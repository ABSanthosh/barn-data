  "text": "WWE Women’s World Heavyweight Champion Liv Morgan stands at the peak of her game on the RAW roster. She made her comeback from injury earlier this year by entering the Women’s Royal Rumble at the 30th spot. Since returning, she has participated in just one major match to seek revenge on Rhea Ripley for her earlier injury. Morgan not only achieved her goal but also stole her on-screen boyfriend, Dominik Mysterio, from Ripley. At WWE SummerSlam, Mysterio betrayed Ripley by assisting Morgan in retaining her Women’s World Heavyweight Championship. He further mocked Ripley by kissing Morgan in front of her. The ongoing storyline involving Liv Morgan, Rhea Ripley, and Dominik Mysterio has become one of the summer’s most captivating narratives in 2024. Last weekend at WWE Bad Blood 2024, Morgan strengthened her position by bringing back her former tag team partner, Raquel Rodriguez, to help her against Ripley. During the match, Rodriguez attacked Ripley, and although Morgan lost, she retained her title due to disqualification. Now, Liv Morgan has introduced another challenge for Rhea Ripley. While Ripley focuses on dealing with Rodriguez, Morgan prepares to face Nia Jax at WWE Crown Jewel for the annual championship. Meanwhile, current WWE Women’s Tag Team Champion Bianca Belair seeks a match against Morgan. Bianca Belair sets her sights on Liv Morgan for a match WWE Women’s Tag Team Champion Bianca Belair and her partner Jade Cargill are currently dominating the women’s tag team division. Recently, Belair reshared an Instagram story from a fan expressing a desire to see a match between her and Liv Morgan. While both stars currently compete on different brands, Bianca Belair’s status as a tag team champion allows her to appear across all brands. It will be interesting to see if Belair faces Liv Morgan following WWE Crown Jewel 2024.",
