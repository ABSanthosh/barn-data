Nearly twenty years after he first brought the DC Comics/Vertigo character to life in Francis Lawrence’s 2005 film “Constantine,” Reeves says there may finally be movement on a potential “Constantine 2.” Though he’s been vocal about wanting a “Constantine” sequel since 2019, Reeves recently revealed he thinks “Constantine 2” is ready for a script: “We’ve been trying to make this film for over a decade, and we just recently put a story together and pitched it to DC Studios and they said, ‘Okay,’” Reeves told Inverse. “So, we’re going to try and write a script.” While Reeves kept quiet on specific plot details, he says his and Lawrence’s idea for a “Constantine” sequel takes place in the same, dreary world as the original. “We’re not going off that,” he confirmed, and joked that fans could expect plenty more angst for the occultist: “John Constantine’s going to be tortured even more.” Popular on Variety On a recent episode of the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Reeves and Francis reunited to discuss Constantine’s 20th anniversary, the film’s legacy and a potential future script: “It’s just fun to be in the same room and talk ‘Constantine,’” Reeves said. “Akiva [Goldsman] is writing, and Keanu and Akiva and I have been collaborating, and I think we have some really, really great ideas that we’re super, super excited about. And I think we’re pretty close on having an object that is really workable,” Francis added. Though the “Constantine” character has remained dormant on the big screen, Matt Ryan has brought the character to life across various live-action and animated television projects including a short-lived “Constantine” NBC series in the character’s theatrical absence.",
