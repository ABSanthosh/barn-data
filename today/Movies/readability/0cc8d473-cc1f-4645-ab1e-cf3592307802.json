  "description": "\"We're making a movie right now!\" Vertical has unveiled a clever official trailer for an indie horror creation called Found Footage: The Making of the Patterson Project, from filmmaker Max Tzannes. A crew of documentarians chronicle an amateur filmmaker's quest to try to make the world's greatest found footage horror film. This is set for release in theaters and on VOD together starting in June this summer. Nothing like a classic bigfoot movie! And don't forget about the brilliant Sasquatch Sunset from last year. Starring Brennan Keel Cook, Dean Cameron, Chen Tang, Erika Vetter, and others. The horror filmmakers Radio Silence are also presenting this new meta \"found footage\" horror film this summer. Tzannes' Found Footage is a mockumentary horror movie about a budding filmmaker's attempt to produce his first feature, a found footage movie about Bigfoot, only to discover he's literally in a very real horror movie. It's nice how this trailer starts out upbeat \u0026 fun before getting all sinister \u0026 scary - this might be a good one. Check it out.

Trailer for Max Tzannes' doc Found Footage: The Making of the Patterson Project, via YouTube: Found Footage is a mockumentary horror movie about a budding filmmaker's attempt to produce his first feature, a found footage movie about Bigfoot. Through the eyes of an esteemed French documentary crew, the story follows his unlikely band of misfits as they struggle to keep the production afloat on a shoestring budget. All the while, mysterious and sinister occurrences begin to unfold behind the scenes, blurring the lines between movie magic and real life. As the shoot days get longer and scarier, the filmmakers quickly learn that they've stepped into a very real \u0026 very terrifying found footage horror film of their own. Found Footage: The Making of the Patterson Project is a mockumentary directed by indie genre filmmaker Max Tzannes, making his second feature after directing Et Tu (2023) previously, plus many other short films. The screenplay is co-written by Max Tzannes and David San Miguel. Editing and Cinematography by Jacob Souza. Produced by Tyler Friesen with Radio Silence (Scream V, Scream VI) presenting. This film hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Vertical will debut Found Footage: The Making of the Patterson Project in select US theaters on June 20th, 2025, and later on VOD starting June 24th.
