This almost looks like The Asylum B-movie bad, surprised they actually got Neeson to agree to come back for this. It does not look like it's going to be worth a watch at all. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jonathan Hensleigh's sequel Ice Road: Vengeance, on YouTube: Big rig ice road driver Mike McCann (Liam Neeson returns from The Ice Road) travels to Nepal to scatter his late brother‚Äôs ashes on Mt. Everest. While on a packed tour bus traversing the deadly 12,000 ft. terrain of the infamous Road to the Sky, McCann and his mountain guide (Fan Bingbing) encounter a group of ruthless mercenaries and must fight to save not only themselves but all of the innocent passengers, as well as a local Nepalese village on the brink of destruction. Ice Road: Vengeance is both written and directed by American writer / filmmaker Jonathan Hensleigh, director of The Punisher, Kill the Irishman, and the first The Ice Road movie, plus music videos. It's produced by Al Corley, Eugene Musso, Lee Nelson, Shivani Rawat, Bart Rosenblatt, David Tish. Vertical will debut Hensleigh's Ice Road: Vengeance sequel in select US theaters on June 27th, 2025, then on VOD starting July 1st this summer. üèî Anyone want to watch this?
