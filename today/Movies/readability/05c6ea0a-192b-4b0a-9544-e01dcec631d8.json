The film presents a gripping retelling of Cheryl Bradshaw's chilling encounter with Rodney Alcala. Kendrick faces the challenge of finding a follow-up project with equal passion and intensity. Filmmakers, once skeptical, now commend Kendrick's successful directorial debut with Woman of the Hour. Anna Kendrick's directorial debut, Woman of the Hour, inspired by the true story of Cheryl Bradshaw and her encounter with serial killer Rodney Alcala on the TV show The Dating Game, has received generally positive reception from audiences for its gripping portrayal of this unique, disturbing story. In fact, it currently holds over a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, so naturally, fans of Kendrick have wondered what the actor-turned-filmmaker might explore with her next project. Now, during an interview with Variety, Kendrick admitted that finding a project she's as passionate about has been daunting. \"I haven't found anything that I'm as passionate about because I think I really hit the jackpot with Woman of the Hour — the script and the actors and everything about it,\" she said. She also shared that it also changed the sentiment of some of her peers, with Kendrick noting, \"It's been really cool. The coolest thing is some of the filmmakers who've reached out to me are people who I auditioned for 15 years ago, and they didn't cast me… It feels very full circle.\" Woman of the Hour.
