What did Bella Thorne say about Mickey Rourke? In a handful of social media posts on Friday, Thorne shared a photo of an article detailing Rourke’s recent insensitive comments made against JoJo Siwa on Celebrity Big Brother UK. Over the image, Thorne wrote a detailed message saying that Rourke was “gross,” and detailed how a scene between them for the 2020 thriller Girl left her extremely uncomfortable. “This f—ing dude. GROSS,” said Thorne in her Instagram Story. “I had to work with this man – In a scene where I’m on my knees with my hands zip-tied around my back. He’s supposed to take a metal grinder to my knee cap and instead he used it on my genitals thru my jeans. Hitting them over and over again. I had bruises on my pelvic bone. Working with Mickey was one of the all-time worst experiences of my life working as an actress.” So.. yeah. Ew. pic.twitter.com/yv8fequR02— BITCHIMBELLATHORNE (@bellathorne) April 11, 2025 Thorne alleges other acts of misconduct, Rourke issues statement In a separate post on X after her initial Instagram Story, Thorne continued to detail misconduct she allegedly faced at the hands of Rourke. This includes a moment in which Thorne said he covered her in dirt to humiliate her, having to beg him to finish scenes, and more. “So many gross stories of things he made me go thru on that movie, including in his last scene to speed up and rev his engine so he could cover me completely in dirt,” Thorne said. “[I don’t know] I guess he thought it was funny to humiliate me in front of the entire crew. Having to go in his trailer absolutely alone because he refused to speak to the director or producers – so I had to convince him to show up and complete his job, as he shouted crazy demands that he wanted from the producers. In fact I had to beg. Alone. In his trailer. Since the movie could not be finished without him. Everyone’s work would’ve just been lost and completely for nothing. I didn’t wanna do it. I was uncomfortable, but I did what I was asked to do and what was best for the movie. Mickey should’ve never put anybody in that movie in any of those positions that he did.” In a statement to Variety, a representative for Rourke denied the allegations, and acknowledged how serious they were. “These allegations are extremely serious. Mr. Rourke adamantly denies any intentional misconduct,” the statement reads. “He was not made aware of any such concerns during filming and had no prior knowledge of Ms. Thorne’s discomfort until now.”",
