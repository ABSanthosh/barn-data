  "description": "Even though we may have moved on from 2024, it's still worthwhile to look back at the many excellent films from last year. Yet another new video countdown has debuted - this one is created by a young film critic named Will Bjarnar. This video featuring his 25 Best Films of 2024 is inspired by David Ehrlich's usual Top 25 Countdown (which will be out next week) and follows the same kind of editing. Bjarnar counts down his favorites from 2024, featuring tons of our own favorites as well. I'm so glad to see Furiosa, Hit Man, Bird, The Room Next Door, Close Your Eyes, and Challengers showing up on best of the year lists. These are some of the best of last year along with all the usual: Nickel Boys, Anora, The Brutalist, No Other Land, and Dune: Part Two. We've also featured a few other great 2024 video countdowns: Clementine's 2024 in Film, Patrick \u0026 Kyle's 25 Best Films of 2024, Little White Lies' 30 Best Films of 2024 Video Recap. Cinema rocks. Thanks to Twitter for the tip on this video countdown. Posted on Vimeo. This video countdown is created and edited by the young film critic […]",

This video countdown is created and edited by the young film critic Will Bjarnar based in New York City - you can follow him on Twitter @bywillbjarnar and on Bluesky @willbjarnar.bsky.social. He also writes for InSession Film where this list is published as his Top 10. He explains there: \"I guess what I’m saying is this: More than any other kind of film that I saw in 2024, I saw a great number of movies that felt human – performed by them, made by them, lived by them.\" He adds this comment about making this inspired by David Ehrlich's annual video: \"I'm the proudest of this year's iteration, which I pray is different enough from the others you might have come across, and perhaps will add a few films to your watchlist. It’s long, but it takes longer to put together than it does to watch.\" For more of his thoughts \u0026 comments on his favorites of 2024, click over to InSession Film.
