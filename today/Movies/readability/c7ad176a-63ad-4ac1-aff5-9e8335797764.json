How fast will SAW 11 come out now?Article Summary SAW franchise is now co-owned by Lionsgate and Blumhouse, aiming for bold new sequels in theaters. James Wan returns to creative control alongside Leigh Whannell, promising a fresh vision for SAW. SAW’s legacy continues as a billion-dollar horror series, with eleven films and massive global impact. Blumhouse sees SAW as a major win amid box office struggles, adding to their growing horror slate. SAW is now officially co-owned by Lionsgate and Blumhouse, and the two will work together to bring future installments to every platform imaginable, most importantly, theaters. June 4, we told you that Blumhouse was purchasing the 50% stake in the franchise owned by Twisted Pictures, with Lionsgate retaining the other 50%. Series creator James Wan is now back in control, as his label Atomic Monster and Blumhouse merged a few years ago. After directing that original film, he stayed on as an executive producer. No movement has been made yet on a new franchise installment after the sequel to the wildly successful and fan-loved SAW X fell apart in development. SAW Will Return ASAP \"Saw holds a special place in my heart—it's where Leigh and I began our Hollywood journey. Returning to this world with a fresh perspective is both thrilling and deeply personal. For me, this will mark a significant creative return to the Saw franchise for the first time since the early days, and I'm very much looking forward to embracing the original spirit whilst pushing the legacy forward in bold, unexpected ways,\" said James Wan, CEO and founder, Atomic Monster. \"The Saw franchise has defined a generation of horror, and its cultural impact continues to grow, making this a strategic investment in one of the most recognizable and successful genre properties of the last two decades. But what really excites me about bringing Saw to Blumhouse is having James and Leigh back in the fold and to see the future of the franchise come to life with their guidance,\" said Blumhouse CEO and founder Jason Blum. See? They seem excited, everyone! Adam Fogelson, Chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, also seems excited: \"Over the course of ten chilling and thrilling Saw films, Oren and Mark have been outstanding partners, producers, and stewards of this billion-dollar franchise which has played a massive role in Lionsgate history. As they pass the baton to James – whose direction started it all – and to Jason and the team at Blumhouse, Billy couldn't be in more gifted or twisted hands. Game on.\" Billy the Puppet from the SAW franchise. Credit Lionsgate The SAW franchise is one of the most successful in the history of horror, having eleven films under its belt that have combined to gross over $1 billion at the box office and with retail sales. Let that sink in for a minute. Even after the lukewarm reception of Spiral, the spin-off starring Chris Rock,  the return of the franchise proper to theaters was inevitable when SAW X came out in 2023. They cost nothing to make and make big money, even if you are talking about the later sequels. The franchise has never gone away if you count Jigsaw and Spiral. This is also a big win for Blumhouse, when they badly needed one. This cash cow franchise is their bread and butter, and a sure thing. They are having a pretty epic cold streak at the box office, which should end soon with Black Phone 2, M3gan 2.0, and Five Nights At Freddy's 2 all coming this year. Adding SAW to that list is a huge get. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media! Stay up-to-date and support the site by following Bleeding Cool on Google News today!
