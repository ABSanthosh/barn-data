Bleecker Street has revealed an official trailer for the indie sci-fi romance creation titled Love Me.

Here is my full review if you're curious to know why I dig it as a story about how social media isn't really that good for our identities. Enjoy. Here's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Sam \u0026 Andy Zuchero's film Love Me, direct from YouTube: Via Sundance: \"Long after humanityâ€™s extinction, a buoy and a satellite meet online and fall in love. As filmmakers Sam \u0026 Andy demonstrate in their wildly imaginative debut feature, telling the love story of a smart buoy and an orbiting satellite that spans a billion years and probes the mysteries of being and consciousness requires legit storytelling dexterity. Love Meâ€™s whimsically philosophical, shape-shifting structure ingeniously weaves together the real, the virtual, and the surreal. Its star-crossed, web-paired metallic protagonists â€” inhabited in different forms by Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun â€” awkwardly navigate romance and companionship, equipped only with untold petabytes of archived web data, social media, and online videos.\" Love Me is co-written \u0026 co-directed by filmmaking husband-wife duo Andrew \"Andy\" Zuchero \u0026 Sam Zuchero, directing their first feature film together after a few short films and other projects previously. It's produced by Kevin Rowe, Luca Borghese, Ben Howe, Shivani Rawat, \u0026 Julie Goldstein. This first premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival last year (our review). Bleecker Street debuts Love Me in select US theaters starting January 31st, 2025 coming soon. Look any good? Who's in? Find more posts in: Indies, Sci-Fi, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
