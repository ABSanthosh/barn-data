This is something we should be celebrating and appreciating – diversity is vitally important and invigorating and meaningful. Alas, there are still people who do not understand that humanity as evolved beyond the simple concept of relationships being between a man \u0026 woman. As a lover of cinema, I'm so grateful this art form can tell stories that stir the soul, and show us how beautiful the world really is when we respect and admire and appreciate other relationships. Love Letters is the latest film written \u0026 directed by French filmmaker Alice Douard – premiering in the Critics Week sidebar at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It's undoubtedly one of the best films of the festival, one of my favorites and a film that I believe will connect with audiences all over the world after its initial unveiling in France. Love Letters is a lively, upbeat, emotionally honest, delightful, touching story about a lesbian couple expecting their first baby. \"Céline, 32, is expecting her first child. But Céline is not pregnant... In 3 months, it is Nadia, her wife, who will give birth to their daughter.\" The film's original title in French is Des preuves d'amour, which translates directly to Proof of Love instead of Love Letters. I prefer this original title more because directly connects with the central concept of the film – involving collecting letters that talk about how these two love each other and will make fantastic parents. Love Letters is set in France just after the country passed their own historic law allowing same-sex marriage (in May 2013). The couple at the center of the film is Céline, played by talented Swiss-French actress Ella Rumpf, and Nadia, played by Quebecois actress Monia Chokri. Both are of them are exquisite in this film, though the camera focuses especially on Céline and her emotions \u0026 experiences. Due to legal complications in France, despite their marriage being legally binding, in order for Céline to legally by considered the other mother of their baby she must \"adopt\" the child as soon as it is born. Her lawyer tells her that she needs to prepare many letters from friends \u0026 family confirming their love and commenting on their potential to raise a family. The brisk 97 minute film follows her as she attempts to convince more than just her other lesbian friends to write something – mainly confronting her famous pianist mother \u0026 dealing with other prejudice. French actress Noémie Lvovsky also stars in this film as Marguerite, playing Céline's multi-cultural mom. She is a world famous pianist and Céline doesn't have a good relationship with her because she has spent most of her time traveling the world playing on tours instead of raising her daughter. As soon as Marguerite is introduced in the film, it becomes something even more special \u0026 unique – Lvovsky begins playing the piano as a form of emotional expression. There are a number of scenes involving Céline \u0026 Marguerite which feature a full-on piano performance as the two interact, talking about life and the baby and romance and the struggles of being a lesbian couple. In addition to these extraordinary musical interludes, which left me vibrating in complete awe, the film features an astonishing soundtrack of songs. Artists include Disclosure, Balthazar, Laurent Dury, and Icare Sandilas. I even wrote down the name of most of the tracks in the film because I enjoyed them so much. They fit perfectly into the film and offer an additional emotional layer of meaning in lieu of a full-on score. The music also keeps the film upbeat and engaging, allowing it to be an exciting feature that feels as artistic as it is meaningful telling this important story about this lesbian family. This dynamic between Céline and her mother is important in this film because it also allows the character to reflect upon another aspect of having a baby – the overwhelming fear of whether you'll be a good parent. On top of all the difficulties of being a new lesbian family in France, Céline also seems to have this worry that she won't be a good mother because her own mother wasn't a good mother. It still seems to bother her even though she never says it out loud. But through these moments where they try to reconnect, where she talks about the baby and admits her frustrations, the two begin to see each other in ways they never understood before. It's really beautiful to watch, I was deeply moved by this aspect of the storytelling. The film offers this dual narrative examining the life of LGBTQ couples as well as the life of young parents expecting their first baby. It isn't easy and they do have some fights at times, but their love still keeps them together, and it will remain strong once they are raising their new daughter together. I adore that this film so carefully, so wonderfully, puts all of this up on screen for us to experience \u0026 appreciate. We should be celebrating them and celebrating this film. And I'll be talking about it as one of my favorite discoveries this year from Cannes.
