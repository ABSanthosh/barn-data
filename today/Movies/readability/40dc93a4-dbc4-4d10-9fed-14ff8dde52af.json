  "text": "Cineverse has shared the first Silent Night, Deadly Night teaser trailer for its upcoming reimagining of 1984’s cult classic horror movie. The movie will be led by The Hardy Boys star Rohan Campbell as Billy Chapman, who is best known as the original movie’s killer, previously portrayed by Robert Wilson. Campbell is no stranger to the horror genre, after starring in 2022’s slasher movie Halloween Ends, and this year’s dark comedy horror The Monkey. Check out the Silent Night, Deadly Night teaser trailer below (watch more trailers): What is Silent Night, Deadly Night about? “In the remake, when Billy witnesses his parents’ grisly murder on Christmas Eve at the hands of Santa, it ignites a lifelong mission to spread holiday fear,” reads the official synopsis. “Every Christmas, he dons the jolly red suit and delivers a blood-soaked massacre to feed his twisted sense of justice. This Christmas Eve, Billy wants to know: ‘Have you been naughty?'” Silent Night, Deadly Night is written and directed by Mike P. Nelson. The cast also includes Ruby Modine as Pamela Varo, Mark Acheson, David Lawrence Brown, David Tomlinson as Max Benedict, Erik Athavale as Geoff, Rick Skene as Elroy, Sharon Bajer as Delphine, and more. It is executive produced by Steven Schneider, Anthony Masi, Sarah Eilts, Brandon Hill, Brad Miska, Erick Opeka, Yolanda Macias, Matthew Helderman, and Luke Taylor. Producers are Scott Schneid, Dennis Whitehead, Jamie R. Thompson, Erik Bernard, and Jeremy Torrie. The remake is currently slated to arrive in theaters on December 12, 2025.",
