  "text": "Economist and former Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney has been elected to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal Party leader and Canada’s prime minister. The election comes at a critical time in foreign relations between Canada and the United States, as both nations impose historic tariffs and prepare for an impending trade war. Carney won 85.9% of the Liberal Party votes. Over 150,000 voted in the election, according to the New York Times. “America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney said Sunday in his acceptance speech in reference to President Donald Trump‘s claims that he will make Canada the 51st U.S. state. “We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.” Carney continued, “So Americans should make no mistake. In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.” Popular on Variety His inauguration is anticipated to take place as soon as this week. Carney is expected to call federal elections shortly after he takes office since he doesn’t currently hold a seat in Parliament. Outside of turbulent foreign relations, the election comes at a critical time in Hollywood as the entertainment industry faces unprecedented uncertainty due to AI and plummeting profits. Trudeau was very popular among Hollywood liberals, who will no doubt be watching if he pursues media a la Barack and Michelle Obama. Carney spent 13 years as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs in 1990s and 2000s, so he’s most likely familiar with the media and entertainment business.",
