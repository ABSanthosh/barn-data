  "description": "\"Someone has to get her out.\" An official trailer has debuted for an indie thriller called Dead Before They Wake, made by indie actor / filmmaker Nathan Shepka as is latest creation. Yet another story involving the entirely fictional and yet apparently super scary \"sex trafficking network\" that many films are using as a villain these days. Conspiracy theory BS but whatever. Nightclub bouncer Alex is tasked with tracking down a young girl suspected of being snared by a sex trafficking network weeks ago. As he delves deeper into the dark depravity within the city's seedy underbelly, he begins to question his own morals and comes to believe that the safe return of the girl will lead to his ultimate redemption. Starring Nathan Shepka (of Lock \u0026 Load), Grace Cordell, Manjot Sumal, Kareem Nasif, along with Dr Who legend Sylvester McCoy and Patrick Bergin. Not really sure this film will save any lives despite its noble intentions... Really wish they'd stop wasting time and money on these stories - they're just feeding the paranoia not helping anything.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Crane \u0026 Shepka's horror Dead Before They Wake, via YouTube: Alex dwells in a caravan by day and mans the door of a city club by night. One evening he is approached by the mysterious Evan, a retired lawyer who offers him £20,000 on behalf of a government official to track down a missing girl named Bianca. Alex's search takes him into the underbelly of Glasgow where he comes across the suspicious Amar and Ghadir who appear to be running a shady criminal operation far beyond the confines of their commercial property. Will he manage to find the girl and get her back safely, leading to his ultimate retribution? Can he take down a ruthless trafficking ring or has he endangered the lives of himself and those around him beyond positive outcome? Dead Before They Wake is co-directed by filmmakers Andy Crane (a cinematographer making his feature directorial debut) and Nathan Shepka (actor / director of the other films Holiday Monday, When Darkness Falls, Lock \u0026 Load previously). It's also produced and written by Nathan Shepka. Shepka's Dead Before They Wake film will debut direct-to-VOD in the US starting January 7th, 2025 early next year and later in January in the UK.
