  "description": "\"That bro must be the villain.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official US trailer for Hi-Five, a Korean action comedy about people who get superpowers after receiving organ transplants. It just opened in Korea last week, and will also arrive in US theaters in a few more weeks. After receiving mysterious organ transplants, five strangers awaken with five extraordinary abilities. Banding together, they become an unlikely superhero team that will be known as the \"Hi-Five.\" These five suddenly develop various superpower abilities after receiving transplants from a man with psychic superpower. They must defend themselves from a different group of people who seek to steal their powers. The cast features Lee Jae-in, who gets a heart transplant and becomes very strong; Ahn Jae-hong, who receives a lung transplant and is able to hold his breath for a long time; Kim Hee-won, who receives a liver transplant and becomes a healer; Yoo Ah-in, who receives a corneal transplant and can interact with electromagnetic waves. Along with Ra Mi-ran, Yoo Ah-in, Oh Jung-se, and Park Jin-young. The looks super cheesy and extra goofy, hopefully still fun enough to enjoy. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Kang Hyoung-chul's movie Hi-Five, direct […]",

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Kang Hyoung-chul's movie Hi-Five, direct from YouTube: In the dead of night, a body donated for organ transplants mysteriously disintegrates into ashes. Soon after, five recipients – given a heart, corneas, lungs, liver, and kidneys – all begin to develop supernatural powers. A teenage girl gains immense strength, a hipster manipulates electromagnetic waves, a novelist summons powerful gusts, a factory manager can heal others, and a woman is docvering a strange, still-unidentified ability. Together, they form a reluctant but heroic team known as \"HI-FIVE.\" But they aren't the only ones transformed. A cult leader who received the donor’s pancreas gains the terrifying power to drain life energy and sets his sights on stealing the abilities of Hi-Five to achieve godlike domination. Hi-Five, also known as 하이파이브 or Haipaibeu in Korean, is written and directed by Korean filmmaker Kang Hyoung-chul (or Kang Hyeong-cheol), director of the films Scandal Makers, Sunny, Tazza: The Hidden Card, and Swing Kids previously. It's produced by An Hee-jin and Anna Lee. The film just opened in Korea. Well Go will debut Hi-Five in US theaters starting on June 20th, 2025 coming soon. Want to watch this?
