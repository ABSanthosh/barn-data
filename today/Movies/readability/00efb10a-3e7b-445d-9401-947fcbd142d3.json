  "text": "Streaming might be the future, but physical media is still the present. It’s also awesome, depending on the title, the label, and the release, so each week we take a look at the new Blu-rays and DVDs making their way into the world. Welcome to this week in Home Video for October 1st, 2024! This week’s home video selection includes a new collection of Paramount Scares, Richard Matheson’s Burn Witch Burn, and more. Check out our picks below. Paramount Scares Collection Volume 2 [4K UHD] What is it? A new collection of 4K UHD horrors from Paramount. Why see it? Paramount remains one of the big Hollywood studios delivering blockbuster fare and managing their own streaming service, but thankfully, they’re also big proponents of physical media. For the second year in a row, they’ve released a Paramount Scares collection of horror films on 4K UHD, and three of the titles are making their premier on the format. The absolute highlight is Breakdown which remains a stellar road-trip thriller using practical effects and killer performances from Kurt Russell, J.T. Walsh, and others. It’s just a terrific ride that jumps quickly into gear and doesn’t let up until the final beat. Friday the 13th Part 2, arguably one of the top three entries in the franchise, makes its 4K debut too, and both the dark shadows and bloody kills have never looked better. Orphan: First Kill is feels a bit too recent for this honor, much like Smile in the first volume, but you’ll get no complaints from me as it remains a highly entertaining time. It surpasses the first film in my eyes thanks to a wild third act that doesn’t rely on a single reveal. Finally, while this isn’t the debut of World War Z in 4K, it’s still a great slice of action/horror that deserves more love. I never finished the book so I can’t compare, but it’s a fun, thrilling movie all the same. The surprisingly reasonably priced set also includes various ephemera for collectors, and here’s hoping Paramount keeps the Paramount Scares line coming for years to come as their back catalog remains filled with spooky goodies. [Extras: Interviews, commentary, featurettes, poster, Fangoria magazine, iron-on patches, pins, sticker] The Best Burn, Witch, Burn [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A professor discovers his wife is, gulp, a witch! Why see it? Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont are two of the big names in genre fiction and film/TV back in the 50s and 60s, and this feature is a rare combination of their writing talents. A popular college professor discovers two things in succession — his colleagues are jealous of his success, and his wife is a witch. She claims her spells are what’s protecting and promoting him, but is she telling the truth? Drama, suspense, deception, and horror combine for a slick little shocker written by Matheson and Beaumont. The new 4K scan brings sharp detail and shadow to this classic, and it’s a great pickup for the Halloween season. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentaries, interview] The West Wing: The Complete Series What is it? A masterful American series in one blue box. Why see it? The West Wing gets referenced and memed a lot these days, often while pointing out its similarities to our real-life political situations. (Not as often as Veep, though.) Happily, it’s also one of the finest American series out there, bumps and all. Aaron Sorkin was the driving force through the show’s first four seasons, and his rapid-fire dialogue and sharp conversations keep things moving and engaging even when it’s just a dialogue scene. Martin Sheen’s portrayal of the American president is an all-timer, a character rich in detail and morality, and a master orator whose words transfixed audiences week in week out. Supporting characters bring additional wit, energy, and depth making this a fascinating look at a political landscape that resembles are own but feels in far better hands. This is the series’ debut on Blu-ray, and while the upgrade isn’t as big as some fans might hope — it looks to be the same master used for the 2010 DVD release, and there are no new extras — a bolder color palette and lossless audio bump it up enough to recommend a pickup for fans who don’t own a physical copy yet. [Extras: Commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, gag reels, interviews] The Rest Body and Soul [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A boxer learns a valuable lesson about winning and losing. Why see it? Anti-capitalism films are their own little niche, but this one carries the extra weight of (many in) its cast and crew landing before the McCarthy Hearings on suspicion of being communists before being blacklisted. But don’t worry, director Robert Rossen named dozens of commies and quickly got back to work. That’s all side story, though, as the film itself is a solid tale of a boxer’s ride from nowhere to the top of the heap, all while being taken advantage of as part of a greed-oriented society. The moral lesson is clear, and while it’s strong enough on its own, it’s heightened that much more by the behind the scenes drama. [Extras: Newish 4K scan, commentary] First Love [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A story about falling in love at college. Why see it? This is an odd one. Its merits are undeniably as a female-directed drama with a strong cast (William Katt, John Heard, Susan Dey, Beverly D’Angelo, and more) tell a serious-minded story about falling in love. Maybe it’s just the cynical eyes of someone in 2024, but watching it now, it’s clear that serious approach lends itself to some unintended laughs. The result is a film that wobbles some in tone as it explores some sensitive topics and relationships even if it remains compelling enough to stay with it through to the hump-related ending. (It makes sense when you watch it.) [Extras: Newish 4K scan, commentary] Also out this week: The Blob [4K UHD], Imaginary [4K UHD], Sebastian",
