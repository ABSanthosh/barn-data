  "text": "Indonesian film production company Imajinari is expanding its footprint with an ambitious slate of upcoming projects following the breakout success of its comedy hit “Agak Laen,” which accumulated 9.1 million cinema viewers to become the bestselling Indonesian comedy of all time. Founded in 2021 by Ernest Prakasa and Dipa Andika, Imajinari has set “Tinggal Meninggal,” a dark comedy in post-production slated for an Aug. 7 release. The film, directed by Kristo Immanuel, will be followed by “Agak Laen 2,” the sequel to their record-breaking comedy, set for Nov. 5, with Muhadkly Acho returning as writer and director. “Our philosophy is we want to make original stories, and we want to make sure everything is ready,” Andika told Variety at Hong Kong FilMart. “We don’t want to push it if it’s not ready.” The company is also developing “Operasi Pesta Pora” in partnership with Angin Segar Films for a 2026 release, with Edy Khemod directing and Rino Sardjono writing. Popular on Variety Imajinari’s commitment to original storytelling in a market dominated by sequels, remakes and horror films has paid dividends with critical acclaim. Their 2023 black-and-white romantic comedy “Jatuh Cinta Seperti Di Film-Film” (international title: “Falling in Love Like in Movies”) made Indonesian film history at the country’s Piala Citra awards, winning seven categories, including best movie, and sweeping all four acting awards. “We try to offer something different to the audience,” said Prakasa, who serves as chief creative officer. “The number one most important thing is it has to be very unique. It has to have a very authentic touch from the creator.” The company is also expanding its horizons by investing in external projects aligned with their values, including “Sore” from Cerita Films, directed by Yandy Laurens; Miles Films’ musical “Rangga \u0026 Cinta,” helmed by veteran director Riri Riza; and “Four Seasons in Java,” a drama directed by Kamila Andini for Forka Films. Prakasa is currently directing a Netflix original titled “Lost in the Spotlight,” about an actor who loses his acting abilities after being blinded by stardom and fame. The comedy, which wrapped shooting in November, is expected to debut on the streaming platform in the fourth quarter of 2025. Since its founding, Imajinari has built a reputation for quality filmmaking while prioritizing humane working conditions for crews. “We want to make sure that at least the crews working for us are working in a very comfortable, suitable, humane condition, because it’s a huge issue in our country, working hours,” Prakasa explained. The company’s first film, “Ngeri-Ngeri Sedap” (international title: “Missing Home”), directed by Bene Dion Rajagukguk, was Indonesia‘s official selection for the Oscars in 2023. Imajinari’s strategy going forward includes exploring international markets through regional distribution in Southeast Asia and potentially pursuing remake rights for their original stories. Andika and Prakasa identified piracy and human resources as the biggest challenges facing Indonesian cinema, noting that the industry’s growth has outpaced the development of new talent. “We need more regeneration for the artists in the industry,” Prakasa said.",
