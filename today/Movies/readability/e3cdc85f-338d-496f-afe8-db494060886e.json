  "text": "Aura Prods. has revealed a strategic partnership with Vidu, the AI-driven content creation platform from ShengShu Technology, to produce an original anime series using advanced artificial intelligence animation technology. The announcement, made during Hong Kong FilMart, details plans for a 50-episode short-form anime series slated for release across major social media platforms in 2025. The project aims to redefine digital entertainment by fusing AI capabilities with traditional narrative techniques. Tenten Wei is the head producer for the show. “Aura’s artwork piqued my interest since it has an American storytelling style while having a Japanese art style. Typically, art styles used in American comics and animations lack the striking style present in Japanese manga and anime, making them less memorable and less interesting to the newer generations,” said Luo Yan, producer at Aura Prods. The partnership leverages Vidu’s sophisticated AI animation generation platform to create content at scale. Popular on Variety “AI is no longer just a tool; it’s a creative enhancement that allows us to scale production while maintaining artistic integrity,” said D.T. Carpenter, showrunner at Aura Prods. “This partnership enables us to pioneer a new era of animation, where technology and storytelling merge to create a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience.” Aura Prods., co-founded by Chinese media mogul and actor Luo alongside creative director Carpenter, brings together industry influence and cutting-edge storytelling expertise. The studio specializes in youth-focused anime that blends Asian aesthetic elements with Hollywood narrative techniques. Carpenter is scheduled to speak at Hong Kong FilMart’s AI-in-Entertainment Panel, discussing artificial intelligence’s evolving role in content creation. Founded in March 2023, ShengShu Technology has quickly established itself in the AI space with its multimodal large-language models. Its flagship Vidu platform has reached users in more than 200 countries across interactive entertainment, advertising, film, animation and cultural tourism sectors.",
