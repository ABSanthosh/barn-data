  "text": "We will update this article throughout the season, along with all our predictions, so make sure to keep checking IndieWire for the latest news from the 2025 Emmys race. The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. The State of the Race While plenty of Emmy categories have shuffled through different shows and different actors year-to-year, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series has remained very consistent. In fact, not only is it the rare category where all of last year’s nominees are still eligible, it has multiple actors in the race that have been nominated for the same performance before. Yet the current belief is that even they will have trouble contending with the stars of some newer shows. Going into April, awards prognosticators have been predicting that the Apple TV+ series “Shrinking” has gained momentum, with its recent second season not so much having to be in the shadow of “Ted Lasso” (the two shows share much of the same creative team). In addition to Harrison Ford, the Season 1 star most on the bubble the last go round, series regular Michael Urie and series co-creator Brett Goldstein, who appears in a pivotal Season 2 role, are expected to make a splash with voters. But in terms of newer series that come with multiple Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series contenders, the show to watch out for is Netflix’s “The Four Seasons,” which will begin streaming on May 1. Not only does it star Emmy winner and two-time Oscar nominee Colman Domingo expanding upon his repertoire, it features comedy veteran Will Forte, who has been nominated for Primetime Emmys several times, but has yet to win. Indie darling Marco Calvani is a scene stealer as well, in a role that serves as his biggest introduction yet to American audiences. In terms of more established ensembles, there is still the expectation that certain standouts from recent Outstanding Comedy Series winners like “The Bear” star Ebon Moss-Bacharach (the most recent winner in this category) and “Hacks” star Paul W. Downs will be nominated once again, but there seems to be less room for their respective co-stars Lionel Boyce and Carl Clemons-Hopkins, who have both been nominated for Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series before. At least one of the “Saturday Night Live” actors tends to make the cut every other year, with Bowen Yang being the most recent example, but this season in particular, which had the show’s 50th anniversary special, has been one with an even bigger audience. Voters could support breakout Marcello Hernández, of “Domingo” fame, or recognize Kenan Thompson again for all his years of service on the NBC late night show. Again, all the actors who were nominated in this category last year are back in contention, so it is fair to assume that if there is one nominee each from perennially nominated shows like “Abbott Elementary” and “Only Murders in the Building,” it will once again be Tyler James Williams and Paul Rudd, (though recognition for their respective co-stars Chris Perfetti and Michael Cyril Creighton would also be deserved). And some of the new faces entering the race that are worth noting, given how their shows are strong contenders across all the comedy categories, are “The Studio” star Ike Barinholtz, “Nobody Wants This” star Timothy Simons, and “Étoile” writer/performer Gideon Glick, who all have bigger roles in their new projects after appearing in other Emmy-winning shows. Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):Ike Barinholtz, “The Studio” (Apple TV+)Marco Calvani, “The Four Seasons” (Netflix)Colman Domingo, “The Four Seasons” (Netflix)Paul W. Downs, “Hacks” (Max)Harrison Ford, “Shrinking” (Apple TV+)Zach Galifianakis, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)Gideon Glick, “Étoile” (Prime Video)Brett Goldstein, “Shrinking” (Apple TV+)Marcello Hernández, “Saturday Night Live” (NBC)Ebon Moss-Bacharach, “The Bear” (Hulu)Chris Perfetti, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)Paul Rudd, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)Timothy Simons, “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix)Michael Urie, “Shrinking” (Apple TV+)Tyler James Williams, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)Bowen Yang, “Saturday Night Live” (NBC) More Comedy Category Predictions:Outstanding Comedy SeriesOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy SeriesOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy SeriesOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series View IndieWire’s full set of predictions for the 77th Emmy Awards.Last Year’s Winner: Ebon Moss-Bacharach, “The Bear”Still Eligible: Yes.Hot Streak: If “The Bear” star Ebon Moss-Bacharach were to win for his performance in Season 3, it would give him a streak that would put him in the rankings for most consecutive wins next to “Night Court” star John Larroquette and “The Andy Griffith Show” star Don Knotts.Notable Ineligible Series: JB Smoove, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” (ended); Josh Lucas and Ricky Martin, “Palm Royale” (Season 2 is not eligible)",
