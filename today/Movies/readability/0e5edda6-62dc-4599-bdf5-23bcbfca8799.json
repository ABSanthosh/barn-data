Unicycle or no unicycle, Ash and Gordon are trying it again. “Colin from Accounts” has been renewed for Season 3 — just in time for American tax season! New episodes will stream exclusively on Paramount+ in the U.S. No air date was announced. “We’re very excited to bring you Season 3 of our show,” said stars, creators, and real-life husband/wife duo Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer in a statement. “To be honest, with the way we ended Season 2 it would have been weird not to make a third, so here we are. We promise we won’t leave you hanging like that again. Probably.”  The dark Australian rom-com — about a promiscuous medical student, a slacker brewery owner, and the stray dog they accidentally paralyzed together — broke out as a surprise hit with serious awards buzz last year. A delicate blend of true love and typical dating terror, the series’ centerpiece romance has made Ashley Molden and Gordon Crapp two of the most beloved and complex characters in streaming. Popular on IndieWire Also nominated for Best International Series at the BAFTA TV Awards, “Colin from Accounts” won two Gotham Awards and three Australian Logie Awards. Season 2 was critically acclaimed, leaving audiences devastated in the wake of a failed proposal. After Gordon asks Ash to marry him (during her best friend’s wedding reception no less), what could have been a tender exchange of a first “I love you” collapses into a public display of cataclysmic awkwardness that couldn’t be more cringe-worthy if it tried. The ending was almost even more dire, said Brammall and Dyer in an interview with IndieWire from last October. “It was just Gordon and Ashley in the wide after he proposed,” Brammall explained. “So after [Gordon] puts the music back on — and it was still ‘Slice of Heaven’ — it’s a wide frame. They’re like on an island and you’re like, ‘Oh, they’re fucking dead.’ And they’re trying to dance and it’s not working. And then people just float in front of them and people are dancing. And then it’s over.” That spectacularly bleak finale ended up getting tweaked when Dyer was reminded that “Colin from Accounts” had become a comfort show for many people. She said then, “I thought, ‘Oh, the [cut] that we sent out half an hour ago is not comfort food. No.’ And so I literally texted Paddy and I was like, ‘We need to find as much hope as we can.’” Fingers crossed Ash and Gordon keep hope alive in Season 3? Emma Harvie, Genevieve Hegney, Michael Logo, Helen Thomson, Darren Gilshenan, Annie Maynard, Tai Hara, Glenn Hazeldine, Celeste Barber, Virginia Gay, Justin Rosniak, John Howard, Lynne Porteus, and Broden Kelly also starred in Season 2.
