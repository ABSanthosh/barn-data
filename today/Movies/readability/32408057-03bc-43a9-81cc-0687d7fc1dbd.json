While reminiscing about her starring role as Olivia Pope on Scandal, the 2x Golden Globe nominee revealed that she made a call to the White House after landing the part in Shonda Rhimes‘ ABC drama. “I had to call Valerie Jarrett, who worked for the Obamas, and say, ‘I just want you to know that I’ve been cast in this show. Lil awkward, because on the show I’m sleeping with the president,'” she recalled on The View. “But like, you know, it’s gonna be fine, right? Watch on Deadline “I wanted to give them a chance to distance themselves if they needed to. But they were like, ‘It’s fine. It’s TV.’ Again, for art, everything’s okay!” added Washington. Washington starred as crisis management expert Olivia Pope on the Shondaland series for its seven-season run on ABC from 2012 to 2018. Tony Goldwyn played her client and love interest, President Fitzgerald Grant III. The show was partially inspired by former President George H.W. Bush’s administration press aide Judy Smith, who served on the series as a co-executive producer.
