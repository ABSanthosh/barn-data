Reminders Of Him by Colleen Hoover. Cover credit Montlake Publishing Colleen Hoover Takes Over Hollywood Here is the plot of the Colleen Hoover book: After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four-year-old daughter. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter's life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself. The only person who hasn't closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna's daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna's life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them. The two form a connection despite the pressure surrounding them, but as their romance grows, so does the risk. Kenna must find a way to absolve the mistakes of her past in order to build a future out of hope and healing. Get ready for a ton of Colleen Hoover, everyone. It feels like Hollywood falls in love with an author every few years, and Hoover is the latest. She has a very large online reader base, which translated into box office dollars this year, and studios took notice. More on this one will be revealed later. Enjoyed this?
