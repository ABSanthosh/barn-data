  "text": "Mike Tyson shed more light on the medical issues that originally delayed his fight against Jake Paul. In a post on his official X account, Tyson wrote, “I almost died in June. Had 8 blood transfusions. Lost half my blood and 25lbs in hospital and had to fight to get healthy to fight so I won.” The fight between Tyson and Paul was originally scheduled for July 20, but it was delayed until November after Tyson suffered what was reported to be an ulcer flare up in late May. Tyson also said that he was “grateful” and had “no regrets to get in the ring one last time.” Popular on Variety “To have my children see me stand toe to toe and finish 8 rounds with a talented fighter half my age in front of a packed Dallas Cowboy stadium is an experience that no man has the right to ask for. Thank you.” After eight rounds, Paul, 27, claimed victory over former world heavyweight champion Tyson, 58, in a unanimous decision. Aside from Paul vs. Tyson, the main card also featured a highly-praised rematch between undisputed super lightweight champion Katie Taylor and unified featherweight champion Amanda “The Real Deal” Serrano, which saw Taylor once again defeat Serrano by a controversial unanimous decision. Taylor previously won the initial bout between the two via a split decision. Other fights included one between Mario Barrios and Abel Ramos for the WBC welterweight world title that ended in a split draw, and Neeraj Goyat defeating Whindersson Nunes via unanimous decision.",
