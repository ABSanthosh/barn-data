  "text": "There have been some incredible documentaries over the years chronicling how films were made, such as Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse. However, the ones that stand the test of time tend to be about groundbreaking pieces of art and legendary movies. That’s why American Movie was so interesting, as it focused on an unknown, yet very eccentric, indie filmmaker named Mark Borchardt and his quest to finish a short film called Coven. Now 25 years since it originally came out, the American Movie 4K release gives people a new reason to revisit Borchardt’s equally inspirational, hilarious, and sad journey. “The hit of the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, American Movie is the hilarious and intense story of one man’s obsession to make movies. Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a long way from Hollywood, but Mark Borchardt has a dream. Armed with a driving ambition and nothing to lose, the fast-talking Borchardt enlists friends, local thespians, and unwilling family members to help him finish his no-budget horror film, Coven. The camera doesn’t flinch as it captures every emotional crisis and financial pitfall in his two-year odyssey. What emerges is a bizarre yet surprisingly heartfelt documentary portrait of a true American character. Welcome to the ‘Real World,'” says the synopsis. Directed by Chris Smith, who has had a huge resurgence in recent years with “Sr.”, Mr. McMahon, and Tiger King, the film opens with Borchardt saying he was a failure and talking about his depression, which he tries to channel into his work. However, there’s a hopefulness and Borchardt’s passion shines through by the end, showing his drive. “I cannot fail. I won’t fail. It’s not in me. You don’t get second chances and mess ’em up. You’d be a fool to.” The passing of time makes the American Movie 4K releases all the more interesting, as 25 years later, we know that Borchardt’s filmmaking aspirations are largely unfulfilled, but it’s hard to classify as a failure since his dream lives on to inspire others thanks to his attempts that were chronicled. Like any good documentary, the subjects are why the film succeeds. Borchardt is an incredible character, mispronouncing the name of his own short film and trying his hardest to get Coven made despite being in debt. Borchardt is joined by Mike Schank, his incredibly charming and good-hearted friend, who chimes in with some great deadpan humor. Their valiant attempts at creating art are paired with looks at personal issues, as both friends have struggled with alcoholism. It all comes together to create a real, non-glamorized look at an attempt to realize a dream. It’s one that leaves the viewer wanting to create and add to the world, even if they wind up falling short. The American Movie 4K has some great bonus features. There’s a wildly entertaining commentary track that features both Borchardt and Schank, along with the director and producer Sarah Price, and 36 minutes of deleted scenes that are worth checking out. However, the crown jewel of the special features is that the full Coven short film is included. More than just a curiosity, the horror film is worth watching, especially after seeing what went into its production. It’s strange, experimental, and filled with poor acting, but it’s wonderfully human and personal. That’s what films should be. American Movie 4K Review: Final Verdict The American Movie 4K release is a wonderful tribute to the documentary on its 25th anniversary. The film looks great, giving us a great look at the limited resources and the unglamorous realities of independent filmmaking, and the disc, including the Coven short film, makes it all the more special. While it’s not on a famous subject or a classic film, there’s no doubt that this remains an essential filmmaking documentary. Disclosure: ComingSoon was sent product by the distributor for our American Movie 4K review.",
