  "text": "Trace Cyrus shared an open letter to his father, Billy Ray Cyrus, following his performance at Donald Trump‘s Liberty Inaugural Ball. In the emotional letter, Trace shared his health concerns for the “Achy Breaky Heart” singer. “Since my earliest memories all I can remember is being obsessed with you and thinking you were the coolest person ever. I wanted to be just like you,” Trace, who Billy Ray adopted after marrying his now ex-wife Tish Cyrus. “The day you adopted me was the happiest day of my life. Sadly the man that I wanted so desperately to be just like I barely recognize now. It seems this world has beaten you down and it’s become obvious to everyone but you.” The former Metro Station bandmember acknowledged that Billy Ray “may be upset” for him posting the letter on social media but Trace said, “I really could care less at this point.” Watch on Deadline Trace noted that he and sisters Miley Cyrus and Noah Cyrus “have been genuinely worried about you for years but you’ve pushed all of us away.” “Noah desperately has wanted you to be a part of her life and you haven’t even been there for her. That’s your baby girl. She deserves better. Somehow just like me she still idolizes you though,” Trace continued. “We are all hanging on to memories of the man we once knew \u0026 hoping for the day he returns.” He added, “You’re not healthy Dad \u0026 everyone is noticing it. Just like I showed up for you at mamaws funeral when you didn’t expect me to I’m still here right now. As I write this with tears in my eyes I hope you realize this message only comes from a place of love and also fear that the world may lose you far too soon. I love you Dad.” Trace acknowledges that he hasn’t talked to his father “in a while” and noted that he is “clean from alcohol” for over a year and a half now, adding, “I feel amazing. I don’t know what you’re struggling with exactly but I think I have a pretty good idea \u0026 I’d love to help you if you would open up and receive the help. You know how to reach me. Till that day comes I will continue to pray for you.”",
