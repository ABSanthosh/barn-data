Watching modern performers take on ancient personas as breakdancers and slam poets on mainstage battles. Exploring authentic costumes worn by actors in the movie, including a Praetorian Helmet and Facemask, Praetorian Cuirass, Roman Cavalry Helmet, and other genuine cinematic artifacts. Virtually trying on Gladiator II costumes with augmented reality projected onto a 2-story-tall digital screen. Dropping their Roman Empire and movie history knowledge during philosopher-led trivia. Stepping into a movie-inspired arena and capturing their gladiator personas with a rotating camera. Discovering props and costumes from the gladiator-inspired Make Your Gameday Epic commercial from Pepsi, including an ice chest, regalia, and scepter. Watching Gladiator II at Regal Times Square, home to the largest 4DX auditorium in the world with a record-breaking 296 seats, more than double the average amount of seats for theatres offering this premium format. \"Fans have waited 24 years for a sequel to Gladiator, so we knew we had to create something awesome to complement this epic moment. We're thrilled to bring Gladiator II to life through a Roman-inspired experience that brings together the best of Regal and Pepsi,\" said Scott Finlow, Chief Marketing Officer, PepsiCo Global Away From Home. \"Enjoying a nice cold Pepsi is a quintessential part of the moviegoing experience at Regal.
