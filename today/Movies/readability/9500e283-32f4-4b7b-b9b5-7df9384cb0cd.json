  "text": "The fate of JJ Maybank in Part 1 of Netflix’s treasure hunt series Outer Banks Season 4 has been a mystery for many fans. With the new season becoming more intense for the Pogues, especially JJ, it’s also said to pack some big surprises for fans. Here is everything you need to know about what happens with JJ Maybank in Season 4 Part 1 of Outer Banks and whether he dies in the show. Does JJ die in Outer Banks Season 4 part 1? No, fan-favorite character JJ Maybank, portrayed by Rudy Pankow, does not die in Season 4 Part 1. Following the ending of Outer Banks Season 3, JJ and the other Pogues became wealthy after finding El Dorado. However, their fortune didn’t last long, as they quickly depleted the money due to JJ’s spending on property and a final, unsuccessful bet in a motorcycle race. According to US Weekly, to recover from these losses, JJ agrees to take on a dangerous task offered by Wes Genrette (David Jensen). This mission involves locating an amulet that once belonged to Blackbeard’s wife, with a promise of $50,000 if the Pogues can retrieve it. But the adventure soon turns perilous, leading to JJ nearly drowning in the ocean and narrowly escaping from a hyperbaric recompression chamber after suffering from the bends during a deep dive. However, JJ’s brush with death isn’t the only shocking moment for his character in Part 1. As tensions rise, JJ learns a life-changing secret about his family. He discovers that Luke Maybank (Gary Weeks), the man he has always known as his father, is not his biological father. Instead, JJ is the son of Chandler Groff, a Kook—making JJ, who has always identified as a true Pogue, a “born Kook.” This revelation shakes JJ to his core, as it challenges everything he believed about himself and his identity. On this surprising revelation, Rudy Pankow, who plays JJ, told Tudum, “It was a shock. Not a single thought [had occurred].”",
