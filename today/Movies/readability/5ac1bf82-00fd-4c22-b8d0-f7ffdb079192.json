  "text": "Warner Bros. Television Sitcom sets can be iconic and highly recognizable. In fact, the main apartment sets on \"Friends\" and \"Frasier\" or the \"Cheers\" set that's based on a real Boston bar (which caused some big problems) can easily become so familiar that devoted fans will absolutely notice if something major is amiss with them. Because of this, \"Young Sheldon\" aficionados who have moved on to scratch their \"The Big Bang Theory\"-verse itch with \"Georgie \u0026 Mandy's First Marriage\" might have caught that something was off in season 1, episode 12, \"Typhoid Georgie.\" The episode features the shocking return of George Cooper Sr. (Lance Barber), whose death was a major event in Sheldon Cooper's (Jim Parsons) life on \"The Big Bang Theory.\" This tragic incident (which \"Young Sheldon\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\" co-creator Chuck Lorre actually regrets) is fully depicted in \"Young Sheldon,\" where George Sr. dies in season 7, episode 12, \"A New Home and a Traditional Texas Torture.\" Since \"Georgie \u0026 Mandy's First Marriage\" takes place after \"Young Sheldon,\" the George Sr. appearance in \"Typhoid Georgie\" is naturally a flashback that takes place in the Coopers' house in Medford, Texas. This posed a problem for the makers of the show since the set had been taken apart after \"Young Sheldon\" came to a close in 2024. Because of this, the makers of \"Georgie \u0026 Mandy's First Marriage\" had to rebuild the kitchen part of the set for the flashback scene. Rebuilding the Cooper kitchen for Georgie \u0026 Mandy's First Marriage was a big challenge Warner Bros. Television It was one thing to rebuild the set and completely another to furnish it the exact way it was in \"Young Sheldon.\" After the set wasn't needed anymore, the show's cast and crew had helped themselves to assorted souvenirs, which posed a challenge since there was no way to relocate it all. This created some discrepancies that didn't go unnoticed by Lance Barber, who told USA Today: \"This little hobo figurine didn't make it back, along with some refrigerator magnets that had been there for years.\" It's no wonder that Barber spotted such minor differences in the set. After all, the Cooper house was effectively his place of work for so many seasons, and returning to it — even for a brief cameo appearance — was a genuinely moving moment for all concerned parties. As Barber described the experience to USA Today: \"Some of the people watching the scenes were visually emotional seeing me on that kitchen set. This is a beloved character. It was fun to feel those feels and be so appreciated, even in the sadness.\" You can currently stream \"Georgie \u0026 Mandy's First Marriage\" on Paramount+.",
