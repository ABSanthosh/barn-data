  "text": "Jesse Eisenberg broke out into superstardom by playing Mark Zuckerberg in the hit 2010 film The Social Network, and had a hilarious answer when asked if he’d ever step back into the role. While speaking to E! News at the Governors Awards in Los Angeles this past weekend, Eisenberg was asked about the possibility of appearing in a long-rumored sequel. Eisenberg joked that he’s an actor, and as such, he would do mostly anything. “I’m an actor here,” Eisenberg said. “We’ll do any job that anybody offers us. If there’s a car commercial for a Pinto, I’ll show up on set. Will I be in that movie? Yeah, I’ll be in anything. If you’re making a home movie for a kid, I’ll be in the home movie.” While The Social Network wasn’t Eisenberg’s first starring role, his portrayal of Zuckerberg in the film catapulted him into the A-list actor territory. The film received eight Oscar nominations, eith Eisenberg earning a Best Actor nomination as well. Rumors of a potential sequel to the film have been making the rounds for some time. Back in April, Aaron Sorkin — who wrote the 2010 film that David Fincher directed — said that he was planning to write a movie about the January 6, 2020 insurrection, which he called a “quasi-sequel” to The Social Network at the time. “I blame Facebook for January 6,” Sorkin said, before joking that, “You’re gonna need to buy a movie ticket,” to find out why. “Facebook has been, among other things, tuning its algorithm to promote the most divisive material possible,” said Sorkin. “Because that is what will increase engagement and because that is what will get you to, what they call inside the hallways of Facebook, the infinite scroll. “There is supposed to be a constant tension at Facebook between growth and integrity, there isn’t. It’s just growth so if Mark Zuckerberg wakes up tomorrow and realises that there is nothing you can buy for $120bn that you can’t buy for $119bn, so how about if I make a little less money, I will tune up integrity and I will tune down growth.” (Source: E!
