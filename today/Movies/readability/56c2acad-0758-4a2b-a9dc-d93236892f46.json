  "text": "And so it begins: Shakira started her massive “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour” in Brazil on Tuesday night. This is the first of over 30 dates that will see the Colombian singer traveling across Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and North America. Ahead of her performance in Rio De Janeiro’s Estádio Nilton Santos, Shakira posted a lengthy statement to her social media account. Shakira notes she has been in rehearsals for the tour for a year and has devoted 14 hours a day to perfecting her performance. “Today is the day. At this moment I write these lines from my dressing room. The reflection in the mirror gives me the image of a woman who has left every last breath in each rehearsal, in each chord, in each step,” she wrote in Spanish. “I know that perfection does not exist, but I do know that tonight I will give myself to you as I am, with my voice sharpened by experience and my skin marked by each one.” Popular on Variety Produced by Live Nation, the “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour” is in support of her Grammy-winning album of the same name. This jaunt, like the album, is her first since her “El Dorado” global outing in 2017-2018. Shakira initially announced tour dates for American fans during her surprise appearance at Coachella with Bizarrap. The dates were subsequently postponed and rescheduled and moved to larger venues with Team Shak citing increased demand. Her North American dates will now begin on May 13 in Charlotte followed by stops in Toronto, Boston, Miami, and Las Vegas. Shakira will also perform in Washington, D.C., May 26, as the headliner of WorldPride DC, and end her North American leg in San Francisco on June 30.",
