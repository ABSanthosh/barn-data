The disc release also includes Yerzhanov's 2022 film Goliath, available for the very first time. This looks extremely brutal and sadistic, yet somehow still entertaining enough to actually watch. Here's the official US trailer (+ posters) for Adilkhan Yerzhanov's film Steppenwolf, from YouTube: Winner of Golden Raven Grand Prix at 2024 Brussels Fantastic Film Festival. Tamara (Anna Starchenko), a young lady consumed by trauma, searches for her missing son, Timka, in a small town dominated by riots \u0026 violence. In a desperate attempt to find him, she works with an amoral former police investigator (Berik Aitzhanov) whose methods prove to be frequently cruel and sadistic. Quietly determined, Tamara decides to complete the mission with the nihilistic detective, no matter the cost, as the pair embark on a bloody \u0026 bullet-riddled road trip in their combined search for salvation. Steppenwolf, also known as Дала қасқыры or Dala Qasqiri in Kazakh, is written and directed by Kazakh filmmaker Adilkhan Yerzhanov, director of many films including Rieltor, Constructors, The Owner, Nochnoy Bog, The Gentle Indifference of the World, A Dark Dark Man, Atbai's Fight, Yellow Cat, Goliath, and Ademoka's Education previously, as well as Kadet also this year. Produced by Olga Khlasheva, Aliya Mendygozhina, Alexander Rodnyansky. This initially premiered at the 2024 Rotterdam Film Festival last year. Arrow Video will debut Steppenwolf on VOD (via Apple TV) and on Blu-ray starting on May 26th, 2025 this summer. Anyone want to watch? Find more posts in: Foreign Films, Indies, To Watch, Trailer",
