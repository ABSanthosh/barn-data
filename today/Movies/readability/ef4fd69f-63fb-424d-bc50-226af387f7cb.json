On January 22, Expedition X Season 8 drops on HBO Max. The reality show features Jessica Chobot and Phil Torres delving deep into the supernatural occurrences in the world. They pay a visit to unknown places for information to explain the unnatural events. However, the mystery continues to deepen with every clue. Further, another reality show Harpoon Hunters Season 1 will be available on the streaming platform. It follows a multi-generational fishing family as they attempt to catch the Atlantic bluefin tuna using 10-foot electrified spears. With a limited time to catch them, they are determined to put in all their efforts. Later, Bugs Bunny Builders will come out on HBO Max. The animated series chronicles the adventures of Bugs Bunny and his goofy group of friends working as builders. While there are numerous challenges in their journey, they do not give up and learn valuable lessons in life. The series features a voice cast of Eric Bauza, Chandni Parekh, Bob Bergen, Alex Cazares, Keith Ferguson, Jeff Bergman, Dawson Griffin, and many others.
