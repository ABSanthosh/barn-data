One of the most riveting, under the-radar films premiering this fall on the genre film festival circuit is called Zero - the latest feature from talented Congolese filmmaker Jean Luc Herbulot. It premiered at both Beyond Fest and the Sitges Film Festival in Spain – which is where I caught up with it – and still doesn't have enough attention yet. Herbulot made a splash back in 2021 with his film Saloum, a neo-Western thriller set in Africa, his second feature film at the time. That one also took time building up buzz before it eventually got a US release (trailer here). His third feature is Zero and it's his most provocative yet, taking aim at America this time, as it's about two Americans who wake up in Senegal with bombs strapped to their chests. Why? What's going on? What's the point? Are they being used - if yes, what for? Who is manipulating them? So many questions at the start that the film does eventually answer in distinct \u0026 surprising ways. It's really refreshing to see Herbulot continue to make edgy genre films that are unlike anything else made by North American and European filmmakers. Zero is directed by Jean Luc Herbulot, who grew up in the Republic of the Congo and studied in Paris and made his first films there, and is co-written by Jean Luc Herbulot along with Hus Miller, who also co-stars in the film as one of the American guys. This isn't the first film made about people suddenly waking up with bombs (or guns or anything dangerous) strapped to them, or waking up in a strange place (like Saw) they didn't expect. It's what the film does with this concept and where the story goes that makes it compelling \u0026 unique. Hus Miller stars as #1, the first guy who wakes up on a bus in Dakar with a bomb on his chest. He's given a phone \u0026 earpiece and suddenly the voice of Willem Dafoe calls in and tells him he has to complete 5 missions within 10 hours or kaboom. It's not long after we meet #2, played by Cameron McHarg with a big bushy beard, the other American guy who wakes up in Dakar with a bomb on his chest. It turns out that #1 was on his way to Dakar anyway, as he's looking for a lost love. All that matters now is following orders and doing what he's told - so off he goes because the police are already after him. The first 30 minutes play out like the early scenes in The Matrix where Neo is told how to get out of the office before Agents find him. Set entirely in Dakar, the film is engaging from start to finish. Aside from the obvious ticking clock concept, the pacing isn't overly erratic or intense, the film takes its time to breathe and rest inbetween the intensity of the missions. It's bright and colorful, just like Dakar, and most of the performances are just barely good enough to grab the audience's attention. The film is rough around the edges, but that doesn't take away from the overall edginess and thrill of what Herbulot is trying to do with Zero. He absolutely has something to say with this film. It's not just an exercise in genre filmmaking and ticking clock writing, thankfully there's more driving this story this time. It's naturaly violent and brutal but actually for a reason – the characters learn there is a value in death even though they're still unwilling participants in this game. As with most films I watch at film festivals, I do no want to discuss spoilers or reveal everything said in the film, thus making it really hard to discuss it in full now. There's a point in the final act where the film finally comes together and everything is explained – there is a point to all of this chaos. And I admire that Herbulot is confident enough to make this point, to say these things in his film, and to take us on this hair-raising journey around Dakar. This scrappy style of filmmaking might not be for everyone, and of course some Americans might be slightly disturbed by seeing these two American characters at the center of it be used as pawns to criticize America. But these kind of films are necessary and are important in cinema anyway. And I'm especially relieved that Herbulot is also a legitimate genre filmmaker - he knows how to tell gripping stories, setup stakes, take us through the narrative as these two dudes try to navigate the craziness of Dakar while they've got a bombed strapped on. It's provocative storytelling wrapped around vivid filmmaking and I'm all for this. Whether or not the point being made actually makes sense is a different question. I do think it encourages the kind of conversation that we're all afraid of having. What does freedom mean, how do people get freedom, why does it matter? What kind of freedom do they really need? And what does freedom for Africans really mean when most of Africa has been colonized by Europeans or White people from other parts of the world. It's kind of awesome to see these questions worked into a film that plays at genre festivals and gets horror fans riled up.
