Either way, welcome back to the fold RDJ. The panel revealed that Downey Jr’s Doom would make his presence known in the freshly titled Avengers: Doomsday which has a release date of May 2026 with Avengers: Secret Wars following in May 2027.  Let us know what you think of this curveball in the comments down below!
