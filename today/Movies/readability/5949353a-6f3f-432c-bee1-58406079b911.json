  "text": "The Voltron live-action movie cast has added a major star, with Henry Cavill set to join the project of the highly anticipated adaptation of the legendary animated series. It’s unclear just who Cavill will play in the film, but he will join Daniel Quinn-Toye, who was cast as the lead in the project earlier this month. Plot details for the movie remain under wraps at this time, with no further casting information or any production details available at this time as well. What else do we know about the Voltron live-action movie? As previously reported, the live-action Voltron movie will be directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber from a screenplay he’ll co-write with Ellen Shanman. Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman are attached to produce along with Bob Koplar through World Events Productions, the company that currently controls the rights to the mecha franchise. The Voltron franchise is based on Toei Animation’s mecha anime series titled Beast King GoLion, which aired 52 episodes from 1981-1982. It first gained international recognition when it was adapted by World Events Productions and ABC into an English animated series that ran on-air from 1984-1985. The story revolves around five young space pilots who control Robot Lions, which combine together into the titular super robot. Due to its success, it spawned three more animated TV spin-offs, two video games, and a line of toys. A release date for the live-action Voltron movie has not yet been announced. (Source: Deadline)",
