From first getting attention with her YouTube series Awkward Black Girl to achieving recognition with HBO‘s Insecure, Rae’s career is worth following. The Emmy nominee will star in Good People, Bad Things, playing a character stuck in an infinite parking garage. Even though Issa Rae usually stars in comedic works, she has also explored plenty of dark projects. Her last comedy-thriller was B.J. Novak‘s directorial debut, Vengeance. This year, Rae joined the season 7 cast of Black Mirror, playing an actress in an AI-produced remake. We also can’t forget when the Golden Globe nominee was involved in heavy dramas like The Hate U Give and The Photograph. According to Deadline, Issa Rae’s next comedy-thriller movie will be Good People, Bad Things. This will be Rae’s third collaboration with MRC, who worked with the film/TV company for Oscar winner American Fiction and Netflix‘s The Lovebirds. Scottish filmmaker Ninian Doff will direct the upcoming movie, known for the dark-comedy Get Duked! and The Chemical Brothers’ music video We’ve Got to Try. What will Issa Rae’s new movie be about? In Good People, Bad Things, Issa Rae stars as an overwhelmed woman stuck in an infinite parking garage. Here’s the thrilling plot twist- she may not be alone. The plot of the movie, said to be a comedy-thriller, appears very dark. But it wouldn’t be the first time the two genres have clashed. Classic films like Pulp Fiction, Game Night, The Menu, and more have had dark plots with plenty of comedic moments to lighten the mood. I can imagine feelings of claustrophobia if the majority of the movie takes place in one location. Keep checking in to learn more about Issa Rae’s Good People, Bad Places as well as its release date.",
