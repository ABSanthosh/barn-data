Hulu released a trailer for the two-part series Tuesday. In it, Cooper explains how her upbringing inspired an entrepreneurial spirit that she took with her into adulthood. Watch the trailer above. “I was fortunate to grow up in a household where it was normalized to speak your mind,” she says. “Playing sports and making videos in my basement, those were the two things I really loved.” When an accident takes Division I soccer away from her, she finds herself driven to find her new purpose, ultimately resulting in her hit podcast Call Her Daddy. The trailer teases details the podcast’s early days at Barstool and Cooper’s six-year journey to where she is today.
