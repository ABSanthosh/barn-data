During a recent interview on the “Bussin’ with the Boys” podcast, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end said that the “hardest” part of hosting “SNL” was the pre-show table read because he “can’t really read that well.” “The writers’ rooms were fun because you’re just getting pitched ideas,” Kelce explained. “The table reading, for a guy that can’t really read that well, it was kind of a fucked situation.” Popular on Variety “I felt like I was just trying to get through the reading instead of actually acting it out and giving it a voice and giving it a character and things like that,” he added. “I was just focused on, ‘Don’t fucking skip this line.'” Kelce hosted the 14th episode of “SNL” Season 48 on March 4, 2023. He was joined by musical guest Kelsea Ballerini. Once past the table read, the Super Bowl champion said he was “so much more comfortable” engaging with “the comedy” and “the silly stuff.” “There was still a sense of like, ‘I need to be a professional here,’” Kelce said. “I want to take advantage of this, but I want to have fun doing it, but I don’t want to look like a loser doing this. I want to make them respect my approach and how I’m like taking it serious. But it was just a fun roller coaster, man.” Kelce has made a push into Hollywood in recent years, landing a recurring role in FX’s “Grotesquerie.” He will soon appear in Netflix’s “Happy Gilmore” sequel alongside Adam Sandler",
