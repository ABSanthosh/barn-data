  "text": "Posted in: HBO, Max, Movies, TV | Tagged: dc studios, dcu, james gunnJames Gunn clarified DC Studios' live-action/animation casting when asked about Alan Tudyk voicing multiple roles in Creature Commandos. It's hard to believe it, but our countdown to the two-episode premiere of DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran's adult animated series Creature Commandos is now down to single digits (nine at the time of this writing), with Gunn, Showrunner Dean Lorey, and the cast in the midst of getting the word out about our first introduction to the New DCU. When Gunn and Safran first rolled out \"Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters,\" one of the things they wanted out of DC Studios was for the actor voicing the animated version of a DC character to also portray them on the live-action side. A perfect example would be Frank Grillo, who portrays Rick Flag Sr. in Creature Commandos, Superman, and Peacemaker Season 2. We read that to mean that the policy was one that the studio would adhere to as much as possible – but if someone blew the doors off auditioning for a live-action role that's currently being voiced by someone on the animation side, we just kinda assumed that they wouldn't cut off their nose to spite their face.  Image: DC Studios; DC Studios Screencap But, what about someone like Alan Tudyk, who is voicing Dr. Phosphorus, Clayface, and Will Magnus (check out our updated voice cast rundown below)? Gunn was asked what that meant in terms of the live-action side of things on Threads, with a fan asking if that meant that those characters wouldn't be getting a live-action take or if it didn't matter because that character would be VFX-created for a live-action film or series. In this case, Gunn explained that it came down to if the character was a major or minor character in the animated series. \"As it was always stated, we plan on the actor playing the same role for 'primary castings.' If it's a minor character in 'Creature Commandos' we didn't do live-action far-and-wide searches like we did for more sizable characters like Circe, Nina, etc. Image: Threads Screencap Creature Commandos: James Gunn Offers Details Thanks to a video presentation from Gunn (busy working on Superman and Peacemaker Season 2) during the 2024 Annecy International Animation Festival, we learned much more about what we can expect – and yes, those in attendance got a look at the adult animated series (though not released). The first look involved Waller (Viola Davis), G.I. Robot (Sean Gunn), Nina (Zoe Chao), and the topic of killing Nazis, followed by a fight scene between deep-sleeper Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) and Dr. Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk). \"It's a cornerstone of the legacy we've been entrusted to carry at DC Studios and plays an integral role in the vision for our future storytelling,\" Gunn shared with those in attendance. \"Since taking the reins, our true north has been to bring DC film, TV, animation, and gaming into alignment under a single banner and bring a sense of unity and consistency into the DCU as a whole. This frees us to create a range of products that are diverse and compelling and deliver great stand-alone entertainment experiences on every medium while also being part of a larger story that we're telling within our unified DCU.\" Gunn continued, \"What this means in practical terms is that our characters can move in and out of animation or jump into a game or onto the big screen, but they will remain consistent throughout: same character, same history, same actor.\" For example, Davis is reprising her live-action role as Amanda Waller for the animated series, and Grillo's animated Rick Flag Sr. will be making the jump into live-action for the second season of Max's Peacemaker. From there, Gunn shared that the series will pick up \"directly\" from the first season finale of the John Cena-starring series – with Waller finding \"her hands tied operationally.\" \"The new series picks up directly after our 'Peacemaker' season one finale, which leaves Waller with her hands tied operationally, meaning that she's no longer able to get away with putting human lives on the line to carry out her clandestine morally questionable missions. Instead, she recruits a ragtag band of misfits, not unlike the Suicide Squad and Peacemaker,\" Gunn revealed during the video presentation. That makes our leads a very different kind of hero than what viewers may have been used to in the past – and that's one of the things Gunn loves about the series: they \"are actual literal monsters, and I can't wait for you to meet them. Creating this series has been one of the absolute joys of my life.\" CREATURE COMMANDOS (Image: Max) The role call for the adult animated series (and any potential live-action takes) includes Frank Grillo as Rick Flag Sr., with Maria Bakalova as Princess Ilana Rostovic, Indira Varma as The Bride, Zoe Chao as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk as Dr. Phosphorus, Clayface, and Will Magnus; David Harbour as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn as G.I. Robot and Weasel; Steve Agee as John Economos, Anya Chalotra as Circe, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. In addition, we have Benjamin Byron Davis as Rupert Thorne, Michael Rooker as Sam, and Peter Serafinowicz as Victor Frankenstein. Linda Cardellini and Gregg Henry also joined the cast in guest star roles. Kevin Kiner and Clint Mansell (Peacemaker, Doom Patrol) are scoring the animated series, First introduced by J.M. DeMatteis and Pat Broderick in Weird War Tales #93 (November 1980), the comic book series focused on Frankenstein's monster teaming with a werewolf, a vampire, and a gorgon to fight Nazis in World War II. The series has the distinction of being the first DCU project that Gunn \u0026 Safran gave the green light to (with Gunn having penned the series) and the first from DC Studios that will hit screens. In addition, the series is being cast with voice actors who could also play their characters in a live-action project down the road. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
