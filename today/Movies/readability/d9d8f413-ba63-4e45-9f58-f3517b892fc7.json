Check out the Babygirl video below (watch more trailers): What happens in the Babygirl video? The video features Kidman and director Halina Reijn discussing the Oscar-winning actress’ character Romy, who begins a love affair with a young intern. Kidman also revealed what drew her to signing onto the movie, admitting that after reading the script she was immediately obsessed with how the character was portrayed in the story. Babygirl is written and directed by Bodies Bodies Bodies filmmaker Halina Reijn. The film is also produced by Reijn along with David Hinojosa and Julia Oh. The ensemble cast also includes Antonio Banderas, Esther McGregor, Vaughan Reilly, Sophie Wilde, Gaite Jansen, Izabel Mar, Victor Slezak, Anoop Desai, Leslie Silva, Maxwell Whittington-Cooper, and more.
