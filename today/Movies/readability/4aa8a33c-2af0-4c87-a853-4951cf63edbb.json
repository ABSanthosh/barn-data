People are really the most terrible when it comes to chasing money and fame. The worst. Here's the main official trailer for Joslyn Jensen's doc Bad Actor, direct from Neon's YouTube: Intro via Tribeca: \"How easy is it to be deceived? In this riveting documentary, the shocking story of D-List action “star” Zachary Horwitz unfolds as his arrest by the FBI in 2021 reveals his so-called movie career was actually facilitating a massive Ponzi scheme – or was it the other way around? Through interviews, victim testimonies, \u0026 a wealth of clips from Horwitz's dubious filmography, Bad Actor: A Hollywood Ponzi Scheme delves into the world of this industry hanger-on, exposing the allure of the glitz and glamor that ensnared both Horwitz and his victims.\" Bad Actor: A Hollywood Ponzi Scheme is directed by American filmmaker Joslyn Jensen, making her feature directorial debut after a few shorts. Produced by Matthew Cherchio, Dan O'Meara, Ted Speaker. This initially premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year.
