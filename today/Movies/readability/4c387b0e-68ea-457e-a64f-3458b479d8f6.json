  "description": "\"She's not who I thought she was...! She's a total badass secret agent.\" Magenta Light Studios (a brand new distributor in town) has revealed the first official trailer for Bride Hard, a totally ridiculous action comedy arriving in theaters nationwide in June this summer movie season. A very cheesy concept mashup - take a spy comedy and wrap up with a wedding comedy about a maid of honor who also happens to be an assassin, and here we go. Also looks similar to JLo's Shotgun Wedding last year. It's directed by action movie veteran Simon West (of Con-Air, The Mechanic, Wild Card, Old Guy, etc). This summer – you are invited to one unforgettable wedding. \"Grab your bride or die.\" When a mercenary group takes a lavish wedding hostage, they have no idea what they are in for as the Maid of Honor is actually a secret agent ready to rain hell-fire upon anyone who dares to ruin her best friend's wedding. Rebel Wilson stars with Anna Camp, Anna Chlumsky, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Gigi Zumbado, Stephen Dorff, and Justin Hartley. This looks entirely absurd in every way, but that's the kind of \"kick back and have fun\" entertainment they're going […]",

She's a total badass secret agent.\" Magenta Light Studios (a brand new distributor in town) has revealed the first official trailer for Bride Hard, a totally ridiculous action comedy arriving in theaters nationwide in June this summer movie season. A very cheesy concept mashup - take a spy comedy and wrap up with a wedding comedy about a maid of honor who also happens to be an assassin, and here we go. Also looks similar to JLo's Shotgun Wedding last year. It's directed by action movie veteran Simon West (of Con-Air, The Mechanic, Wild Card, Old Guy, etc). This summer – you are invited to one unforgettable wedding. \"Grab your bride or die.\" When a mercenary group takes a lavish wedding hostage, they have no idea what they are in for as the Maid of Honor is actually a secret agent ready to rain hell-fire upon anyone who dares to ruin her best friend's wedding. Rebel Wilson stars with Anna Camp, Anna Chlumsky, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Gigi Zumbado, Stephen Dorff, and Justin Hartley. This looks entirely absurd in every way, but that's the kind of \"kick back and have fun\" entertainment they're going for. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Simon West's comedy Bride Hard, direct from YouTube: Sam (Rebel Wilson) is a world-class secret agent... and a pretty terrible maid of honor. After blowing off bridal duties for an international spy mission, she’s demoted to bridesmaid at her childhood best friend’s wedding. What should’ve been a weekend of reconnecting and celebration turns into a five-star death trap when armed mercenaries crash the big day. Sam’s the only one who can save the bride, and hopefully earn back the trust she lost along the way. Dodging bullets and trying not to ruin the floral arrangements, Sam takes on the ultimate wedding crasher, realizing that sometimes the toughest mission isn’t taking down the bad guys, but showing up for the people who matter. Bride Hard is directed by British filmmaker Simon West, director of the movies Con Air, The General's Daughter, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, When a Stranger Calls, The Mechanic, The Expendables 2, Stolen, Wild Card, Stratton, Gun Shy, Skyfire, Legend Hunters, and Old Guy previously. The screenplay is by Shaina Steinberg; from a story by Shaina Steinberg and Cece Pleasants. Produced by Colleen Camp, Cassian Elwes, Jason Ross Jallet, Joel David Moore, Max Osswald, Bob Yari. Magenta Light releases West's Bride Hard in theaters nationwide starting on June 20th, 2025. Find more posts in: Comedy, To Watch, Trailer",
