After leading the HBO series spin-off, which is garnering Emmy buzz ahead of this weekend’s Season 1 finale, the Oscar nominee might be gearing up to reprise the villainous role for the upcoming sequel to Matt Reeves‘ The Batman (2022). “I have no idea what the second film is gonna be. I heard Penguin features in it. I haven’t read it,” he said on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Show with Julia Cunningham. “It’d be interesting to see where we pick up from. There’s been so much pipe laid.
