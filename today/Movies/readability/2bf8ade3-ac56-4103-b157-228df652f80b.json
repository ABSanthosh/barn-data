The surrealist family comedy series from Apple Studios will be streaming in April this spring. Set in the San Fernando Valley, 1969. Where the American Dream gets surreal. David Oyelowo stars as Hampton Chambers - a newly released ex-convict striving to leave his own criminal past behind and reunite with his family. Amidst this struggle, he grapples with frequent inexplicable moments of divine intervention and dreams of invention. Alas, his long-awaited family reunion doesn't go quite as he'd planned. His wife, Astoria, and sons, Einstein \u0026 Harrison, have formed an unconventional family unit. But he has some ideas anyway... The big ensemble cast includes Simone Missick, Jahi Di’Allo Winston, \u0026 Evan Ellison as his family, with Bokeem Woodbine, Jeremy Bobb, Louis Cancelmi, Julien Heron, Djilali Rez-Kallah, Louis Ferreira, Thomas Beaudoin, Kyle Mac, John Ortiz, and Adam Beach.
