  "description": "\"A shimmering film about love and resilience.\" Yes! Kino Lorber has finally unveiled an official trailer for a wonderful little film called Every Little Thing, which first premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. I watched this at the world premiere and have never forgotten it - always on my mind. Now it's ready to open a year later after its debut! It's the story of a humble woman who takes care of and nurses hummingbirds back to health and re-releases them. Author and wildlife rehabber Terry Masear has an ambitious goal: to save every injured hummingbird in Los Angeles. But the path to survival is fraught with danger. This heart-expanding Sundance doc hit introduces audiences to Terry's diminutive patients through breathtaking slow-motion photography and emotional storytelling. I love this film! If you live anywhere where hummingbirds fly, you've probably heard or seen one fly into a window or glass door. What do you do next? She teaches us how to save them. It's such a wholesome, uplifting little film... I wrote in my glowing review: \"Take a moment to appreciate \u0026 heal with this lovely doc film whenever you have a chance.\" Enjoy.

It's such a wholesome, uplifting little film... I wrote in my glowing review: \"Take a moment to appreciate \u0026 heal with this lovely doc film whenever you have a chance.\" Enjoy. Here's the official trailer (+ posters) for Sally Aitken's doc Every Little Thing, direct from YouTube: Author \u0026 rehabber Terry Masear wants to save every injured hummingbird in Los Angeles. Terry takes in the most fragile of patients through her volunteer hummingbird rescue she runs on her own, but the path to survival is fraught with uncertainty and drama. Over the course of this intimate and moving documentary, we become invested in Terry‚Äôs hummingbird patients ‚Äì including Cactus, Jimmy, Wasabi, Raisin, and Mikhail ‚Äì celebrating their small victories and lamenting their tiny tragedies. üê¶ Through the eyes of America's busiest bird rehabilitator, each of her birds becomes memorable, mighty and heroic. As she nurtures the wounded hummingbirds back to health, Terry finds herself on her own transformative journey, unraveling a visually captivating and magical tale of love, healing, and the delicate beauty in tiny acts of greatness. Every Little Thing is directed by acclaimed Australian doc filmmaker Sally Aitken, director of the docs Getting Frank Gehry, Playing with Sharks: The Valerie Taylor Story, Hot Potato: The Story of the Wiggles, and many others. Produced by Bettina Dalton, Anna Godas, and Oli Harbottle. This initially premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year (our review). Kino Lorber will debut Every Little Thing in select US theaters (NY \u0026 LA at first) starting on January 10th, 2025 coming soon. Find more posts in: Documentaries, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
