  "description": "\"Five times I cast my vote for you, Aldo. But I was wrong....\" Another year is over, which means it's time to look back at the best films released over the last 12 months. Artist James Chapman, based in Leeds, UK, has just published his Top 10 Films of 2024 list on Instagram - by drawing an adorable little illustration for each \u0026 every favorite film. I've been an avid follower of Chapman for a few years already (we also posted his illustrations for 2022 and for 2023) and I am a big fan of his artistic style. He draws and colors images in a little notepad and includes the pens \u0026 markers in the shot every time. They make me smile every time. Each image is so clever. Many of these films are my faves, too (Conclave and Dune: Part Two and Sing Sing and Anora are also in my Top 10). Many critics put La Chimera on their list this year due to a late release (it was my #1 last year). This year he posted only 10 picks, and I've included all 10 images below.

Click back over to IG for more details. His mini reviews within each image come from his Letterboxd. Check his Top 10 below. Even though Perfect Days, Poor Things, and La Chimera were already on my Top 10 of 2023 at the end of last year, I'm still happy to see them appearing here anyway. Because they're superb films and giving them more attention is all good! I'm quite happy with his Top 10 for 2024 - though I'd love to see his full Top 25 as well. One of the reasons we keep posting Best of the Year lists like this is to encourage watching any of these films that you haven't seen yet. James' intro for 2024: \"I loved going to the cinema this year, it was full of surprises and things I never knew I needed to see. Uplifting, inspirational, life-affirming works of art. And also Madame Web.\" You can follow him on there or see more on his IG @chapmangamo. For the full list of James Chapman's favorites and to view all of his 2024 illustrations - visit his IG poster. He also sells many of his illustrations in his shop on Etsy, and you can find more of his work on his official website or support his Patreon. As always, if there are any films you haven't seen from these annual end-of-the-year recaps, add them to your Watch List/Queue and make time to enjoy. Which of these drawings are the best?
