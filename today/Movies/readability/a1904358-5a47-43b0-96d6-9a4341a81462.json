  "description": "\"You trying to steal from me?\" \"Just protecting my family.\" Saban Films has debuted the official trailer for a junky action crime thriller called High Rollers, the latest from filmmaker Randal Emmett also know as Ives. The film is now ready to launch in March and will be available on VOD right away if anyone out there cares. It's a surprise sequel to Cash Out (from last year) which also starred Travolta as a thief. In this follow-up, master thief Mason is pulled back in for a big casino heist that he must complete in order to get the love of his life back from his ruthless nemesis Salazar. Will he be able to outsmart him and the casino? The cast features John Travolta back as Mason Goddard again, with Gina Gershon, Lukas Haas, Quavo, Kelly Greyson, Swen Temmel, and Demián Castro.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Randall Emmett's film High Rollers, direct from YouTube: Master thief Mason (John Travolta) is living the criminal's dream: island-hopping with his crew and the love of his life, Decker (Gina Gershon), while floating on a sea of stolen cash. But his dream is shattered when his nemesis, the ruthless Salazar, kidnaps Decker and forces Mason and his crew to attempt a near-impossible casino heist in exchange for her return. Hedged in by Salazar's equally ruthless rivals, with the FBI on his tail, Mason gambles everything in pursuit of both the big score \u0026 the ultimate jackpot: Decker's life. High Rollers is directed by the American action producer / filmmaker Randall Emmett (who is also known as just \"Ives\"), director of the films Midnight in the Switchgrass, Savage Salvation, and Cash Out previously, plus a producer on many other projects. The screenplay is written by Chris Sivertson. Produced by Cecil Chambers, Joel Cohen, and Randall Emmett. Saban Films will debut Ives' new heist thriller High Rollers in select US theaters + on VOD starting March 14th, 2025 coming soon. Anyone want to watch?
