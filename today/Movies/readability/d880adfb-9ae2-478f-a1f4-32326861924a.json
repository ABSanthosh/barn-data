  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Emmy winners John Lithgow (Conclave, The Old Man) and Jimmy Smits (East New York, Sons of Anarchy) are set to reprise their roles of Arthur Miller aka the Trinity Killer and Miguel Prado, respectively, in the Showtime original series Dexter: Resurrection. The show has been in production in New York since January. For playing the diabolical Trinity Killer, Lithgow received an Emmy Award, Critics’ Choice Award, and a SAG Award as well as a Golden Globe nomination. Smits received an Emmy nomination for his Season 3 portrayal of Miguel, the ADA-turned-lawbreaker hellbent on revenge. At this point, fans of the ‘Dexter’-verse aren’t surprised when news emerges that dead people are being resurrected. Especially when Lithgow is concerned, as he appeared in flashback scenes in the limited series Dexter: New Blood. The New Blood continuation series is titled Resurrection, so at this point, anything goes. This is Smit’s return to the franchise, however, a young Miguel Prado appeared in Original Sin played by Nick Santucci. Watch on Deadline From Clyde Phillips and led by Michael C. Hall, who returns to the role of the titular serial killer, the cast also includes returning stars David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista, Jack Alcott as Dexter’s son Harrison Morgan and James Remar as Dexter’s father Harry Morgan. New additions also include Uma Thurman as Charley, Peter Dinklage as Leon Prater, Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine as Blessing Kamara, Kadia Saraf as Detective Claudette Wallace, Dominic Fumusa as Detective Melvin Oliva and Emilia Suárez as Elsa Rivera. Previously announced stars are Neil Patrick Harris, who will play Lowell, Krysten Ritter as Mia Lapierre, Eric Stonestreet as Al and David Dastmalchian as Gareth. We recently announced New Blood’s David Magidoff will reprise the character of ‘Teddy Reed’ from the Iron Lake Police Department. I hope that Lithgow’s return as Trinity ends up connecting to the potential spinoff prequel about his early years we told you about in December, similarly to how Dexter’s survival bled from New Blood into Original Sin’s premiere. As we told you back in December, Phillips and fellow Dexter veteran Scott Reynolds will serve as co-creators and executive producers of the limited series project which has already been written. Fans are also pending the Season 2 renewal of Original Sin which concluded its first season, led by Patrick Gibson and Christian Slater, on February 14. We understand the further expansion of the franchise depends highly on the success of Original Sin and Resurrection, the latter of which is set to premiere this summer. Dexter: Original Sin ended on a high note, measuring a finale audience that grew 27% over the December premiere, according to Deadline’s Katie Campione. She continued, “the finale tallied 2.68M global viewers on Paramount+ with Showtime, according to Paramount Global. This includes the three-day streaming audience that tuned in once the episode became available on Friday, as well as any same-day viewers that watched when the episode aired on the linear network Sunday night. It was the most-streamed episode of the season, Paramount Global says, up 30% from the premiere’s streaming audience.” Dexter: Resurrection is executive produced by Clyde Phillips, who also returns to serve as showrunner, and produced by Showtime Studios and Counterpart Studios. Michael C. Hall also serves as executive producer along with Scott Reynolds, Tony Hernandez and Lilly Burns, with Marcos Siega serving as producing director. Monica Raymund is set to direct four episodes with Siega directing six episodes for the series. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution. Lithgow is a two-time Tony, six-time Emmys, two-time Golden Globes, three-time SAG Awards and two-time Oscar-nominated actor. Lithgow most recently starred in the ensemble cast of the Edward Berger-directed film Conclave and the animated film Spellbound. At Sundance this year, he played the titular role of Jimpa, starring alongside Olivia Colman. Upcoming, John will star in The Rule of Jenny Pen with Geoffrey Rush. As Deadline previously reported, Lithgow is expected to play ‘Albus Dumbledore’ in HBO’s Harry Potter series. He is repped by UTA, Anonymous Content, Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Smits is an Emmy and Golden Globe Award-winning actor who broke barriers for Latino actors who followed his footsteps into theater, TV and film careers. His recent credits include the 2023 CBS drama East New York and Jon M. Chu’s critically acclaimed feature film In The Heights. He received six consecutive Emmy nominations, winning in 1990, for his role in the multi-award-winning drama L.A. Law. He has received multiple other prestigious awards and nominations for his work in NYPD Blue, Dexter and The West Wing. Additional notable film and TV credits include roles in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Sons of Anarchy, Outlaw, Star Wars: Rogue One and The Believers. Smits is repped by UTA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners.",
