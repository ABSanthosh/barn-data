One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/touch-me-sundance-midnight-83602/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eTue, 21 Jan 2025 04:16:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83602\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eNOSFERATU - Succumb to the Darkness\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/nosferatu-review-eric-mcclanahan-83601/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers\u0026amp;#39;s latest film, NOSFERATU.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/nosferatu-review-eric-mcclanahan-83601/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Wouldst thou like to live immortally?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see,\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/nosferatu-review-eric-mcclanahan-83601/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eTue, 31 Dec 2024 01:37:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83601\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eJames Fox Discusses His Documentary THE PROGRAM\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-james-fox-the-program-uap-reports-83600/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Filmmaker James Fox discusses his new documentary THE PROGRAM which examines the United States government\u0026amp;#39;s pre-existing relationship with UAPs.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/interview-james-fox-the-program-uap-reports-83600/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Streaming services took over channels and then became their own studios. For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity. Set within the confines of a horror film, we see what it might be like to grow up in a family where the patriarch is a serial killer/slasher who rises from the grave\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/bloody-axe-wound-hilarie-burton-morgan-interview-83599/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eFri, 27 Dec 2024 05:10:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83599\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eBarbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/michaeljohnwarreninterview2024freediver-83598/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/michaeljohnwarreninterview2024freediver-83598/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/michaeljohnwarreninterview2024freediver-83598/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eFri, 06 Dec 2024 12:45:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83598\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eTim Sheridan - Creator Interview\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/tim-sheridan-alan-scott-green-lantern-interview-83597/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Tim Sheridan chats about Alan Scott: Green Lantern, Superman: Man of Tomorrow, Batman: The Long Halloween, and adapting legacy stories to small and large screens.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/tim-sheridan-alan-scott-green-lantern-interview-83597/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/tim-sheridan-alan-scott-green-lantern-interview-83597/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 30 Nov 2024 08:54:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83597\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eJenni \"JWoww\" Farley on Writing/Directing DEVON\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/jenni-jwoww-farley-interview-devon-83596/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;McEric chats with reality star Jenni \u0026amp;quot;JWoww\u0026amp;quot; Farley on her feature-film debut as writer/director of the found-footage horror film DEVON.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/jenni-jwoww-farley-interview-devon-83596/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Found footage horror.

Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: Why go black and white with this? \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that.

If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Carrie-Anne\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/hold-your-breath-die-alone-bhff-83594/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eMcEric\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eFri, 01 Nov 2024 00:45:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83594\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eSnake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/lifeanddeathsofchristopherleeffreview2024-83593/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/lifeanddeathsofchristopherleeffreview2024-83593/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015).\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/lifeanddeathsofchristopherleeffreview2024-83593/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003estaff\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 05 Oct 2024 14:56:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83593\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eSTRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/strangeharvestinterview2024-83592/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;STRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/strangeharvestinterview2024-83592/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey friends. Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Peter: Bless You. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Stuart: Thank you.  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for? \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/skdaleinterview2024subservience-83589/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 14 Sep 2024 13:57:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83589\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eTHE 4:30 MOVIE's Cast Speaks About Kevin Smith's New Comedy\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;McEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith\u0026amp;#39;s THE 4:30 MOVIE\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026amp;A following the screening.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

Barbarella here. It feels a little wrong that I have a ton of pep today while I’m covering a movie about the very serious topic of suicide, but here we are. Continue makes a personal and powerful statement from writer, director, and star Nadine Crocker, who survived her own suicide attempt in her twenties. In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it. Check out his response and the rest of our conversation! \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Shiloh: That is so sweet. It’s still one of my favorite movies. I loved doing a small movie like that, and all these years later, to do Continue, I think it was maybe the 2nd smallest.

Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.   \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes. While she placed Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzy Bear in the lead roles of Calhoun (Corin Nemec), Pandora (Heather Graham), and Hester (Brielle Robillard), I took a completely different approach, thinking it would be fun to have Statler and\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/audreycummingsinterview2024placeofbones-83585/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eThu, 22 Aug 2024 23:29:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83585\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003e#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/all-my-friends-are-dead-interview-83584/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn talk to McEric about the new slasher comedy!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/all-my-friends-are-dead-interview-83584/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=reviews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face.

\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/amazon-mgm-revives-the-legendary-studio-united-art-83578/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eHouseOfMacleod\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eSat, 27 Jul 2024 01:22:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83578\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eFanhome Launches The Legends of Batman Collection\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Fanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=comics\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hello all!\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; So, if you're like me, you love Batman. Who doesn't? However, when it comes down to reading his myriad adventures, where should one start? \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Batman has been a hero in pages and on screens for over 85 years, so it's hard to jump into his exploits without a guiding hand to navigate the most important formative stories. To this end Fanhome, a subscription-based model and collectible service, has launched a new collection called The Legends of Batman Graphic Novel Collection.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/shanedaxtaylorinterview2024murdercompany-83575/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Finish the article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u003c/description\u003e\u003cdc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\u003eBarbarella\u003c/dc:creator\u003e\u003cpubDate\u003eFri, 12 Jul 2024 01:44:00 +0000\u003c/pubDate\u003e\u003cguid\u003e83575\u003c/guid\u003e\u003c/item\u003e\u003citem\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eIt May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!\u003c/title\u003e\u003clink\u003ehttps://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u003c/link\u003e\u003cdescription\u003e\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It May Only be July, but Here\u0026amp;#39;s a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026amp;utm_medium=feed\u0026amp;utm_term=coolnews\u0026amp;utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Read the full article on AICN\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hey friends, Barbarella here.

The worst kids in the community participating in a church activity; what could go wrong? It’s hard to say from the trailer if this movie, starring Judy Greer, Pete Holmes, Molly Belle Wright, and Lauren Graham, is going to be just another sappy Christmas story or something memorable to add to one's annual holiday movie rotation.

A lot of invites to screen films, read books, watch documentaries, talk to strangers. A lot. I can’t answer them all, sadly. But when I got an email that said there was a new film coming out with Chuck Norris and Marc Singer, and would I like to talk to Marc Singer about it, I practically broke the sound barrier with my swift response of “hell to the yes!”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; I’m a man of a certain age, and I grew up in the wilds of Southeast Texas.

Concrete jungle films didn’t interest me quite as much as actual jungle films, so if you wanted my ticket money, throw an animal or two in your film. Want to see Clint Eastwood act with a monkey? Hell yes, take my money.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; So for me there was no greater action franchise than the BEASTMASTER films starring Marc Singer. The Sword \u0026amp; Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another.

One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads:\u003cbr\u003e Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too.\u003cbr\u003e I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/touch-me-sundance-midnight-83602/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e McEricTue, 31 Dec 2024 01:37:00 +000083601James Fox Discusses His Documentary THE PROGRAMhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-james-fox-the-program-uap-reports-83600/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u003cp\u003eEric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers\u0026#39;s latest film, NOSFERATU.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/nosferatu-review-eric-mcclanahan-83601/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWouldst thou like to live immortally?\u003cbr\u003e Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow.

Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien.

For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows:\u003cbr\u003e Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity.

Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death. \u003cbr\u003e Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both!\u003cbr\u003e Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/michaeljohnwarreninterview2024freediver-83598/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e McEricSat, 30 Nov 2024 08:54:00 +000083597Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley on Writing/Directing DEVONhttps://www.aintitcool.com/jenni-jwoww-farley-interview-devon-83596/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u003cp\u003eTim Sheridan chats about Alan Scott: Green Lantern, Superman: Man of Tomorrow, Batman: The Long Halloween, and adapting legacy stories to small and large screens.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/tim-sheridan-alan-scott-green-lantern-interview-83597/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=comics\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e This interview is different. This subject I hunted down.

I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment.

Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie.

One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances.

That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015).\u003cbr\u003e Yes, I said puppetry.

Check it out!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff.\u003cbr\u003e Peter: Bless You. \u003cbr\u003e Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that. \u003cbr\u003e Stuart: Thank you.  \u003cbr\u003e Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for? \u003cbr\u003e Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles.

Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/skdaleinterview2024subservience-83589/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e McEricFri, 13 Sep 2024 00:11:00 +000083588Shiloh Fernandez Discusses Working With Nadine Crocker on CONTINUEhttps://www.aintitcool.com/shilohfernandezinterview2024continue-83586/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u003cp\u003eMcEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith\u0026#39;s THE 4:30 MOVIE\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/interview-cast-new-kevin-smith-film-83588/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWriter/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film. \u003cbr\u003e Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it.

Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.   \u003cbr\u003e I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes.

We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine. \u003cbr\u003e Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year.

reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios.\u003cbr\u003e Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen.\u003cbr\u003e After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few. \u003cbr\u003e Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/amazon-mgm-revives-the-legendary-studio-united-art-83578/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e McEricSat, 20 Jul 2024 18:02:00 +000083577Exclusive Clip from THE MANDELA EFFECT PHENOMENON!!https://www.aintitcool.com/mandelaeffectclip2024-83576/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u003cp\u003eFanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/fanhome-legends-of-batman-collection-83577/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=comics\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHello all!\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e So, if you're like me, you love Batman.

From Year Zero to Year 100, this collection promises to tell the most definitive stories of the Caped Crusader in beautifully reproduced glossy hardcovers, each with bonus content such as variant covers, concept art, and creator notes.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e \"From the moment Bruce Wayne becomes The Caped Crusader to his final days in the future, this collection brings together essential Batman tales in a book series that belongs on every bookshelf.\"\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e New volumes arrive monthly, and the series is MASSIVE. From the collected spines one can see that we'll witness the Joker's origin, the Death in the Family, the Breaking of the Bat, and the formation and expansion of the Bat Family.

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/shanedaxtaylorinterview2024murdercompany-83575/?utm_source=inside-bottom\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinish the article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e BarbarellaMon, 01 Jul 2024 22:46:00 +000083574Marc Singer talks AGENT RECONhttps://www.aintitcool.com/marc-singer-interview-agent-recon-eric-mcclanahan-83573/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviews\u003cp\u003eIt May Only be July, but Here\u0026#39;s a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.aintitcool.com/bestchristmaspageantevertrailer2024-83574/?utm_source=inside-top\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnews\u0026utm_campaign=1310_RSS\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eRead the full article on AICN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHey friends, Barbarella here.

One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world.

Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN McEricFri, 27 Dec 2024 19:50:00 +000083600BLOODY AXE WOUND is a Bloody Good Time!https://www.aintitcool.com/bloody-axe-wound-hilarie-burton-morgan-interview-83599/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsFilmmaker James Fox discusses his new documentary THE PROGRAM which examines the United States government's pre-existing relationship with UAPs.

Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Read the full article on AICN Everything about film has changed, and while some lambast this brave new world, it does have its silver linings. Streaming services took over channels and then became their own studios. For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows: Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction.  The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity.

Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni!

Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that.

If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 05 Oct 2024 02:02:00 +000083592Kevin Smith Talks THE 4:30 MOVIEhttps://www.aintitcool.com/kevin-smith-interview-eric-mcclanahan-430-movie-83591/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsSTRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!

The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate.

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN McEricFri, 13 Sep 2024 00:11:00 +000083588Shiloh Fernandez Discusses Working With Nadine Crocker on CONTINUEhttps://www.aintitcool.com/shilohfernandezinterview2024continue-83586/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsMcEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.   Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.    I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.   I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes.

One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.  Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.” The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.   Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

Read the full article on AICN In perhaps the most shocking story to come out of this year's otherwise short-on news panel from Marvel Studios, Robert Downey Jr is returning to the MCU. It has just been announced that he has been cast as none other than the great green dictator Doctor Doom. Taking to the stage Downey Jr had this to say: \"New mask, same task...What can I tell ya, I like playing complicated characters.\" Whether or not he’ll be the genuine Earth 616 version or the Doom from the alternate Universe Fantastic Four: First Steps seems to be set in remains to be seen. Either way, welcome back to the fold RDJ. The panel revealed that Downey Jr’s Doom would make his presence known in the freshly titled Avengers: Doomsday which has a release date of May 2026 with Avengers: Secret Wars following in May 2027.  Let us know what you think of this curveball in the comments down below!

The Max panel from HBO has just unveiled the second trailer for its forthcoming original limited series The Penguin starring Academy Award Nominee Colin Farrell, Cristin Milioti, Rhenzi Feliz and Clancy Brown.

Created by showrunner Lauren LeFranc and Directed by Craig Zobel, The Penguin premiers on September 19 exclusively on Max.

Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:   “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films Finish the article on AICN McEricSat, 20 Jul 2024 18:02:00 +000083577Exclusive Clip from THE MANDELA EFFECT PHENOMENON!!https://www.aintitcool.com/mandelaeffectclip2024-83576/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsFanhome, a subscription-based models and collections service, launches a Batman collection for the ages. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!   So, if you're like me, you love Batman. Who doesn't? However, when it comes down to reading his myriad adventures, where should one start?  Batman has been a hero in pages and on screens for over 85 years, so it's hard to jump into his exploits without a guiding hand to navigate the most important formative stories. To this end Fanhome, a subscription-based model and collectible service, has launched a new collection called The Legends of Batman Graphic Novel Collection. From Year Zero to Year 100, this collection promises to tell the most definitive stories of the Caped Crusader in beautifully reproduced glossy hardcovers, each with bonus content such as variant covers, concept art, and creator notes.   \"From the moment Bruce Wayne becomes The Caped Crusader to his final days in the future, this collection brings together essential Batman tales in a book series that belongs on every bookshelf.\"   New volumes arrive monthly, and the series is MASSIVE. From the collected spines one can see that we'll witness the Joker's origin, the Death in the Family, the Breaking of the Bat, and the formation and expansion of the Bat Family. This looks to be an amazing collection for fans of the Bat new and established, young and old.    To find out how to order, check out https://www.fanhome.com/us/movie-series/legends-batman-graphic-novels   Check it out and stay tuned for more info! -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan- Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaFri, 12 Jul 2024 16:09:00 +000083576Shane Dax Taylor Talks MURDER COMPANYhttps://www.aintitcool.com/shanedaxtaylorinterview2024murdercompany-83575/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsExclusive Clip from THE MANDELA EFFECT PHENOMENON!!

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories? I understand that it seems a good way to develop characters, but it drives me crazy every time anyone has a conversation at a normal volume as if they’re just strolling through the Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaMon, 01 Jul 2024 22:46:00 +000083574Marc Singer talks AGENT RECONhttps://www.aintitcool.com/marc-singer-interview-agent-recon-eric-mcclanahan-83573/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsIt May Only be July, but Here's a Trailer for THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. I know it’s way too early to start thinking about Christmas, but we have a trailer to share with you for a Christmas movie! Please forgive us. The Best Christmas Pageant Ever comes to theaters November 8.  Based on Barbara Robinson’s beloved book, the story centers on the Herdmans as they take over their local church pageant. The worst kids in the community participating in a church activity; what could go wrong? It’s hard to say from the trailer if this movie, starring Judy Greer, Pete Holmes, Molly Belle Wright, and Lauren Graham, is going to be just another sappy Christmas story or something memorable to add to one's annual holiday movie rotation. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.

Read the full article on AICN I get a lot of emails. A lot of invites to screen films, read books, watch documentaries, talk to strangers. A lot. I can’t answer them all, sadly. But when I got an email that said there was a new film coming out with Chuck Norris and Marc Singer, and would I like to talk to Marc Singer about it, I practically broke the sound barrier with my swift response of “hell to the yes!”     I’m a man of a certain age, and I grew up in the wilds of Southeast Texas. As I recall my rough and tumble childhood, I don’t say I’m from the streets - I’m from the roads. Concrete jungle films didn’t interest me quite as much as actual jungle films, so if you wanted my ticket money, throw an animal or two in your film. Want to see Clint Eastwood act with a monkey? Hell yes, take my money.   So for me there was no greater action franchise than the BEASTMASTER films starring Marc Singer. The Sword \u0026 Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another. While CONAN THE BARBARIAN was the box office victor, and probably stands the test of the time more defiantly, I take some pleasure in knowing that it made four times the box office draw of BEASTMASTER at the Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaWed, 05 Jun 2024 21:25:00 +000083572",

One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry behind its fantastical elements, and the power of dance. TOUCH ME will have its world premiere at Sundance on Tuesday, January 28th at 10:15pm. The film will screen a total of five times over the course of the festival and hopefully will find wide release shortly after its festival run. Many thanks to the team at TOUCH ME for chatting with me and trust me when I say that you have to see this movie to believe it.  Until next time, take care! -McEric, aka Eric McClanahan-",
