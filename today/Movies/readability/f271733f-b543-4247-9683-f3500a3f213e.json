  "text": "Horror films still offer a path to profitability on low budgets that no other genre can claim, which is why even the most squeamish filmmakers should celebrate the remarkable box-office success demonstrated by Damien Leone’s gory saga of the depraved Art the Clown. The “Terrifier” franchise began in 2016 with a $35,000 budget — but the series quickly developed a passionate following for its stomach-churning practical effects and the instantly iconic villain. Eight years later and “Terrifier 3” became the #1 movie in America with a $27 million opening weekend. Much of the credit goes to Cineverse, the distributor that has steadily expanded the series’ reach. Anyone who wants to learn from the “Terrifier 3” phenomenon won’t want to miss IndieWire’s Future of Filmmaking Summit on November 2. On their panel “Turning Low-Budget Horror Into Box-Office Hits,” Cineverse executive director of acquisitions Brandon Hill and Chief Content Officer and head of digital sales Yolanda Macias will join IndieWire for a discussion about the lessons they learned from the franchise’s exponential growth and what it might mean for the future of independent horror movies. Macias and Hill each have decades of experience in the distribution space and have worked on thousands of titles. They’ll share their insights on the state of the industry and the process that led them to invest in both “Terrifier 2” and “Terrifier 3.” Attendees will also have the opportunity to network with industry peers, exchange ideas, and spark inspiration throughout the whole summit. With a premium breakfast, lunch, and cocktail reception included, this is more than just a day of learning — it’s a chance to form meaningful connections that could shape the future of your next project. Don’t miss your chance to join this forward-looking conversation and position yourself for success in the ever-changing world of entertainment.    Buy Your Tickets to the Future of Filmmaking Summit Here  Panels will include:   Keynote Chat: Sean Baker Award-winning auteur Sean Baker will deliver our Future of Filmmaking Summit’s keynote chat.
