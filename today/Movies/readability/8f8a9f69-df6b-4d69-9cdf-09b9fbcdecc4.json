  "text": "Jeri Taylor, the Emmy-nominated scribe, producer, director and showrunner behind Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Voyager (which she co-created), has died. She was 86. “My mother succeeded in a male-dominated industry,” her son Andrew Enberg said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, “but she did it without being super aggressive. She did it with compassion and kindness. She was like a den mother to everyone.” The industry veteran died Oct. 24 of natural causes at an assisted living facility in Davis, Calif., Enberg said. Watch on Deadline Throughout her decades-long career, Taylor spent more than ten years bringing to life episodes set within the Star Trek universe. In 1990, she began writing for Next Generation Season 4, eventually working her way up to co-executive producer in Season 6. She was the showrunner of the Patrick Stewart vehicle in its seventh and final installment, for which she garnered an Emmy nom for Outstanding Drama Series. Afterward, Taylor co-created Voyager alongside Next Generation co-EPs Rick Berman and Michael Pillar, serving as showrunner from 1995 through 1998 and later creative consultant for its final three seasons. She pioneered the idea of a female lead captain in the franchise with actress Kate Mulgrew. In a tribute post on X, Mulgrew wrote that Taylor was “responsible, in large part, for changing my life. She was elegant, erudite, and fiercely opinionated. She wanted Kathryn Janeway to be a significant part of her legacy and I think there is no doubt that in that endeavor she succeeded.” “I owe her a debt of gratitude. May she rest in peace,” she concluded. In total, Taylor penned 30 episodes within the Star Trek universe. Per StarTrek.com, she was most proud of contributing fan-favorite Next Generation episode “The Drumhead.” She also wrote three Star Trek novels for Pocket Books. Prior to her contributions to the galaxy, Taylor wrote and produced episodes of popular network procedurals like Quincy, Magnum, P.I., Jake and the Fatman and In the Heat of the Night. She also wrote on episodes of Little House on the Prairie, The Incredible Hulk and received a story by credit on three episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Taylor also co-wrote the CBS primetime movie, A Place to Call Home. Born June 30, 1938 in Evansville, Ind., Taylor graduated from Indiana University with a major in English. She received her master’s degree from CSUN and began her foray into Hollywood through an acting workshop in Los Angeles, where she directed local stage productions before transitioning to screenwriting before the ’80s. Graphic designer Michael Okuda, best known for designing the computer interfaces on the Starfleet called “okudagrams,” said in a remembrance post, “The world of Star Trek lost one of its giants yesterday with the passing of writer-producer Jeri Taylor … Jeri brought humanity and compassion to her work and to Star Trek,” adding, “Working for Jeri Taylor was always a delight. She always welcomed ideas and suggestions, even from designers in the art department. She was thoughtful and warm, and she always made us feel like we were an important part of her team.” Brannon Braga, who inherited Taylor’s showrunning duties on Voyager, wrote on Instagram, “She was a great writer and showrunner and, to me, a cherished mentor. Jeri was generous with her wisdom and her time, she nurtured an entire staff of young writers which is a testament to her patience. I would not have a career without Jeri’s intricate guidance. She taught us all so much. Her memory will live on in many ways, but perhaps most of all in the character of Captain Janeway, who reflected the best dimensions of Jeri herself. Jeri Taylor, we were lucky to know you.” Star Trek: Discovery co-creator Bryan Fuller wrote, “O, CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN FAREWELL JERI TAYLOR, PIONEERING CO-CREATOR OF #STARTREKVOYAGER, MY FIRST SHOWRUNNER BOSS AND THE KINDEST.” Voyager actor Robert Picardo shared, “What a wonderful person to work with ! Jeri Taylor was the beating heart of @StarTrek #Voyager ‘s groundbreaking #CaptainJaneway character. I will miss her. My condolences to her family.”",
