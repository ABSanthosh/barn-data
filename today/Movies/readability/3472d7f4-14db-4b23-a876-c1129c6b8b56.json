The Snack Wrap was discontinued in 2016 from US McDonald’s menus due to the long cooking hours associated with the food item. However, the fast food chain has now decided to provide its US customers with the option to purchase it again. Here are all the details regarding when the Snack Wrap is going to launch. When is McDonald’s launching Snack Wrap? In a recent post made by McDonald’s on X (formerly Twitter), the fast food chain teased that Snack Wraps will be back in 2025. However, they kept the exact date a mystery. The post read, “snack wraps xx.xx.2025.” This post unleashed quite a storm on social media as many users went on to bombard the comment section under the post. Additionally, Joe Erlinger, the president of the United States’ McDonald’s chain, revealed the good news on Good Morning America, where he said, “The Snack Wrap will be back in 2025. It has a cult following. I get so many emails into my inbox about this product. It will be back in 2025. I’m not going to tell you exactly when in 2025 for competitive reasons.” Guillaume Huin, who is the senior marketing manager of US McDonald’s also took to X (formerly Twitter) and wrote, “If you ever wonder if your posts here matter, if they have an impact, if we even care, let me tell you something, you and you only with your countless posts and requests and petitions made it happen. They were in all our meetings, all our discussions, every single powerpoint to make a case for it. You won, snack wrap fans. Thank you.” Huin highlighted how fans of the item started a petition on Change.org to bring back the iconic Snack Wrap in 2021 which garnered more than 17,000 signatures.",
