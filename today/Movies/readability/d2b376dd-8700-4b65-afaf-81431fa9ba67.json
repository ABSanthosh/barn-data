Have fun. Here's the official trailer for Mike Young's comedy film Stealing Jokes, direct from FDM's YouTube: Stealing Jokes centers on a comedian and his friends who, after setting out on a comedy tour, get bilked out of their promised fees on the first night. They decide to rob the venue, leading to a heist involving the underworld of the comedy scene. Stealing Jokes is a comedy written and directed by American comedian / indie filmmaker Mike Young, director of the other very tiny indie films My Man is a Loser and A Stand Up Guy previously. Produced by Jeremy Alter and Michael Manasseri. It was filmed mostly in Detroit. THR adds: \"The release is timed to the start of Young's Rocket Comedy tour, which launches its 25-city run in Phoenix on October 11th. Young and the roster of comedians will end the tour in Detroit.\" Freestyle Digital Media will release Stealing Jokes direct-to-VOD starting November 1st, 2024 this fall. Anyone into this?
