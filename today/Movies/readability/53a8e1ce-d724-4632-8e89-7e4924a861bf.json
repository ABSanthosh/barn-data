  "text": "Tom Segura is offering the first unhinged glimpse inside his mind through his upcoming series. In the teaser for his new six-part Netflix comedy series Bad Thoughts, which he debuted Saturday at his sold-out Madison Square Garden show, the comedian presents his dark and twisted musings through a genre-bending cinematic alternate universe. Premiering May 13 on the streamer, Bad Thoughts is described as Black Mirror meets Chappelle’s Show. The first teaser promises an alien invasion, black ops snipers, radicalized elementary schoolers, a bloody kitchen showdown, a hideous deformity and penis envy, all presented with some quality cinematic flare. Last April, Deadline reported that Segura had self-financed, produced and sold the then-untitled pilot to Netflix, noting that he also serves as narrator in the show, which will see him take the viewer through a series of vignettes in each episode. The twisted comedic sensibility of his standup is the core DNA of this series, where every story will unfold in a hilariously disturbing way only he could imagine.  Watch on Deadline Segura’s first scripted series for Netflix comes after he filmed five standup specials for the streaming platform, including Completely Normal (2014), Mostly Stories (2016), Disgraceful (2018), Ball Hog (2020) and Sledgehammer (2023).",
