  "text": "Fans are curious to find out whether Netflix has announced the release date for Evil Season 4. The latest season of the supernatural drama originally premiered on Paramount+ on May 23, 2024. Created by Robert and Michelle King, the series follows Kristen Bouchard, David Acosta, and Ben as they collaborate to investigate and solve mysteries that challenge faith and science. Given that the series’ previous seasons are now available on the streaming giant, many are eager to know when Season 4 will drop. So, here are the details. When could Evil Season 4 start streaming on Netflix? There are no confirmed dates for Evil Season 4’s arrival on Netflix. However, many reports indicate that it might drop in late 2025. Evil Season 1 initially premiered on CBS in 2019, but later seasons transitioned to Paramount+. While all four seasons are currently available to stream on that network, most U.S. viewers are waiting for its arrival on Netflix. In September 2020, CBS made Season 1 available on Netflix to reach a larger audience and build anticipation for future installments. The deal was temporary, leading to the show leaving Netflix sooner than expected. However, in April 2024, Seasons 1 and 2 returned to Netflix under a new agreement. Additionally, Season 3 joined the platform on December 31, 2024. With three seasons already available for binge-watching on Netflix, audiences are eager to know when Season 4 will follow. According to speculations, Season 3 — which originally aired in June 2022 on Paramount+ — made its way to Netflix almost 28-29 months after its finale. This means it took nearly two and a half years to arrive. However, it’s unlikely that Season 4 will take that long. There was only an eight-month gap between the Netflix release of the first two seasons and the third season. If this pattern continues, Season 4 could release in late 2025 or even earlier. Nevertheless, Netflix needs to make an official announcement.",
