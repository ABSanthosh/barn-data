  "text": "During an event held by Universal Pictures in honor of Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning director shared the next movie genre he wants to make. Spielberg is best known for his work on sci-fi action movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, War of the Worlds, Ready Player One, and the Jurassic Park movies. What’s next for Steven Spielberg? In a recent interview, Spielberg expressed his desire to direct a Western movie. Even though the acclaimed filmmaker hasn’t directed one, he did previously produce a Western miniseries in 2005 titled Into the West. However, some fans may argue that Spielberg’s Indiana Jones franchise could also be considered action-adventure movies with Western influences. “[I still have] an appetite for a Western, which I will someday hopefully do. It’s something that’s eluded me for all of these decades,” Spielberg revealed. The award-winning filmmaker had just wrapped up the production on his sci-fi project, which is being described as an untitled UFO movie. It is directed by Spielberg from a screenplay written by Jurassic Park scribe David Koepp, based on a story by the Oscar-winning filmmaker. The ensemble cast includes Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Wyatt Russell (Thunderbolts*), Josh O’Connor (The Crown), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Colin Firth (The King’s Speech), Eve Hewson (The Perfect Couple), and Noah Robbins (Fly Me to the Moon). It is produced by Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger for Amblin Entertainment, along with Chris Brigham. This will be Spielberg’s latest directorial feature project since helming 2022’s The Fabelmans, which was loosely based on his early life. Aside from directing, Spielberg is also serving as a producer on a number of upcoming projects, including Universal Pictures’ Jurassic World Rebirth movie with Scarlett Johansson, Netflix’s The Thursday Murder Club movie with Pierce Brosnan, and Apple TV+’s Cape Fear series with Amy Adams.
