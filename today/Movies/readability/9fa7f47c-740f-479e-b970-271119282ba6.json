  "text": "The recent release of Denise Richards and Her Wild Things has put the spotlight back on the Wild Things star, as she documents the daily struggles of her life as an actress and a mother in the reality show. With the recent appearance of Brooke Mueller on the series, fans are curious regarding her equation with Denise Richards, especially since they both were previously married to Charlie Sheen. So, here’s everything you need to know regarding the dynamics between the two actresses. Are Denise Richards and Brooke Mueller friends? As conveyed by Denise Richards, she and Brooke Mueller share a remarkable bond with one another. The veteran actress even invited Mueller to feature in her reality show on March 4, where the duo embarked on a picnic in Malibu alongside the former’s family. Explaining her decision to include the Witchouse star, Richards stated on the Bravo show, “I wanted to include Brooke, Charlie’s other ex-wife. There’s a lot of history there. Her sons are my daughters’ brothers. We are a big, blended family.” Prior to exchanging vows with Brooke Mueller, Charlie Sheen was in a long-term relationship with Denise Richards. The pair were married from 2002 to 2006 and even welcomed two daughters in the period. After their separation, the Two and a Half Men actor began dating Mueller and the two eventually tied the knot in 2008. Their union bore two sons and ultimately ended in November 2010. With both Sheen and Mueller battling addiction, Denise Richards received temporary custody of their children in 2013. Moreover, Brooke Mueller has expressed gratitude for Richards’ help with her kids. Praising their friendship, she publicly thanked the latter on the Hollywood Raw podcast in September 2024, for “stepping up” and being “very helpful.” Mueller even acknowledged Richards’ support during her journey toward sobriety. In an earlier interview with US Weekly, Richards shed further light on her relationship with Mueller and her kids, noting, “It’s a blended family, and there were times things were not great with their dad, and then him and Brooke, and then me and Brooke. It’s always up and down, so I always try to keep it as harmonious as possible. When it’s peaceful and great, we’ll take it and it’s good. It’s really good right now.”",
