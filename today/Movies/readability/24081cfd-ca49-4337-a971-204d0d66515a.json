  "text": "The 56th NAACP Image Awards have officially kicked off with Ayo Edebiri, Keke Palmer, Marlon Wayans and Jamie Foxx among the first set of winners during the pre-awards ceremony. The two-night virtual event streams on the NAACP Image Awards YouTube channel, with night one hosted By Angel “ThatChickAngel” Laketa Moore and Marcus Tanksley. A handful of awards were presented including Edebiri for outstanding breakthrough creative for television for FX’s “The Bear”; Palmer as host of NBC’s “Password”; Marlon Wayans for his guest performance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air”; and Foxx’s Netflix comedy special “What Had Happened Was,” as well as film and TV writing and directing honors; numerous short film prizes; and winners in the literary categories. Taraji P. Henson won two Image Awards: one for outstanding supporting actress in a limited television series, special or movie for Peacock’s “Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist” (her co-star Samuel L. Jackson picked up the supporting actor prize) and as the author of the children’s book “You Can Be a Good Friend (No Matter What!): A Lil TJ Book.” Popular on Variety MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid also won two awards for her show “The Reidout” (outstanding news/information series or special) and as the author of the biography “Medgar and Myrlie: Medgar Evers and the Love Story That Awakened America.” The hit YouTube series “Gracie’s Corner” picked up two prizes (outstanding children’s program and outstanding animated series). Leah Sava Jeffries, star of “Percy Jackson and the Olympics” on Disney+, won the award for outstanding performance in the TV categories, while Cree Summer, who was also nominated for outstanding guest performance for “Abbott Elementary,” took home the Image Award for outstanding voiceover performance on television for her work on Nickelodeon’s “Rugrats.” The 56th Image Awards broadcast will take place on Feb. 22, airing live from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on BET and CBS. Special honorees include Vice President Kamala Harris, who will receive the Chairman’s Award; trailblazing comedian Dave Chappelle, who will be awarded the President’s Award; and the Wayans family — namely Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. — who will be inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame. Jotaka Eaddy, founder and CEO of #WinWithBlackWomen, and Essence Communications will receive special awards at the Creative Honors ceremony on Feb. 21. This year, the Image Awards broadcast will be extended by 30 minutes to two and a half hours, with the ceremony also used to drive support for the Altadena, Pacific Palisades and Pasadena communities affected by the recent wildfires. BET Media Group, NAACP, Johnson Shapiro Slewett \u0026 Kole and WME partnered with L.A. County and collaborated with local community organizations, including Community Aid Dena, Altadena Heritage and WalkGood LA, to launch the Altadena Community Preservation Fund, which is aimed at protecting homeowners from displacement and preserving the community’s cultural heritage.
