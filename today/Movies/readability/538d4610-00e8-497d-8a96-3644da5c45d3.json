  "description": "\"What if it's a trap?\" Indeed what if it is? Marvel has revealed another new 60-second promo trailer for the MCU sequel Captain America: Brave New World - hitting theaters February 14th, 2025 in exactly two months. Almost time! From director Julius Onah comes the next Captain America evolution – Anthony Mackie stars as Sam Wilson, who has taken over as the new Cap from Steve Rogers after he retired at the end of the Avengers movies. Brave New World picks up with Harrison Ford as the US president, with the power dynamics in the world changing (a meta reference for sure). After an attack, Cap is asked to join the military - but he ends up in the middle of another international incident. The conspiracy noir side of this is the best part – but they're downplaying it now. The impressive cast includes Giancarlo Esposito, Danny Ramirez as a young Falcon, Carl Lumbly, Tim Blake Nelson as The Leader, Shira Haas, Liv Tyler, Xosha Roquemore; plus an appearance by a Red Hulk, played by Harrison Ford. This looks like it might be entertaining, but it also seems like yet another generic Marvel movie and that's not so exciting anymore. […]",
