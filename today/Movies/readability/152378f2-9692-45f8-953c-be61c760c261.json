  "text": "Ed Sheeran, the Weeknd and Drake are just a few of the artists topping Apple Music‘s Top 500 Streamed Songs list, honoring 10 years of the streaming service. Sheeran’s “Shape of You” is the most-streamed song on the tally, which Apple has been rolling out in batches by the hundred throughout the week. As the No. 1 most-played song globally, “Shape of You” had over 1,000 days where the song reached No. 1 on the all-genre Top Songs chart in at least one country, and upon release, it broke the record for biggest pop song in Apple Music history in worldwide first-day streams. At No. 2, the Weeknd‘s “Blinding Lights” spent more than 180 days in the top 10 of the Global Daily Top 100. The Weeknd has the most R\u0026B/soul songs on the chart with nine entries. Behind him is Drake with “God’s Plan” at No. 3, which was streamed more than any other hip-hop song in Apple Music history. Across the list of songs, Drake has more entries than any other artist, with 27 songs making the tally. Popular on Variety Post Malone has songs at Nos. 4 and 5: “Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse)” featuring Swae Lee and “Rockstar” featuring 21 Savage, respectively. Rounding out the rest of the top 10 are Drake’s “One Dance,” Travis Scott’s “Sicko Mode,” Sheeran’s “Perfect,” Chris Brown’s “No Guidance” and Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy.” Other notable entries on the Top 500 Streamed Songs list include Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which is the only holiday song to make the cut at No. 100. Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” which bows at No. 60, is the highest-ranking country song, while Eilish has the most alternative songs with nine. Taylor Swift is the No. 2 artist by number of songs (14 entries), with “Cruel Summer” as her highest-charting at No. 57. Check out the full list over at Apple Music.",
