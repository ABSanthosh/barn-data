  "text": "Wondering what happened to New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy III? The fourth-year player was in the midst of a breakout season before suffering a significant shoulder injury. His performance had been a bright spot for the struggling Pelicans, making his absence a major setback. Here’s what to know about Murphy’s injury, his career-best season, and what it means for New Orleans moving forward. What happened to Trey Murphy III? The Pelicans ruled out forward Trey Murphy III for the season after he suffered a torn labrum and partial tear of the rotator cuff in his right shoulder. Murphy dislocated his shoulder in the first quarter of Monday’s 127-81 loss to the Pistons while diving for a loose ball. He played only one minute before exiting. The Pelicans confirmed the diagnosis after further examination. Murphy was in the midst of a career-best season, averaging 21.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 3.6 assists in 52 games while shooting 45.4% from the field and 36.1% from three-point range on 8.4 attempts per game (via NBA). His scoring average marked a 6.4-point increase from last season. He also recorded his third straight season with at least 150 made three-pointers. The Pelicans have stated that updates on his recovery will be provided when appropriate. The 6-foot-8 forward had solidified himself as a key player for New Orleans, excelling as a 3-and-D wing. Last October, Murphy signed a four-year, $112 million rookie contract extension with the Pelicans. He had increased his role significantly this season after primarily coming off the bench in his previous years. The Pelicans have struggled with injuries throughout the season and currently hold an 18-51 record with 13 games remaining. They have been out of playoff contention for an extended period. Murphy’s absence further compounds the team’s difficulties in an already challenging season.",
