How you want to say who you are.\" Transmission Films from Australia has posted the official UK trailer for the documentary film titled Twiggy, which is out in cinemas in the UK and soon Oz. This first premiered at the 2024 London Film Festival last year, and it also played at the Thessaloniki Doc Festival earlier this year. This is the tell-all doc about the real story of the greatest \"IT\" girl – known as Twiggy – and all she's been through. She was initially born as Lesley Hornby in a working-class London home, but when she changed her name to \"Twiggy\" as a teenager, she became the world's first international supermodel almost overnight. Twiggy was the iconic face of 1960s Swingin' London – a period when fashion and music changed the whole world forever. With her androgynous look \u0026 giant eyes, she might as well have landed from another planet, and that was pretty much the effect she had on all the media.

Catch this doc whenever it opens. Here's the official UK trailer (+ poster) for Sadie Frost's doc film Twiggy, direct from YouTube: This documentary focuses on the life of the greatest \"It Girl\" of all time: Dame Twiggy Lawson. It's the first time Twiggy has ever told her story first-hand. Discovered at 16 and proclaimed as \"the face of '66\" by Daily Express journalist Deirdre McSharry, the model became an overnight sensation. The world saw her grace the covers of Vogue and Tatler by 17, and the New Yorker magazine devoted nearly 100 pages to the Twiggy \"phenomenon\" after her arrival in NY. Twiggy shook the world by giving women a whole new look and feel to aspire to. Twiggy brought an elfin androgyny to the forefront and helped revolutionize the accepted image of the female form, giving a voice to a whole new generation of women. Twiggy is directed by British designer / producer / filmmaker Sadie Frost, director of the film Quant as well as a producer on many others. Produced by Nick Hamson and Simon Jones. This initially premiered at the 2024 London Film Festival last year. And it already opened in UK cinemas earlier in the year - more info here. Anyone curious?
