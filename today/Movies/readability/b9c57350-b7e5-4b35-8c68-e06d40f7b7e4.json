  "text": "HBO and the newly re-minted HBO Max have announced what the Emmy submissions are for the final season of cult favorite “The Righteous Gemstones” and the premiere season of the sprawling TV spin-off “Dune: Prophecy” to IndieWire exclusively. The entries include Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series, respectively. The former series, created by and starring Danny McBride, has the HBO all star up for consideration for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series alongside Emmy winner John Goodman, who plays the patriarch on the series about a world-famous televangelist family. Rounding out the rest of the family members are Edi Patterson for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Adam DeVine, Tim Baltz, and Walton Goggins for Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, and Cassidy Freeman and Jennifer Nettles for Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Arden Myrin will be submitted for Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in the third episode of Season 4, titled “To Grieve Like The Rest Of Men Who Have No Hope,” while Bradley Cooper will be submitted for Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, for his starring turn in the Season 4 premiere “Prelude” set entirely in the Civil War. Cooper’s episode, which reveals how preaching became the Gemstones’ family business, will be submitted in several categories, with McBride also in consideration for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series alongside John Carcieri and Jeff Fradley. Other submissions for “Prelude” include Cinematography, Picture Editing, Production Design, Period or Fantasy/Sci-Fi Makeup (Non-Prosthetic), Music Composition, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Special Visual Effects, and Stunt Performance, in the categories that apply to comedy and/or half-hour series. Outstanding Casting, Choreography, Contemporary Costumes, Contemporary Hairstyling, Music Supervision, Stunt Coordination, and Stunt Performance for Season 4, Episode 2 as well, are all categories the final season of “The Righteous Gemstones” is also submitting for. As for “Dune: Prophecy,” a prequel series to the Oscar-nominated film franchise helmed by Denis Villeneuve, the actors will be submitting for Emmys consideration as follows: Emily Watson for Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Travis Fimmel for Lead Actor in a Drama Series, Olivia Williams for Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and Mark Strong for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. The show will be submitting two episodes for both Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. First up is the third episode “Sisterhood Above All,” which was directed by Richard J. Lewis, and written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Jordan Goldberg. Next is the sixth episode “The High-Handed Enemy,” directed by Anna Foerster, and written by Elizabeth Padden and Suzanne Wrubel. Below the line, “Dune: Prophecy” will be up for consideration for Outstanding Cinematography (for Episodes 1 and 4,) Picture Editing (for Episodes 5 and 6,) Production Design, Fantasy and Sci-Fi Costumes, Period or Sci-Fi Hairstyling, Period or Fantasy/Sci-Fi Makeup (Non-Prosthetic), Music Composition and Original Main Title Theme Music (both of which were done by recent Oscar winner Volker Bertelmann), Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Special Visual Effects, and Title Design in the categories that apply to drama and/or one hour series.",
