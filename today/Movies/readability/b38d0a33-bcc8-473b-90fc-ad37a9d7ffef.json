Created by filmmaking duo Nicole Daddona \u0026 Adam Wilder, who run a studio called \"Magic Society Pictures\" in New York City together, this short film originally premiered at the 2024 Sundance \u0026 SXSW Film Festivals last year in the Midnight Shorts section. It's now available to watch for free thanks to our friends at Short of the Week. \"Where do your missing socks go?\" This very weird, very dark 8-minute animated short is about a woman known as \"The Bleacher\" who is looking for her missing sock at a laundromat. She gets sucked into the laundry machine then ends up in her own subconscious - where she encounter a very creepy singing dolphin. But, uh, why? Starring the voices of Kate Micucci, Ben Sinclair, \u0026 Sky Elobar. It's best to not try to describe anything else about this, you just have to experience it yourself. And make sense of it on your own. Bravo to Nicole \u0026 Adam for creating something I've never seen before with some of the strangest visuals [‚Ä¶]",

Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on watching this short. Intro via SXSW: \"Frugal Wash, a self-service laundromat, draws a diverse, often unhappy crowd, including Rita Riat, 'The Bleacher'. Rita's hunt for her missing sock spirals into a crisis, suspecting either the oddball patrons or the faulty machines. Her search leads her inside a washing machine, plunging her into her subconscious. She encounters a dolphin-man in a limbo of lost socks. Their surreal interaction, a mix of seduction and discovery, distorts reality, revealing the stark truth behind Rita's life and the crucial, blood-stained sock she must recover.\" The Bleacher is written and directed by very unique filmmakers Nicole Daddona and Adam Wilder - together they run \"Magic Society Pictures\" based in NYC.
