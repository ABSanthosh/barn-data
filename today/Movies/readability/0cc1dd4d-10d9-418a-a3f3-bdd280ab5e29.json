  "text": "Netflix has given a green light to Boyfriend On Demand (working title), a new romantic comedy series starring Blackpink’s Jisoo and Seo In-guk (Doom at Your Service, Café Minamdang). Production has begun on the series which revolves around exhausted webtoon producer Mi-rae (Jisoo) who escapes reality through a subscription-based virtual dating simulation program, where she meets the boyfriends of her dreams. Blending the relatable challenges of daily work life and a never-before-seen virtual reality dating subscription program, Boyfriend on Demand (WT) promises to revolutionize dating. Jisoo plays Seo Mi-rae, who longs for a second chance at love in virtual reality. Accustomed to a nonexistent dating life due to her hectic schedule, Mi-rae receives a ‘Monthly Boyfriend’ device by chance. Entering this virtual reality, she encounters unrealistically perfect boyfriends, awakening her dormant desires for romance. Watch on Deadline Seo In-guk portrays Park Kyeong-nam, Mi-rae’s colleague and rival webtoon producer. He’s capable and competent at work, but Mi-rae feels uneasy around him. Despite his indifferent and cold demeanor, he’s a character with surprising secrets, sure to stir emotions in Mi-rae. Boyfriend on Demand (wt) is directed by Kim Jung-sik, known his work on web series Work Later, Drink Now and No Gain No Love. Jisso recently appeared in the South Korean drama series Snowdrop on Disney+ and can currently be seen in the Prime Video zombie comedy series Newtopia. Her debut solo mini album, Amortage, was released on Feb. 14.",
