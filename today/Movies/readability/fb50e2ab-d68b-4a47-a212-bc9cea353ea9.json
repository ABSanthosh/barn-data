  "text": "Rob Menschel, a veteran director, camera operator and lighting director in sports broadcasts, has died. He was 59. The news was shared by his colleagues at FanDuel, who recently interrupted a broadcast to pay tribute to Menschel after his passing, recognizing the work he’s done in Southern California and across the country since 1989. “Rob has been a fixture in the sports broadcasting industry across the nation for over 30 years,” said court reporter Lauren Rosen in a broadcast. “A brilliant camera operator, lighting director and game director, Robbie’s presence on any broadcast immediately made the experience special, not only with his amazing technical skills, but his amazing friendship.” For the majority of Menschel’s career, he was part of the crew for Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, up until his retirement in 2016. Scully died at age 94 in 2022. Watch on Deadline “If it’s out of left field, I probably had something to do with it,” Menschel told the Los Angeles Times in 2016 upon Scully’s exit. Joel Gooding paid tribute to Menschel after working together for the Dodgers. “Rob was the best ‘high home’ camera op in the biz. He directed a handful of Dodgers games alongside me in 2013 and taught me a ton. Great dude. RIP,” he wrote on X. Los Angeles Angels color commentator Mark Gubicza wrote of Menschel, “Rob was the absolute best in the business. We shared many laughs and even a few dances. I’ll cherish our friendship for the rest of my life. Love and prayers to his beautiful family. RIP Rob” Menschel is survived by his wife Andrew and his two sons, Kyle and Jared.",
