He accused the latter of taking down his famous YouTube video and also reacted to his latest song, Thick of It. As a result, PewDiePie’s remarks over KSI have gone viral, making everyone curious about the ongoing copyright controversy. So, here are the details on what PewDiePie and KSI are feuding over. What happened to PewDiePie and KSI? PewDiePie recently did a YouTube livestream, where he expressed his opinion on KSI’s music career. As per an X (formerly Twitter) post by @Snoopsftw, during the livestream, one of the fans asked PewDiePie if he had heard KSI’s songs anytime. He responded to the question, saying ‘Listened to KSI’s songs? F**k no!” The YouTuber further blamed KSI’s music being responsible for his car video being taken down, which he deems was his “greatest video of all time.” PewDiePie added, “It all started because of KSI’s f**king music because KSI had to go and have a music career. It’s all his fault.” Furthermore, he spoke about how all KSI does is copyright strike individuals for using his music in their streams. He believes that “striking is what he does all day.” Aside from his criticism of KSI’s career, PewDiePie also commented on his latest viral song. Most recently, KSI dropped “Thick of It,” a song produced by Ran Michael Djan Jr. Since its release, the song has garnered viral reactions from fans. Though the song received mostly negative reviews, it managed to amass 11 million views. According to PewDiePie, he considers the song to be “mid” and sounding “corporate.” He thinks that the song appeared as if it was written and produced by someone else and not KSI. Moreover, PewDiePie believes people are tired of KSI because of his recent business ventures, like Lunchly. Giving some suggestions for improving his music to KSI, the Swedish YouTuber said, “I guess this is what KSI wants to put out in terms of music. I don’t know. Really not that bad. ‘He could make it better.’ I mean, it is pretty good. You know? I, actually, think it’s not that…”",
