  "text": "It’s a “Nosferatu” reunion! Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who starred in director Robert Eggers‘ stylish vampire hit, is set to re-team with the filmmaker for his next film, “Werwulf.” Lily-Rose Depp, who led the 2024 gothic horror film, is also in talks to join the project. Eggers will direct the werewolf horror feature from a script he co-wrote with Sjón. The film is slated for a Christmas Day 2026 release in North America. Eggers and Sjón, who also co-wrote 2022’s “The Northman” together, are producing “Werwulf” alongside Focus Features, while Maiden Voyage’s Chris and Eleanor Columbus are serving as executive producers. Popular on Variety Focus Features most recently financed and released Eggers’ critically-acclaimed gothic horror film “Nosferatu.” Eggers and Focus have partnered on all his films to date, also including “The Northman,” “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse, for which Focus handled international distribution through Universal International. A reimagining of F. W. Murnau’s 1922 silent German Expressionist film, “Nosferatu” stars Depp as a young woman who becomes the object of desire for the terrifying vampire Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård). Taylor-Johnson appears as Friedrich Harding, a vampire skeptic. Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin, Ralph Ineson, Simon McBurney and Willem Dafoe also star. The film was a success at the box office, sucking up a huge $40 million Christmas debut, nearly double its pre-release expectations. It ultimately grossed over $181 million worldwide. Taylor-Johnson most recently appeared in “28 Years Later.” Previous credits include “Kraven the Hunter,” “The Fall Guy,” “Bullet Train,” “Tenet,” “Nocturnal Animals” and “Godzilla.” Depp’s additional credits include “Wolf,” “Silent Night,” “Voyagers,” “The Dancer,” “The King” and HBO’s “The Idol.” Nexus Point News was first to report the casting.",
