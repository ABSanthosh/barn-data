  "text": "SPOILER ALERT: Details follow for Season 13, Episode 6 of “The Masked Singer,” “Grand Ole Opry Night,” which aired March 19 on Fox. I don’t want to wait, for this episode to be over. I want to know right now who will it be… and indeed, it was “Dawson’s Creek” star James Van Der Beek. The Beek was the latest celebrity to be unmasked Wednesday on Fox’s hit music competition series, having performed as Griffin. Van Der Beek was eliminated after singing John Denver’s “Take Me Home (Country Roads).” During the episode, he alluded to his recent colorectal cancer diagnosis: “Recently, we got some news that changed everything. It’s been a really tough year. But fortunately, we’ve been able to face this challenge together, in our home. I would not have gotten through all of this without them. They make me smile through the tough days and are strong for me when I sometimes can’t be. They sit beside me through it all. They’re my safe space. My home.” Late last year, Van Der Beek also appeared on Fox — without a mask — on “The Real Full Monty”  special to raise awareness for prostate, testicular and colorectal cancer testing and research. Popular on Variety For Griffin, guest panelist Casey Wilson — filling in for Rita Ora — got it right in picking James Van Der Beek. Robin Thicke said it was Kyle Chandler. Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg named Chad Michael Murray. Ken Jeong went with Josh Hartnett. Van Der Beek previously sang “Rewrite the Stars,” by Zac Efron and Zendaya, for week one, and “Disturbia,” by Rihanna, for week two. For the Group B finals, the first singer to move on to the show’s “Lucky Six” was Pearl. That left Griffin and Boogie Woogie to face off in a Battle Royale. The celebrities both sang versions of “I Had Some Help,” by Post Malone feat. Morgan Wallen; Boogie Woogie ultimately won the round and moves on to the “Lucky Six,” while Griffin was unmasked. James Van Der Beek as Griffin joins Flavor Flav as Space Ranger, Sheana Shay as Bat, Aubrey O’Day as Ant, Oscar de la Hoya as Fuzzy Peas and Cedric the Entertainer as Honey Pot as the celebrities unmasked on “The Masked Singer” Season 13. “Grand Ole Opry Night” opened with Group B finalists Pearl, Boogie Woogie and Griffin performing “Save A Horse (Ride A Cowboy)” by Big \u0026 Rich. The night centered on the three remaining Group B contestants and picking the round’s winners, as Group A winners Coral and Paparazzo have previously moved to the “Lucky Six.” Back for Season 13 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, Rita Ora and Robin Thicke. Ora was at the desk for a third consecutive season to fill in for Nicole Scherzinger. New this season, a mysterious masked character dubbed “Detective Lucky Duck” will appear throughout the season to give clues and help the panelists “quack” the case of who’s under the masks. On this episode, Lucky Duck hinted that all three Group B finalists had a connection with Season 6’s Katharine McPhee — and he also noted that he appeared with Wilson on a “historic” show together. (Which could mean “Saturday Night Live,” or “Drunk History.”) Also new: The “Crack the Case” clue cases, in which more clues are shared about the eliminated contestant. Griffin’s clue case included a football.” “Been a big part of my career.” “The Masked Singer” Season 13 themed episodes include a tribute to franchises “Shrek” and “Ghostbusters,” as well as the Grand Ole Opry as it hits its 100th anniversary. Also on tap are a tribute to the Rat Pack and themes such as “Voices of Olympus: Unmasking of the Gods,” “Carnival,” “Boy Bands,” “Decades,” “Lucky 6 Speed Guessing,” a “Clash of the Masks” and the return of “Soundtrack of My Life.” Masked contestants in Season 13 include Honey Pot, Space Ranger, Cherry Blossom, Coral, Fuzzy Peas, Ant, Paparazzo, Griffin, Boogie Woogie, Pearl and Bat, with more to be announced later. Here were the performances on Wednesday’s Episode 6, “Grand Ole Opry Night”: Pearl, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Pearl Song: “Here You Come Again,” by Dolly Parton Panel guesses: Sheryl Crow, Trisha Yearwood, Kellie Pickler, Carrie Underwood Boots Clue: Strong arm. “As a strong woman, there’s nothing I like more than making others feel strong too. In fact, I’ve been quoted as saying that.” Pearl voiceover: “The biggest stars have performed at the Opry, but there’s one that shines brighter than the rest: Dolly Parton. Like everyone, I was dazzled by her. So when I was invited to share the stage with her, you can imagine my first thought: What would I wear? This designer dumb dumb showed up to rehearsals with no clue. And it turns out, Dolly was wearing the perfect outfit. So when I asked her where she got it, she replied, ‘Don’t worry honey, I’ve got two of everything, you can have one.’ And it fit! A true Cinderella story. Tonight I’m singing one of my favorite Dolly songs. One that I believe is a true hidden gem of hers. Just the idea of her seeing me sing it means the world to me. So thank you Dolly, the reigning queen of the Opry, for inspiring me. Oh, and for the outfit. I’ve still got it.” Previous songs: “Saving All My Love For You,” by Whitney Houston; “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper,” by Blue Oyster Cult Previous panel guesses: Regina King, Shania Twain, Joan Jett, Madonna, Melissa Etheridge Griffin, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Song: “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” by John Denver Panel guesses: Kyle Chandler, Josh Hartnett, James van der Beek Boots Clue: Texas. “The Lone Star State played a very big role in making me a star.” Griffin voiceover: “I can’t believe I’ve landed on Grand Ole Opry night. I have a big appreciation for country music. Or at least I’m starting to. After so many years in the spotlight, I moved my family to the country. A place where we could live quietly, in nature. The kind of childhood I always dreamed of providing for my kids. It’s been exactly what my family and I needed. Recently, we got some news that changed everything. It’s been a really tough year. But fortunately, we’ve been able to face this challenge together, in our home. I would not have gotten through all of this without them. They make me smile through the tough days and are strong for me when I sometimes can’t be. They sit beside me through it all. They’re my safe space. My home.” Previous songs: “Rewrite the Stars,” by Zac Efron and Zendaya; “Disturbia,” by Rihanna Previous panel guesses: Matthew Lillard, Freddie Prinze Jr., David Arquette, Jason Segel, Robert Pattinson Boogie Woogie, “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Boogie Woogie Song: “Something in the Water,” by Carrie Underwood Panel guesses: Ryan Tedder, Gavin DeGraw, Josh Groban Boots Clue: “MLB.” “People say I hit a real home run at the World Series.” Boogie Woogie voiceover: “The halls of the Grand Ole Opry have been filled with some of the greatest voices of all time. But for me, there was no one with a better voice than my mom. She and my dad are musicians, and the filled the halls of our home with happy songs and uplifting lyrics. I guess you could say that’s where I got it. It must have been something in the water. But a few years ago, I lost my mom. And suddenly, the house was quiet. It was empty. On that day, I was changed. A darkness washed over me, and I was out of hope. I found it hard to keep going. The one thing I did have was her recordings. So I began playing music. And suddenly I felt the rooms fill with her warmth again. I miss her every day. But hearing her voice is the next best thing to having her here. And tonight, I have faith that I’ve got an angel on my side.” Previous songs: “I Believe In a Thing Called Love,” by the Darkness; “Radioactive,” by Imagine Dragons Previous panel guesses: Adam Lambert, Andy Samberg, Mika, Criss Angel, Neil Patrick Harris, Jason Mraz, George Clooney In Season 12, Boyz II Men (as the Buffalo) won the Masked trophy, beating out Mario, as the Wasp, who was this season’s runner-up.
