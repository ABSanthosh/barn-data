Reviews from fests have been quite positive: \"a gripping script and a fictional story that feels ripped from a viral Netflix doc [make] Dead Mail definitely worth hunting down.\" Worth a look based on this kind of effusive praise and also because it looks as totally crazy as a Park Chan-wook film. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for DeBoer \u0026 McConaghy's horror film Dead Mail, from YouTube: You can watch the festival teaser for DeBoer \u0026 McConaghy's Dead Mail right here for the first look again. On a desolate, Midwestern county road, a bound man crawls towards a remote postal box, managing to slide a blood-stained plea-for-help message into the slot before a panicking figure closes in behind him. The note makes its way to the county post office and onto the desk of Jasper, a seasoned and skilled \"dead letter\" investigator, responsible for investigating lost mail and returning it to its sender. As he investigates further, Jasper meets Trent, a strange yet unassuming man who has taken up residence at the men's home where Jasper lives. When Trent unexpectedly shows up at Jasper's office, it becomes clear he has a vested interest in the note, and will stop at nothing to retrieve it... Dead Mail is co-written and co-directed by filmmakers Joe DeBoer \u0026 Kyle McConaghy, making their second feature after directing BAB and a few other short films previously. Produced by Zachary Weil \u0026 Brett Arndt. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year in the Visions section, and it also played at TIFF in the fall. Shudder will debut DeBoer \u0026 McConaghy's Dead Mail horror streaming on Shudder starting on April 19th, 2025 this spring. Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, To Watch, Trailer",
