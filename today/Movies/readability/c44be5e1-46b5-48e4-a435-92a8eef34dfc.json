Here's the official trailer for Kristi Jacobson's doc Louder: The Soundtrack of Change, via YouTube: The documentary champions the brave, bold, and unapologetic actions, both sung and spoken, of some of the most iconic female musicians of all time. The film is an emotional \u0026 inspiring journey filled with stunning archival footage, revealing interviews, and personal accounts from a powerful group of fearless female artists. Exploring musicians' stories from present-day Rhiannon Giddens summoning deep-rooted emotions on a banjo, to H.E.R. processing her grief through her powerful 2020 ballad \"I Can't Breathe,\" to Melissa Etheridge bravely coming out on TV at the peak of early 1990s homophobia, to Mickey Guytonâ€™s present-day struggles as a Black woman in country music. Guided by esteemed journalists, including J Wortham, Puja Patel, and Clover Hope, we are also reminded of the groundbreaking women of 90s hip-hop, highlighting artists like Queen Latifah and Salt-N-Pepa, as well as an interview with Kathleen Hanna whose \"Rebel Girl\" reflected the rage and anger of the Riot GRRRL movement. ðŸŽ¶ A MakeMake Production.
