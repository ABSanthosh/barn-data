The former Disney star dwelled on their age gap, given she is 32 while he is 26, placing him in a whole different generation. Cyrus discussed the impact of social media on her boyfriend’s life compared to hers, admitting that she doesn’t even have her Instagram password. She began dating the musician in 2021 more than a decade after her highly-publicized relationship with ex-husband Liam Hemsworth.  Miley Cyrus reveals what works for her and boyfriend Maxx Morando In her new December/January cover story for Harper’s Bazaar, Miley Cyrus admitted that she and her boyfriend, Maxx Morando, are “very similar.” She noted, “We just don’t take life too seriously,” However she admitted that he “looks at life really differently than I do.” Morando, who is six years younger than her, “grew up with a laptop,” she said, contrary to the desktop computer she shared with her siblings growing up.  The singer even confessed that they share a dog whom Morando “raised our dog off Reddit,” pointing at notable differences between her millennial practices and his Gen Z approaches. Cyrus then recalled questioning his methods, “I’m like, Are you sure we’re supposed to be doing this? And he’s like, On Reddit it says blah, blah, blah.” In addition, she disclosed in the cover story that receiving memes from her boyfriend is the only time she is active online. Miley Cyrus admitted that Maxx Morando, a producer and member of the band Liily, has introduced her to different kinds of music. They even worked together on her new album, with Morando producing several songs and helping her word the lyrics to the title track, “Something Beautiful.” Not only that, Cryus and her boyfriend often collaborate, with her professing, “Maxx just inspires me so much.” Besides talking about new music and her beau, the Grammy winner also posed for glamorous cover story photos for Harper’s Bazaar.
