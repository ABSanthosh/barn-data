  "text": "Renowned singer Stevie Nicks recently shared her thoughts on Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce’s relationship. Romance rumors began swirling in 2023, fueled by Swift’s appearance at Kelce’s game on September 24. Nicks, a longtime friend of Swift, expressed her excitement for the couple, describing Kelce as a supportive partner and sharing her hopes for their relationship to grow. Here’s everything you need to know about their budding romance and Nicks’ supportive take. During an interview with Rolling Stone, the legendary Edge of Seventeen singer shared her thoughts on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance. Nicks, an old friend of Swift, had attended her Eras Tour show in Dublin. According to Rolling Stone, Nicks had kind words for the couple and Kelce’s role as Swift’s partner. She remarked, “She’s really smart and has been through a lot before. Now, I think she’s in a good place, and she has a good man. I hope they fall deeper and deeper in love and ride off into the sunset.” Like Swift’s fans, Nicks even expressed a desire to see Swift and Kelce eventually marry. “He does his thing, she does hers, and they come back together. Maybe they’ll get married and have babies if she wants that. I want all of that for her.” Nicks also shared a unique gesture she made for Kelce. She gifted him a cashmere blanket, a go-to present she reserves for close friends during special occasions. “That’s what I buy for friends on a special occasion,” she explained. Additionally, she wore a TTPD (Taylor Swift’s “Tortured Poets Department”) friendship bracelet in honor of her connection to Swift, highlighting their lasting bond. Beyond her thoughts on Swift and Kelce, Nicks shared insights into her career, her passion for art and poetry, and her connection with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom she likened to a lighthouse.",
