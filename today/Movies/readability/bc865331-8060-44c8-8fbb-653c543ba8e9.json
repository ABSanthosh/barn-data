The Getty Center in Brentwood will likely remain closed until Monday, January 20. The Getty Villa is located on a hilltop overlooking Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades. “The Getty Center and Getty Villa remain safe from the Palisades Fire, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,” said Katherine E. Fleming, president/CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust as reported by City News Service. “We remain acutely aware of our affected staff, our Getty neighbors, and the whole Los Angeles region, and extend our heartfelt sympathy and hope for everyone’s safety,” Fleming added. The Getty Villa had recently opened its newest exhibition focusing on the ancient land of Thrace, a region spanning present-day Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey. The exhibition showcases gold, silver, and bronze artifacts that reflect the Thracians’ aristocratic pursuits, including warfare, horsemanship, and banqueting. Watch on Deadline The exhibition is part of the Getty Museum’s program The Classical World in Context, devoted to the diverse cultures that interacted with ancient Greece and Rome. It was organized by the J. Paul Getty Museum in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, Republic of Bulgaria, and the National Archaeological Institute with Museum at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. The exhibition opened on Nov. 4, 2024 and was scheduled to run through March 3, 2025. As of Monday morning, the Palisades Fire had scorched 23,713 acres and was 14% contained.
