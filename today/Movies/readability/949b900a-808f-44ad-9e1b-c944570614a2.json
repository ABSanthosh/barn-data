  "text": "Several stars of the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer have confirmed that fans will want to stick around for a special post-credits scene. What do we know about the I Know What You Did Last Summer post-credits scene? During the film’s premiere recently, star Jennifer Love Hewitt told fans “don’t miss the credits” when asked if there was something to be looking out for. While she didn’t go into much more detail, journalist Scott Menzel confirmed that there was a mid-credits scene in the film that is “legitimately freaking great.” I Know What You Did Last Summer is set to release in theaters on July 18, 2025, with early reactions praising the new entry in the iconic horror franchise. No. It’s a mid credits scene too but it’s legitimately freaking great.— Scott Menzel (@ScottDMenzel) July 15, 2025 “When five friends inadvertently cause a deadly car accident, they cover up their involvement and make a pact to keep it a secret rather than face the consequences,” reads the official synopsis. “A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they’re forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer…and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help.” I Know What You Did Last Summer is directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson from a screenplay she co-wrote with Leah McKendrick. The reboot will introduce new cast members Jonah Hauer-King (The Little Mermaid), Madelyn Cline (Outer Banks), Chase Sui Wonders (Bodies Bodies Bodies), Sarah Pidgeon (Tiny Beautiful Things), Tyriq Withers (The Game), Lola Tung (The Summer I Turned Pretty), Austin Nichols (The Day After Tomorrow), Nicholas Alexander Chavez (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story), musician/model Gabbriette Bechtel and more. It is executive produced by Robinson, Jackie Shenoo, and Karina Rahardja, with Neal Moritz serving as a producer.",
