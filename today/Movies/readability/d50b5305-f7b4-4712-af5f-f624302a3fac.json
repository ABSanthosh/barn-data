  "description": "\"Ready? Cause there's no going back.\" Disney has launched the first trailer for Tron: Ares, the third Tron movie that is a sequel to Tron: Legacy from 2010. This next movie is made by Norwegian director Joachim Rønning, continuing his Disney tenure following directing Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, and last year's Young Woman and the Sea. This spectacular sci-fi tech movie follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. beings. Greta Lee plays Eve Kim, the human lead of the story. A tech genius, analytical and observant. She's one of the world's best programmers. Reclusive, anti social, and important renegade in stopping the programs. Tron: Ares stars Jared Leto as Ares, Evan Peters as Julian Dillinger, Greta Lee, Jodie Turner-Smith, Cameron Monaghan, Sarah Desjardins, Hasan Minhaj, Arturo Castro, Gillian Anderson, and featuring Jeff Bridges back as the OG Kevin Flynn. \"This October, worlds will collide.\" It has been the dream of Tron fans since 1982 to see the programs arrive in the \"real\" world – this looks like it might be awesome.
