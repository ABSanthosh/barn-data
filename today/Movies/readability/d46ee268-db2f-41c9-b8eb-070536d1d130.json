Ready for more? Arriving in December at the end of this year. Blumhouse’s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy's, the highest-grossing horror movie of 2023, begins a blood-chilling new chapter of animatronic terror. Based on Scott Cawthon’s hit video game series, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi. The next one seems to continue right where the last left off, with Josh Hutcherson returning to his lead role. Now being hunted down by the Fozbears.

Let's hope this one turns out a bit better. Here's the first teaser trailer for Emma Tammi's horror sequel Five Nights at Freddy's 2, from YouTube: Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances. The first film, which opened to a record-shattering $80 million and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide, followed Mike (Josh Hutcherson), a troubled young man who reluctantly takes a job as a night security guard at an abandoned theme restaurant, called Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria, hoping it will help him retain custody of his young sister. That fateful decision instead drags him into the black heart of a supernatural nightmare. And he will never be the same again. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is directed by the American producer / filmmaker Emma Tammi, director of the film The Wind and the first Five Nights at Freddy's movie, plus the doc Fair Chase and podcast \"The Left Right Game\". The screenplay is by Scott Cawthon, Seth Cuddeback, Emma Tammi. Produced by Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon. Universal will debut Tammi's Five Nights at Freddy's 2 in theaters nationwide starting on December 5th, 2025 at the end of this year. Who's excited for more?
