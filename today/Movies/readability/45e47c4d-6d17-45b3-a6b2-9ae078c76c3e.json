  "description": "\"You really think you can stop 'em?\" \"I know I can.\" Voltage Pictures has unveiled an official trailer for an action thriller survival film called Aftermath, also known as simply The Bridge for release in a few other countries (since it's set mostly on a bridge, obviously). From director Patrick Lussier, this is set for release in November including arriving on digital VOD right away. Trapped on Boston's Tobin Bridge after a bomb explodes, a former Army Ranger must use his elite training to save his sister and all the other hostages from a group of vengeful ex-military contractors that are led by an unhinged war criminal. Aftermath stars Dylan Sprouse, Mason Gooding, Dichen Lachman, Mark Irvingsen, Shahjehan Khan, Will Lyman, \u0026 Megan Stott. It reminds me of the other trapped-on-a-bridge action thriller from this week called Armor starring Stallone. Though I gotta say - this film looks way better. A real big bridge with tons of people, lots of trickery, bad guys with masks, and a sneaky military lead character? Yeahhh this is where it's at – fire it ...",

It reminds me of the other trapped-on-a-bridge action thriller from this week called Armor starring Stallone. Though I gotta say - this film looks way better. A real big bridge with tons of people, lots of trickery, bad guys with masks, and a sneaky military lead character? Yeahhh this is where it's at – fire it up. Here's the first official trailer for Patrick Lussier's thriller Aftermath, direct from YouTube: On what should have been a peaceful afternoon drive, former Army Ranger Eric Daniels (Sprouse) finds himself trapped with hundreds of other commuters and a high-profile prisoner (Lachman) after a group of heavily armed ex-military contractors shut down Boston's Tobin Bridge. As their leader (Gooding) starts killing hostages, Sprouse must rely on his military training, killer instincts, and some unexpected help to get his little sister – and everyone else – home safely. Aftermath, also known as The Bridge, is directed by Canadian-American editor / filmmaker Patrick Lussier, director of the films Dracula 2000, White Noise 2: The Light, My Bloody Valentine, Drive Angry, Trick, and Play Dead, plus an ep of \"The Purge\" series. The screenplay is by Nathan Graham Davis. It's produced by Lucas Jarach, Brian Pitt, Timothy C. Sullivan. Voltage Pictures debuts Aftermath in select US theaters + on VOD starting November 1st, 2024 this fall. Find more posts: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
