  "description": "\"What are they after?\" \"They're hungry...\" Vertical has revealed an official trailer for an action movie called Osiris, a sci-fi thriller about a group of soldiers trying to survive on a hostile alien spacecraft. It's directed by filmmaker William Kaufman, a former US Army Calvary Scout, who has made a bunch of action movies over the last decade most people haven't seen. In this movie, a team of Special Forces commandos are in the middle of an operation when they are abducted by a mysterious spacecraft. When they wake up aboard the extraterrestrial spaceship, they soon discover they are being hunted as prey by a merciless alien race. Uh oh. The full cast includes Max Martini, Brianna Hildebrand, LaMonica Garrett, Michael Irby, David B. Meadows, Linds Edwards, Tyler Galpin, Jaren Mitchell, Dawson Towery, and Stanley White Jr. Plus the OG Terminator badass heroine Linda Hamilton. Reminds me of Predator, of course, but with different kinds of aliens who just want to eat all these humans as food. Not sure if this will end up any good. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for William Kaufman's sci-fi thriller Osiris, direct from YouTube: A team of Special Forces commandos wake up on [â€¦]",

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for William Kaufman's sci-fi thriller Osiris, direct from YouTube: A team of Special Forces commandos wake up on an alien spacecraft with no memory of how they arrived. They horrifically discover they are being hunted by a relentless Alien race.

The screenplay is written by William Kaufman and Paul Reichelt. Produced by Jon Wroblewski, Christian Sosa, Andrew Lewis, Isaac Lewis, Max Martini. Executive produced by Paul Reichelt. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Vertical will debut Kaufman's Osiris film in select US theaters + on VOD starting July 25th, 2025 this summer.
