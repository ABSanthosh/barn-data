  "text": "Posted in: HBO, Movies, TV | Tagged: dc studios, lanternsBased on a recent post, the first week of filming on DC Studios' Aaron Pierre and Kyle Chandler-starring Lanterns has wrapped - we think. First, we were asking, \"Is it cake?\" Now, we're wondering, \"Has it been a week?\" In terms of production on Chris Mundy (True Detective: Night Country, Ozark), Damon Lindelof (Watchmen, The Leftovers), and Tom King's (Mister Miracle, Supergirl) Aaron Pierre (John Stewart) and Kyle Chandler (Hal Jordan)-starring Green Lanterns series Lanterns, previous updates would have filming officially being underway. That brought us to this week, with Garret Dillahunt (Fear The Walking Dead) checking in on Instagram Stories with an interesting image. The actor posted an image showing a Green Lantern-themed cake with a single candle, and it included the text, \"Happy birthday #KyleChandler.\" Except… it wasn't Chandler's birthday (September 17, 1965), and it wasn't Hal Jordan's birthday (October 1959). Did that mean it was the first day of actual filming – or maybe Chandler's first day on the set as Hal? There was text on the cake board that – although a moving image of Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner from Superman is blocking part of it – appeared to read, \"Another year flew by… Happy Birthday [blocked, but appears to start with an \"A\"] and Hal!\" Image: Image: Netflix; Paramount+;Gabriel Hardman/DC Studios Screencap Now, we have another post from Dillahunt to pass along. \"Beautiful location to end a great first week,\" read the text on the image Dillahunt posted, with \"Because It's There\" (Michael Hedges) accompanying the nature image. Based on the two posts, we're going with the message that the first week of filming has wrapped on the HBO series. It will interesting to see if we get anything official this week from Gunn and Safran's team… Lanterns: A Look Back at Some Things We Know So Far… \"I don't want to give away all that stuff, but I think it's grounded just like, you know if Green Lanterns were real, what the fuck would they be and how would they be, you know?\" DC Studios co-CEO Gunn shared when asked to explain what he and DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran meant when they described the series as \"grounded\" during his one-on-one with Josh Horowitz for the Happy Sad Confused podcast. For those taking issue with the series being described as \"terrestrial,\" Gunn argued that the description is more than appropriate \"because it's on Earth; the story takes place on Earth.\" While Hal and John are still space-faring heroes, the story being told in Lanterns is Earth-bound – with Gunn adding that scenario is like \"most Green Lantern stories.\" That means \"it's not in outer space,\" and there won't be \"a thousand Green Lanterns.\" Gunn continued, \"It's a grounded story that's being told through another lens in a way that's really commensurate. You know it's an HBO series – and it's going to be an HBO series, and I'm happy with that, and I love the scripts.\" You can check out the segment at around the 32:50 mark in the episode below. HBO's Lanterns follows legendary Green Lantern Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler) mentoring a young John Stewart (Aaron Pierre) as they're drawn into a dark mystery on Earth in the middle of the American heartland. Along with Pierre, Chandler, and Dillahunt, the DC Studios series stars Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire, In the Line of Duty), Poorna Jagannathan (Never Have I Ever, Deli Boys), and Ulrich Thomsen (Counterpart, The Blacklist) – with James Hawes (Slow Horses, Penny Dreadful) helming the opening chapters of the series. When the series was first announced, DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran noted that the series would play a major role in their New DCU. Comparing it to \"a huge HBO-quality event\" along the lines of \"True Detective,\" the \"Green Lantern\" series is set to focus on Hal Jordan and John Stewart – who investigate a mystery that Safran said during the initial rollout \"plays a really big role leading us into the main story that we're telling across our film and television. So this is a very important show for us.\" Enjoyed this? Please share on social media! Stay up-to-date and support the site by following Bleeding Cool on Google News today!
