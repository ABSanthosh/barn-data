  "text": "As executive producer on The Real Housewives franchise, Andy Cohen has great insight on the shows. At Bravo Fan Fest Miami, Cohen gave Deadline a deeper understanding as to why The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City continues to work so well in its fifth season. “I always lead with humor. These women have all known each other a long time. Even Bronwyn [Newport], the new housewife, has known Lisa Barlow for 10 years,” Cohen told us. “I think that’s something that’s really important. It’s a connectivity that you can’t fake. There’s an organic backbone to people’s relationships that is essential to the success and longevity of these shows.” Cohen also teased that “there’s something coming up this week on the Salt Lake City Housewives, which is probably one of the most raw [and] real moments I’ve ever seen on a Housewives episode in the history of the franchise between Mary Cosby and her son, Robert, Jr. It’s incredibly emotional and I think it’s going to affect a lot of people.” Watch on Deadline With RHOSLC not short on drama, we wondered if there was any consideration for Jen Shah (who is currently in jail serving time) or Monica Garcia (who was behind an Instagram troll account) to join the reality series in the future. “I mean, Jen is incarcerated. I don’t know when she’s getting out, so I think that seems off the table,” Cohen explained. “I’m a big Monica fan, but I think that’s kind of a conversation for the future. We’re in the middle of an incredibly successful season right now, and I wouldn’t want to take away from the great work these women have done who are on the cast by speculating.” The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip spinoff on Peacock was also a fan favorite. Fans have been wondering if it would ever get a new edition, and Cohen said he would “hope so.” “I love Ultimate Girls Trip. We’ve been looking at ways that we could freshen it up if we brought it back. It’s definitely a conversation,” he said. Cohen noted that in discussing ways to bring back the spinoff would be considering cast members from other Bravo shows.",
