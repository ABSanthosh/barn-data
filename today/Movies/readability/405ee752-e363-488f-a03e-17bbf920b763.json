Now, TLC viewers will witness her journey towards independence on Baylen Out Loud starting Monday, January 13 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. The reality series will chronicle 22-year-old Dupree as she faces a variety of extreme and uncontrollable vocal and motor tics while challenging herself to become an independent adult and moving out of her parent’s home. “Baylen’s realness and humor struck us right away,” said Howard Lee, President, TLC and Discovery Networks. “Her fearless honesty about living with Tourette Syndrome not only busts stereotypes but also builds bridges of understanding. At TLC, we stay committed to showcasing stories that resonate deeply with our audience, and Baylen’s journey is the perfect blend of heart and mission.” The cast to be featured on the show includes Dupree’s five siblings, her boyfriend Colin, her father Allen, and her mother Julie. Dupree was diagnosed with Tourette’s at the age of 18 and has used humor to navigate through life. With 9.5 million followers on TikTok, Dupree has garnered a loyal audience who admires her openness in sharing how she leverages the power of positivity and her strong relationships to navigate life’s challenges.  Watch on Deadline TLC dropped the trailer for Baylen Out Loud, which focuses on Dupree’s family life and her journey to becoming independent. “Having a sister with Tourette’s is very crazy,” Dupree’s younger sister Sammi says in the trailer. “You don’t know if you’re gonna get smacked in the face or get a hug.” In the preview, Dupree’s boyfriend Colin reveals that he’s in the U.S. Air Force and has a relocation coming up, which could complicate their relationship. Dupree calls Colin her “medicine” and the “world’s best boyfriend.” Watch the trailer for Baylen Out Loud in the video posted above.",
