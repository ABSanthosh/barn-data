  "text": "Peacock’s new The Office series has added four new cast members. In January 2024, it was announced that Greg Daniels was developing a follow-up series to The Office. The series isn’t described as a reboot or spin-off; rather, it’s a mockumentary show with a brand-new cast that is set within the same universe. The series is rumored to be titled The Paper, though this has not been officially confirmed at this time. Per Variety, Gbemisola Ikumelo (Black Ops, A League Of Their Own), Alex Edelman (Unfrosted), Tim Key (The End of the F***ing World), and Eric Rahill (Friendship) have all joined the cast as undisclosed characters. Ikumelo, Edelman, and Rahill will additionally serve as writers on the series. The series’ cast also includes Domhnall Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, Melvin Gregg, Chelsea Frei, and Ramona Young. What else do we know about Peacock’s new The Office series? “The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,” the synopsis reads. Daniels co-create the new series alongside Michael Koman. They also both serve as executive producers along with Ricky Gervais and Stephan Merchant, both of whom created the original British version of The Office. Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, and Banijay Americas also serve as executive producers. It is a production by Universal Television. “It’s been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,” NBCUniversal Entertainment president Lisa Katz previously said in a statement. “In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.” A premiere date for the new Office series has not yet been announced.",
