  "text": "Starting today, Max subscribers can watch HBO on Max. OK, so they pretty much always could, but this is a bit different. Max began to roll out “Channels” in the U.S. on Wednesday. The new in-app feature allows subscribers to “stream a live feed of HBO programming directly from the Max app through simulcasts,” in the words of the press release. In other words, it means you can randomly catch the final 20 minutes of a “Game of Thrones” re-run on a Saturday morning — just like the pre-streaming days. Pre-Channels, Max was strictly an on-demand streaming platform. Channels is not exactly a novel concept — and not just because it is literally the old way of programming television. Warner Bros. Discovery already offers a number of FAST channels outside of Max, and Disney+ is adding its own live, curated channels. Channels can serve as a way to put the “HBO” back into what was once “HBO Max.” Warner Bros. Discovery has been criticized for excising the HBO name from the platform’s title, with some arguing that it contributed to a perceived devaluation of the HBO brand, once famously dubbed “Prestige TV” by former CEO Richard Plepler. (He was biased, but he was right.) The rollout will begin with “a small subset of adult profile users” (kids probably shouldn’t have access to a live feed of HBO’s entire schedule — especially at night) on Max’s ad-free and Ultimate ad-free tiers. (Linear HBO does not have ads; Max has an ad-supported option.) Warner Bros. Discovery already offers a number of FAST channels outside of Max. Disney+ is adding its own live channels that feature curated collections of Disney+ content. Even Criterion Channel is getting into the live channel game. What’s that you say? You’d like more corporate-speak about the feature? Consider it done!Channels “allows subscribers to enjoy the ease of seamlessly entering a live feed of HBO programming while also being able to restart, rewind, and fast-forward, as well as navigate between channels directly from within the player (on select devices), adding flexibility to their live viewing experience all within the Max app,” the announcement continues. “While Max continues to provide personalized content recommendations for every user, the addition of live channels offers the element of serendipity and another route for content discovery.” Show me where Netflix “offers the element of serendipity.” I’ll wait. (2001’s “Serendipity” currently streaming on Max!) In the meantime, Max PR really wants you to know that Channels “provides the infrastructure for future iterations and ongoing innovation of channels including curated collections specifically programmed for Max, featuring themed content from our iconic original programming and robust library.” To explain it in a way that real humans would, the feature paves the way for the Max algorithm to one day put together a personalized streaming channel, just for you. Here is the Channels lineup, with language directly from Max: HBO: The flagship channel home to current HBO Original premieres and replays, blockbuster theatrical premieres, and must-see library movies. HBO 2: Caters to the ultimate fans of HBO Original programming, featuring binge-worthy marathons of current HBO Original series in addition to top theatrical movies. HBO Signature: Delivers all things prestige drama, featuring iconic HBO Original series and films as well as blockbuster drama movies. HBO Comedy: Features laugh-out-loud comedy, including award-winning HBO Original series, specials headlined by top and emerging comedic talent, documentaries about legendary comedians, and box-office comedy hits. HBO Zone: Showcase for classic HBO series, documentaries, docuseries, and movies.",
