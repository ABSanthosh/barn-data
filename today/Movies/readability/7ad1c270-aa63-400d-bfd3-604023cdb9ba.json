It's landing on VOD directly next month. The night before Claire Reynolds' big trip to Paris, she catches the eye of a mysterious, handsome stranger. That's the last thing she remembers before waking up on a plane with no recollection of what happened after that. Things take a dangerous turn when someone slips her a note warning that there is a threat on the plane and that she might be the target. What!? This bastard is messing with her!

This looks pretty bad, all of the acting is cringe. There's enough clues in this trailer that it's obvious she's not actually on a real flight. Just dreaming? A coma? Or in a simulation? Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Bo Youngblood's thriller In Flight, direct from YouTube: Claire Reynolds (Tiffany Smith) hasn't had the best year. After graduating with a political science degree, the track all-star thought she'd land the perfect career. However, with her career stagnant and the recent death of her father, she decides to focus on herself and pursue her own desires. Her first step: a solo trip to Paris. The night before her scheduled flight, she says bye to her best friend \u0026 meets a handsome stranger named Marco (Cristo Fernández). But when Claire wakes up on her flight to Paris, she has no memory of how she got there. Things take a chilling turn when someone slips her a note warning that there's a threat on the plane and that she might be the target. In Flight is directed by American producer / filmmaker Bo Youngblood, making her feature directorial debut after producing other films including Safer at Home and Citizen Athlete. Produced by John Ierardi, Drew McAnany, and Bo Youngblood. Gravitas will debut the In Flight thriller direct-to-VOD in the US starting November 15th, 2024 this fall. Look any good - or not?
