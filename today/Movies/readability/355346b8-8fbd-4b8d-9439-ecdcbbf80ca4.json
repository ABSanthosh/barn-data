  "description": "\"My flame gives you life... My crater is your home... Stay close to me...\" Meet Ginger, a tiny little porcelain tea pot created by the Fire God. But there is something a bit strange about him... which is what makes him unique. Potlems is a mesmerizing animated short film created \u0026 directed by Spanish animation filmmaker Alberto Allegri Rodríguez. This is his official graduation project from The Animation Workshop / VIA University College in Denmark, where he has been studying Character Animation over these past few years. Potlems is a 3D mini-opera styled in the aesthetic of 70s stop-motion. In a town of ever-smiling porcelain children, Ginger is created with a fatal flaw: a frown is accidentally painted on his face. \"What started as a fun world-building concept evolved into an exploration of my feelings of vulnerability related to growing up with a disability,\" Alberto explains. The result is an empowering, emotional little animated film about what makes us different and why we should embrace those differences instead of trying to hide them. View below.
