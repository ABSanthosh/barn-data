Just enough of a spicy tease to get my attention, especially with all the glimpses that pop up at the end of this teaser. Check it out below. Here's the festival promo trailer (+ teaser poster) for Steve Pink's sci-fi film Terrestrial, from YouTube: Not long ago, Allen (Jermaine Fowler) was a struggling science-fiction writer trying to get his work seen and his voice heard. But now he's living high in the Hollywood Hills in a big mansion with a fountain, a vintage Mustang, and a room devoted to \"The Neptune Cycle\", the classic science-fiction novels written by Allen's hero, S.J. Purcell (Brendan Hunt). His friends Maddie (Pauline Chalamet), Ryan (James Morosini) and Vic (Edy Modica) have come to visit and celebrate Allen's big book \u0026 movie deal, but they're quick to believe his out-of-nowhere good fortune may be too good to be true. And his erratic behavior isn't helping matters any; he's coming across as sad, paranoid, and delusional, not like someone who's about to hit the big time. Is it writer's block? Or maybe it's the wrong time to visit? And maybe they weren't the only ones? Terrestrial is directed by the American filmmaker Steve Pink, director of the movies Accepted, Speechless, Hot Tub Time Machine 1 \u0026 2, About Last Night, Best Intentions, The Wheel, and The Last Republican, plus episodes of the series \"Children's Hospital\", \"The Detour\", \"Angie Tribeca\", \"Wayne\", \"Santa Clarita Diet\", and \"Cobra Kai\" as well. The screenplay is written by Connor Diedrich \u0026 Samuel Johnson. Produced by Josh Jason, Molly Gilula, Molly Conners, AJ Bourscheid, Austin Lantero, Rachel Walden, Pauline Chalamet, Luca Balser. The film is world premiering at the 2025 Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal playing in the Cheval Noir section this summer. No other release dates are set - stay tuned for more. Look good?
