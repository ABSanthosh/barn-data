  "description": "\"The world ain't fair. It ain't supposed to be fair... that's how it works.\" Briarcliff Entertainment has finally unveiled an official trailer for Magazine Dreams, the long-delayed film featuring actor Jonathan Majors as a psychotic body builder in LA. This initially premiered back at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival to great reviews (here's mine), and was bought by Searchlight Pictures pretty quickly. But then Majors was arrested and then found guilty for assault and harassment, so they sold off the film and pulled it from the schedule. Briarcliff has picked it up instead years later and is now setting it for a March 2025 release coming soon. An amateur bodybuilder struggles to find any human connection in this exploration of celebrity and violence. Magazine Dreams stars Jonathan Majors as a body builder named Killian Maddox, who is obsessed with winning body sculpting competitions but has nothing else in life. The cast also includes Haley Bennett, Taylour Paige, Mike O'Hearn, Harrison Page, \u0026 Harriet Sansom Harris. Despite Majors' troubles, this is a good film and it should be released anyway – especially as a cautionary tale about vanity and fame.

Despite Majors' troubles, this is a good film and it should be released anyway – especially as a cautionary tale about vanity and fame. Here's the first official trailer for Elijah Bynum's film Magazine Dreams, direct from YouTube: Magazine Dreams follows aspiring bodybuilder Killian Maddox (Jonathan Majors), who struggles to find human connection in this exploration of celebrity and violence. Nothing deters him from his fiercely protected dream of superstardom, not even the doctors who warn him of the permanent damage he causes to himself with his quest. Magazine Dreams is both written and directed by up-and-coming American indie filmmaker Elijah Bynum, his second feature film after directing Hot Summer Nights previously; he also wrote the screenplay for The Deliverance. It's produced by Jennifer Fox, Dan Gilroy, Simon Horsman, and Jeffrey Soros. This initially premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival a few years ago (read our review). It was bought and delayed due to Majors' criminal problems. Briarcliff Ent. will release Bynum's Magazine Dreams in select US theaters starting March 21st, 2025 coming soon.
