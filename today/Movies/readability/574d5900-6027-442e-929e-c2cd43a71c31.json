  "description": "\"I am retiring.\" Or are you? Ha ha. This extra cute and amusing animated short film is created by a group of students at the famous Gobelins animation school in Paris. Miyazaki is a 60-second animated short film tribute to maestro Hayao Miyazaki, the iconic filmmaker / animator / storyteller. It is about how he said he was retiring then just sits there not doing anything, so he comes back to work again. Always more stories to tell! Of course! Miyazak-san first announced his retirement in 2013, then Studio Ghibli said they were shutting down in 2014. A decade later he returned to work and went on to make The Boy and The Heron, which won the Oscar last year.

Made by 8 students at the acclaimed Gobelins School Paris. It's so darn cute seeing anything with Miyazaki-san in it! Thanks to Polygon for the tip on this animated short debuting online. Posted directly on the YouTube page called \"Chrispy Animations\" by one of the creators. The short's brief [â€¦]",
