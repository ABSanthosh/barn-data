  "description": "\"We're gonna sort this out, my man.\" Ohh I bet we will. Cineverse has debuted a badass new teaser for the fresh horror remake of The Toxic Avenger, ready to hit theaters this August near the end of the summer. After a two year wait since this first premiered at the genre festivals - it's time to unleash Toxie on everyone evil! The original The Toxic Avenger from 1984 is a Lloyd Kaufman / Troma horror cult classic, introducing the world to one of the most iconic mutant heroes \"Toxie\". Many sequels were made, and spin-offs, but now Troma has teamed up with Legendary for a brand new take. Macon Blair's The Toxic Avenger reboot follows struggling everyman-janitor Winston Gooze (starring Peter Dinklage), who is transformed by a horrible toxic accident into a new evolution of hero: The Toxic Avenger! With super-human strength and wielding a glowing mop, he must race against time to save his son and stop a ruthless, power-hungry corporate tyrant hellbent on harnessing toxic superpowers. Also packed with a kick ass supporting cast: Jacob Tremblay, Taylour Paige, Julia Davis, Jonny Coyne, Elijah Wood, and Kevin Bacon. Yes this is a much better teaser than the previous [â€¦]",
