Watch on Deadline His tenure on the business side of things within the entertainment industry included serving as the top executive of Kaiser Broadcasting, where he conceived of and executed a plan to build independent television stations in seven of the top ten national markets: Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco. He was also the executive vice president of the TV station division of Metromedia, prior to its sale to Fox, where he negotiated an agreement with Ted Turner’s CNN to give his stations regular broadcast access to national and international video news coverage. Additionally, Block was instrumental in the creation and launching of The Travel Channel for Westinghouse and Game Show Network for Sony. His teaching posts also spanned Stanford University, his alma mater, and UCLA. He had previously testified before congressional committees and served as an expert witness. Block served as a board member within organizations like the National Association of Broadcasters, Association of Independent TV Stations, TV Bureau of Advertising, Broadcast Education Association, National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard \u0026 Reserve, Stanford Alumni Association and Easterseals of Southern California. “The entertainment industry lost a great leader and consummate teacher,” read the obituary shared with Deadline from Block’s loved ones. “His impact on the entertainment business is legendary. His easy, can-do manner, dry wit and fearless pursuit of opportunity, drove his remarkable career which spanned nearly seven decades of broadcasting innovations, adroit deal making and education.” Block served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II and in the U.S. Coast Guard during the Korean War. He is survived by his two children, Julie Grunsky and Nick Block, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. A celebration of his life will be held at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.",
