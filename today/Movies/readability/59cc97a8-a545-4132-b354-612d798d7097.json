The six-part series, which is headed for Prime Video in the new year, promises to “take viewers beyond the headlines to uncover the real Molly-Mae.” Cameras will follow the former “Love Island” contestant as she parents Bambi, her 18-month-old daughter with Fury, and launches a new business venture.
