  "description": "\"You were hurting yourself, and you were hurting everyone around you. Something has to change.\" Well, well, well. Lionsgate has revealed the second trailer for an entrancing odyssey through space and time and music called Hurry Up Tomorrow, the latest creation from the mind of director Trey Edward Shults (Krisha, It Comes at Night, Waves). Still set to open in theaters this May. It's made in collaboration with mega musician The Weeknd, who's using his real name now - Abel Tesfaye. Tesfaye stars as an unnamed musician, playing a version of himself, who is experiencing insomnia and strange visions. He encounters a mysterious stranger, leading to a journey that challenges everything he knows about himself. This trailer is just as abstract and strange as the first one. Co-starring Jenna Ortega as Anima, Barry Keoghan as Lee, and Paul L. Davis as Lavi. She begins to \"unravel the very core of his existence.\" Using some time travel or other technique? Very interesting footage in here - it's definitely worth a look. What do you make of all this? Here's the second trailer (+ new poster) for Trey Edward Shults' film Hurry Up Tomorrow, via YouTube: You can rewatch the first official [â€¦]",
