The streaming platform has confirmed that it will bid adieu to the comedy-drama series, along with movies like The Flash, IT: Chapter Two, and more. Here’s everything we know about why Royal Pains is leaving Netflix and which streaming service it will move to next. When and why is Royal Pains leaving Netflix? Netflix will no longer be hosting Royal Pains for streaming, starting from December 31, 2024. While the streaming platform confirmed the same via Tudum, the reason for the exit still remains unknown. Royal Pains will be among many popular shows that will be taking their leave from Netflix at the end of this year. Many believe that it might be due to the expiration of streaming rights between Netflix and USA Network, the show’s parent channel. Albeit, no official reason for the show’s departure has been made public by either party. Royal Pains was added to Netflix earlier this year in January 2024 and has enjoyed significant viewership. For now, the complete show is available for streaming with all eight seasons. However, as mentioned above, fans now have only a month left to binge it all one last time before it leaves the streaming platform at the end of 2024. Where to watch and stream Royal Pains after it leaves Netflix? There is currently no official statement confirming where Royal Pains will be available for streaming in 2025. Although there isn’t an official confirmation regarding which streaming service will host the show next, past trends suggest that it might end up on Peacock. This is because USA Network shows have usually landed on the NBCUniversal-owned streaming service in the past. One of the most notable examples of that happening is with the popular legal drama series, Suits, which arrived on Peacock in 2023. Hence, Royal Pains, which is also a USA Network series, could arrive on the streaming platform in 2025. However, this is mere speculation as of writing, as neither USA Network nor Peacock has confirmed the same.",
