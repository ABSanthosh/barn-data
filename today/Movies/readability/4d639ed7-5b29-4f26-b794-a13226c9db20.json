  "text": "Posted in: HBO, Max, Movies, TV | Tagged: ccxp, dc studios, james gunnThough hoping he could make it happen, DC Studios' James Gunn confirmed that \"a million schedule conflicts\" are keeping him from CCXP 2024. We thought that the combination of DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran's Creature Commandos hitting Max on December 5th and Gunn's love for the huge Brazilian pop culture event would lead to some no-brainer news about Gunn heading out to CCXP 2024 (running December 5-8). Unfortunately, it looks like \"a million schedule conflicts\" will keep him from making the journey out to \"one of my favorite places in the world with some of my favorite people.\" With a whole lot of plates now spinning at the same time on both the film and series sides over at DC Studios, it's more than understandable. \"Sadly, no. I tried to work it out, but because of a million schedule conflicts, I won't be able to make it to CCXP this year, one of my favorite places in the world with some of my favorite people,\" Gunn wrote on Threads when asked about his CCXP status. Image: James Gunn/DC Studios Screencap; CCXP Creature Commandos: James Gunn Offers Details Thanks to a video presentation from Gunn (busy working on Superman and Peacemaker Season 2) during the 2024 Annecy International Animation Festival, we learned much more about what we can expect – and yes, those in attendance got a look at the adult animated series (though not released). The first look involved Waller (Viola Davis), G.I. Robot (Sean Gunn), Nina (Zoe Chao), and the topic of killing Nazis, followed by a fight scene between deep-sleeper Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) and Dr. Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk). \"It's a cornerstone of the legacy we've been entrusted to carry at DC Studios and plays an integral role in the vision for our future storytelling,\" Gunn shared with those in attendance. \"Since taking the reins, our true north has been to bring DC film, TV, animation, and gaming into alignment under a single banner and bring a sense of unity and consistency into the DCU as a whole. This frees us to create a range of products that are diverse and compelling and deliver great stand-alone entertainment experiences on every medium while also being part of a larger story that we're telling within our unified DCU.\" Gunn continued, \"What this means in practical terms is that our characters can move in and out of animation or jump into a game or onto the big screen, but they will remain consistent throughout: same character, same history, same actor.\" For example, Davis is reprising her live-action role as Amanda Waller for the animated series, and Grillo's animated Rick Flag Sr. will be making the jump into live-action for the second season of Max's Peacemaker. From there, Gunn shared that the series will pick up \"directly\" from the first season finale of the John Cena-starring series – with Waller finding \"her hands tied operationally.\" \"The new series picks up directly after our 'Peacemaker' season one finale, which leaves Waller with her hands tied operationally, meaning that she's no longer able to get away with putting human lives on the line to carry out her clandestine morally questionable missions. Instead, she recruits a ragtag band of misfits, not unlike the Suicide Squad and Peacemaker,\" Gunn revealed during the video presentation. That makes our leads a very different kind of hero than what viewers may have been used to in the past – and that's one of the things Gunn loves about the series: they \"are actual literal monsters, and I can't wait for you to meet them. Creating this series has been one of the absolute joys of my life.\" CREATURE COMMANDOS (Image: Max/DC Studios) The role call for the adult animated series (and any potential live-action takes) includes Frank Grillo as Rick Flag Sr., with Maria Bakalova as Princess Ilana Rostovic, Indira Varma as The Bride, Zoe Chao as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk as Dr. Phosphorus, David Harbour as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn as G.I. Robot \u0026 Weasel, Steve Agee returning as John Economos, and Anya Chalotra taking on the role of Circe. In addition, Michael Rooker, Peter Serafinowicz, Linda Cardellini, Benjamin Byron Davis (Rupert Thorne), and Gregg Henry are on board as guest voices. Kevin Kiner and Clint Mansell (Peacemaker, Doom Patrol) are scoring the animated series, First introduced by J.M. DeMatteis and Pat Broderick in Weird War Tales #93 (November 1980), the comic book series focused on Frankenstein's monster teaming with a werewolf, a vampire, and a gorgon to fight Nazis in World War II. The series has the distinction of being the first DCU project that Gunn \u0026 Safran gave the green light to (with Gunn having penned the series) and the first from DC Studios that will hit screens. In addition, the series is being cast with voice actors who could also play their characters in a live-action project down the road. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
