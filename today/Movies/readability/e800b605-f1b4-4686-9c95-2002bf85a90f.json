Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 23 release date and time explained There isn’t a Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 23 release date and time.

Where to watch previous Chicago Fire Season 13 episodes You can watch Chicago Fire Season 13 via NBC and then the next day on Peacock. NBC is a popular American commercial broadcast television and radio network that offers viewers shows, sports, special programming, and news.

The series synopsis reads: “An edge-of-your-seat view into the lives of everyday heroes committed to one of America’s noblest professions. For the firefighters, rescue squad and paramedics of Chicago Firehouse 51, no occupation is more stressful or dangerous, yet so rewarding and exhilarating. These courageous men and women are among the elite who forge headfirst into danger when everyone else is running the other way and whose actions make the difference between life and death.”",
