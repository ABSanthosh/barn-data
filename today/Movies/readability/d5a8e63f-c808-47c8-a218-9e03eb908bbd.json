  "text": "Step aside, Daisy Edgar-Jones: Paul Mescal just might have a new career collaborator in Saoirse Ronan. The “Outrun” and “Blitz” star said during a recent junket interview with reporter Landon Johnson that she plans on “having a whole career shared” with Mescal. However, she most likely won’t be making her action-film genre debut with Mescal’s newfound franchise come “Gladiator III.” “I would do a film with Paul. Yeah, definitely,” Ronan said when asked if she would appear in the not-yet-greenlit third film. “[But] I don’t know if there’s a character for me in ‘Gladiator.’ It is tough.” Instead, Ronan reiterated her desire to star in a musical, and pointed to the “Glicked” dual debuts of “Wicked” and “Gladiator II.” “We got ‘Wicked’ coming out as well,” Ronan said, as both films premiered November 22 in theaters, “and I’d love to be a witch with the girls.” It “would’ve been fun” to play Glinda (the Ariana Grande role) if she had been asked, Ronan said. But then she brought to conversation back to her fellow Irish actor. “Paul and I will do many things together in our life,” Ronan said. “We became so close on the movie that we made together [‘Foe’], and we plan on having a whole career shared with one another.” Mescal recently parodied “Gladiator II” during his “SNL” hosting gig December 7. After “Gladiator II” director Ridley Scott revealed that the sequel was originally conceived as a musical, “SNL” imagined exactly that. Back in actual musical-land, there could conceivably be room for Ronan in the second part of Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked” adaptation. Ronan told IndieWire that she “always wanted to do a musical,” but added that she hopes to reunite with her “Little Women” and “Lady Bird” director Greta Gerwig for it. “A lot of people say they want Greta to write us a musical and we’ll do that together. I think that would be really fun,” Ronan said. She later added to The Playlist that while she is “not a singer,” she would “love to be in a film musical.” “I’ve done little bits here and there,” Ronan said of showing off her vocal chops, including singing in “Blitz.” “And listen, I’m not a professional singer, but I love to sing, and I get very nervous doing it in front of anyone. So it was a big thing to have to perform in front of people.” Saoirse Ronan would rather be a witch than get a role in Gladiator 3: “I don't know if there's a character for me in Gladiator. We got Wicked coming out as well and I'd love to be a witch with the girls. That would've been fun! But Paul and I will do many things together.” pic.twitter.com/oRCiEcOsIw— saoirse ronan archive (@archivesaoirse) December 8, 2024",
