  "description": "Time for beautiful quick journey to a whole other world. This animated short film titled The Lost Tower is a 2-min creation from Montreal-based animation filmmaker Florent Lebrun. It started as a small project and turned into this magnificent animated short. The film follows a pilot in a yellow bi-plane. \"Flying over uncharted waters, a pilot searches for one of the Lost Towers.\" It reminds me of Porco Rosso of course, very similar vibes (also with Castle in the Sky), but still feels like something unique. I would love to watch more - it's this is just the intro. For anyone concerned that it's created with A.I., Lebrun puts those rumors and concerns to rest right away. He explains on his IG post: \"Got some people wondering if it was AI... Sorry just good old Blender / Photoshop / compositing process.\" Amazing work! This is so evocative and immersive, allowing anyone to feel like they're ready to join this pilot on his mission to discover even more Lost Towers. Wow.
