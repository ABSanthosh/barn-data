What happens in The Fantastic Four: First Steps video?

Not only that, but the iconic headquarters of the group can also be found on real-life real estate website Zillow. On Zillow’s listing, The Baxter Building is listed for a whopping $4,444,444, a potential steal for a place in a skyscraper in New York City. Among the amenities listed on the site are things like “high-speed elevators,” “color television,” and “super-science laboratories.” The heroic group, including Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm, and Johnny Storm, are also all listed as neighbors.
