  "text": "Deadpool 2 director David Leitch is reportedly in talks to direct Ocean’s 14, the next installment in the fan-favorite heist franchise. According to a new report from The InSneider’s Jeff Sneider, Leitch has been in negotiations to potentially helm the new movie. Sneider notes that things can change as time goes on but that the feeling is that Leitch will end up closing the deal and directing the movie. Outside of being behind the camera of Deadpool 2, Leitch has also directed 2017’s Atomic Blonde, 2022’s Bullet Train (which also featured Brad Pitt), and was an uncredited co-director on 2014’s John Wick. What do we know about Ocean’s 14? Dating back to last year, rumors of Ocean’s 14 happening were beginning to surface. According to a report from Deadline, there was “momentum” building on Ocean’s 14, with both Clooney and Pitt expected to come back. At the time, Edward Berger was reportedly being eyed to direct the movie, but talks have since fallen through. Clooney previously teased that Ocean’s 14 could be happening when speaking to Uproxx’s Mike Ryan in December 2023. He said at the time, “We have a really good script for another Ocean’s now, so we may end up doing another one. It’s actually a great script.” There is also an untitled Ocean’s prequel film in the works with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling that is being directed by Jay Roach. Ocean’s Eleven originally began in 2001 as a remake of the 1960 film starring the Rat Pack. The film kicked off what became known as the Ocean’s trilogy, three films featuring the group as they went around and performed heists. The film series featured a litany of high-profile names, including Clooney, Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Eddie Jemison, Carl Reiner, Qin Shaobo, and more.
