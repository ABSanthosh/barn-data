  "text": "Andie MacDowell may be benefiting from some favoritism in the industry as her daughter Margaret Qualley‘s star has risen throughout the years. In a recent spot on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the veteran actress joked she was experiencing “reverse nepotism” because of Qualley. “She’s crushing it,” MacDowell gushed. “She’s great, so good in The Substance, and the movie is fantastic. And she takes so many chances, she’s so much braver than I could have ever been. She really carved her own road, I’m super proud of her.” Qualley cemented her star power in Netflix’s Maid, a limited series adaptation of Stephanie Land’s best-selling memoir of the same name, which garnered her second Emmy nomination after 2019’s Fosse/Verdon. That same year she was in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood, and has since made a concerted effort to headline more niche projects, like last year’s queer comedy-thriller Drive-Away Dolls and Yorgos Lanthimos’ twisty Kinds of Kindness (her second collaboration with the auteur, following her turn in the Oscar-winning Poor Things). A number of outlets and film enthusiasts online considered Qualley’s lack of an Academy Award nod for her supporting performance in The Substance a snub. Watch on Deadline “They always accuse the children of [nepotism], but I’m now cool, because I’m Margaret Qualley’s mom,” MacDowell, who co-starred with her daughter in Maid, said, “and also, I’m Jack Antonoff‘s mother-in-law, so it’s a double-whammy. Letters in the mailbox, like ‘I think you’re wonderful,’ and they’re 13.” Elsewhere in the interview, The Way Home star reflected on Groundhog Day, recalling an instance on the set of the 1993 temporal-warping comedy in which co-star Bill Murray randomly drove off during filming with her in the car.
