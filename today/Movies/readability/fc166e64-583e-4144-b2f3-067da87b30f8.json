An eating machine.\" Universal is celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the all-timer classic Jaws with a nationwide re-release at the end of the summer this year. ðŸ¦ˆ Steven Spielberg's beloved shark movie Jaws has been re-released many times before and screens often in many places all over the world. Still just as thrilling as ever to watch it up on the big screen! Starting on August 29th, the movie returns to theaters nationwide in stunning 4K, with select screenings in IMAX, RealD 3D, 4DX and D-BOX (all the crazy formats!), offering audiences the chance to experience the original summer blockbuster \"as never before\" (ugh, why). When a massive killer shark unleashes chaos on a beach community off Long Island, it's up to the local police chief, a marine biologist, and an old seafarer to hunt the beast down. Starring Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton. Originally released in June 1975, back again in the summer of 2025. Much has changed, much hasn't changed. Everyone's still afraid of sharks (me included). Don't forget it's rated PG â€“Â bring the family. Here's the brand new 50th Anniv. trailer (+ [â€¦]",

Everyone's still afraid of sharks (me included). Don't forget it's rated PG â€“Â bring the family. Here's the brand new 50th Anniv. trailer (+ posters) for Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws, from YouTube: This goes well with the upcoming doc Jaws @ 50 looking back at the making of this iconic shark movie. For Steven Spielbergâ€”who had made his feature debut the year prior with The Sugarland Expressâ€”Jaws marked a pivotal ascent. The film cemented his place among the defining filmmakers of his generation, and his mastery of suspense, character and visual storytelling would shape the trajectory of US filmmaking for decades to come. Released on June 20th, 1975, Jaws became a box office sensation and a cultural tidal wave. It was the first film in history to surpass $100 million \u0026 helped usher in the era of the wide-release blockbuster. Its success redefined the studio release model \u0026 established the summer time as Hollywood's premiere showcase for event films. Jaws was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won three: Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Original Score for John Williams' now-legendary theme. Jaws is directed by the iconic American filmmaker Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb; based on the novel also written by Peter Benchley. Produced by David Brown \u0026 Richard D. Zanuck. Universal Pictures will re-release Spielberg's classic Jaws in theaters once again starting on August 29th, 2025 at the end of this summer.
