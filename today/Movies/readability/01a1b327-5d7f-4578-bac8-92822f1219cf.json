  "text": "The trailer for the second season of “Peacemaker” has arrived. Revealed at San Diego Comic-Con on July 26, the John Cena-starring DC Comics comes just two weeks after the release of “Superman,” the kinda official-ish soft-ish reboot of the DC Universe courtesy of now-steward James Gunn. The new season, it was revealed during the Comic-Con panel, will take place a month after the events of “Superman.” “Peacemaker” will arrive on HBO Max on August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. In a May interview with Entertainment Weekly, Gunn said that getting back around to “Peacemaker” — which premiered its first season long ago in 2022 — was top-of-mind when he took the DC Universe gig. “Once I was done with ‘Peacemaker,’ I had to do ‘Guardians 3,’ and then when I was about ready to jump [back] into ‘Peacemaker,’ I got hired to be the head of DC,” he said. “As soon as I got that job, I made a couple of calls, and the first one was to [Marvel’s] Kevin Feige telling him that I’m taking the [job as] head of DC. The second one was to John Cena, and I said, ‘I’m getting this gig, and I still want to do ‘Peacemaker,’ but it’s going to have to wait. We’re going to have to get ‘Superman’ working first.'” The second “Peacemaker” installment being part of the “soft reboot” of the DC Universe was first mentioned way back in 2023, which Gunn also acknowledged. “I developed it along the way, in conjunction with the other DC projects that we’re doing, so it’s very much connected to ‘Superman’ and it’s very much connected to what comes after,” he explained. “I had a rough idea of what I was going to do, but it was actually quite different than what the show ended up being.” Gunn relayed how some elements of the first season play into the second season of “Peacemaker.” “You’ve seen what we call the QUC, the Quantum Unfolding Chamber, in the first season of Peacemaker, and we see more about that technology in ‘Superman’. The QUC is the center of the story in ‘Peacemaker’ Season 2,” he said. Apparently, some “Superman” characters are even going to wander over to “Peacemaker.” Gunn has also noted previously, though, that the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s rather, uh… universal tone is not the objective for DC. Discussing 2027’s “Clayface,” Gunn said (via ScreenRant), “We’ve got ‘Clayface,’ which is a totally different thing. Although it’s in the same universe, it’s a complete horror film. That’s one of the things we want to do. There’s not a company style. It’s not like every movie is going to be like ‘Superman.’ The artists — the directors and the writers — each one will bring their own sense to it… That’s what we want to bring to the films because we don’t want people to get bored. We want to invigorate people.” Cena appeared on the Comic-Con panel in full costume, thrilling the fan-packed audience. Gunn discussed the direction Cena’s character would he taking, saying (via ScreenRant) “Peacemaker is a different guy this season. He’s dealing with the demons he accepted in the first season.” So, to sum it up, though “Peacemaker” premiered while the previous DCEU was still in its waning days, Gunn was at the helm, and so it is still canon in the new DCU — or at least the second season is really, really canon. And the events of “Superman” happened one month before the new season’s events. Got it? Check out the “Peacemaker” Season 2 trailer below and watch on HBO Max August 21 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.",
