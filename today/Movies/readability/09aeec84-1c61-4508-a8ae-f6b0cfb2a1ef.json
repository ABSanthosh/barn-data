  "text": "The Michael Jackson biopic “Michael” will open in standard theaters and in Imax worldwide on April 24, moving from its earlier October date. Lionsgate is releasing the film domestically, with Universal handling distribution in the rest of the world except for Japan, which is handled by Kino Films. Antoine Fuqua directs, with John Logan as screenwriter and Jaafar Jackson starring as his late uncle. Graham King, an Oscar winner for “The Departed,” produces. “‘Michael’ explores the global superstar’s journey to become known to the world as the King of Pop, presenting an intimate look at the life and enduring legacy of one of the most influential, trailblazing artists the world has ever known,” the synopsis reads. Popular on Variety Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said in May that the movie was “likely” to move to 2026. Although it wrapped production in May 2024, the project underwent reshoots and came in with a lengthy initial cut. Earlier, there had been discussion about releasing the film in two parts. The film was last reported to carry a $155 million production budget. “Michael” also stars Colman Domingo and Nia Long as family heads Joe and Katherine Jackson. Miles Teller plays John Branca, Jackson’s attorney and advisor. Larenz Tate plays Motown Records founder Berry Gordy, with Laura Harrier as music executive Suzanne de Passe and Kat Graham will appear as Diana Ross. Other cast members include Jessica Sula as La Toya Jackson, Michael’s older sister; Liv Symone as Gladys Knight; Kevin Shinick as Dick Clark; KeiLyn Durrel Jones as Jackson’s former security-turned-trusted friend and confidante Bill Bray; and Kendrick Sampson as Quincy Jones, who first met Michael Jackson when he was just 12 years old.",
