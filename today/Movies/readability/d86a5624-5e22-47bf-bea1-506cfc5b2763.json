Accordingly, fans are wondering why he got fired. Did David Pollack criticize ESPN? Did he stir up any controversy? Here is David Pollack’s firing from ESPN explored. Why did David Pollack get fired by ESPN? David Pollack was fired from ESPN on June 30, 2023 due to budget cuts. Pollack confirmed this in an appearance on the Rick \u0026 Bubba podcast earlier this year. However, he was far from upset after getting fired. The football analyst was actually “thankful,” when addressing it in a recent appearance on Jason Whitlock’s Fearless podcast. “It’s opened up me to be able to talk about whatever the subject is in a truthful manner,” he said. Here, Pollack also confirmed that ESPN never specifically told him what he could and could not say while working for them, and how he should conduct himself. “Your opinions you post on social media, while they are yours, they also represent us,” he stated. “So, we are taking that into account.” David Pollack elaborated on this point by bringing up a situation involving NFL analyst Dan Orlovsky. The latter once put up a post on X (formerly Twitter) alleging a woman boxer, taking part in the 2024 Paris Olympics had been born with XY chromosomes, only to later delete it. Orlovsky eventually confirmed on The Pat McAfee Show that ESPN did not force him to do it. Pollack’s comments also point to the situation surrounding Sam Ponder, who was fired from ESPN two months ago. Prior to her firing, she expressed her honest and strong opinions on transgender participation in women’s sports via X. Since leaving ESPN, David Pollack has been co-hosting the Family Goals podcast with Jonathan Howes, a pastor. Here the two discuss topics like sports, family, and faith.",
