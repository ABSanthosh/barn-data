  "text": "(L-R) Mel Gibson, Kamala Harris Everett; Getty Images Just a few days ago, Andrew Garfield praised his Hacksaw Ridge director Mel Gibson for the “beautiful healing with himself” the Oscar winner has done over the year. Based on comments Gibson made today at LAX about the Vice President of the United States, the We Live In Time actor might want to reconsider his perspective. Caught at the airport by TMZ cameras, Gibson said that Kamala Harris has the “IQ of a fence post.” Beforehand, the Mad Max actor declared he was voting for Donald Trump to get back in the White House and it “ain’t good” if the current VP won the very close election. “Miserable track record, appalling track record, and no policies to speak of,” Gibson proclaimed of Harris – as you can see below. Deadline reached out to Gibson’s reps for a statement on the actor’s words about Harris, but have heard nothing back. If we do hear back, this post will be updated. Watch on Deadline Gibson’s insult echoes repeated attacks against Harris and her intelligence made by Trump. Just yesterday the former POTUS said that the VP “gave an answer that was from a loony bin” in a CBS interview. At a rally in Georgia on Wednesday, Trump added: “She’s not a smart person. She’s a low IQ individual.” Even in that context, Gibson’s demeaning IQ comment about the VP will probably also remind many of the “sugartits” remark he made to a female police officer back in 2006. Eighteen years ago, the Passion of the Christ director was pulled in Malibu and later booked for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. During that same incident, besides insulting the female officer, Gibson let loose with a tirade of antisemitic attacks such as “the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world” and “fucking Jews.” Condemned by the likes of Ari Emanuel, Gibson offered a series of apologies for those comments. Still, when Winona Ryder in 2020 said that at a Hollywood party Gibson asked the Beetlejuice actress if she was an “oven-dodger.” Ryder also said that Gibson quipped about getting AIDS from being around a gay friend of the actress. Praised in the past for his friendship by Jodie Foster and Robert Downey Jr, Gibson in 2011  pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of battering his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. At the same time, Grigorieva was cleared of claims by Gibson that the mother of one of his children was trying to extort him with recordings of racist and violent rants against her. In those rants, Gibson said that Grigorieva “deserved” being hit by him. They also had Gibson chastising his then partner for looking “like a f*cking bitch on heat” and telling her if she got “raped by a pack of” N-word about Black men, “it will be your fault.” Must Read Stories Read More About: Subscribe to Deadline Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.
