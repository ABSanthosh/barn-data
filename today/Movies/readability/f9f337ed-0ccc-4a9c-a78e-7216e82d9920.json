  "description": "\"I suspect 'you' aren't the only secret he kept...\" Acorn TV has revealed an official trailer for a new mystery thriller series titled Irish Blood, arriving to watch on Acorn TV later this summer. There is another series called Blood on Acorn TV, but it's unrelated. Alicia Silverstone (who has British parents) stars as divorce lawyer Fiona Fox who receives a message from her estranged father, embarking on a journey to Ireland. Her path in life is earmarked by her father, Declan, who seemingly abandoned her and her mother on her 10th birthday. In Ireland, she uncovers family truths and her father's dark past, realizing her life's abandonment story was a protective lie. Silverstone also adds: \"Irish Blood is the story of a woman discovering herself and confronting her past after traveling abroad unexpectedly. I love how unpredictable the storytelling feels and the combination of drama, humor, and suspense my character experiences.\" The series also features Wendy Crewson, Jason O'Mara, Dearbhla Molloy, Simone Kirby, Ruth Codd, \u0026 Leonardo Taiwo. Shot on location in Ireland (and it looks beautiful there, of course). Worth watching just to explore the island. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Acorn TV's Ireland series [â€¦]",
