Leonel Gutierrez was given four years in prison after pleading guilty in September to one count each of attempted robbery and grandtheft. Read more about the case below. UPDATED, 10:15 AM: One of the men convicted of lesser charges in the 2024 killing of General Hospital actor Johnny Wactor were sentenced today in Los Angeles.

Both ordered last week to stand trial on one count each of murder and attempted second-degree robbery stemming from the May 25, 2024, attack on the 37-year-old actor, and one count of grand theft involving the alleged removal of catalytic converter from another vehicle within two miles and less than a half-hour before Wactor’s killing. Barceleau is also facing a special circumstance allegation of murder during the commission of a robbery, along with allegations that he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury and death to Wactor.
