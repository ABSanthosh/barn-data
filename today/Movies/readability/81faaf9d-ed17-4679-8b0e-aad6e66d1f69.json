  "text": "Tom Cruise is looking to potentially make a Days of Thunder 2. Days of Thunder was released in 1990. Directed by Tony Scott, the film stars Cruise as Cole Trickle, a young race car driver who is looking to make a name for himself in NASCAR. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Cruise is now talking to Paramount about potentially making a sequel to Days of Thunder. What do we know about the potential Days of Thunder 2 movie? The project has not been officially greenlit at this time; rather, Cruise is merely having discussions about the idea at this time.  “He’s talking [to Paramount] about Top Gun and Days of Thunder,” a studio insider familiar with the discussions told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s going to be what comes together first in terms of a script. It depends on the idea and, ultimately, the script.” According to a March 2022 The Hollywood Reporter article, Paramount was previously interested in adapting Days of Thunder into a television series; however, Cruise didn’t want to move forward with that project and “strangled [the idea] in its cradle.” Along with Cruise, Days of Thunder starred Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, John C. Reilly, Cary Elwes, Fred Thompson, and Caroline Williams. “In the fast-paced world of NASCAR, a rivalry brews between rookie hotshot Cole Trickle (Cruise) and veteran racer Rowdy Burns (Rooker),” the synopsis for the 1990 movie reads. When both of them are seriously injured in competition, the former bitter rivals become close friends. With Cole’s spirits restored by a romance with neurosurgeon Dr. Claire Lewicki (Kidman), and Rowdy still sidelined by injuries, Cole decides to race Rowdy’s car in the Daytona 500 against underhanded newcomer Russ Wheeler (Elwes).” It’s unclear if any other cast members from Days of Thunder would return for a sequel, should the project move forward. Days of Thunder is currently streaming on Fubo, Paramount+, and MGM+.",
