We are proud to provide assistance to this resilient and vibrant community in this moment of need.\" Here's a look at the full statement released alongside Iger's comments.

Today we are committing $15 million for initial and immediate response and rebuilding efforts. We will be supporting vital organizations offering essential services on the ground, including the American Red Cross, the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, among others. Additionally, we've been working around the clock to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, many of whom have been impacted by these fires, and we intend to provide further resources to our Employee Relief Fund to help those facing hardship as a result of this crisis. Beyond critical relief efforts, we will be working closely with the business community to find ways to support important rebuilding efforts in the region. We want to express our overwhelming gratitude to the heroic firefighters and first responders from across the area and around the country whose unbelievable courage and professionalism have been a source of tremendous encouragement and pride this week. Likewise, we are grateful for the outstanding local reporters at KABC and elsewhere who have been a vital resource to all. While the fires continue to rage and the full extent of the damage won't be understood for some time, our hearts are with everyone across Southern California who has been affected by the destructive fires, and we urge residents to remain vigilant and follow safety guidance from local officials. This community's strength is rooted in its people, and we are proud to be a part of it and offer our support.\" Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
