  "text": "Sean Penn has had it with people being politically correct. The Oscar-winning actor made an impassioned plea for people “to be as politically incorrect as their heart desires,” while being honored with an award on Saturday during a glitzy gala night at Morocco’s Marrakech Film Festival, where guests included Luca Guadagnino, Monica Bellucci, Tim Burton, Justin Kurzel, Jeff Nichols, Alfonso Cuarón and Walter Salles. “For those of you with any familiarity with me and what has been my life, you’ll understand that I don’t often miss the opportunity to say an opinion,” Penn said. “And I have one [opportunity to do so] tonight in celebration of this incredible group of people that this festival brings together,” he added. Penn went on to reference the so-called Munk Debate about political correctness held in 2018 between British multi-hyphenate Stephen Fry and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson in Toronto. “Stephen Fry was giving a kind of closing argument and it’s so important to film that we remember this,” he noted. “While Steven is a very progressive-minded person, he criticized the liberals on the other side of the aisle for was that liberalism has become in the United States,” Penn went on. “Around the world [there is] this demand for diversity — but not diversity of behavior and not diversity of opinion or language,” said Penn. “I would just encourage everybody to be as politically incorrect as their heart desires and to engage diversity and to keep telling those stories, and I’m very proud and happy to be here. Thank you.” Penn received the award from Italian actor Valeria Golino, with whom he has been close friends ever since she appeared in his 1991 directorial debut “The Indian Runner.” Penn, who is a two-time Oscar winner for “Milk” and “Mystic River,” more recently co-directed the Ukraine doc “Superpower” and will soon be seen in anthology film “War Through the Eyes of Animals,” whose main protagonists are animals suffering from the terrible Russia-Ukraine conflict. The event’s homage marks Penn’s first appearance at the Marrakech International Film Festival and his first visit to Morocco.",
