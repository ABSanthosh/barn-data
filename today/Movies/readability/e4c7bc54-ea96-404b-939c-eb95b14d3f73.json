  "description": "\"Our kids can still go to prom tomorrow, right?\" Uh, no. Fathom has revealed an official trailer for a horror comedy movie called Ick, the latest fun movie from music video director Joseph Kahn (who also directed the films Torque, Detention, Bodied). This one played on the genre festival circuit last fall - it premiered at TIFF in Midnight Madness then played at Fantastic Fest, Sitges, and Screamfest. Science teacher Hank's life changes when he reconnects with his first love and suspects a new student is his daughter, all while facing an alien threat in their town. The movie is about a weird substance called \"The Ick\" that has been growing all over America (an obvious metaphor). But it's getting worse and suddenly will start taking over, unless this teacher and his smart student can figure out how to stop it. \"A wild ride driven by a power punk spirit, Ick is a dizzyingly fun \u0026 hilariously grotesque homage to throwback PG horror flicks, as well as an ode to Millennial nostalgia manifested in soundtrack needle drops by American Rejects, Paramore, and Blink 182.\" Starring Brandon Routh, Malina Weissman, Mena Suvari, Harrison Cone, Mariann Gavelo, and Cory Hart.

I'm not a fan of this film, it's especially tame \u0026 unexciting, the VFX are really bad. Not worth it. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Joseph Kahn's horror movie Ick, direct from YouTube: For almost two decades, a viscous vine-like growth known colloquially as \"The Ick\" has benignly crept into every nook \u0026 cranny of life while the residents of small town Eastbrook remain blas√© about its existence. The exceptions are former high school football star-turned-hapless science teacher Hank (Brandon Routh) and his sardonically perceptive student Grace (Malina Weissman) who are thrown together by Grace's mom's (Mena Suvari) closely-guarded secret and a mutual suspicion that the Ick is about to unleash some monstrous mayhem. Ick is directed by indie music video / genre filmmaker Joseph Kahn, director of the films Torque, Detention, and Bodied previously, plus tons of other music videos \u0026 shorts. The screenplay is written by Joseph Kahn, Dan Koontz, and Samuel Laskey. It's produced by Joe Heath, David Kang, Steven Schneider, Adi Shankar. This initially premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival last year, and played at Fantastic Fest \u0026 Sitges as well. Fathom Events will screen Kahn's Ick movie in theaters nationwide on July 24th, and again starting from July 27th-29th, 2025 this summer. For three nights only! Don't miss it. üèà Find more posts in: Horror, To Watch, Trailer",
