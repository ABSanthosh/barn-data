Fandango Logo Fandango Trying A New Loyalty Program With Fandango FanClub, members will continue to earn FanRewards, Fandango's free loyalty program which awards account holders with a $5 promo code for every four tickets purchased, which can be used towards a future movie ticket purchase on Fandango or on-demand viewing on Fandango at Home. In addition, FanClub members can double up on their rewards, as they will continue to be able to earn eligible theater points at participating theaters by linking their accounts to those programs. Like any other movie ticket program, this depends on how often you go to the theater to determine how much you get out of it. At this point, the service is so synonymous with movie ticket buying that it only makes sense for them to try and dominate a ticket loyalty plan. Hopefully, they fare better doing it than other attempts at such programs launched in the last couple of years, as none of them have really lasted. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
