At an event held at Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, the Emmy-winning TV personality sat down with broadcaster Richard Bacon and offered her candid thoughts regarding her departure from the United States and starting over. Ellen DeGeneres talks about why she moved to the UK The Daytime Emmy Awards winner did not hold back her thoughts, explaining why she thinks life in the UK is “just better.” She appeared on the Cheltenham show on July 20 and revealed that Donald Trump’s re-election as the president played a crucial part in their decision to move to the UK. Ellen DeGeneres disclosed that she and Portia de Rossi initially purchased a property in the UK as their “part-time house.” However, they chose to stay in the country permanently when the news of Trump’s re-election surfaced. (via BBC) DeGeneres explained to the audience, “We got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, ‘He got in.'” The election results helped the couple decide as they thought, “And we’re like, ‘We’re staying here’.” Since the move in 2024, DeGeneres and de Rossi have been enjoying the warmth of the English countryside. Speaking of their new life, the veteran talk show host was all praises. She gushed, “We’re just not used to seeing this kind of beauty. The villages and the towns and the architecture – everything you see is charming.” The Finding Dory star also detailed what they have been up to since last year’s move. She noted that she saw snow “for the first time” since their arrival in November. “We love it here. Portia flew her horses here, and I have chickens, and we had sheep for about two weeks.” While talking about their lives, DeGeneres also discussed the current state of queer rights in the US. She stated, “The Baptist Church in America is trying to reverse gay marriage.” Speaking of marital rights for the LGBTQ+ community, she opined that they might “reverse” it in the future. Furthermore, Ellen DeGeneres suggested she and Portia de Rossi might remarry in the UK if U.S. gay marriage rules change. She also addressed uncertainties facing LGBTQ+ individuals in the US. “I wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are,” DeGeneres said. “I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences.”",
