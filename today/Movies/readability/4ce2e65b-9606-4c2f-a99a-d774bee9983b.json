Up is down, pain is everywhere, innocence and tranquility are losing the battle to hatred and fear. Peace is the shrinking minority, and very few possess grace — even fewer know compassion...\" Indeed. Berg's \"American Primeval is a fictionalized dramatization \u0026 examination of the violent collision of culture, religion, and community as men and women fight and die to keep or control this land.\" Sounds thrilling and harrowing - and it sounds like not much has changed in 200 years in America.
