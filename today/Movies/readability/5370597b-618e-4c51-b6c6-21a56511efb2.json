  "text": "Jill Sobule, the pop artist best known for songs including “I Kissed a Girl” and “Supermodel,” has died in a house fire. She was 66. According to local news reports, firefighters in responded to call at about 5:30 a.m. Thursday at a house in Woodbury, Minnesota, which was fully engulfed in flames upon arrival. The cause of the fire is under investigation. “Jill Sobule was a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture,” her manager John Porter said in a statement shared with Deadline. “I was having so much fun working with her. I lost a client and a friend today. I hope her music, memory and legacy continue to live on and inspire others.” Born Jan. 16, 1959, in Denver, Sobule released her Todd Rundgren-produced debut album Things Here Are Different in 1990. Other albums include Happy Town (1997), Pink Pearl (2000), Underdog Victorious (2004), California Years (2009), Dottie’s Charm (2014) and Nostalgia Kills (2018). Singer-songwriter and guitarist Sobule became popular for her self-titled second album in 1995, which featured the lesbian anthem “I Kissed a Girl,” the first gay-themed song to make the Top 20 on Billboard’s Modern Rock, and the bop “Supermodel,” which appeared that year in the seminal teen film Clueless. Watch her quirky video for “I Kissed a Girl,” a different song from Katy Perry’s debut hit of the same name: Composing music for film and television, Sobule’s work appeared in Nickelodeon’s Unfabulous, and she acted and performed her music in the 2004 film Mind the Gap. She also appeared as herself in a 2003 episode of The West Wing and had roles in the features Mind the Gap and Grace of My Heart and on Oddville, MTV.

Explaining that she’s “been known to do topical and political songs” in her career, Sobule said while touring with The Fixx last month: “I’m certainly not used to tiptoeing around. So it’s interesting and even wonderful to figure out what you can get away with and how you can still relate to people who disagree with you.” DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:",
