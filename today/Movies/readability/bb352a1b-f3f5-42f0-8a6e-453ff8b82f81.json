  "text": "Looks like everyone’s favorite “Succession” daddy is at it again. Re-igniting controversy over who his real No. 1 boy may actually be. Per The Independent, Brian Cox shared during a recent interview on “The Jonathan Ross Show” that he still hasn’t seen his TV son Jeremy Strong‘s Oscar-nominated performance in “The Apprentice.” “The problem is I won’t watch anything that is to do with Donald Trump,” Cox said. “Donald Trump is in ‘The Apprentice,’ Jeremy is playing the lawyer.” The lawyer in question is Roy Cohn, infamous McCarthy litigator and mentor to Trump during the 1970s and ’80s. But Strong isn’t the only one of Cox’s faux-children to be receiving praise this awards season. Kieran Culkin is also nominated in the same category as Strong for his role in Jesse Eisenberg’s “A Real Pain” and has already picked up the Golden Globe and other accolades for his stunning turn. “I have seen Kieran’s film and he’s wonderful,” said Cox. “And I’m sure Jeremy is wonderful so I can’t really judge because I will not watch anything to do with that man — I’m talking about Trump.” Cox has vocalized his disdain for Trump many times now, even refusing to consider playing him should he be asked to. “You know, somebody said, ‘Would you ever want to play Donald Trump,'” Cox said in an interview with Deadline in 2023. “And I said, ‘Well, no.’ Because I think it’s such a bad script — the Donald Trump script. But then I look at Donald Trump, and I think, God, he’s so lost. He’s just a lost individual, and he’s so full of shit, and the reason he’s full of shit is that he’s an abused child. He’s really an abused child, Donald Trump. A tragic figure.” When asked on The Jonathan Ross Show whether Trump’s reelection made Cox lose faith in humanity, the Scottish actor denied feeling this way, but was nonetheless not looking forward to what lies ahead. “It just makes me realize people are stupid,” he said. “We’re in for a pretty rough old four years coming up.” Though he was born and spent most of his life in the U.K., Cox now lives mostly in the U.S. where he’s raised his sons. Perhaps that may change in the coming years though with Trump back in office.",
