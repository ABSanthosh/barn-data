  "text": "Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone has disclosed that she underwent surgery for thyroid cancer in May after being diagnosed earlier this year. A spokesperson for Redstone said, “Shari Redstone was diagnosed with thyroid cancer earlier this spring. While it has been a challenging period, she is maintaining all professional and philanthropic activities throughout her treatment, which is ongoing. She and her family are grateful that her prognosis is excellent.” Redstone, 71, is in the midst of trying to close the high-stakes deal with Skydance Media that will see it merge with Paramount, the owner of CBS and other television stations, streaming platforms and Paramount Pictures. That agreement was struck in July 2024 but remains in limbo, as it still hasn’t been approved by the FCC, led by Trump ally Brendan Carr. She’s also dealing with a lawsuit filed by President Trump against the CBS news division over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Popular on Variety Her cancer diagnosis is another difficult wrinkle in the already-tangled situation Redstone has been working to resolve. According to the New York Times, which first reported the story, Redstone said she consulted doctors about two months ago after experiencing fatigue and other symptoms. She had surgery to remove her thyroid gland, but surgeons were unable to remove the cancer cells that had spread to her vocal cords. She continues to be treated with radiation, the spokesperson said. Redstone had shared the news of her diagnosis with David Ellison, the head of Skydance, and with close family members and friends. If and when the Paramount-Skydance deal closes, Redstone will leave the merged company’s board.",
