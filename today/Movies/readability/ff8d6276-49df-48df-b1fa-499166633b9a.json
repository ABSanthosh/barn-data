  "text": "Sony Pictures has announced the official title and logo for its long-awaited new Karate Kid movie. The film will feature the return of franchise vets Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan. It is currently scheduled to arrive in theaters on May 30, 2025. Posted on X, Sony confirmed that the next installment of the iconic martial arts film franchise has now officially been titled as Karate Kid: Legends. This comes ahead of the movie’s upcoming NYCC panel next week on Friday, October 18 at Empire Stage at the Javits center. Who’s involved in the new Karate Kid movie? Sony’s Karate Kid movie is directed by Jonathan Entwistle from a screenplay written by Rob Lieber, with Karen Rosenfelt set as a producer. Plot details for the film are still being kept under wraps at this time. However, it is currently expected that story will largely take place on the East Coast, focusing on a teenager from China. In the new installment, Macchio will be reprising his iconic role as Daniel LaRusso, while Chan will once again play Mr. Han from the 2010 reboot. Joining them are franchise newcomers Ben Wang, Joshua Jackson, Ming-Na Wen, Shaunette Renée Wilson, Sadie Stanley, Aramis Knight, Wyatt Oleff, and Jennifer-Lyn Christie.",
