  "description": "\"She thinks that you are in possession of nukes and are planning to blow up Texas.\" Wait, what!? Yellow Veil Pictures has revealed an official trailer for a wacky, weird, indie comedy film titled Rats! set in Fresno, Texas. This initially premiered at the 2023 Cucalorus Film Festival a few years ago, and played at more fests throughout 2024 including Fantasia and Seattle and Calgary Underground. In Fresno, Texas, graffiti artist Raphael's arrest leads to his involvement in a chain of surprising events involving a sting operation, suicide, drug deals, criminal suspicions, weapons, a newswoman, and a plutonium deal gone wrong, creating chaos. Reviews add even more superlatives: \"Chock-full of gross-out humor, emo haircuts, and a female cop who loves the c-word, Rats! is a shockingly touching coming-of-age story.\" Rats! stars Danielle Evon Ploeger, Luke Wilcox, Darius Autry, Khali Sykes, Ariel Ash, Jacob Wysocki, and John Ennis. Looks like a crazy punk rock indie film from the 90s that they used to make. Bonkers! This actually seems like good fun. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Carl Fry \u0026 Maxwell Nalevansky's film Rats!, direct from YouTube: It's 2007 in Pfresno, Texas. Raphael is in county jail following an arrest […]",

Looks like a crazy punk rock indie film from the 90s that they used to make. Bonkers! This actually seems like good fun. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Carl Fry \u0026 Maxwell Nalevansky's film Rats!, direct from YouTube: It's 2007 in Pfresno, Texas. Raphael is in county jail following an arrest for graffiti. He's a good kid. It’s just graffiti. So you can’t blame Raphael for the events that unfold after his arrest. He’s not responsible for the sting operation, the suicide, Pflophaus's new mix-tape, Officer Williams and her delusional suspicions, the meth pipes, the FBI, the rich kids with nothing to lose, Mateo, Larry the pig, all the knives, the local aspiring TV newswoman, the plutonium deal gone wrong, or anyone who may or may not die due to that deal turning sour. None of it is his fault, but it is his problem. The moment Raphael walks out of that cell, he’ll be stuck on this turbulent roller coaster of misguided chaos. An amusement ride that’s a joy to watch in motion, as long as you’re not the one on it. Rats! is co-written and co-directed by two indie filmmakers Carl Fry \u0026 Maxwell Nalevansky, both making their feature directorial debut after short films previously. It's produced by Carl Fry, Maxwell Nalevansky, Adam Levin, Alison Moses, Harrison Nalevansky, Danielle Evon Ploeger. Yellow Veil Pictures will debut Rats! in select US theaters on February 28th, 2025, then on VOD starting March 11th this spring. For more info, visit the film's official site.
