Joining original castmates David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Dermot Mulroney and Skeet Ulrich earlier today at Hartford’s 90s Con held at the Connecticut Convention Center, Lillard spoke on a panel moderated by People about his fear of ruining the seminal horror movie’s legacy upon his (possible) resurrection. “I will say, I can’t say anything about it, obviously. But I am very excited and slightly terrified to be back because all I can do is really screw up a legacy that we have,” he explained. Watch on Deadline The Scooby-Doo actor continued, “I could really suck, and so that’s my fear. My fear is that I come back and sort of punish something that I could never have touched and been just fine. I hope I don’t F it up for everyone.” Originally premiering in 1996 and quickly becoming an iconic entry into the cult classic slasher genre, Scream has since spawned six sequels, with the seventh installment being released by Paramount next year on Feb. 27. Lillard’s career catapulted following his turn in the flick as Stu Macher, one-half of the evil duo (including Ulrich’s Billy Loomis) behind the savage killings at Woodsboro High. As a refresher, both die at the end of the film’s conclusion — or do they? In the denouement, Stu and Billy are seen stabbing each other to try to pass themselves off as victims of Ghostface after planning to kill Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott, however she gets the upper hand by dropping a TV on the former and subsequently electrocuting him. The latter dies a more decisive death, being shot by Courteney Cox’s Gale Weathers and eventually finished off with a bullet to the forehead by Sidney. Earlier this year, Deadline broke the news that Lillard would return to Woodsboro. Since his turn in Scream, Lillard has starred in She’s All That, The Descendants and played a role in the Blumhouse/Universal hit Five Nights at Freddy’s. The actor will appear alongside fellow legacy cast members Campbell and Cox as well as Scott Foley, Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown, alongside newcomers Isabel May, Celeste O’Connor, Asa Germann, Mckenna Grace, Sam Rechner, Anna Camp, Joel McHale and Mark Consuelos. Both Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega were originally set to return as their on-screen sister duo; however, the former was unceremoniously dropped from the project for calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the latter departed due to scheduling conflicts with Wednesday Season 2.",
