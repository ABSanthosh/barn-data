You can rewatch the official trailer for The Rule of Jenny Pen right here, to see more with these two actors. An unsettling thriller revolving around an acting duel between two stars of the caliber of Geoffrey Rush and John Lithgow. A judge is hospitalized in an asylum after suffering a stroke. There, he falls into the clutches of a twisted patient, who uses his doll, Jenny Pen, as an instrument to impose his will on the poor inmates. The clash between them will cause a wave of violence and terror to totally shake up the place. The Rule of Jenny Pen is directed by New Zealand filmmaker James Ashcroft, making his second feature film after Coming Home in the Dark previously, and many other short films. The screenplay is written by James Ashcroft and Eli Kent; based on the short story by Owen Marshall. Produced by Catherine Fitzgerald and Orlando Stewart. This initially premiered at Fantastic Fest 2024 and Sitges Film Festival (read our review). IFC releases Ashcroft's The Rule of Jenny Pen in select US theaters starting March 7th, 2025. Who's in?
