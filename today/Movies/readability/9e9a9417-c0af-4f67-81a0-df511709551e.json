Some of you will remember a badass short (at 30 mins!) film from 2015 called Kung Fury, made by Swedish filmmaker David Sandberg (no relation to Shazam! director David F. Sandberg). This was his own big project and it was a huge hit when it launched online - watch here. In 2018 he started development on a full-length feature version called Kung Fury: The Movie or Kung Fury 2. He was somehow able to wrangle up Michael Fassbender, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and David Hasselhoff for the cast, and shot the film in 2019. But after legal troubles and other setbacks, the pandemic kicked in and the film has been stuck in release limbo. Word is that it's finished but who knows if it'll ever be released.

If you're not prepared to do the same, then you hang up that hat, walk out that door, and you never come back...\" Hell yes - I want to watch this! Some of you will remember a badass short (at 30 mins!) film from 2015 called Kung Fury, made by Swedish filmmaker David Sandberg (no relation to Shazam! director David F. Sandberg). This was his own big project and it was a huge hit when it launched online - watch here. In 2018 he started development on a full-length feature version called Kung Fury: The Movie or Kung Fury 2. He was somehow able to wrangle up Michael Fassbender, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and David Hasselhoff for the cast, and shot the film in 2019. But after legal troubles and other setbacks, the pandemic kicked in and the film has been stuck in release limbo. Word is that it's finished but who knows if it'll ever be released. After all this time, a 10-minute \"sizzle reel\" promo trailer for Kung Fury 2 has popped up online and it's awesome. A must watch. Sandberg himself stars again as Miami martial arts cop Kung Fury, and Jorma Taccone apparently stars as his nemesis A. Hitler. This 10 minutes of footage is proper badass! Here's hoping they get the legal issues sorted and debut this in theaters in 2025. In this sequel, the story will focus on Kung Fury's universe with no real connection to the short movie other than the lead character. The original short film's synopsis: In 1985, Kung Fury, the toughest martial artist cop in Miami, goes back in time to kill the worst criminal of all time - Kung Führer, a.k.a. Adolf Hitler. Kung Fury 2 is an original project still stuck in release limbo - it's directed by Swedish filmmaker David Sandberg, who has directed numerous other short films and commercials before this including the short it's based on. It's also written by Tyler Burton Smith. Here's the full backstory: \"Development of Kung Fury 2 began shortly after the release of the featurette. Fassbender, Schwarzenegger, and Hasselhoff were cast by February 2018, and principal photography took place from July to September 2019. Post-production work stopped in September 2020 due to a lawsuit with investors and its release was indefinitely delayed. The film was complete by April 2024, but the legal issues were still ongoing.\" The sizzle reel \"leak\" has also been covered by Variety - hopefully they'll figure things out and get this released sometime soon.
