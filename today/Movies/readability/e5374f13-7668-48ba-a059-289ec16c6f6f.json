  "text": "The Bride is one of the main characters of DC’s Creature Commandos. As such, fans have many questions about the character, chief among them being whether she is Eric Frankenstein’s wife, her origins, and her powers and abilities. Here is everything you need to know about The Bride, Frankenstein’s wife. Is The Bride Frankenstein’s wife and who plays her in Creature Commandos? The Bride was created to be Frankenstein’s wife in Creature Commandos. However, she actually is not and detests him while he is madly in love with her. Frankenstein is an obsessive stalker who has often destroyed The Bride’s attempts to start over her life. Indira Varma voices the Bride. Varma is an English actress best known for her role in Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, which is also her debut film. Her other film and television credits include Luther, Game of Thrones, Rome, Human Target, Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The Bride has a violent and tragic backstory in Creature Commandos. Here, Frankenstein’s creator, The Doctor, built The Bride to his creation’s wish to have someone with whom he could share his life. Unfortunately for Frankenstein, the Doctor and The Bride fall in love while the former helps the latter navigate her identity and shares his knowledge with her. The Doctor and The Bride eventually became intimate. Frankenstein, upon discovering their intimate relationship, murdered his creator in a fit of rage. He did so as he felt he was entitled to The Bride. The Bride eventually escaped, which led to a centuries-long cat-and-mouse game between her and Frankenstein. She rejected his advances, and he pursued her. What are The Bride’s powers in DC’s Creature Commandos? The Bride possesses superhuman strength, speed, and durability in Creature Commandos. Moreover, The Bride is also a highly skilled combatant capable of going toe-to-toe with Frankenstein. She even defeats him in all of their encounters. She can also overwhelm incredibly powerful opponents like Circe in a fight.",
