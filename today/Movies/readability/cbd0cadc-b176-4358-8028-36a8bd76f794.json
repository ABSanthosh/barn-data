A similar story to My Penguin Friend with Jean Reno from last year year, but not the same. This is opening at the end of March in US theaters. Starring Oscar nominee Steve Coogan, this endearing new film from director Peter Cattaneo follows an Englishman's personal and political awakening after he adopts a little penguin during a cataclysmic period in Argentine's history. He finds the small penguin covered with oil and cleans him up, making a new friend in the process. The main ensemble cast includes Björn Gustafsson, David Herrero, Jonathan Pryce, Vivian El Jaber, Aimar Miranda, Micaela Breque, Tomas Pozzi, and Ramiro Blas.
