  "text": "FRIDAY EARLY EVENING: Currently, many have Ballerina in the mid-$20M range, but Lionsgate believes there’s a potential path to $30M at 3,409 theaters. Nobody in distribution land wants to a see a movie with great exits underperform. We need all the wins we can get. Ballerina is a R-rated movie, and the audiences for those always come out at night. What’s hard here is that this spinoff came on tracking three weeks ago at $35M+, so if it eases to mid-$20Ms, eeesh. Friday, including $3.5M previews, is just under $11M. I’m hearing now the production cost was in the low-$90M net range, more than 60% of that funded by foreign sales. Given that this is part of the crown jewel John Wick franchise, Lionsgate was determined to make the best movie possible, hence the year delay, hence the additional photography. With an estimated $45M P\u0026A spend Stateside, iSpot shows that close to 38% was spent on NBA Finals spots, and those go for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ya can’t say that Lionsgate didn’t push Ballerina out in the limelight, not to mention Ana de Armas has been promoting in Dwayne Johnson-like fashion since CinemaCon, all over social, etc. Watch on Deadline Ballerina has just under 1,000 PLF auditoriums. RELATED: The Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Box Office It’s a stacked summer, and this male-skewing action movie is in the wake of Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, which has a firm hand on Imax screens, heading to a $14M (-49%) third weekend in third place at 3,496. That’s better than Dead Reckoning‘s $10.6M third sesh. Running cume by Sunday is $148.2M. As we mentioned all along this week, No. 1 is Disney’s to lose as Lilo \u0026 Stitch is seeing a third weekend of $32M-$34M after a $9M-$10M third Friday at 4,185 theaters. Running cume is between $335M-$337M. Fourth is Sony’s Karate Kid: Legends at 3,859 sites. The pic is seeing $2.3M in its second Friday with a second weekend in the $9M range, -56%. Ten day running cume is $35.7M. Fifth is Focus Features’ second-weekend wide expansion of The Phoenician Scheme, which jumped from six locations in NYC and L.A. to 1,678 theaters with a second Friday of $2.5M and second weekend of $5.7M. Currently, Wes Anderson’s second weekend isn’t as high as his Asteroid City, which landed at $9M in 2023. We’ll see where this goes. Four stars, 81% positive and a good 62% definite recommend from a crowd that’s 64% under 35, mostly guys at 57%. FRIDAY AM UPDATE, after exclusive: Lionsgate is reporting $3.75M for the previews to Thunder Road’s John Wick spinoff Ballerina. That number is from Wednesday and Thursday shows. The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stands at 93%, equal to 2023’s John Wick: Chapter 4‘s which is best in the Keanu Reeves franchise. Ballerina‘s audience score also is higher than previous solo femme action movies Furiosa (88%, 2024) and Alita: Battle Angel (91%, 2019). Exits on PostTrak were excellent Thursday night with a 79% definite recommend. Again, that’s the fans, but it speaks volumes; we’ve said this before, but with the Comscore/Screen Engine polling service, “definite recommend” carries more weight than the positivity score which is 87%, still very good. This should bode well for Ballerina prancing past $30M. Men showed up to the guns-blazing ballet Thursday night at 61%. Best definite recommend and positive scores came from women over 25, who showed up at 29% and gave it an 83% and 90%, respectively. Ballerina takes place during the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum and follows orphaned Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas), who is beginning her training in the assassin traditions of the Ruska Roma. Her father died at the hands of Gabriel Bryne’s The Chancellor. She’s as mad as hell, and she’s not going to take it anymore. RELATED: Ana De Armas Teases ‘Deeper’ With Tom Cruise \u0026 Reveals The Lessons ‘Ballerina’ Has Taught Her Social media org RelishMix says: “Convo on Ballerina is running positive for action fans excited to see one of their favorite franchises expand in glorious fashion. The cast is the cause of a lot of the film’s positive sentiments including Ana de Armas, who has gained a lot of good will in other roles, and the promise of a returning Keanu Reeves as John Wick. Some comments are, ‘I love Ana de Armas, and I’m so excited to see her doing this kind of film after No Time to Die. She was the best Bond Girl!’ and ‘I didn’t actually expect Keanu to show up in the movie, glad he is gonna be in it!’ plus, ‘Did I spy Norman Reedus? Between Ian McShane, Keanu, and the legendary Mr. Lance Reddick‘. Many are pleased with the direction of this film and the action spotlighted in the trailer, sharing, ‘I was wondering if they were going to do a spinoff with the dancers! This looks EPIC!!!’ and, ‘I really hope that this is the start of a trilogy.'” RelishMix also notes that Reedus has the most social media followers from the Ballerina cast with his activated 19.2M, and de Armas has 15M fans, while Reeves is still off the grid for his movies. Disney And as we told you Thursday night, it was imminent that Disney’s Lilo \u0026 Stitch would cross $300M at 4,410 theaters, the second movie to do so YTD at the domestic B.O. after Warner Bros/Legendary’s A Minecraft Movie. The hybrid/live-action feature take on the 2002 Disney toon made $5M Thursday, -7% from Wednesday, for a second week of $86.1M and a running total of $303.1M. Lilo \u0026 Stitch is expected to reign again with a third weekend of $35M. Rest of the top five for the week is as follows: 2.) Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (Par) 3,861 theaters, Thu $2.3M (-10% from Wed), Wk $38.9M (-59%), Total $134.2M/Wk 2 3.) Karate Kid: Legends (Sony) 3,809 theaters, Thu $1.2M (-10%), Wk $26.7M, Wk 1 4.) Final Destination Bloodlines (NL) 3,134 theaters, Thu $1.M (-11%), Wk $16.1M (-48%), Total $117M, Wk 3 5.) Bring Her Back (A24) 2,449 theaters, Thu $675K (-12%), Wk $10.4M, Wk 1 EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us tonight that the John Wick spinoff Ballerina is looking to do around $3.5M-$4M in previews. That’s all in, including Wednesday fan screenings that started at 7 p.m. as well as Thursday showtimes that began at 6 p.m. The hope is that the $80M-$90M Lionsgate production gets to north of $30M, which, as we told you, is around where recent female solo action movies openings live at the box office, read Furiosa ($26.3M 3-day last year) and 2019’s Alita: Battle Angel ($28.5M 3-day in 2019). The Len Wiseman-directed spinoff produced by Thunder Road is expected to rank second behind Disney’s third weekend of Lilo \u0026 Stitch, which is looking to make around $35M; that movie crosses $300M today. Ballerina was delayed a year to undergo additional photography. Upside on Ballerina is that Thursday night fans are enjoying the Ana de Armas movie with a Keanu Reeves cameo, giving a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes — as of this minute, that’s higher than any John Wick RT popcorn score; John Wick: Chapter 4 received a 93% in 2023. Critically, even though Ballerina is 72% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, it’s not as high as the John Wick movies, which had film review scores ranging from 86%-94% certified fresh. Ballerina‘s all-in preview cash is on par with the Thursday preview box office of Furiosa ($3.5M) and higher than the $2.4M Tuesday night preview cash of Alita: Battle Angel. Essentially, the thinking is to comp Ballerina to female solo action movies instead of John Wick movies. Female solo action movies are a completely different subgenre and don’t always attract the full-on male audience that typically attends an action movie with a male leading star. Still, Ballerina‘s combined preview cash is higher than the Thursday night of 2017’s John Wick 2 ($2.2M) but far under both 2019’s John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($5.9M, ) and 2023’s John Wick: Chapter 4 ($8.9M, best preview cash in franchise). We’ll have more updates as they happen Friday morning. Lionsgate didn’t return our request for comment.",
