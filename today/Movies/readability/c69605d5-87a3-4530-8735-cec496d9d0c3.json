  "description": "\"Maybe somebody just went down the wrong driveway?\" Relativity Media has unveiled an official trailer for an indie thriller film called The Man in the White Van, based on a true story of a serial killer stalking people in Florida in the 1970s. Opening in theaters on Friday the 13th in December this year. The Man in the White Van (a PG-13 horror movie) delves into the eerie underbelly of a seemingly idyllic 1974 Florida town and follows the harrowing experience of young Annie Williams, a spirited girl whose carefree existence is turned upside down as she becomes stalked by an ominous man in a white van. Based on actual events of the serial killer Billy Mansfield Jr., this portrays a bone-chilling story of a young girl's unimaginable horrors and every parent’s worst nightmare. Starring Madison Wolfe as Annie, along with Brec Bassinger, Skai Jackson, Gavin Warren, Ali Larter, and Sean Astin. The whole point if this seems to be that, oh back then, they didn't know there were creepos in white vans prowling on kids. Uh huh, sure... whatever ...",

The whole point if this seems to be that, oh back then, they didn't know there were creepos in white vans prowling on kids. Uh huh, sure... whatever you say. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Warren Skeels' film The Man in the White Van, from YouTube: Based on true events. Back in 1974 Florida, a series of violent disappearances go unnoticed, and young Annie (starring Madison Wolfe) is targeted by an ominous white van that stalks her every move. As the van menace escalates, her parents dismiss her fears, and Annie is soon plunged directly into a terrifying nightmare that will shatter her world. The Man in the White Van is directed by indie writer / filmmaker Warren Skeels, making his first narrative feature after the doc film Thespians previously, plus a few other shorts. The screenplay is written by Sharon Y. Cobb and Warren Skeels. It's produced by Anne Marie Gillen, Terri Lubaroff, Michael Nole, Paul Scanlan, and Warren Skeels. This first premiered at the 2023 Newport Beach Film Festival last year. Relativity Media will release Skeels' The Man in the White Van in select US theaters starting December 13th, 2024 (on Friday the 13th) later this year. Scary? Who wants to watch?
