On March 3, The Nut Job (2014) drops on HBO Max. The animated family comedy revolves around Surly, a squirrel who is abandoned by his community. Further, he decides to raid a nut store, but his plans go haywire when he realizes it is a front for thieves planning to loot a bank. Further, the film’s sequel, The Nut Job 2 (2017), will be available on the streaming platform. It showcases the ruthless mayor of Oakton City planning to destroy Liberty Park.
