  "text": "Curious about Taylor Swift’s Wonderstruck perfume and why it’s still making headlines years after its release? Once a popular celebrity fragrance, it has now become a sought-after item with prices that may surprise many. As fans continue to hunt it down, questions about its cost and current market value are coming up more often. Here’s a breakdown of how much Wonderstruck costs today and the key reasons behind its rising resale prices. How much does Taylor Swift’s Wonderstruck perfume cost? Taylor Swift’s Wonderstruck perfume currently sells for a wide range of prices due to its discontinued status. On resale platforms like eBay, listings for the 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum have sold for anywhere between $75 and $350 depending on the condition, packaging, and whether the bottle is sealed or partially used. Sellers typically list smaller sizes, such as 0.5 oz or travel minis, for $20 to $130. They price sample vials and partially filled bottles between $15 and $85. Prices change frequently, especially for brand-new, unopened items that collectors and fans actively seek. Why is Taylor Swift’s Wonderstruck perfume so expensive? The primary reason for the high price of Wonderstruck is its discontinued status. Because the fragrance is no longer in production, resellers raise their prices to reflect its limited availability. Buyers now turn to secondary markets, where pricing depends on demand and remains unregulated. Taylor Swift launched Wonderstruck in 2011 as her first endorsed perfume. As production ended, the supply dwindled, and listings on platforms like eBay began showing higher resale prices. New, sealed bottles or those with original accessories typically command the highest prices. No new stock enters the market, and buyers continue to use existing inventory, causing the number of available bottles to drop. As a result, listings often show fluctuating and elevated prices, especially for larger or unopened units. This trend reflects how the resale market typically responds to discontinued beauty and celebrity-endorsed products.",
