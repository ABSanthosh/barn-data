  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: We have learned that the stars of the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, won’t be attending the Golden Globes this Sunday. Marvel Studios’ Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine, which grossed $1.33 billion worldwide, has one Golden Globe nomination, in the category of Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. Since Reynolds won’t be there, neither will his wife, Blake Lively, the star and producer of It Ends With Us. Wayfarer Studios and Sony’s $351 million-grossing summer romantic drama, which was also a Top 10 hit on Netflix over the holidays, was overlooked by Globes voters. Lively also made a cameo in Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine. We understand that Reynolds, Lively and Jackman’s decision to not attend Sunday was made well in advance of the It Ends With Us legal firestorm in which Lively is suing that pic’s co-star and director, Justin Baldoni, and his team for sexual harassment and “unconscionable” retaliation in federal court in New York. Also, Reynolds and Lively’s decision to skip the Globes isn’t due to the latest It Ends With Us scandal, per sources. Watch on Deadline When it comes to joking about the It Ends With Us behind-the-scenes situation, this year’s Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser is steering clear of it. “I think the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni thing is such a hot-button thing right now that even a mere mention of it will seem like I could be on the wrong side of things, even though I would never be,” the comedian told Yahoo Entertainment. “I also don’t want to give his name any — I’m mad I even know his name, to be honest with you, so I don’t need to say it anymore.” Reynolds was up for a Golden Globe in 2017 for the first Deadpool in the Best Actor in Comedy/Musical Feature category. Upon losing to Ryan Gosling, who won for La La Land, the cameras caught Reynolds giving a hysterical celebratory kiss to Andrew Garfield during the ceremony. Jackman was nominated at the Golden Globes four times and won once for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical Feature for his turn as Jean Valjean in 2012’s Les Miserables. Reps for Reynolds, Jackman and Lively did not return Deadline’s request for comment.",
