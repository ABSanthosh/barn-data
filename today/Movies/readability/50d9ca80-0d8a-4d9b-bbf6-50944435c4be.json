  "text": "The latest episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta addresses Londie Favors‘ death and pays homage to Porsha Williams‘ late cousin. In August 2024, Williams confirmed that her cousin Yolanda “Londie” Favors had died at the age of 34. The Bravo reality series was filming Season 16, and Williams skipped out on attending an event with her fellow co-star Phaedra Parks, which she organized as she mourned her cousin’s death. On RHOA’s latest episode, which aired on Sunday, June 22, Williams called Parks to tell her why she wouldn’t be there. “It just was so sudden — so difficult,” Williams says during a confessional. “Londie was just the most giving person you could ever think of. [She was] a loyal person, the most creative with her company. She did so much for my grandfather’s foundation. The most honest person you can ever think of. It’s just a huge loss.” Watch on Deadline RELATED: ‘The Real Housewives Of Atlanta’ Season 16 Taglines: Porsha Williams “Snatched” Her Peach Back \u0026 Brit Eady Calls Out “Haters Trying To Shade” Favors was featured on the latest season of RHOA as she helped Williams organize an event for her Pampered by Porsha bedding line. Williams’ cousin was also heavily featured on the spinoff Porsha’s Family Matters, which ran for one season on Bravo. “I’m devastated because I know Londie was really the backbone of their family — very young, which is brilliant, I mean, a sweetheart,” Parks says in a confessional. “I know Porsha is devastated.” RELATED: ‘RHOA’s Porsha Williams Pays Tribute To Cousin Londie Favors On Heavenly Birthday Two Weeks After Her Death: “Too Hard To Write All My Feelings” During the call with Williams, Parks tells her not to worry about not attending her event, adding, “We’ll be praying for you because I know she was like another sister to you.” At the end of her event, Parks delivers the news to the RHOA cast, which surprises them all. “I’m in shock,” Cynthia Bailey says in a confessional. “Londie was so sweet, so loving. This is devastating news.” RELATED: ‘Real Housewives Of Atlanta’s Porsha Williams Honors Former Bravo Star Londie Favors At Memorial: “Rest Well Beautiful Queen Londie” Although there’s conflict among the ladies, the loss brings them together, and Parks reflects and says, “We just need to support her during this time.
