  "text": "Star Wars Gets A Blast Of Kenergy As Ryan Gosling Joins Upcoming Film Universal Pictures This is not a drill: Ryan Gosling (\"Barbie,\" \"The Fall Guy\") is coming to a galaxy far, far away. While much remains unanswered, the Oscar-nominated actor is currently in talks to star in one of Disney and Lucasfilm's upcoming \"Star Wars\" films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the outlet brings word that Gosling is being eyed to star in Shawn Levy's forthcoming film set within the legendary sci-fi franchise. Whether you've got a good or a bad feeling about this, it's a big deal. Levy's mystery \"Star Wars\" movie first entered development in 2022 and is said to be working on the script alongside Jonathan Tropper, who he worked with on Netflix's \"The Adam Project.\" Originally, it was reported that the film could go into production after he wrapped up his commitments on \"Deadpool 3,\" aka \"Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine.\" Given the success of that film, now the biggest R-rated movie in history with more than $1.3 billion to its name, it's likely that Levy's \"Star Wars\" project rocketed up the priority list. Per THR, Gosling's interest only furthered that. It's now likely going to be the next movie in the series to enter production, as early as this fall. Plot details remain totally under wraps, but the report notes that it is intended to be a standalone adventure. So that rules out this being tied to the new \"Star Wars\" trilogy being developed by Simon Kinberg (\"Dark Phoenix,\" \"Star Wars Rebels\"). It's also unclear who Gosling would be playing. Levy is also set to produce the film via his 21 Laps production company, along with Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy. The future of Star Wars is coming into focus Lucasfilm The last film in the franchise to grace the silver screen was \"The Rise of Skywalker\" in 2019. While it was a financial success, it concluded the sequel trilogy on a mixed note, having to follow up the ever-divisive middle entry that was \"The Last Jedi.\" Since then, Lucasfilm and Disney developed many \"Star Wars\" projects, with only Jon Favreau's \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" making it to the finish line. That film, which is set in the same universe as the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian,\" hits theaters in May 2026. Gosling is one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, with \"Barbie\" ranking as one of the biggest movies ever. The actor earned an Oscar nod for his work as Ken in the film, which only increased his star power. Some of his other notable credits include \"La La Land,\" \"The Notebook,\" and \"Blade Runner 2049.\" Coupled with Levy's ability to churn out a crowd-pleaser surely makes this an appealing combo in the eyes of Disney and Lucasfilm. \"Star Wars\" could use some surefire hits right now. Aside from this project, \"Clone Wars\" maestro Dave Filoni is developing a film that will tie together all of the shows in the \"Mandalorian\" universe. James Mangold (\"Logan\") is also working on a movie that will showcase the beginnings of the Jedi Order. Plus, Daisy Ridley is set to return in a movie that will show her building a new Jedi Order in the aftermath of the sequel trilogy. Whether or not all of these make it across the finish line remains to be seen. As for how soon this movie could see the light of day? Originally, two \"Star Wars\" movies were going to arrive in 2026. However, Lucasfilm took the December 2026 film off the calendar, but the studio is holding a December 2027 release date for a mystery title in this franchise. We'll see how things shake out. Shawn Levy's \"Star Wars\" movie does not have a release date, but stay tuned.",
