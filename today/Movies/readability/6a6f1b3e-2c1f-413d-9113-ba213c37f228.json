  "text": "The Sydney Sweeney-led crime thriller Americana is getting a release date shift, with Lionsgate announcing a new date for the upcoming movie. When is the Americana release date? According to Lionsgate, Americana’s release date will move up a week, now releasing on August 15, 2025. The film was previously dated for August 22, 2025, but fans can now check it out a bit earlier. Americana stars Euphoria vets Sydney Sweeney and Eric Dane, alongside Paul Walter Hauser, Halsey, Gavin Maddox Bergman, Joe Adler, Zahn McClarnon, Derek Hinkey, Simon Rex, Jasper Keen, Christopher Kriesa, Augusta Allen-Jones, and more. Americana is written and directed by Toby Tost. It is executive produced by Jason Cloth, Chris Cole, Jean-Luc De Fanti, Terry Dougas, David Gendron, Ali Jazayeri, Bavand Karim, Paris Kassidokostas-Latsis, Suraj Maraboyina, Alison-Jane Roney, Steven Thibault, and Michael R. Williams. Producers are Aaron L. Gilbert and Alex Saks, with Nigel Bluck and Peter McNulty serving as the cinematographer and editor, respectively. “A highly prized Native American artifact leads a gallery of dynamic characters down a dangerous path in this wildly entertaining modern-day western,” reads the official synopsis. “After the rare relic falls onto the black market, the lives of a small-town woman and her son become violently intertwined with a quirky local diner waitress, an offbeat military veteran, and a corrupt antiquities dealer. Crime and chaos follow when an indigenous group leader and his crew join the fray in order to reclaim the artifact and return it to its rightful place.”",
