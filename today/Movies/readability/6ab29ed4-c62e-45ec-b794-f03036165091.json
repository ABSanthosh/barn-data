  "text": "There’s no single path to becoming a great actor. Whether one trains through Meisner, Stanislavski, Stella Adler, or Uta Hagen, every performer eventually discovers what works for them. Still, some principles seem to resonate across disciplines. Over the years, IndieWire has spoken with rising stars and established talents about the mindset required not only to break into acting, but to sustain a meaningful career. Here, David Alvarez (“West Side Story”), Wunmi Mosaku (“Sinners“), Ts Madison (“Bros”), and others share what they’ve learned about committing to the craft and finding purpose in performance. David Alvarez: Passion Is Essential, Obsession Is Not ‘West Side Story,’ David Alvarez©20th Century Studios/Courtesy Everett Collection One of the youngest performers to win the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, Alvarez had a pretty good launching pad for a career in acting, yet instead committed himself to multiple paths. He trained in classical piano, served two and half years as an infantryman in the U.S. Army, studied philosophy at Case Western University, all before finally returning to acting as Sharks leader Bernardo in Steven Spielberg’s 2021 remake of “West Side Story.” Popular on IndieWire Speaking to IndieWire’s Jude Dry in January 2022 following the release, Alvarez made clear his interest in the craft, but that he never wanted to take a part because he needed it. “I’d love to continue acting, but I have to be passionate about it. I have to be inspired with it or I’d rather just do something else, to be honest,” he said. Since then, Alvarez has starred in the Showtime drama “American Rust” and currently appears on the new Prime Video series from Amy Sherman-Palladino, “Étoile,” but Alvarez’s success proves that those who last in this business don’t always need to be obsessed with getting their next part. “If it’s meant to be, the right roles will come my way, and I would love to portray other things,” Alvarez told IndieWire. “But if not, I wouldn’t mind finishing my degree to become a philosophy professor or something.” Ts Madison: Acting Requires Responsibility TS Madison attends the ‘Bros’ Press Conference at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.Getty Images Billed as the first gay rom-com produced by a major studio, “Bros” was as much about breaking barriers as it was about splitting sides. For cast member Ts Madison, being a part of the film meant taking pride in her identity as a trans woman of color and reminding herself that she was part of a larger community. “If I’m going to occupy a public space,” she said during a 2022 interview with IndieWire’s Dry, “I have a responsibility to my community to make sure we’re represented well.” This wasn’t always the case for Madison, who considered herself pretty “reckless” before becoming an actress. Once she realized the power of seeing herself represented on screen though, she knew she had to alter her attitude. “I saw that there were so many people that are behind me that don’t have the privilege of having their voices elevated,” said Madison. “So I started to make changes within myself and say, ‘Madison. … You have lots of ears. And if you change one life, one life can change another.’” This isn’t only a valuable lesson for someone like Madison, but for anyone given the opportunity to be placed before a camera. Whether on screen or off, having a respect for what you’re doing and the import it may have to others goes a long way towards earning the respect of those around you. Ethan Herisse and Brandon Wilson: Keep It Grounded Ethan Herisse and Brandon Wilson in ‘Nickel Boys‘©MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection While filming “Nickel Boys,” Ethan Herisse and Brandon Wilson took on dual roles as actors and as camera operators, given the film’s first-person shooting style. It was a technical challenge, but they quickly found a rhythm. “Even looking into the lens, that just starts to all fade into natural movements” Wilson told IndieWire in 2024. “If you step back, it all looks very unnatural, but as you start to get into the rhythm, it just became what we were doing.” Their process reflects a broader truth about acting: Finding truth in a role isn’t about overthinking. It’s about connecting to something real. “It’s less about doing it just ’cause, or for money, or whatever,” Herisse said. “It’s, ‘Does this speak to me in some way? Or would this be fun?’” Wunmi Mosaku: Every Role Has a Ripple Effect ‘Sinners,’ Wunmi Mosaku, Michael B. Jordan, Miles CatonCourtesy of Warners Bros. Pictures In an industry often driven by market trends and streaming metrics, Wunmi Mosaku stays focused on what she can control: choosing stories that matter to her. “If we are brought closer together because of a shared experience,” she told IndieWire, “then those are the stories that I want to be a part of, whether as a viewer or as someone acting in it.” Mosaku, who stars in “Sinners” alongside Michael B. Jordan, believes each role is a chance to contribute to something bigger. And while any gig can be a step forward, she’s mindful of how each one adds to the arc of her career. As Mosaku told IndieWire, “What attracts me to these projects is, ‘Do I feel changed? Do I feel like I’m growing?’”",
