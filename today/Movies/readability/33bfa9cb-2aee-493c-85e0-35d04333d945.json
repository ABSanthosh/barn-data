While many are familiar with the latter, this will be the first time hearing about the former. We’ll cover what NPD is, how it affects those diagnosed with it, and how it’s treated below. What is Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and how does it affect Nick Cannon? Nick Cannon shared his Narcissistic Personality Disorder diagnosis with People earlier this month. He didn’t go into much detail about how it affects him, stating: “I feel like there’s so many labels out there, but it’s like, to be able to embrace it and say, ‘Look, I’m healing. I need help. Show me.’ I just embrace mental health and therapy in such a strong way. To be able to say I’m an example for others, but also be healing during the self-process works too.” The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (and Mayo Clinic) states an individual must possess at least five of the nine symptoms listed below to meet the criteria for an NPD diagnosis: Are jealous of others or believe that others envy them. Believes they are “special” and should only associate with others who are “special.” Displays arrogant and haughty attitudes and behavior. Exploits others to achieve their own needs. Grandiose sense of self-importance. Has a sense of entitlement. Lacks empathy. Obsesses over fantasies of unlimited power, success, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. Requires excessive admiration. While many “healthy” people can display the above traits, the DSM-5 indicates, “Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting, and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress, do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder.” The cause of NPD hasn’t been discovered yet, but there’s evidence that it might be genetic rather than environmental. Neuroscientists have found that those with NPD have less gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with compassion, empathy, and emotional regulation. The primary treatment for NPD is therapy. However, there is no clear evidence that therapy effectively alleviates the symptoms of the disorder. Doctors may also prescribe antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics to patients to reduce the severity of symptoms.",
