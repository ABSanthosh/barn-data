  "text": "The Penguin star Colin Farrell completed the Irish Life Dublin Marathon earlier today in support of charity Debra Ireland, crossing the finish line in just over four hours with longtime friend Emma Fogarty, who has a rare genetic condition called epidermolysis bullosa that affects the skin. Joining ranks with over 22,000 runners, the Oscar nominee kicked off the event and met up with Fogarty in the last 2.5 miles of the race, wheeling her to the ending ribbon. In a video captured at the finish line, Farrell is seen embracing Fogarty as he rests after the ordeal. “Shall we go again?” The Banshees of Inisherin actor can be heard saying. Leading up to the annual run, Fogarty and Farrell surpassed their goal of raising 400,000 euros for EB, setting a new goal of 1 million euros in light of receiving 679,000 euros (roughly $733 million) as of a day ago. The charity effort was in celebration of Fogarty’s 40th birthday, as she reached a milestone that few with her type of EB get to. Watch on Deadline Per Debra Ireland, EB, known as “butterfly skin,” is an incurable and incredibly painful blistering condition of the skin, with more than half a million people diagnosed with the disease worldwide lacking the essential proteins needed to bind layers of skin together. As a result, minor friction, movement or trauma of the epidermis causes it to break and tear. More severe forms of EB have a life expectancy range of early infancy to 35 years of age. “That run was nothing compared to the pain she is forced to endure every single day, even though she doesn’t show it,” Farrell said afterward, per the Irish Times. It was an honor to see her waiting for me with 4km to go, each of those representing a decade of her life, and to do the final stretch together. I’ll never forget it.” The Irish actor previously spoke about his participation in runs and the significance of this year’s Dublin Marathon during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers last month. “She, literally, 80% of her body is an open wound. She’s a legend. She shouldn’t have lived to the age she is now, she’s 40 years of age. I’m gonna push her the last 4k. She’s magic, this one. I’ve known her for 16 years, so she’s my excuse to slow down for the last 2-and-a-half miles.” Farrell has long been involved in charity work, founding the Colin Farrell Foundation earlier this year in dedication to his son, who has Angelman Syndrome, a rare neuro-genetic disorder. Launched in August, the organization aims to bridge the gap in resources for adult children who have intellectual disabilities through advocacy, education and innovative programs.",
