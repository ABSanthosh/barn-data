The new video sees Harbour, acting like his Red Guardian character from the movie, driving around Florence Pugh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Wyatt Russell, and Hannah John-Kamen. The group were in Las Vegas for this week’s CinemaCon, and all inside the Red Guardian service car from the movie. In the hilarious video, Harbour can be seen taking some wide turns and generally not following all the rules of the road. As for the cast in the back, they were laughing throughout, even when Harbour got out to help them out. Did David Harbour really drive Florence Pugh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Wyatt Russell \u0026 Hannah John-Kamen to #CinemaCon in Vegas? Yes. Did they enjoy it? You decide.
