  "text": "Fox has signed on for more seasons of the Rob Lowe-hosted game show “The Floor” and the survival competition series “Extracted.” “Extracted” has been greenlit for a second season, while “The Floor” has been renewed for Seasons 4 and 5. According to the official series description, “‘Extracted’ features 12 untrained competitors attempting to survive extremely grueling conditions, perilous terrain, and the threat of fearsome predators in the unforgiving Canadian wilderness. Meanwhile, some miles away, their family members are locked down at a secluded headquarters watching them navigate their dangerous surroundings alone via a 24/7 live feed. The fate of each untrained contestant in the wilderness lies in the hands of their family members back in HQ. Each amateur survivalist’s family has the power to decide whether their loved one has what it takes to brave the elements and fight to be the last one standing, or whether the family will push the ominous “Extract” button and remove their loved one and their whole family from the competition. Extracted begs the question: how far will their loved ones let them go for a chance for their family to win $250,000?” “Extracted” is produced by B17 Entertainment (a part of Sony Pictures Television) and Sylvester Stallone’s Balboa Productions. Executive producers include Rhett Bachner, Brien Meagher, Stallone, Braden Aftergood, Kourosh Taj, Rob Buchta and showrunner Lauren Taylor Harding. Popular on Variety The show first premiered back in February and wrapped its first season in April. According to Fox, it had the highest-rated unscripted series debut in roughly a year. In each episode of “The Floor,” “100 contestants will stand their ground on a massive, interactive LED game floor featuring 100 squares, each representing a different trivia category. The first challenger, selected at random, must choose one of his or her neighboring opponents to go head-to-head in an epic quiz duel in the opponent’s category. The winner takes over the loser’s square, gaining valuable ground as they expand their territory, while the loser exits the game. The winner must then choose – do they go on the offensive to dominate more of the board? Or do they let ‘The Floor’ choose a new challenger? The contestant who gains full control over ‘The Floor’ takes home a life-changing grand prize of $250,000,” according to the show’s logline. Talpa owns “The Floor” format, and produces alongside Eureka Productions and BiggerStage through their Talpa Studios banner. Executive producers include John de Mol, Maartin Meijs, Chris Culvenor, Paul Franklin, Wes Dening, Jayne Parker, Pat Kiely, Sean O’Riordan and showrunner Anthony Carbone. Host Lowe is a co-executive producer. “The Floor” first premiered back in January 2024, and was quickly picked up for a second and third season in May of that same year. The Season 3 premiere of “The Floor” was the most-watched unscripted entertainment telecast since 2023, according to Fox.",
