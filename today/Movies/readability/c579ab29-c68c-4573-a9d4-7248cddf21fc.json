The other two films in this intimate trilogy are quite good - and this one looks delightful as well. So much honesty and ingenuity in these stories. Here's the official US trailer (+ original poster) for Dag Johan Haugerud's film Love, direct from YouTube: Marianne, a pragmatic doctor at a hospital in Oslo, and Tor, a compassionate nurse, are both avoiding conventional relationships. One evening, after an unsuccessful blind date, Marianne encounters Tor on the ferry. Tor, who often spends his nights there seeking casual encounters with men, shares his experiences of spontaneous intimacy. Intrigued by his perspective, Marianne begins to explore whether casual intimacy could also be an option for her. Love, originally known as Kjærlighet in Norwegian, is written and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Dag Johan Haugerud, director of the films The 7 Deadly Sins, I Belong, I'm the One You Want, Barn, and The Light from the Chocolate Factory previously, plus many other shorts and cinema projects. Part of his \"The Oslo Trilogy\" (featuring Love, Sex, Dreams). It's produced by Hege Hauff Hvattum and Yngve Sæther. This originally premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year. Strand Releasing will debut Haugerud's Love film in select US theaters (at Film Forum in NYC) starting May 16th, 2025. Along with Sex on June 13th \u0026 Dreams on September 12th later this year.
