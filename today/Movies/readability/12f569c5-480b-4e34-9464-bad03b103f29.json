  "text": "David Harbour is detailing just how emotional the table read for the “Stranger Things” series finale was. The actor said during the live taping of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast at Comic Con, via People, that the ensemble cast was “uncontrollably crying” while reading the script. “The end of this [final] episode when we were reading it — just us reading it — about halfway through, people started crying,” Harbour said. “Then about the last 20 minutes, it was just uncontrollably crying, waves of different people. Noah Schnapp being my favorite.” Harbour continued onstage, “I think part of that also is the fact that these kids, it was their childhood. It’s 10 years later, and we examine that idea, and it’s so well done and so beautiful. It’s such a great episode, and it’s such a great season. You guys will love it.” He further teased that the series finale is the “best episode they’ve ever done,” adding, “They land the plane.” Harbour previously said during the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, hosted by Josh Horowitz, that the finale will be “very, very moving.” He teased in August 2023 that the script were “terrific, as per usual,” with the series creators the Duffer Brothers continuing “to outdo themselves.” “The things in the scripts that we saw are bigger than anything we’ve done in the past,” Harbour said at the time. “I’m excited to wrap it up in a bold, amazing way.” The eight-episode “Stranger Things 5” will debut sometime in 2025. Two out of the eight episodes will be directed by “The Shawshank Redemption” filmmaker Frank Darabont, who came out of an 11-year retirement to work on the final season. “What really dragged me out of retirement was that my wife and I really love this show,” Darabont told The Daily Beast. “Our content now is so filled with horrible people doing horrible things for greedy reasons but ‘Stranger Things’ has so much heart. That positivity is something I really responded to.” In addition to Harbour and Schnapp, the ensemble cast includes Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Finn Wolfhard, Joseph Quinn, Maya Hawke, and more.",
