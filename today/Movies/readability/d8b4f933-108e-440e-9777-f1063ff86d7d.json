His favorite audience was always seated around the dinner table.” Scalies starred in Season 2 of “The Wire.” He appeared in all 12 episodes as Horseface, an imprisoned Baltimore longshoreman and member of IBS Local 1514 with an emphatic allegiance to his criminal boss, Frank Sobotka. Popular on Variety In “The Sopranos,” Scalies appeared in the Season 5 episode “The Test Dream” as Tony’s high school football instructor, Coach Molinaro. His character manifests in Tony’s dream, screaming at him for throwing away his life to become a criminal. Scalies’ other television credits include “Homicide: Life on the Street,” “Law \u0026 Order,” “Law \u0026 Order: SVU” and “Cold Case.” On the film side, he appeared in “12 Monkeys,” “Liberty Heights,” “Jersey Girl” and “Two Bits.” Scalies also starred in a number of stage productions with the St. Francis Players in Springfield, Pa., including “Guys and Dolls,” “Chicago” and “The Wizard of Oz.” He is survived by his wife and “the true love and joy of his life,” Angeline M.
