  "text": "T.J. Miller wants to return to the Deadpool universe in a potential fourth installment, but only if Ryan Reynolds asks. In a new interview, the Silicon Valley alum said he would be open to reprising his role in a new sequel to the Marvel Studios movie. “We talked a little while ago,” Miller said on SiriusXM’s The Bonfire about maintaining contact with Reynolds. “I think him asking me, I think he’s just been such a good friend right now that I think it would be really, I think that would be awesome.” Miller played the role of Weasel in the 2016 film directed by Tim Miller. Weasel is Reynolds’ Wade Wilson’s best friend. The actor reprised his role in 2018’s Deadpool 2 but did not participate in 2024’s Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine. Watch on Deadline Miller has faced multiple problems over the years, including sexual assault accusations and an arrest for making a bomb threat. RELATED: T.J. Miller Says “Manic Episode” Was Behind His Fake Amtrak Bomb Threat; Subsequent Online Commentary Led To “An Absolute Spin-Out” In 2018, Miller made a “false 911 call” saying there was a bomb on an Amtrak train. Miller was arrested at New York’s La Guardia Airport on April 9, 2018, and released on $100,000 bond. Federal prosecutors in Connecticut dropped the charges in 2021 after the actor agreed to “make full financial restitution for the costs of the law enforcement response to the false 911 call, and to continue a thorough and necessary program of Cognitive Remediation to render any recurrence of such conduct most highly unlikely.” RELATED: T.J.
