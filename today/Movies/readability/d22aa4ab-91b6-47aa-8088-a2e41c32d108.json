Here's the official trailer (+ posters) for Andrew Johnson's film When I'm Ready, direct from YouTube: When I'm Ready revolves around a young couple, Rose and Michael (starring June Schreiner and Andrew Ortenberg), on a road trip across the country during the last days before an extinction event, as asteroids threaten to wipe out all life on earth. While journeying to see the girl's grandmother one last time before they perish, they fight to find meaning and adventure in the world's final week. Along the way Rose and Michael encounter a rotating cast of lost souls from different backgrounds, each looking for something very different out of the end. When I'm Ready is directed by indie filmmaker Andrew Johnson, making his feature directorial debut with this project, who also works as an art director. The screenplay is written by Andrew Ortenberg. Produced by Robert Ballo, Jordan Dykstra, Andrew Ortenberg, and Eli Samek. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Briarcliff Ent. will debut When I'm Ready in select US theaters on February 7th, 2025, then on VOD starting February 14th this winter. Who's in?
