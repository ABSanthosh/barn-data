  "text": "“The Boys” couldn’t let “Gen V” have all the fun at San Diego Comic Con. At the very end of the “Gen V” Season 2 panel on Friday afternoon, the upcoming fifth and final season of “The Boys” showed its very first teaser to the crowd of attendees in Ballroom 20. It was a brief teaser, packed with tons of superhero violence and gore — as fans of “The Boys” have come to expect — and quick looks at the new and returning cast members. The action unfolded quickly, but a couple of the highlights included a new supe character vomiting up what appeared to be a bloody hairball onto another character and someone having what could only be described as a violent explosion in a bathroom stall. Popular on Variety Seth Rogen, who’s an executive producer on “The Boys” and has appeared in a handful of cameos across the previous seasons, also made an appearance in the teaser. As did newcomers Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins, who are both playing unknown characters. Both actors appeared in a blink-or-you-miss-it scene together, in what’s the latest “Supernatural” reunion on “The Boys.” Showrunner Eric Kripke was also the creator of the beloved CW series and had already cast “Supernatural” stars Jensen Ackles, as the Captain America-like antihero Soldier Boy, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, as Joe Kessler, on “The Boys.” “Supernatural” fans had been begging Kripke to bring more of their faves to the Prime Video superhero show, and now their wishes have been granted. The most memorable part of the teaser was a powerful declaration by Antony Starr’s Homelander, in which he bellows how “this is a safer, more god-fearing nation” to an unseen crowd. At the end of Season 4, Homelander essentially worked his way into the White House and is the real power behind the new U.S. president. The country is under martial law, and Homelander has rounded up the Boys and other supes who don’t want to “make America super again.” In the quick teaser, at least one “Gen V” cast member was spotted: London Thor as Godolkin University student Jordan Li. That makes sense, as “Gen V” stars Maddie Phillips and Asa Germann appeared in “The Boys” Season 4 finale as pro-Homelander enforcers who turned on their fellow classmates and former friends. The “Gen V” and “The Boys” cross-show synergy continues with Erin Moriarty and Chace Crawford appearing in “Gen V” Season 2, coming this fall. Many of “The Boys” alum are returning for the final season, in addition to the aforementioned actors: Jack Quaid, Karl Urban, Jessie T. Usher, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Laz Alonso, Nathan Mitchell, Colby Minifie, Cameron Crovetti, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry and more. New faces coming in Season 5 include Daveed Diggs and Paul Reiser. Season 5 will release some time in 2026.",
