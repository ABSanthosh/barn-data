Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Alain Guiraudie's film Misericordia, direct from YouTube: The teasingly entwined ambiguities of love and death continue to fascinate Alain Guiraudie, who returns with a sharp, sinister, yet slyly funny thriller. Set in an autumnal, woodsy village in his native region of Occitanie, his latest follows the meandering exploits of Jérémie (Félix Kysyl), an out-of-work baker who has drifted back to his hometown after the death of his beloved former boss, a bakery owner. Staying long after the funeral, the seemingly benign Jérémie begins to insinuate himself into his mentor's family, his kind-hearted widow (Catherine Frot) \u0026 venomously angry son (Jean-Baptiste Durand), while making an increasingly surprising—and ultimately beneficial—friendship with an oddly cheerful local priest (Jacques Develay). Misericordia, also known as Miséricorde in French, is written and directed by acclaimed French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie, director of the films Sunshine for the Poor, That Old Dream That Moves, No Rest for the Brave, Time Has Come, The King of Escape, Stranger by the Lake, Staying Vertical, Nobody's Hero previously, and other short films. Produced by Charles Gillibert. This initially premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year in the Cannes Première section. The already opened in France last fall. Janus Films debuts Guiraudie's Misericordia film in select US theaters on March 21st, 2025. Visit the film's site. Find more posts in: Foreign Films, Indies, To Watch, Trailer",
