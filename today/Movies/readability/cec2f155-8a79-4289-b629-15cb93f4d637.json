  "text": "Francis Ford Coppola’s controversial “Megalopolis” production is now being given the documentary treatment. Mike Figgis directs “Megadoc” about the making of Coppola’s self-funded $120 million epic. While the buzzy cast included a slew of “canceled” actors as well as beloved stars, the feature was plagued with allegations of wild on-set antics and unwanted advances against extras (Coppola has denied the claims.) Figgis, meanwhile, was on set to capture it all. “Megadoc” is billed as an “unfiltered” look into Coppola’s “Megalopolis” and the auteur’s creative process as a whole. The official synopsis for “Megadoc” reads: “A raw, fly-on-the-wall documentary about Francis Ford Coppola’s decades-long journey in creating his self-financed passion project, ‘Megalopolis.’ The bold and unrelenting epic returns in Mike Figgis’ portrait of Coppola’s creative process – weaving together archival material, unfiltered cast interviews, and a close-up view of how the legendary filmmaker drew from Roman history, political allegory, and his own singular vision to shape the world of ‘Megalopolis.’ This isn’t a record of a production on the brink, it’s a personal memoir unfolding in real time.” “Megadoc” will debut at Venice 2025. Utopia will release the feature. “Megalopolis” stars Adam Driver as architect Cesar Catilina, who strives to create a utopian city while battling Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). Nathalie Emmanuel, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, and Aubrey Plaza co-star. Coppola recently said that he is planning on re-releasing “Megalopolis” with a “weirder” recut. The property will also soon be turned into a graphic novel with an October 2025 release. “Megalopolis” actors Driver, Plaza, Emmanuel, Voight, Dustin Hoffman, Giancarlo Esposito, Chloe Fineman, Shia LaBeouf, and Laurence Fishburne appear in “Megadoc,” as well as Coppola collaborators Talia Shire and Robert De Niro. “Megadoc” is produced by Tara Li-An and James Mockoski, with Anahid Nazarian, Barrie Osborne, and Darren Demetre executive producing. Figgis previously helmed the Oscar-nominated “Leaving Las Vegas” and is known for directing episodes of “The Sopranos” and “The Affair.” Figgis previously said in a press statement that Coppola gave him “access to everything, including the amazing archive material he’s accumulated of the many readings of the script as it went from one version to another. I was more or less free to go where I wanted.” He added, “The cast were open about the working situation and how they were dealing with the idiosyncrasies of Francis and his very individual working methods. What a privilege to be a witness to such a moment in film history.” And according to Coppola, “Megadoc” will showcase the many versions of the truth about what it really was like to film “Megalopolis” in Georgia. “The great filmmaker Mike Figgis shot the making of ‘Megalopolis’ as he saw it,” Coppola said. “Interestingly, there are many interpretations of what really happened and it’s all in the documentary although the documentary doesn’t always say which is what. It is for the viewer to behold and interpret.”",
