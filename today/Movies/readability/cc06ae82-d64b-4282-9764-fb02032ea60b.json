  "text": "Following the critical acclaim and awards buzz around her self-described life-changing role in The Last Showgirl, Pamela Anderson has called the Gia Coppola vehicle “the best payback” following Hulu‘s 2022 Pam \u0026 Tommy limited series. Having previously discussed her lack of involvement on the Lily James- and Sebastian Stan-starring show in the aftermath of its premiere (and its own turn around the awards circuit), Anderson reiterated on a recent SiriusXM interview with Andy Cohen that she found it “so strange,” “hurtful” and “so bizarre.” “I think ethically it’s illegal,” she said. “But I mean it’s kind of fair game. I remember people telling me a long time ago that you are basically public property and you have no right to privacy.” Watch on Deadline The newly minted memoir and cookbook author added that Hulu hasn’t approached her about making amends, but that she doesn’t “dwell on it, but it was kind of a strange thing to pick a very terrible time of my life and make entertainment.” Additionally, she pointed at the irony of other performers garnering accolades for portraying her, namedropping Deadline’s Pete Hammond and referencing an interview in which he noted, “”All these people have won awards basically playing you, but not you.'” She continued, “It’s not the actor’s fault, I mean, I’m sure she’s a great actress and stuff. I don’t care, it’s just one of those things. It happened, and now I’m here, and this is the best payback. I’m being seen and recognized for my work and not these tawdry moments.” Pam \u0026 Tommy, which garnered nine Emmy nods and a win for makeup, was adapted after producers had acquired the rights to a 2014 Rolling Stone article that detailed the story which eventually culminated in the illicit release of Anderson and then-husband Tommy Lee’s sex tape.",
