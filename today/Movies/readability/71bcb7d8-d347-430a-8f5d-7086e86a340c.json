  "description": "\"This is the shot we have. We may not get another one... Let's finish it.\" Ready? Marvel has dropped the new official trailer for the latest season of What If...?, their fun anthology series taking crazy all-out \"what if\" imaginative looks at different characters and ideas in the MCU. This might be the final season because Marvel's own intro from YouTube states: \"Witness the season that ends it all.\" The Watcher even comes out and says this, too. The first season launched in 2021 to mixed reviews, and this second season debuted in late 2023 one year ago. The opening once again is: Welcome back to the multiverse. So much to see in these 8 episodes! The voice cast set for Season 3 includes Jeffrey Wright as The Watcher, once again, along with Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Laurence Fishburne as Goliath, Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight, Simu Liu as Xu Shang-Chi, Kathryn Hahn as Agatha Harkness, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Cap, Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter. Plus a few other surprises, of course. Looks like it has a rad Gundam style Avengers segment. Up for an adventure? […]",
