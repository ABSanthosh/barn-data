  "text": "Adele delivered an emotional farewell speech during her final Las Vegas residency date on Saturday night at the Colosseum Theatre at Caesars Palace. “It’s been wonderful and I will miss it terribly, and I will miss you terribly,” Adele told the audience, according to videos circulating online. “I don’t know when I next want to perform again.” She added, “I’m not doing anything else. I’m actually shitting myself about what I am going to do. I don’t have any fucking plans.” The singer’s “Weekends With Adele” residency began in November 2022. Earlier this year, Adele announced that she would take a step back from music following the conclusion of her Las Vegas residency. Popular on Variety “I don’t have any plans for new music, at all,” Adele revealed in July. “I want a big break after this and I think I want to do other creative things, just for a little while.” At her final show on Saturday night, though, Adele assured the audience that she will eventually “be back.” “The only thing I’m good at is singing,” she continued. “I just don’t know when I want to next come on stage, but I love you.” Adele explained that she decided to do a residency instead of touring because of her son, Angelo. “I chose to do a residency so I could keep his life normal,” she said, adding that she’s now able to spend her weekends with him. Adele also thanked her fiancé Rich Paul for “always picking me up and making me feel like I could do whatever I want to do.” She then took a moment on stage to acknowledge Celine Dion, who attended one of Adele’s residency shows in October. The “My Heart Will Go On” singer opened the Colosseum with her first residency in 2003. “I am emotional but also, just so you know, I got closure when Celine Dion came to my show a few weeks ago,” Adele said. “I cried for a whole week … It was just such a full-circle moment for me because that’s the only reason I ever wanted to be in here.”",
