  "description": "\"Red Sox decided to compete - player for player, dollar for dollar.\" Netflix has unveiled the trailer for the sports documentary series called The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox streaming in October during this final month of baseball season. By director Colin Barnicle (The Hobby: Collecting America's Pastime), an inside look at the iconic Red Sox baseball team and how this happened in 2004. This definitive series chronicles one of the greatest comebacks in sports history when the Boston Red Sox overcame a 3-0 series deficit to defeat their archrivals the New York Yankees en route to winning their first World Series title in 86 years and breaking the infamous \"Curse of the Bambino\" (more on that). As the title indicates, this happened in 2004 and it was a major moment in sports history (they beat the Yankees before beating the St. Louis Cardinals for the World Series victory that year). Barnicle explains that this docu series is about digging into it: \"I want them to know how it happened – how an organization changed with new ownership, how the ...",

Barnicle explains that this docu series is about digging into it: \"I want them to know how it happened – how an organization changed with new ownership, how the team was built from the front office and how the clubhouse came together.\" This looks pretty good. Here's the official trailer for Netflix's doc series The Comeback: 2004 Boston Red Sox, from YouTube: \"This series is not just about the 2004 ALCS. That’s the ending. As fans, we know what happened. I want them to know how it happened – how an organization changed with new ownership, how the team was built from the front office and how the clubhouse came together. It’s not a straight line from 86 years of losing to champions. Sometimes, it's funny. Sometimes, it's heart wrenching. There were considerable bumps along the way. But how those trials and tribulations defined the decision making and the chemistry of the team is how they were able to come back from three games down in the ALCS. It didn’t start with Game Four of the ALCS.\" –Director Colin Barnicle The Comeback revisits one of the greatest comebacks in sports history when the Boston Red Sox overcame a 3-0 series deficit to defeat their archrivals the New York Yankees, en route to winning their first World Series title in 86 years and breaking the infamous \"Curse of the Bambino.\" Debuting in October, this definitive three-part doc series celebrates the 20th anniversary of the team's groundbreaking postseason run with new, exclusive interviews featuring key players and figures including: Pedro Martinez, David Ortiz, Kevin Millar, Terry Francona, and Theo Epstein, among many others.
