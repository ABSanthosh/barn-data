This isn't the first film about him - there's also The Hours and Times - this is more of a straightforward look at his short life.

This will be streaming on Prime Video in the UK this fall, but still has no US debut set yet. Looks solid - the performances all matter the most making it an engaging watch. Enjoy. Here's the full official UK trailer (+ poster) for Joe Stephenson's Midas Man, direct from YouTube: Meet Brian Epstein: a man who lived a thousand lives in a few years, and a visionary who transformed music history. From running a Liverpool record store to shaping the sound of a generation, his journey is a rollercoaster of ambition, passion, and relentless pursuit of greatness. Jacob Fortune-Lloyd stars as the mastermind behind The Beatles' meteoric rise, navigating a whirlwind of unprecedented fame, cultural revolution, and personal demons. But behind the glitz and glamour lies a man seeking acceptance and love in a world not ready. Midas Man peels back the curtain on the swinging '60s, revealing the triumphs, heartbreaks, and secrets of the man who changed the face of music forever. Step into Brian’s world, where every touch turns to gold, but the most precious treasure remains just out of reach. Midas Man is directed by British filmmaker Joe Stephenson, director of the films Chicken, Agatha and the Midnight Murders, and Doctor Jekyll, plus the doc film McKellen: Playing the Part and eps of the series \"Ackley Bridge\". The script is written by Brigit Grant. Produced by Perry Trevers, Trevor Beattie, Jeremy Chatterton, William Dietrich, Richard Holmes, and Tom Reeve. Signature Ent. will debut Midas Man streaming in the UK on Prime Video starting October 30th, 2024 this fall. No US release is confirmed yet - stay tuned. Any good?
