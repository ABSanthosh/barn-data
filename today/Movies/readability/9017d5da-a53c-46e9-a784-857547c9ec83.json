  "text": "The White Lotus has everyone buzzing on the kiss between Patrick Schwarzenegger‘s Saxon and Sam Nivola‘s Lochlan. On the latest episode of the HBO series from March 16, the Ratliff brothers shared a kiss that was hinted from the beginning of Season 3. Reactions to the incestuous moment have taken over social media and filming the scene was awkward for those involved as well. In a new interview, Schwarzenegger’s co-star Charlotte Le Bon gave insight to how it was filming the scene. “Well obviously they’re not brothers by blood, so that made it easier,” Le Bon told Vulture. “I think for Patrick it was really difficult. For Sam, he was kind of like, ‘It’s whatever, let’s just do it well one time and it will be over.’ You know? Because if you don’t do it well the first time, then you have to do it over and over again.” She continued, “But Patrick’s reaction in the episode is his genuine reaction. We all thought he was going to throw up. And Sam was like, ‘It’s fine, it’s just a kiss, calm down!’” Watch on Deadline Le Bon plays Chloe, the character that instigated the moment between the Ratliff brothers. “I think Chloe is deeply, deeply bored,” she added. “There’s a void inside of her. She fills that void with partying, sex and chaos. This kiss between the two brothers for her is just pure entertainment, which is obviously really evil when you think about it.” White Lotus EP David Bernad said the incest storyline was not for shock, telling the NY Post, “No, in terms of that — that’s all [creator Mike White]. Mike is brilliant, and I think those big story turns are not just for shock. There’s a specific reason in terms of the narrative storytelling, and the larger thematic idea Mike is trying to get across.”",
