  "text": "Sony has nudged the release for Tom Holland‘s fourth “Spider-Man” installment by one week, shifting it from July 24, 2026 to a new date of July 31, 2026. That now positions the Marvel entry for launch two weeks after Universal’s July 17, 2026 release of “The Odyssey,” Christopher Nolan’s next film which also stars Holland. Along with giving Holland some breathing room from opening two prospective blockbusters within a week of one another, the adjustment also has key repercussions for exhibitor operations. Before Sony’s scheduling change, the next live-action “Spider-Man” would have released just one week after “The Odyssey.” That film continues Nolan’s decades-long relationship with Imax, shooting with the company’s powerful cameras and negotiating a dedicated theatrical window in its premium auditoriums. Presumably, Sony is also looking to release the new “Spider-Man” to Imax and other premium large format screens, as it has with its previous Marvel Comics adaptations. With this new “Spider-Man” date, “The Odyssey” now has two weeks of play without a wide release that would contend for Imax real estate. Such a pile-up occurred in July 2023, when Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning” (né “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One”) played Imax auditoriums for only a little more than a week before Universal and Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” took over venues. Popular on Variety It took a few years after the 2021 release of the multiverse-spanning “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” but Sony finally added Holland’s next outing as Peter Parker to its theatrical slate four months ago. Destin Daniel Cretton is directing. The film is expected to begin production this summer, though no casting details have been announced beyond Holland. It remains unclear if Zendaya, who has played love interest MJ in all three Holland entries, is returning for this fourth entry. It is known, however, that Zendaya will appear in Nolan’s “The Odyssey,” starring alongside Holland. The adaptation of Homer’s time-proven ancient Greek epic poem began production just weeks ago, with Universal releasing a first look at Matt Damon in the lead role of Odysseus. The film also stars Mia Goth, Anne Hathaway, Lupita Nyong’o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron, Benny Safdie, Jon Bernthal and John Leguizamo.",
