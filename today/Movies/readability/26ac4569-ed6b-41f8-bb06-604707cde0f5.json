  "text": "Three series produced by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, had No. 1 premieres this week across three different external platforms: “We Were Liars” debuted on Prime Video on June 18; “The Waterfront” dropped on Netflix on June 19; and Season 3 of “The Gilded Age” began on June 22 on HBO. “The Waterfront,” created by Kevin Williamson, became one of only four new dramas this year to top Netflix’s global Top 10, earning 53.3 million hours viewed in its first week. Meanwhile, “The Gilded Age” landed on the top 10 Max list within 24 hours of its premiere; the episode drew 2.7 million U.S. cross-platform viewers within its first three days of availability. “We Were Liars” is based on E. Lockhart’s bestselling novel and showrun by Julie Plec and Carina Adly MacKenzie. During a recent interview with Variety, the team shared that they’re hopeful for a second season, but also planned an ending that could serve as a series finale, should that happen. Popular on Variety “Emily wrote three books and we love this world. We love our cast. We’d love the opportunity that exists for more story, so we’re hopeful that we’ll get to come back and do more,” said MacKenzie. “But also, should this be a limited series, I think it’s a beautiful story.” Universal Studio Group also saw successes at three other studios over the weekend; Universal International Studios’ “The Survivors” remained in Netflix’s Top 10 for its third week; UCP’s “Resident Alien” landed in the Top 10 on Peacock; and Unverisal Television Alternative Studio’s reality competition series “Destination X” appeared in the Top 10 this past week. All four studios are divisions of Universal Studio Group, helmed by Pearlena Igbokwe. Erin Underhill is the president of Universal Television, with Toby Gorman as president of Universal Television Alternative Studio. Beatrice Springborn serves as the president of UCP and Universal International Studios.",
