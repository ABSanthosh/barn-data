  "text": "Sylvester Stallone is nearing a deal to return for at least two more seasons of the Paramount+ drama series “Tulsa King,” Variety has confirmed with sources. Stallone, who is also an executive producer on the show, leads the cast of the mob drama, with his new deal paving the way for a two-season pickup for Seasons 3 \u0026 4. Sources stressed, however, that the show has not been formally renewed at this point. Reps for Paramount declined to comment. Per the official logline, the show ” follows New York mafia capo Dwight “The General” Manfredi ( Stallone), just after he is released from prison after 25 years and unceremoniously exiled by his boss to set up shop in Tulsa, Okla. Realizing that his mob family may not have his best interests in mind, Dwight slowly builds a ‘crew’ from a group of unlikely characters, to help him establish a new criminal empire in a place that to him might as well be another planet.” Along with Stallone, the cast includes Jay Will, Max Casella, Andrea Savage, Martin Starr, Garrett Hedlund, Vincent Piazza, Dana Delany, and Annabella Sciorra. Both Neal McDonough and Frank Grillo joined the show in its second season. Popular on Variety “Yellowstone” mastermind Taylor Sheridan created “Tulsa King” under his expansive overall deal with Paramount Global. It marks the first regular television role of Stallone’s storied career. The show opened solidly with its first season in 2022, with the show’s second season garnering even more praise with its launch in September. Season 2 currently has a perfect 100% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Sheridan is also an executive producer on the series along with Terence Winter, Stallone, David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle, Bob Yari, David Hutkin, Allen Coulter and Braden Aftergood. The series is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios and 101 Studios. Deadline first reported Stallone’s new deal.",
