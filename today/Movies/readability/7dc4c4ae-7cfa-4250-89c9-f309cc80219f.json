  "text": "HBO In its first season, “The Last of Us” chronicled the journey of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they traveled across the United States 20 years after a fungal pandemic has decimated the global population and turned any infected person into a mindless zombie called a clicker. Ellie is immune to the fungal infection, and Joel’s job is to deliver her to the Fireflies, a paramilitary group focused on finding a cure for the fungus and saving humanity. Over the course of Season 1, however, Joel and Ellie develop a profound, father and daughter bond; when he learns that Ellie has to die so her brain can be harvested for a cure, he snaps. On a rampage to save Ellie’s life, he kills most of the Fireflies, including the doctor who was about to operate on an unconscious Ellie. When Ellie wakes up, Joel lies to her, saying that there are other people who are immune like her, so the Fireflies didn’t need her after all to create a cure. As they arrive at the settlement in Jackson, Wyoming, where Joel’s brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna) has been living, Ellie makes Joel swear that he’s telling her the truth. He does, and she decides to believe him (or so it seems). Season 2 is set five years later, as Joel and Ellie contend with the fallout of Joel’s decisions at the end of Season 1. The cast is almost entirely new, and even more sprawling than in Season 1, so here’s a guide of who is who this season on “The Last of Us.” Joel (Pedro Pascal) Image Credit: HBO Past work: “The Mandalorian,” “Gladiator II,” “The Wild Robot” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is happening with the character when we first see him? Joel is a crucial member of the Jackson community, helping to supervise construction of new housing and the repair of existing structures. He’s also dealing with a profound estrangement from Ellie, which has driven him to seek help from a therapist in town. Ellie (Bella Ramsey) Image Credit: HBO Past work: “Catherine Called Birdy,” “Game of Thrones” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is going on with the character when we first see her? She’s 19 now, and has had five years of growing up and living in the Jackson settlement. She’s never been in a safe community like that before. That’s brought its challenges. She’s sort of living with Joel and being his kid in more of the real world, with other people around them, and navigating new relationships she’s having with other people. That has created some friction. And also the lie that he tells at the end of Season 1, that is hanging over Ellie. She said that she believes him, but I think there’s a part of her that didn’t. That’s still something that’s playing on her mind. Have you played “The Last of Us Part II”? I did not. I’m not a gamer. I really tried, but I just spent way too long in a room that’s completely irrelevant, looking at all the details. The level of detail and artistry in the game is so rich that it will take me forever to get through it. But I watched a walkthrough of it, like I did for Season 1. Thank goodness for those people who play the games and put it on YouTube, because that has was so helpful for me.  How long do you think you would survive if you were put into the world of this show?  I actually think I’d survive a while. Whenever I play laser tag — which is probably not equivalent to the fungal apocalypse — I literally survive forever. I get myself in a corner with my back against the wall so that my back’s protected, and then I just look out for people, and then find a new place to hide. So I think I’m pretty nifty. And I learned jujitsu and fight training for this season. So I feel like I’m gonna fare pretty well for a while — until it all goes horribly wrong, which eventually it will. Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) Past Work: “Unbelievable,” “Booksmart,” “Apple Cider Vinegar” Faction: Abby’s Crew What is going on with your character when we first see her? In the first episode, we’re seeing a very broken down and raw Abby. It’s kind of a refreshing thing to see, I think, because the people who have played the game it’s a very different introduction to Abby. She’s just experienced immense loss, and she’s just trying to figure out how to cope with that. We’re seeing her as a very broken person as she’s figuring out her new dynamic with the Fireflies as well.  What’s your favorite part of “The Last of Us Part II” game? In the game, there’s a button on the front of the controller, I think it’s R1. You can press it to go behind walls, so you can see where there’s a clicker on the other side of the wall. I liked that part of the gameplay because you could get a layout for where the clickers were. Also just the storytelling in that first game is really beautiful and stands alone. I haven’t played a lot of games, but my dad has, and he’s like ‘There’s not a game out there like this,’ so I trust him. I did really like the experience of playing it with him, that was really nice. How long do you think you would survive if you were put into the world of this show?  Ooh, to put a timeline on that is hard. I think I could go a long time. Dina (Isabela Merced) Past work: “Alien: Romulus,” “Madame Web,” “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is going on with your character when we first meet her? I think Dina is making the most of every moment, really having fun, probably realizing that she’s chosen to neglect responsibilities pushing away Jesse yet again. Knowing that maybe in the end, they weren’t meant to be together, but it made sense at the time. Now she’s embracing this loving relationship with Ellie and trying to mend the relationship that Ellie and Joel have, because she’s developed this sort of strong relationship with Joel in the process of growing closer to Ellie. Have you played “The Last of Us Part II?” What were you excited to see brought to life in the series? I was more excited for what they would add to it, in addition to what was in the game, because I know there’s so much. When I found out the music shop scene was being included, which was one of my favorites in the game, I was really excited. How long do you think you would survive if you were put into the world of this show?  I wouldn’t want to survive. I feel like that’s not for me. No, thanks. Yeah, I’m good. I like my spoiled little life right now. Tommy (Gabriel Luna) Past work: “Fubar,” “Terminator: Dark Fate,” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is going on with your character when we find him in season two? Our family is now these five people, and being blood with Joel has helped me wrap my arms around Ellie. I think having Benjamin has helped her [Maria] receive Joel. These different fractured elements of our family from the first season have now come to be this unit, with all of our family secrets and things we keep from each other. We start in this really great place, you can see us all working together pretty seamlessly. Have you played “The Last of Us Part II?” I did. I played both before we started season one, so that has really helped me create this through line that really hasn’t stopped. I felt the story was whole when I first received it through the source material, and now it’s a very natural, seamless continuation of the story. That’s what I’m so proud of watching this first episode, how it doesn’t feel like we have to reset everything to make people understand it.  How long do you think you would survive if you were put into the world of this show?  I used to be a lot faster than I am now, but I am a pretty good shot. So maybe a while. But is a world without gummy bears and Cheetos a world you want to live in? I did play the game in grounded mode because and I died in the streets of Austin, running, carrying Sarah in my arms as I’m following me, Tommy, through this thing. I get my belt loop caught on the fence because I just got stuck, and I got eaten. Right away. That was the end of the game, 10 minutes in. So 10 minutes. Maria (Rutina Wesley) Past work: “Queen Sugar,” “True Blood” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is going on with your character when we find her in season two? When we first pick up, we’re five years after the first season and we have our beautiful gift, our son Benji, who we love dearly. He’s brought me and Tommy closer together, and Benji is Maria’s light. Not that she was dark, but because she’s lost a son before, she had some grief pent up in a dark place and never wanted to talk about it. Having Benji allowed her back to the light, which is so beautiful. He’s made her softer. She’s still a general, she’s ruling a certain way, but it’s with a softer hand.  Have you played “The Last of Us Part II?” I didn’t play the game. I wanted to develop Maria on my own and find her essence, but now I kind of want to play. How long do you think you would survive if you were put into the world of this show?  I wouldn’t make it. I don’t think I’d make it too far. Jesse (Young Mazino) Past work: “Beef,” “Opus” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is going on with your character when we first see him? Jesse is a stalwart member of the community, and really just in the grind of things trying to keep his community afloat. I think even in the beginning of the season, Jackson has been around for some time now, and they’re starting to get a larger and larger influx of refugees looking for a sanctuary, and so there’s a lot of work to be done. Jesse’s a pillar of the community, so he’s trying to foster a strong sense of that throughout. Have you played “The Last of Us Part II?” What were you excited to see brought to life in the series? Yeah. I was excited to tackle Jesse as a character because Stephen Chang, the original actor for Jesse in the game, brought such a nice, cool, calm energy to the character. My last job, I was playing this kind of unhinged dude on the Netflix show, so it was a nice departure. How long do you think you would survive if you were put into the world of this show?  I think I’ll be okay. Yeah, I’d be fine. I’d be all right. Gail (Catherine O’Hara) Image Credit: HBO Past work: “The Studio,” “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” “Schitt’s Creek” Faction: Jackson Settlement What is happening with the character when we first meet her? Gail works as a therapist in the Jackson settlement, and Joel is one of her patients. She was married to Eugene (Joe Pantoliano), another Jackson citizen, but he died roughly a year before the events of Season 2. Manny (Danny Ramirez) Past work: “Captain America: Brave New World,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Black Mirror” Faction: Abby’s Crew What is happening with the character when we first meet him? Manny was part of the Fireflies group that Joel massacred at the end of Season 1, and now operates as a reliable soldier in Abby’s mission to find Joel. Nora (Tati Gabrielle) Past work: “You,” “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,”“Uncharted” Faction: Abby’s Crew What is happening with the character when we first meet her? Nora was part of the Fireflies group that Joel massacred at the end of Season 1, and now operates as a medic in Abby’s mission to find Joel. Mel (Ariela Barer) Past work: “How To Blow Up a Pipeline,” “Marvel’s Runaways” Faction: Abby’s Crew What is happening with the character when we first meet her? Mel is another medic from the group of Fireflies Joel massacred at the end of Season 1, and has joined Abby in her hunt for Joel. She’s also dating Owen (Spencer Lord), a fellow Firefly. Owen (Spencer Lord) Past work: “Riverdale,” “The Good Doctor” Faction: Abby’s Crew What is happening with the character when we first meet him? Owen was one of the Firefly soldiers present during Joel’s massacre at the end of Season 1. In Season 2, he’s joined his girlfriend Mel in helping Abby search for Joel.
