With Season 12 only premiering in January 2024, avid viewers of the show received a heartful surprise when it was announced that its follow-up edition would also come out in the same year. However, a fresh chapter in the franchise also brings with it the prospect of the departure of several characters. The twelfth edition famously bid adieu to four lead actors as well as their characters. As such, fans are wondering if other pivotal characters, including Miranda Rae Mayo’s Stella Kidd, will be leaving Chicago Fire this term as well. But, why is Kidd one of the prime candidates to exit the show? Here’s all you need to know regarding the supposed departure of the renowned television actress from the series. Is Miranda Rae Mayo’s Stella Kidd leaving Chicago Fire? At the time of writing, Chicago Fire showrunners have yet to confirm whether or not Stella Kidd is leaving the show. However, fans have speculated that her exit is just a matter of time, as per the ongoing arc of Rae Mayo’s character. Kidd is currently mired in a heated scuffle with her partner’s brother, Jack Damon. The Truck 81 lieutenant was majorly responsible for Damon’s dismissal to the floater pool. Her part in Damon’s ousting also put Mrs. Severide in the crosshairs of Chief Pascal. Taking into consideration Kidd’s desire to mother children, it could prove difficult for her to juggle both responsibilities simultaneously. As such, fans have speculated that Stella Kidd’s wish to start a family could lead to her leaving Chicago Fire. However, the actress recently acknowledged this dilemma and stated that her character’s plan to have kids could take a backseat for some time. Rae Mayo addressed the issue while talking to Soaps.com, shedding more light on whether Stella Kidd is leaving Chicago Fire. “I also think that a big part of her not wanting to have kids yet is she hasn’t been a truck Lieutenant for that long,” she said. “I think there is a part of herself that really wants to kind of validate Boden’s belief in her, wants to validate her belief in herself and prove to herself that she can be a good leader,” she further stated. The Blood \u0026 Oil star also added, “Having a kid right now would totally take her out of the action for a decent amount of time, at least a year. And I don’t think she’s ready for that right now.” While there is a considerable chance of Stella Kidd leaving Chicago Fire, Rae Mayo’s statements suggest that the event could take place after a delayed period.",
