  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Blumhouse has laid off six staffers across film, television and casting, Deadline has learned. A spokesperson for the independent studio, which employs around 100 people, confirmed that due to restructuring, six roles were impacted last week. Those departing are believed to include largely junior-level executives and support staff, with Manager, Creative Development Haley Pigman, who has worked on such Blumhouse movies as the March release The Woman in the Yard, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, among them. The cuts come two weeks after the disappointing opening of Blumhouse’s M3GAN 2.0, which has performed below expectations. None of the executives affected by the layoffs worked on the film, sources said. The restructuring of multiple divisions and subsequent headcount reduction follows the downsizing of the TV division in 2023 when Chris McCumber stepped down as Blumhouse Television President and under 10 people were laid off. (He was replaced by Melissa Aouate who was named TV President in April.) Watch on Deadline A number of indie TV studios have been hit hard by the ongoing TV industry contraction. Blumhouse’s TV slate includes the upcoming Scarpetta series for Prime Video starring Nicole Kidman and Jamie Lee Curtis. On the feature side, the studio has coming up Black Phone 2, opening Oct. 17, and Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, releasing Dec. 5.",
