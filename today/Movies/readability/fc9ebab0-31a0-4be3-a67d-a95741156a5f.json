As much as it may seem like some conspiracy theory doc, it's anything but – it's the true story of an atomic bomb facility. The film tells the story of how the U.S. secretly manufactured thousands of atomic weapons in the suburbs of Denver, leaving behind a toxic legacy that will persist for many generations. Colorado's Rocky Flats plant produced a staggering 70K atomic bombs, each serving as a \"trigger\" for thermonuclear warheads. Concealed by U.S. government secrecy, the plant's fires, leaks, \u0026 illicit dumping of nuclear waste contaminated the Denver area with long-lived radioactive toxins.

As someone who grew up in Colorado, I'm fascinated by this harrowing true story (the plant was shut down for good in 1992). Scary they got away with it for so long. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jeff Gipe's doc Half-Life of Memory, direct from YouTube: In the suburbs of Denver, Colorado, the U.S. government manufactured thousands of atomic weapons, leaving behind a toxic legacy that will persist for generations.​​ The Rocky Flats plant (Wikipedia) produced a staggering 70,000 atomic bombs, each serving as a “trigger” for thermonuclear warheads. Shrouded in government secrecy, the plant's fires, leaks, and illicit dumping of nuclear waste contaminated the Denver area with long-lived radioactive toxins. ​A major — and highly visible — plutonium fire sparked a decade of mass protests, culminating in an unprecedented FBI raid that ultimately shuttered the plant. Through powerful testimonials and extraordinary archival media, the documentary film Half-Life of Memory exposes Rocky Flats's dark past and enduring impact, prompting critical reflection on the implications of the nation’s renewed nuclear weapons buildup and ongoing construction of another new \"trigger\" factory. Half-Life of Memory: America's Forgotten Atomic Bomb Factory is a doc directed by newcomer filmmaker Jeff Gipe, making his feature directorial debut; he also works as a visual artist. His father was employed at the Rocky Flats Plant. Produced by Erick Daniel de Jesus and Jeff Gipe. This initially premiered at the 2024 Denver Film Festival this fall. Freestyle will debut Gipe's Half-Life of Memory doc direct-to-VOD starting January 24th, 2025 coming soon. For info - head to the film's official site. Would you like to know more?
