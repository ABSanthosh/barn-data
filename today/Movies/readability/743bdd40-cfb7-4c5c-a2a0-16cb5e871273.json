  "text": "Don’t you forget about them. For the first time in four decades and just a little past the 1985 classic film’s 40th anniversary, all five stars of John Hughes’ The Breakfast Club reunited. Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy all took the stage during a panel conversation celebrating the seminal coming-of-age drama at Chicago Comic \u0026 Entertainment Expo yesterday. As they were introduced by moderator Josh Horowitz, the cast walked out to the “Colonel Bogey March,” the same track the teenagers whistled to in the movie that fateful day in detention. During the panel, which you can view in full here, the actors discussed working with the storied writer-director Hughes and their on-set memories, taking questions from the audience and speaking to the movie’s enduring legacy. Watch on Deadline “I feel really, very emotional and moved to have us all together,” Ringwald said, per Today. “This is the first time that Emilio has joined us. We don’t have to use the cardboard cutout anymore because he’s here.” Estevez addressed his absence during previous reunion events, saying, “I skipped all of my high school reunions, so this just was something that finally I felt I needed to do just for myself. But Josh, this one felt special. It’s here in Chicago, where we made the film, and obviously the 40th anniversary, and it just felt like it was time.” Shot at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, Ill., The Breakfast Club which left an indelible mark in the teen bildungsroman genre, saw five disparate archetypical high schoolers come together, form unforgettable bonds and go through adolescent growing pains during one Saturday detention under the watchful eye of a domineering principal.",
