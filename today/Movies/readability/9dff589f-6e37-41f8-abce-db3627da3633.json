Set to return is Cillian Murphy, reprising his role as Thomas Shelby and executive-producing the Tom Harper (Heart of Stone, Wild Rose)-directed Netflix film continuation. Joining Murphy are Rebecca Ferguson (Dune, Silo), Barry Keoghan (Saltburn, The Banshees of Inisherin), and Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) – and it looks like we can add Stephen Graham (Line of Duty) to that list. Image: Netflix Speaking with Deadline Hollywood during Tuesday night's London Film Festival (LFF) red carpet, Graham noted that he was \"looking forward to seeing the lads again.\" The actor previously played Hayden Stagg during the sixth and final season of the series, appearing in two episodes. Here's a look at the video of Graham mentioning that he would be joining the return film. And here's a look at the post that went out at the end of last month, confirming that production was underway: Speaking with IndieWire in support of his film Bird at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, Keoghan wasn't able to go into much detail about what fans can expect, but he did have some things to say about the script – including that he's read it. \"I wouldn't be attached to it if I didn't [read the script],\" Keoghan shared. \"But yeah, I read the script and loved it and have chatted to Cillian [Murphy] about it and it's going to be epic.\" Here's a look back at the announcement that went out at the beginning of June, showing off the cover of the film's script – followed by comments from Murphy, Harper, and Knight: \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me… It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of 'Peaky Blinders.' This is one for the fans,\" Murphy shared. \"When I first directed 'Peaky Blinders' over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive. 'Peaky' has always been a story about family – and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix,\" Harper added. \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen,\" Knight shared. \"It will be an explosive chapter in the 'Peaky Blinders' story. No holds barred. Full on 'Peaky Blinders' at war.\" Knight penned the script for the film and is co-producing alongside Murphy, Caryn Mandabach, and Guy Heeley. Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren, and David Mason are set as executive producers. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!
