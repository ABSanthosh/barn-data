  "description": "\"The boy is out of the box.\" ðŸ“¦ You've never seen anything like this film before! A hilarious new short film is finally online after playing at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year. Meat Puppet is a hilarious comedy short film created by a British-Greek filmmaker named Eros V. The film won the Audience Award at SXSW and played at a bunch of other festivals and is now online to watch. It's a knock out! On the day he promised his girlfriend he'd grow up, a man-child inadvertently traps himself inside a puppet. How will he get back to his old fleshy meat bag self?! Meat Puppet stars David Jonsson (the super talented young actor seen in Alien: Romulus and Rye Lane) along with MÃ¡irÃ©ad Tyers and Gregg Chilingirian. This concept is crazy to begin with, but it's executed in just the right way to be super funny and exceptionally awkward, which is not easy to pull off. The puppet is also real - created and puppeted by Hugh Purves. Just click on play below. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on this funny short landing online. Brief intro from YouTube: \"On the day he promised [â€¦]",
