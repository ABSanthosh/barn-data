  "text": "Marc Maron called out Bill Maher on the latest episode of the “WTF” podcast, which featured CNN host W. Kamau Bell as a guest (via The Daily Beast). Maron took issue with the “Real Time” host for being partial to “some of the things” Donald Trump is doing in his second administration as U.S. president. “Are you going to be like Bill Maher, you know, ‘I’m going to agree with some of the things that Trump is doing,’” Maron said. “It’s like, dude, you’re a bitch.” Per The Daily Beast: “[Maron] host continued to make fun of Maher for finding points of connection with members of the MAGA coalition, imitating him as he added, “”I like Kid Rock.” And now you’re gonna blow him with a slightly disdainful look on your face? That’s who you are?” Popular on Variety Maron has been critical of podcasters supporting Trump in the past. Before last year’s election, Trump appeared on Joe Rogan’s popular Spotify podcast. Shortly after, Maron posted a blog post in which he called out “comedians with podcasts” who “joke around” with “shameless, self-proclaimed white supremacists and fascists on their show,” saying, “all it does is humanize and normalize fascism.” “Even though I do not do a political show I have been very clear in my specials and on the podcast that I believe, and have believed for years, what is brewing in this country is an American fascist movement rooted half in grievance and half in Jesus and enabled by tech oligarchs and an inundation of propaganda from many sources,” Maron wrote at the time. “Well, it’s fully percolated and pouring into the minds of all of us. It is shameless and proud. Culturally, the combination of blatant racist fear mongering and the anti-woke movement has delivered their message for the future. A future that marginalizes almost all voices.” He continued that the “anti-woke flank of the new fascism” is being “driven almost exclusively by comics, my peers. Whether or not they are self-serving or true believers in the new fascism is unimportant. They are of the movement. Whether they see themselves as acolytes or just comics doesn’t matter. Whether they are driven by the idea that what they are fighting for is a free speech issue or whether they are truly morally bankrupt racists doesn’t matter. They are part of the public face of a fascist political movement that seeks to destroy the democratic idea.” Listen to Maron’s latest episode of the “WTF” podcast here.",
