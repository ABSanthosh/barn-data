  "text": "In the pop-star tradition of Cher, Madonna and Lady Gaga, Chappell Roan might add actress to her resume. The Grammy winner revealed that she recently met legendary cult filmmaker John Waters, who encouraged Roan to embrace her inner thespian and give acting a try. “I met John Waters last night, which was insane,” she told W Magazine. “One of my idols! And I was talking about how there are only so many ‘firsts’ you can have with your career.” Roan continued, “And he said, ‘No, no, no—there are all the firsts to go through when you become an actress!’ And I said, ‘I’m not an actress—what are you talking about?’ He said, ‘Every singer is an actress!’ And I was like, okay, maybe I am! Damn! If John Waters says I’m an actress, maybe I am!” Watch on Deadline After breaking out with her 2023 debut studio album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, Roan won her first Grammy this year for Best New Artist. Meanwhile, Waters’ two-decade hiatus from filmmaking after his 2004 satire A Dirty Shame was interrupted when Village Roadshow Entertainment optioned his novel Liarmouth: A Feel-Bad Romance in 2022, with Waters set to write and direct. Although Waters said in April 2024 that he had a good script in place, with Aubrey Plaza onboard to star as the titular Marsha ‘Liarmouth’ Sprinkle, they “don’t have the money to make it.” In November, he revealed that the adaptation is no longer happening.",
