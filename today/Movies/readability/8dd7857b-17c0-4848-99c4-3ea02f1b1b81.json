His ambitious goal of completing over 1,000 backflips in 24 hours came to an abrupt halt, sparking concern and curiosity among his fans. After several days offline, Speed returned to explain what happened and how the extreme challenge took a toll on his body. Here’s what we know about the situation and the details behind his sudden absence. IShowSpeed, YouTube star Darren “IShowSpeed” Jason Watkins Jr., recently shared a health update after attempting a 24-hour backflip challenge. His goal was to break the world record by completing more than 1,001 backflips. However, after completing 660 flips, IShowSpeed had to stop due to being temporarily paralysed, which prevented him from continuing or streaming for four days. On October 12, 2024, Speed returned to streaming and shared that he had trouble moving his legs after the challenge. He considered going to the hospital and explained that the intense physical strain caused his absence. Despite some viewers’ skepticism, Speed stressed how difficult it was to perform 650 backflips in one day. Although Speed did not break the record, previously set by Austria’s Nico Scheicher in 2019, he remains determined to try again. He announced his intention to attempt the challenge in a month or two, promising to come back stronger. During the livestream, he took several breaks to conserve his energy. However, even a massage therapist arranged by fellow internet personality Jake Paul couldn’t help him overcome the physical exhaustion. Speed’s attempt is part of a growing trend where streamers attempt to break world records while live. Recent challenges include Censor breaking the 24-hour pull-up record and PineappleHoops setting a new “butt-hooping” record. Speed’s effort, despite the setback, gained recognition from Andrew Tate, who praised his dedication and hard work.",
