  "text": "Streaming might be the future, but physical media is still the present. It’s also awesome, depending on the title, the label, and the release, so each week we take a look at the new Blu-rays and DVDs making their way into the world. Welcome to this week in Home Video for September 3rd and 10th! These weeks’ home video selection includes the blockbuster Inside Out 2, Wind River in 4K, some 80s genre pics from Kino, and more. Check out our picks below. Wind River [4K UHD, steelbook] What is it? A tracker and an FBI agent investigate a woman’s death. Why see it? Taylor Sheridan is best known these days for his television empire including Yellowstone, 1883, and more, but his feature work is equally compelling stuff. This thriller sets its sights on a sad truth that still doesn’t get enough attention — the violence committed against Native American women even to this day. Here a young woman’s death brings together a game tracker (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) to catch the men responsible. There are some memorable sequences here, powerful at times too, and while Sheridan’s take on women ain’t great the end result still compels. The film is set in the remote areas of Wyoming, and the cinematography captures both the beauty and the haunting isolation of it all. [Extras: Deleted scenes] The Best The Antichrist [4K UHD, KL Studio Classics] What is it? A man tries to help his paralyzed daughter but instead welcomes evil. Why see it? We’ve all been there. Using hypnosis to help a kid only to unknowingly invite it an evil entity that turns out lives into a living hell. What starts as a character drama of sorts, quickly shifts to become a rip off of William Friedkin’s The Exorcist — Warner Bros. even sued! — brought to life with Italian flair. That last bit’s important as it’s what raises Alberto de Martino’s film above the fray. It’s an over the top festival of goop, nudity, and attractive visuals (both via special effects and cinematography). Another highlight here is the lead performance of Carla Gravina as the target of the possession. It’s no real competition to Friedkin’s film, but as knockoffs go, it’s pretty special. [Extras: Commentary, featurette] Inside Out 2 What is it? A sequel. Why see it? Hi, it’s me, the one person on earth who doesn’t love Inside Out because, and I mean this, Sadness is just too goddamn annoying. She’s back for the sequel along with Joy and the others, but she’s far less grating this time out as focus is given to a bevy of other emotions exploring how our brains work despite the chaos. It’s fun, colorful, and occasionally heartwarming, but its biggest strength is its ability to juggle the emotions the same way our own brains do. It may be far from my favorite Pixar — A Bug’s Life, obviously — but its charms are undeniable. Now what are the odds Pixar returns to more personal and far more memorable fare like Luca and Turning Red? [Extras: Featurettes, deleted scenes] Late Night With the Devil [steelbook] What is it? A talk show host gets a Halloween scare. Why see it? While its attempts to reach the highs of Ghostwatch don’t quite succeed, this riff on a live taping that goes horribly wrong — as in the horror of demonic antics — still manages a good time. Its biggest strength is star David Dastmalchian who brings the late night TV host to life, both as a charismatic personality and as a man whose secrets come back to haunt him. The third act loses its grip as things ramp up in varying ways, but the film’s core as a live show running off the rails remains a satisfying time. This steelbook edition is a slick affair adding in some physical extras for fans making it a solid pickup for those aching for a rewatch and celebration of the film. [Extras: Commentary, Q\u0026A, featurette, art cards] The Rest Arctic Circle: Seasons 1-3 What is it? A chilly series of murders and mayhem. Why see it? It’s been a few years now since the invasion of thriller, procedural series from Norway, Sweden, and the like hit America. We’ve seen some great stuff since then, some high profile, but most has been sneaking across the border with far fewer eyes. This Finnish series — all three seasons are included — is a good one following a female police officer working her way up to police chief in the Arctic Circle. The mysteries are compelling, but more than that, the scenery makes for a more unique entry in the genre. It’s well-acted, engaging television, and fans of short season thrills should give it a spin. [Extras: None] Avenging Force [KL Studio Classics] What is it? An ex-agent fights right-wing terrorists! Why see it? Cannon Films in the 80s? Guaranteed B-movie fun. This 1986 effort sees Michael Dudikoff take the lead as an ex-Secret Service agent whose attempt to help a friend lands him and his younger sister in trouble in the swamps of Louisiana. Explosions, fisticuffs, gun play — it’s all here alongside the great Steve James and the competent direction of Sam Firstenberg. It won’t blow your socks off, but it’s a good time for Cannon fans. [Extras: Commentary, interview] Call My Agent: the Complete Series What is it? A French comedy/drama about actors. Why see it? I’ll be the first to admit that international humor doesn’t always translate, but this series lands more than enough laughs to warrant a spin thanks to some sharp writing. The drama is arguably less compelling, but thankfully the heady roster of stars, mostly European but some Americans slip through, make it all the more entertaining. Juliette Binoche, Isabelle Adjani, Monica Bellucci, Jean Reno, Sigourney Weaver, Charlotte Rampling, and more all play themselves and make for a fun time. [Extras: None] Chains of Gold [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A social worker goes undercover. Why see it? Odds are you don’t remember this particular John Travolta vehicle, despite it being from 1991, and that’s very understandable. Not only did it get no traction back then, but it’s also a film that reaches the level of okay despite grander ambitions. Travolta plays a social worker trying to save a teen from a gang, and that involves gaining access to the gang itself. Marilu Henner, Bernie Casey, Hector Elizondo, and Joey Lawrence co-star. Travolta is good here, so that’s something. [Extras: None] Fatal Vision [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A blockbuster miniseries from the 80s. Why see it? Remember miniseries? I miss them. Anyway, this 1986 effort delivers a true crime tale about an Army captain accused of murdering his wife and two daughters. An adaptation of Joe McGinniss’ bestselling true crime book, the case initially fell apart in military court only to be reopened on the strength of evidence and in-laws seeking justice. Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint are those in-laws, Gary Cole is the killer, and more familiar faces pop up throughout giving additional weight to the proceedings. They don’t make miniseries like this anymore — it’s all limited series that run for ten episodes these days — and this is one of the greats. Will you want to rewatch it? That’s the question, but it’s at least worth a visit. [Extras: New 4K scan, commentary] Rolling Vengeance [KL Studio Classics] What is it? A man seeks vengeance in a monster truck. Why see it? The premise here is pretty great as a young man seeks revenge for the death of his family with the help of a newly built monster truck. He rolls over the baddies and their belongings with abandon, and there’s fun to be had. Still, though, it never feels like it’s enough — the bad guys kill his mother and younger siblings, kill his father, and rape his girlfriend, and he just crushes them. I want more! Use that drill attachment to skewer the rapists! Make Ned Beatty (he’s never looked cooler) squeal like a pig! Anyway, it’s fine, but it leaves you wanting which is something exploitation cinema shouldn’t do! [Extras: Commentary, interview] Two Weeks in September What is it? A woman explores an affair. Why see it? Brigitte Bardot is the big name draw here as a young woman who takes an impetuous leave of absence from her relationship with an older man to spend time with a younger man she just met. There’s not much here plot-wise as we just hang out with the young lovers as they cavort about, taking occasional breaks for Bardot to speak to her guy on the phone. The cuck is played by Jean Rochefort while the lucky guy is played by Laurent Terzieff. It’s more of a mood than a story, and it never really amounts to much, but there’s a dreamy “what if” hanging in the air that some may connect with. [Extras: Commentary] Zoltan, hound of Dracula [4K UHD, Kino Cult] What is it? Dracula’s dog goes hunting. Why see it? Albert Band, the man who spawned both Charles and Richard, directs this goofy tale of a vampire dog hungry for blood. The story sees an unnecessarily complicated relationship between the present prey and past master, but who cares — it’s a vampire dog. Reggie Nalder plays the pup’s keeper, and Stan Winston provides the prosthetic puppetry for closeups. It’s silly, and while it’s not nearly as fun as it should be, it has its moments. Regardless, we should celebrate its existence in 4K. [Extras: Commentary] Also out this week: All of Us Strangers [Criterion], Horizon: An American Saga: Chapter 1, Kill, Knuckles, Naughty Girl, Sorry Not Sorry, The Stepfather [4K UHD], The Strangers [4K UHD]",
