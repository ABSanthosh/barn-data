Tribeca Films has revealed the official trailer for an indie comedy titled Stealing Pulp Fiction, marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Danny Turkiewicz. Another one of these meta films about film geeks trying to get involved in cinema by stealing something from another famous filmmaker – because why not. Much like Fanboys before this, and some of Kevin Smith's movies, too. This indie first premiered at the 2024 Newport Beach Film Festival last year, and will be out on VOD to watch this June.

Starring Jon Rudnitsky, Karan Soni, Cazzie David, Jason Alexander, Taylor Hill, Oliver Cooper. Looks like everyone was having a blast making this! With New Beverly references galore, of course.
