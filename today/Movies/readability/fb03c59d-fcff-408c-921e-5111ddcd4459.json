After the recent airing of Episode 10, fans are excited to see what comes next.

With the release of the tenth episode marking the end of the first installment, there will be no Episode 11 or Part 2 with additional episodes. In this captivating legal drama, viewers follow the life of Ted Black, a former federal prosecutor who started a new life after a scandal forced him to leave behind what he did before. Black establishes a law practice in Los Angeles. The television series delves into the high-stakes legal battles of Hollywood, where glamor and fierce competition collide, involving celebrities, tricky contracts, and some very lucrative deals.
