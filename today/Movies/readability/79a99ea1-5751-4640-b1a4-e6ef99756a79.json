  "text": "by May 23, 2025 Some sagas stay with us throughout our entire cinephile lives, shaping our tastes and influencing the way we experience the art of cinema. For me ersonally, Mission: Impossible is one of those franchises. From the elegant suspense of Brian De Palma's original IMF movie in 1996 to the insane action-packed spectacle of Christopher McQuarrie's movies, every installment has been a constant source of adrenaline, innovation, and utter respect for the power of action cinema. McQuarrie's latest Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is the long-awaited conclusion to the saga led by Tom Cruise, naturally making it one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Expectations were sky-high, not just because it's supposedly the final chapter, but also due to the promise of closing one of the most consistent franchises in the genre's history. M:I - The Final Reckoning is once again directed by McQuarrie – the architect of the most recent Mission: Impossible era from Rogue Nation on – and co-written with Erik Jendresen, once more placing Ethan Hunt (Cruise) at the center of a global crisis where the past, present, and future collide with catastrophic consequences. Picking up the narrative left open by Dead Reckoning - Part One, the threat continues to revolve around an out-of-control artificial intelligence, whose ethical and existential ramifications open the door to some of the most daring themes of the entire saga. Cruise, as expected, returns with the same physical and emotional dedication that has become synonymous with these blockbusters, backed by a stellar team: Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, among others. Since 1996, Tom Cruise has redefined what it means to be an action star. And it's impossible not to begin by acknowledging, once again, his absolute commitment to this world. In The Final Reckoning, the iconic American actor once again performs heart-stopping stunts, with a level of realism and physical commitment that remains astonishing even after decades. The second half is a non-stop spectacle of utterly insane sequences that should never be normalized. It's true that there's a sense of familiarity that may lead to slight disappointment in not witnessing something truly new, but McQuarrie and his team keep the bar set as high as it can be. Tension, pacing, and pure entertainment are present in every frame, constantly pushing the limits of what can be captured on camera. On the technical side, DP Fraser Taggar's cinematography is, as expected, a true visual achievement. The way the camera moves, how it immerses itself into chaotic action scenes with remarkable clarity, deserves a standing ovation. It's thanks to this cohesive, immersive visual language that the audience can believe in the impossibility of what they're seeing. Taggart creates an atmosphere that elevates both the most intimate and explosive moments, doing so with inspiring confidence and precision. As for the score, Max Aruj and Alfie Godfrey deliver one of the most intense and emotional compositions in the entire Mission: Impossible franchise. The duo's work is a direct successor to previous scores, filled with pulsating themes that drive the action, but also with melodic variations that emphasize the emotional weight of the saga's conclusion. Personally, it's a score I'll be revisiting often. That said, amidst all the technical praise, the entire cast remains one of The Final Reckoning's strongest assets. Every member of the IMF team has their moment to shine, which is impressive given the growing number of characters and subplots. Atwell and Klementieff, in particular, continue to prove themselves as valuable additions to the core team. The former strengthens the movie's emotional core with a vulnerable yet determined performance, while the latter, a French actress, impresses as a physically imposing character of few words but great presence. Still, it's Ving Rhames who delivers the film's most memorable lines. His monologue about the true meaning of identity and the importance of one's actions isn't only moving, but a perfect encapsulation of the franchise's philosophy. We aren't defined by isolated feats, but by the sum of our intentions and deeds. A deeply human and unexpectedly emotional message for a summer blockbuster. In fact, it's precisely the movie's thematic depth that elevates The Final Reckoning. Over the last few decades, Ethan Hunt has been a character who embodies personal sacrifice for the collective good. Rejecting traditional heroism, the agent has built his reputation not through brute strength, but through unshakeable loyalty and an almost suicidal stubbornness to always do what's morally right, even as the world around him crumbles. This final chapter questions that moral compass: does Ethan still have free will? Or has he become just another pawn in a larger system out of his control – just like the AI he's trying to defeat? Unsurprisingly, the digital antagonist is a clear metaphor for the increasing dehumanization of our societies. The way the last two installments depict AI – as an \"entity\" that learns, manipulates, and redefines truths to control human behavior – mirrors modern concerns about AI algorithms, social media, and the loss of autonomy. Mission: Impossible has explored the duality between control and freedom many times before, but never so literally or urgently. What was once a \"simple\" spy game between rival governments has now become an ideological battle for the preservation of humanity in an age of automation. Another powerful reflection lies in the idea of regret and timeless responsibility. The constant revisiting of past moments – through flashbacks, character returns, and not-so-subtle references – isn't just an exercise in nostalgia. It's a reminder that actions have lasting consequences and that time does not erase the marks of what has been done. Ethan, as he confronts the legacy of his choices, becomes a tragic symbol of someone who lives to correct mistakes that may never be undone. This sense of lingering guilt, present throughout the saga, reaches its emotional peak here. It's no coincidence that the first hour – slower \u0026 more repetitive – is filled with these ghosts; The Final Reckoning is emotionally preparing the audience for the inevitable impact of goodbye. However, not everything works as effectively as one would hope. The film's biggest obstacle is undoubtedly its exposition. All the previous entries use this storytelling device, but The Final Reckoning overloads its first hour with flashbacks, recaps, reinterpretations, and endless references to events and characters from every previous movie in the entire M:I franchise. The attempt to recontextualize things is completely understandable, especially for more casual viewers. Still, this need to remind audiences of the past ends up hurting the narrative rhythm, taking far too long for things to truly get going, and getting stuck in a cycle of explanation and backstory that, while useful, could've been handled with more subtlety and economy. The narrative structure also suffers from this urge to include everything. There is a feeling of imminent farewell that pushes the creators to revisit nearly every major moment and figure in the saga – and yes, there are pleasantly surprising returns – but this structural nostalgia negatively affects the story's natural flow. The time spent looking back delays the forward momentum of what should be a finale focused on the now and what's at stake. Ultimately, The Final Reckoning is a tribute to the saga that built a legacy of excellence in action cinema. We mustn't forget all the names that made it possible. Brian De Palma laid the foundation with an elegant psychological thriller; John Woo elevated the visual stylization; J.J. Abrams brought emotion \u0026 tension; Brad Bird redefined pure spectacle; and McQuarrie unified it all with a coherent and passionate vision. Mission: Impossible has always been more than the sum of its parts – and that's thanks to decades of dedication from stunt teams, technicians, directors, writers, and of course, the one-of-a-kind Tom Cruise. Final Thoughts Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning may not be the all-out epic conclusion fans hoped for, or the best movie in the franchise, but it is, without a doubt, a worthy and emotionally satisfying sendoff. Despite some pacing issues and an overload of exposition, Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise succeed through audiovisual spectacle, thematic richness, and an unmatched commitment to the cinematic legacy that they represent. If this really is the very end (something always doubtful in Hollywood...), then what a beautiful, heartfelt goodbye it is. Thank you, Ethan Hunt. And thank you to everyone who made this mission possible. Manuel's Rating: B+ Follow Manuel on Twitter - @msbreviews / Or Letterboxd - @msbreviews Find more posts in: Review",
