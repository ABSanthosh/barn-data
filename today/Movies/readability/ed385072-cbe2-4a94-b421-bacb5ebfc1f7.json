  "text": "Zach Cregger, the filmmaker behind the horror hit Barbarian, is set to write and direct a new Resident Evil movie based on the iconic horror game franchise. According to a report from THR, Cregger’s new movie has set off an “intense” bidding war between studios for the planned reboot movie. Four studios are said to be vying for the movie, with Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix specifically named in the report. The movie will be produced by Constantin Films (who have held the movie name rights to Resident Evil for some time), as well as PlayStation Productions. What do we know about the Resident Evil movie? Currently, nothing is known about what Cregger’s Resident Evil movie will be about. The legendary video game franchise has been no stranger to movie adaptations, though, with seven different films having been made dating back to 2002, most of which have starred Milla Jovovich. Cregger is best known for his work as one of the founding members of the comedy troupe The Whitest Kids U’ Know, which he founded alongside Sam Brown and the late Trevor Moore. Cregger also directed the 2009 comedy Miss March but broke out as a director following the 2022 horror film Barbarian, which became a massive success and garnered positive praise from the horror community. Cregger’s next film is titled Weapons and stars Josh Brolin, Julia Garner, Alden Ehrenreich, Benedict Wong, Austin Abrams, Amy Madigan, June Diane Raphael, Cary Christopher, and Clayton Farris. The film revolves around multi-related plots centered around the disappearance of school kids in the middle of the night and is set to premiere on January 16, 2026. (Source: The Hollywood Reporter)",
