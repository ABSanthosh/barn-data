  "text": "Hollywood mainstay Anne Hathaway recently issued a private apology after a blast from the past came back to disturb her peace. The Princess Diaries star faced backlash after an old interview resurfaced online. The interview, which took place in 2012, was conducted by renowned Norwegian journalist Kjersti Flaa during a press junket for Les Misérables. But what actually transpired between the two that ultimately led Anne Hathaway to offer an apology? Here’s all you need to know about the latest controversy surrounding the Academy Award winner. Anne Hathaway apologises to journalist for 2012 interview Anne Hathaway sent a personal apology email to journalist Kjersti Flaa for her demeanor during a 2012 interview (via Variety). Their conversation recently went viral after Flaa reposted the encounter on YouTube, along with her own commentary. In the video, Flaa explained that she had tried a unique approach during the Les Misérables press junket, where she sang her questions to the actors, hoping for playful or musical responses. Most guests enjoyed her distinctive approach and participated willingly. However, Hathaway declined to engage and instead responded with short, brusque answers. For example, when Flaa asked, “Do you think love was more passionate back then?” Hathaway responded with a curt, “No.” In her commentary, Flaa described the exchange as “topnotch cringe.” Still, she acknowledged that such experimental stunts can sometimes backfire. Flaa also mentioned that a subsequent encounter with Hathaway was more positive, describing the actress as “very sweet.” After the interview clip went viral, amassing millions of views on TikTok, Hathaway reached out to Flaa to issue a personal apology. Flaa shared this update in a YouTube video, revealing that Hathaway’s publicist had forwarded an apology email from the actress. “She sent me a long email explaining what she was going through at the time and apologized for giving me an awful interview,” Flaa said. “It was so touching. Just talking about it makes me almost teary-eyed. I was so grateful she did that. It was a very personal note.” However, Kjersti Flaa refrained from sharing the specific details of Anne Hathaway’s apology.",
