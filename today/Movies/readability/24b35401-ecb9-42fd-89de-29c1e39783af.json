  "text": "After Taylor Swift took to the stage at the benefit concert that occurred following the conclusion of Travis Kelce’s Tight End University (TEU) event, fans have come out on the internet to inquire about her relationship with fellow musician Chase Rice. While he was also present at the said event on June 23, does he share any connection with the pop icon? Without further ado, here’s everything you need to know regarding the proposed bond between Swift and Rice. Is Taylor Swift friends with Chase Rice? As per the present available information, the 14-time Grammy winner does not share any personal relationship with the “Eyes on You” singer whatsoever. The trend connecting Taylor Swift and Chase Rice only popped up on the internet after they performed separately at the after-event festivities of Travis Kelce’s Tight End University. Taking place at the 1,200-capacity Brooklyn Bowl in Nashville, the small-scale concert, dubbed ‘Tight Ends \u0026 Friends,’ saw many renowned artists, including Kane Brown, take to the stage. After Brown ended his performance, he surprisingly called out Swift to the stage by stating, “Do y’all care if I bring out a really, really, really, really special guest?” The “Bad Blood” singer then noted how she did not prepare for an act by saying that she does not have a guitar. “We were thinking, like, ‘How loud could this place get? Theoretically, how loud could the singing be in here?’ So, I was like, I don’t have a guitar, but then Chase Rice was like, ‘You can use mine,” Swift said. In the end, she performed her hit single “Shake It Off,” much to the awe of the audience present. (via Variety) Meanwhile, Rice also engaged the people present at the after-party by giving an energetic performance of his own. As shared by a fan on Threads, he even gave a shout-out to Swift for supporting his song, ‘Cruise,’ during her performance at the TEU concert. Aside from their interaction at the said event, Chase Rice and Taylor Swift do not share any personal connection with one another.",
