Iris Apatow and Edvin Ryding join the cast as Capitol University students Proserpina and Vitus. Lionsgate continues to expand the Hunger Games universe with another prequel adaptation. The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping is set for release on November 20, 2026. Production for¬†The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping¬†has officially kicked off, and with that, we have two final additions to the already large and impressive cast. Lionsgate has cast Iris Apatow and Edvin Ryding as Proserpina and Vitus, two Capitol University students assigned to the prep team for the District 12 Tributes. It's not at all surprising that Lionsgate is jumping at the chance to adapt another one of these books.¬†The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes managed to do something that prequels rarely do, which is fine for an audience that hadn't watched any of the previous films. However, it's unclear whether or not this film will be able to do this as well.¬† L-R: Edvin Ryding (Photo by JC Olivera/WWD via Getty Images) | Iris Apatow (Photo by Lionel Hahn/Getty Images) Images Provided Via Lionsgate PR) | The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. Credit: Lionsgate The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping Book Summary Summary: \"Sunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem. This year, in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice as many tributes will be taken from their homes. Back in District 12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances. All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves. When Haymitch's name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He's torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who's nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he's been set up to fail. But there's something in him that wants to fight . . . and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.\" The film adaptation of¬†The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will be released on November 20, 2026.¬†Francis Lawrence will direct from a screenplay adaptation by Billy Ray. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad¬†Simpson will produce. Cameron¬†MacConomy will executive produce. The cast so far includes Joseph Zada as Haymitch Abernathy, Whitney Peak as Haymitch's girlfriend, Lenore Dove Baird, Mckenna Grace as Maysilee Donner, Haymitch's fellow District 12 Tribute, Jesse Plemons as a young Plutarch Heavensbee, Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Beetee, Maya Hawke as Wiress, Lili Taylor as Mags Flanagan, Ben Wang as Wyatt Callow, Ralph Fiennes as President Snow, Elle Fanning as Effie Trinket, Iona Bell as Lou Lou, Molly McCann as Louella, Kieran Culkin as Caesar Flickerman, Glenn Close as Drusilla Sickle, and Billy Porter as Magno Stift. The supporting cast is large and includes Laura Marcus as Silka, Percy Daggs IV as Ampert, Rada Rae as Wellie, Jhaleil Swaby as Panache, John Doeble as Buck, Alina Reid as Kerna, Salimou Thiam as Clayton, Kaine Buffonge as Hull, Sky Frances as Maritte, Tatyana Muzondo as Ringina, Kara Tointon as Willamae, Smylie Bradwell as Sid, Melody Chikakane Brown as Hattie Meeny, Grace Ackary as Asterid, Scot Greenan as Burdock, Jeffrey Hallman as Clerk Carmine, Sandra F√∂rster as Hersilia, Serafin Mishiev as Woodbine Chance, Jax Guerrero as Tibby, and Jefferson White as Mr. McCoy. While The Ballad of Songbirds \u0026 Snakes' success will likely shut up anyone who does the whole \"who asked for this\" dance,¬†this is your reminder that¬†Rachel Zegler very much asked for¬†Sunrise on the Reaping to exist.
