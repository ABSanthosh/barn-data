  "text": "Jaume Collet-Serra has signed a multiyear overall film deal with Netflix, the distributor of his hit 2024 action thriller Carry-On, starring Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman, sources have confirmed to Deadline. The first project under the deal, which will see him directing and producing for the streamer, is An Innocent Girl, a previously announced psychological thriller in which a young and ambitious woman is seduced by a high powered D.C. couple, being drawn into a dangerous world of sex, power and murder. Most recently working on Play Dead, a survival thriller described as Don’t Breathe meets 1917, on which we were first to report, Collet-Serra’s upcoming slate also includes a reimagining of the classic actioner Cliffhanger, starring Lily James and Pierce Brosnan. Since premiering on Netflix on December 13, the Spanish filmmaker’s Carry-On has generated nearly 200 million views, establishing itself not only as Netflix’s most watched movie of 2024, but also as the streamer’s second most popular film of all time. Watch on Deadline Also known for directing high-concept thrillers like The Shallows and Non-Stop, Collet-Serra broke out with his work on horror films House of Wax and Orphan before going on to a string of collaborations with Liam Neeson on Non-Stop, as well as the films Unknown, Run All Night, and The Commuter.
