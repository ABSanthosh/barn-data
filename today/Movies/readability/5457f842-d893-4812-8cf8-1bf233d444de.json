  "text": "We will update this article throughout the season, along with all our predictions, so make sure to keep checking IndieWire for the latest news from the 2025 Emmys race. The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. The State of the Race Breaking into the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series Emmy category is a formidable task. There are already two contenders that have already won for the performance they are up for, and three more that also nominated last year. The one open spot, should they all be nominated again, was vacated by comedy legend Carol Burnett for her role in “Palm Royale” on Apple TV+. Circling back to the women that have won, “The Bear” used the same Emmys campaign strategy that won it much success for Season 1, having its latest season premiere right as Television Academy members were voting for nominees. One could argue that is why Ebon Moss-Bachrach, for example, won Outstanding Supporting Actors in a Comedy Series for Season 1 — because voters had already seen his standout episode in Season 2. Same with Liza Colón-Zayas. As great as she has consistently been on the show, her surprise Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series win last year was ascribed to viewers’ reaction to her standout episode in Season 3, even though the season she was nominated for was Season 2. All that said, Season 3 of “The Bear” has not been the overall fan favorite, meaning its stars are going into Emmys season with less momentum. And that coincides with Emmy-winning shows like “Hacks” and “Abbott Elementary” putting more of a spotlight on Supporting Actress contenders that have been consistently nominated, but have not won yet. Hannah Einbinder, star of the former show, is building off of a killer performance in the Season 3 finale, with a new dynamic opposite Jean Smart that may finally get her across the finish line on her fourth try. This season of “Abbott Elementary” also served as more of a showcase for breakout star Janelle James, with Principal Ava being central to the Season 4 arc. It would be her fourth try at the Emmy as well, with her co-star Sheryl Lee Ralph having won the category for her performance in the first season of the ABC sitcom. Outside of that “The Bear”-”Hacks”-”Abbott Elementary” triumvirate that has been driving the race in this category the past couple years, there are tried and true contenders like “Shrinking” star Jessica Williams, and “Only Murders in the Building” star Meryl Streep, who were both nominated for their shows before. And then there’s the latest Apple TV+ contender “The Studio,” which stars perennial Emmy nominees Kathryn Hahn and Catherine O’Hara. Considering the aforementioned Burnett nomination last year, this category definitely has some room for legends, so a posthumous nomination for “Mid-Century Modern” star Linda Lavin may be in tow, or more likely some recognition for Patti Lupone in “Agatha All Along,” which would only be the Broadway icon’s second Primetime Emmy nomination. “Nobody Wants This” is currently the top contending Netflix comedy, which bodes well for star Justine Lupe, but the streaming service has “The Four Seasons” coming later in the TV schedule with Kerry Kenney-Silver, and Amazon Prime Video is about to launch “Étoile” starring French actress Lou de Laâge, from notable showrunner Amy Sherman-Paladino, so voters have even more fresh slate of Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series contenders coming to their TV screens. Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):Liza Colón-Zayas, “The Bear” (FX)Lou de Laâge, “Étoile” (Prime Video)Hannah Einbinder, “Hacks” (Max)Abby Elliott, “The Bear” (FX)Kathryn Hahn, “The Studio” (Apple TV+)Janelle James, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)Linda Lavin, “Mid-Century Modern” (Hulu)Justine Lupe, “Nobody Wants This” (Netflix)Patti Lupone, “Agatha All Along” (Disney+)Catherine O’Hara, “The Studio” (Apple TV+)Sheryl Lee Ralph, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)Meg Stalter, “Hacks” (Max)Meryl Streep, “Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)Lisa Ann Walter, “Abbott Elementary” (ABC)Jessica Williams, “Shrinking” (Apple TV+) More Comedy Category Predictions:Outstanding Comedy SeriesOutstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy SeriesOutstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy SeriesOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series View IndieWire’s full set of predictions for the 77th Emmy Awards.Last Year’s Winner: Liza Colón-Zayas, “The Bear”Still Eligible: Yes.Hot Streak: If it is true that her performance in Season 3 is what sway voters to award her for her performance in Season 3 of “The Bear,” there is a strong chance that Colón-Zayas could start a two-year winning streak, and continue the show’s already two-years-running winning streak in this category (Ayo Edebiri won for Season 1 before moving up to Lead.)Notable Ineligible Series: Susie Essman, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” (ended); Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, “Loot” (Season 3 is not eligible); Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb, Amber Chardae Robinson, Laura Dern, and Carol Burnett, “Shrinking” (Season 2 is not eligible)",
