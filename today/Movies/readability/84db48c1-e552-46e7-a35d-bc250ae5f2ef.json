  "text": "Talk about timely. In what is a movie that looks tailor-made to debut at the Sundance Film Festival, British actor Josh O’Connor tries on an American Southwest accent to take on the role of Colorado rancher, Dusty, whose life (along with his few neighbors in the very rural Rocky Mountain community in which his family has lived and worked for generations) comes crashing down when a devastating wildfire destroys everything. On top of all that he is living alone after splitting with his wife Ruby (a fine Meghann Fahy) who has moved into her mother Bess’s (Amy Madigan) nearby house with their young daughter Callie Rose (Lily LaTorre). Finding a temporary roof over his head in a FEMA pop-up trailer park planted in the middle of nowhere but with zero guarantee of stability, Dusty doesn’t quite realize what is happening to his dreams and how it all came to this. However, as the title suggests, this film is not about the tearing down of a life, but rather how we start over, find new meaning, and build community once again. The film comes from fine writer/director Max Walker-Silverman who last did A Love Song, a lovely and contemplative film about old friends reconnecting in a similiar rural part of Colorado (where he grew up) , and this one has the same kind of deliberate pace and emphasis on human beings who see their lives changing but know no alternative than to somehow survive. Watch on Deadline Dusty is a quiet guy and O’Connor, probably not a casting director’s idea of a cowboy, really manages to show us who this young man is, often with just his forlorn facial expressions rather than the limited dialogue he is given in many scenes. Dusty not only has to deal with this catastrophe that has claimed his family landmark of a ranch, the big blue barn, and everything it means handed down from grandfather to father to him, but also rebuilding his relationship with the wise-beyond-her-years Callie-Rose who has a hard time adjusting to her visits with her dad in the small makeshift trailer community FEMA formed for these displaced people. There is also still clearly tension in his relationship with Ruby and this all takes a toll. His absolute goal though is to stay and rebuild, just as currently we hear residents in Los Angeles declare after similarly losing everything. Particularly gut-wrenching is to see the family grave plots now surrounded by nothing but burned trees. Also depressing is a visit to the bank and Mr. Cassidy (Jefferson Mays) who gives him tough love on the idea he could ever rebuild or get loans with nothing left to show for his ranch. It would take 10 years to even to have anything remotely workable there again he says considering the condition of the land. Slowly though Dusty ingratiates himself into this instant new trailer community of neighbors in the same boat including Mila (Kali Reis), and others comprised of local actors the filmmakers found who add genuine grit and truth to it all. As I was watching this film I kept thinking of Nomadland, the 2020 Oscar winning Best Picture, set in similar sparse territory, but about a community of drifters who choose this lifestyle off the grid, not forced into it as is the case here. On the end credits I noticed a producer’s name, Dan Janvey who won an Oscar for Nomadland, and also was a producer on A Love Song. He clearly is drawn to these stories and the American Southwest. The fine cinematography by Alfonso Herrera Salcedo and subtle but pitch perfect production design by Juliana Barrreto Barreto add to the atmosphere. A big shout out to casting director Ann Goulder who merged some memorable local actors into the cast of more known stars flawlessly and authentically. O’Connor continues to show different facets of his talent here and never overplays it, skillfully looking and sounding like he was born to this land. Fahy gets some choice scenes as well as Reis (recently Emmy nominated for True Detective). It was nice to see Madigan get to do her thing in this kind of warm maternal role, even with limited screen time. The true scene stealer is La Torre and she is a real cracker jack of a young performer. This film at this time might sound overly depressing, but oddly it isn’t. In the end Rebuilding gives us faith and hope for the human race and its ability to overcome in the face of the worst life can throw at us. It’s inspiring stuff. Producers are Jesse Hope, Paul Mezey, and Janvey. Title: Rebuilding Festival: Sundance (Premieres) Sales Agent: CAA Director/ Screenplay: Max Walker-Silverman Cast: Josh O’Connor, Meghann Fahy, Lily La Torre, Kali Reis, Amy Madigan, Jefferson Mays Running Time: 1 hour and 35 minutes",
