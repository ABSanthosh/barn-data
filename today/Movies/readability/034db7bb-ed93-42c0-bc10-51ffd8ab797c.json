  "description": "\"There is no way I'm gonna let these two bozos take all my glory without a fight!\" Magnolia Pictures has debuted the official US trailer for a sports comedy film called The Gutter, made by comedy brothers Isaiah Lester \u0026 Yassir Lester. It's set for a US release in November including VOD.

This plot borrows from the classic Kingpin (make money pro bowling), which for decades has been one of the only bowling comedies to ever exist. The Gutter is an \"outrageous and hilarious spin\" on sports comedy. Walt is pressured to embrace his bowling talent, sparking backlash from detractors seeking to undermine his sudden pro success. Starring Shameik Moore, Susan Sarandon, D'Arcy Carden, Jay Ellis, Jackée Harry, and Paul Reiser. This premiered at SXSW 2024 earlier this year and will play at the London Film Festival next.

It looks good! Just the right vehicle for Shameik Moore's kooky comedy and it's funny to see a boatload of bowling jokes again. Here's the official US trailer (+ new poster) for Isaiah \u0026 Yassir Lester's film The Gutter, from YouTube: You can rewatch the promo trailer for Isaiah \u0026 Yassir Lester's The Gutter right here for more footage. One of life's losers, Walt (Shameik Moore), tends the bar at AlleyCatz, which is on the brink of closure. But when he has a go at bowling, Walt realises where both his talent and calling may lie. Can his new-found skills save his workplace? Black comedy royalty Jackée Harry and Kim Fields also star in this laugh-out-loud film, which is guaranteed to have you rolling down the aisles. The Gutter is directed by the American comedy writers / filmmaking brothers Isaiah Lester (writer on \"Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Black-ish\" series) and Yassir Lester (writer on \"Earth to Ned\", \"Black Monday\" series), both making their feature directorial debut with this film previously. The screenplay is written by Yassir Lester. Produced by Liz Destro. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival earlier this year, and it's also playing at the London Film Festival next this fall. Magnolia Pictures will debut The Gutter bowling comedy in select US theaters + on VOD starting November 1st, 2024 this fall. Who wants to watch this? And go bowling?
