  "text": "Celebrities like Mark Ruffalo, Jimmy Kimmel, Kerry Washington and more are stepping out in support of the “No Kings” protests happening nationwide against president Donald Trump‘s increasingly authoritarian behavior. They join thousands of marchers across cities from New York City to Austin to Los Angeles, the latter of which has become an epicenter for the showdown currently occurring between the constituency and federal government policy, with Trump deploying 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines sans state leaders’ approval in reaction to communities’ opposition to the harsh escalation in ICE raids. In an interview with MSNBC, Ruffalo — who attended the rally in New York City, alongside Susan Sarandon — said he was protesting “because we see our democracy’s in real trouble. We see a president who has made himself a king and dictator, and we don’t see an opposition that’s powerful enough to stand up against the trampling of our rights and the trampling of the Constitution that’s happening every single day, with executive orders, with the refusal to obey court orders, with the kidnapping of immigrants, people who are here legally, people whose children are being taken from them. We’re disgusted and we’re scared, and we know the only way to fight this now is for the people to come together.” Watch on Deadline He continued, “This president does not care about any of our Founding Fathers’ principles. One of the reasons we separated the military from the Executive Branch was because we were leaving countries where dictators were using the military against the people. We’re seeing it already happening in California; it is sending a message to the American people that the Constitution means nothing, and it’s spitting — literally spitting — on our military members and the history of this country, which has been to fight fascism and dictatorship throughout the world.” “They’re pointing the guns in the wrong direction — it’s not the immigrants who are taking anything, it’s not that there isn’t enough for everyone in this country; it’s that there’s a few very, very, very wealthy, powerful people who are taking too much. It’s the billionaires and it’s the people in power that are taking from the American people, which is leaving us feeling desperate. This is the answer to that; this is the reimagination of America and the reestablishment of our democratic principles,” Ruffalo concluded. Referencing Sen. Alex Padilla’s (D-CA) forced removal from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference for asking a question about the mass detainment of both undocumented and documented immigrants, Ruffalo answered “you know you’re heading towards dictatorship, that’s a turning point. You’re only going to see more of that happening. This administration will continue to over-reach, and this will be the response. We’re not going away, we’re not gonna be quiet, we love each other, and we realize that we love this country so much that we’re leaving our homes today in the rain to express our friendship and love for the people here, who made this place. And unless you’re Native American or a Mexican, you’re an immigrant.” Washington seemed to attend the rally held in Santa Monica, holding signs alongside another A-Lister, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, which read “The only Monarch I like is a butterfly.” In her post, she highlighted other attendees’ signs, including one that was inscribed with “Keep ICE in my drinks, not my streets.” Glenn Close took to Instagram to post in support of the demonstrations, herself taking part in the 3,000-strong protest taking place in Bozeman, Mont. In one video, she stated she was “deeply disturbed and saddened and outraged” that on a day where millions were gathering to “peacefully demonstrate,” the “underbelly of violence and conspiracy” reared its head via the politically motivated shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers, one of whom was assassinated. “It’s not about screaming slogans,” she wrote in the caption. “it’s not about spitting hatred. It’s the calm, unified PRESENCE of MILLIONS of Americans who refuse to let our beloved, magnificent country be sold out to the wannabe KING/OLIGARCH and his RUTHLESS, cruel, scheming puppeteers.” In another post, she shared images of signs from marchers, including ones that read: “If this was really about criminals, why is one president?” and “If there is money for a parade, there is enough money for Medicaid!” Marisa Tomei and Dan Bucatinsky attended the rally in West Hollywood, with the latter writing online: “Coming together to show what Democracy looks like.” Ayo Edebiri attended alongside Patti Harrison, posting signs that read “I love you \u0026 I have your back! Stay Brave!” as well as “F— ICE, F— Trump.” Jimmy Kimmel, who attended a rally in South Bay alongside his parents, wrote in the caption of his Instagram post: “A huge, inspiring and yes – peaceful – turnout in the South Bay. I met many people who love this country and still believe it to be a force for good. I am grateful to see so many Americans take action to stand up for our friends and neighbors, most of all, my parents. I know how fortunate I am to have been born into a family that taught me to care about others and that the most important words ever spoken are ‘Love one another.’ It really is as simple as that. #NoKings“ Mary Elizabeth Ellis, who attended the protest in L.A., shared videos and images from the event, with fellow attendees chanting “ICE go home!” Signs included, “Fascism has no place in America” and “I like my city neat. No ICE!” The It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia actress also posted Instagram Stories featuring captions like “Whose streets? Our streets.” Nadya Tolokonnikova’s Pussy Riot — the Russian feminist collective and performance art group, whose installation at MOCA was halted and later rescheduled due to the downtown Los Angeles protests earlier this week — also attended the protests, along with a cohort of red balaklava-clad women who held a banner that read, “It’s beginning to look a lot like Russia.” Insecure and The White Lotus‘ Natasha Rothwell, who has long been keeping up her daily tradition of trolling Trump with tweets, was also in attendance, carrying a sign that read, “You are trash.”",
