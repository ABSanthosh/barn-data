With new achievements, industry records, and ongoing speculation surrounding her circle, there’s plenty to cover. Let’s break down the biggest Taylor Swift updates and the key moments shaping the discussion. Taylor Swift news update for February 23, 2025 As of February 23, 2025, here are the top Taylor Swift news stories of the week. Travis Kelce’s First Film as Producer Set for Release Travis Kelce is stepping into the entertainment industry as an executive producer for My Dead Friend Zoe, set to release on February 28. The film follows an Army veteran dealing with PTSD after losing a fellow soldier. Kelce described the project as “an incredible experience.” He further said he hopes to “continue working on meaningful projects.” Director Kyle Hausmann-Stokes praised Kelce’s involvement, saying, “While our schedules didn’t align for him to visit set or meet the cast, it was clear from the outset that Travis signed on because of his support for the military and veterans” (via People). Kelce has also partnered on a documentary about artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, gaining exclusive access to his archives. Taylor Swift’s ‘Lover (Live from Paris)’ Hits No. 1 in the U.K. Without Streaming Taylor Swift’s Lover (Live from Paris) has topped the U.K. Albums Chart, becoming the first album in eight years to do so solely through sales, per the Official Charts Company (via Forbes). The heart-shaped vinyl re-release sold 47,000 copies last week without streaming. The last album to achieve this was Swift’s Reputation in 2017. The surge in physical sales underscores her fanbase’s dedication and impact on the industry. Travis Kelce Calls Adam Sandler the “GOAT” of Comedy Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce praised Adam Sandler during a recent rebroadcast of his New Heights podcast, calling him the “GOAT of comedy.” The episode, which originally aired in August 2024, was re-released while Kelce and his brother, Jason, took a break from recording following the Chiefs’ Super Bowl loss to the Eagles. Kelce, who filmed scenes for Sandler’s upcoming Happy Gilmore 2, shared that receiving a personal message from the actor after his Saturday Night Live hosting gig in 2023 was a “full life circle moment” (via Athlon Sports). Sandler, who has been in the entertainment industry since 1987, recently topped Forbes’ list as the highest-paid actor of 2024 with estimated earnings of $73 million.",
