  "description": "\"Now take her heart from her chest and then...\" \"I shall have it all.\" Entertainment Squad \u0026 The Horror Collective have unveiled an official trailer for a B-movie horror remix of the iconic Snow White story called The Death of Snow White. Yet another of these public domain horror mashups, taking iconic characters and making them dark \u0026 evil. Pursued by her stepmother for eternal beauty, Snow White flees into a scary forest and aligns with seven bloodthirsty dwarves - cold-blooded assassins with a knack for brutal killings. Her spirit is tested in this grim fairy tale. As secrets unravel and betrayal surfaces, they realize the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of their seemingly idyllic kingdom. With twists and turns at every corner, they must navigate through danger to seek justice and avenge their friend's tragic end. Starring Sanae Loutsis, with Chelsea Edmundson, Tristan Nokes, Meredith Binder, Colin Miller, Dillon Moore, Jeremy Hallam, Michael DeSanto II, Risa Mei, and Eric Pope. \"Fairy tales have always had a dark side, and The Death of Snow White embraces that in a bold, terrifying way.\" Sure, okay. But why does it look so bad? Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jason [â€¦]",
