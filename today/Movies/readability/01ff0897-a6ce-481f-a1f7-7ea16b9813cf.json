This fascinating animated short film called Freedom River is originally from 1971. A full 53 years later (!!) and everything it talks about is happening right now - the river of freedom is murky \u0026 poisonous, and most Americans don't seem to get it... Freedom River is a \"parable told by Orson Welles.\" The maestro lent his voice to this project after the producers convinced him by sending a script \u0026 recorder in the mail to him in Paris. It's a parable about America – obviously this \"river of freedom\" is referring to the USA – and how xenophobia, racism, and greed will cause that river to become tainted and toxic. \"They could not see it.

Uploaded on YouTube - the intro: \"Concentrating on an area of growing concern in our society – the indifference that makes people blind to the injustices – this animated parable traces how the erosion of freedom, like the pollution of natural resources, can occur so gradually that both evade the attention of a busy and preoccupied nation.\" Freedom River is an animated short created by Stephen Bosustow Productions. It's directed by Sam Weiss, and written by Joseph C. Cavella. Based on the original parable about freedom by Warren H. Schmidt PhD. Produced by Nick Bosustow. The story: \"For several years, Bosustow Prods had asked Orson Welles, then living in Paris, to narrate one of their films. He never responded. When I finished the Freedom River script, we sent it to him together with a portable reel to reel tape recorder and a sizable check and crossed our fingers... two weeks later we got the reel back with the narration word for word and we were on our way.\" To view even more short films, click here.
