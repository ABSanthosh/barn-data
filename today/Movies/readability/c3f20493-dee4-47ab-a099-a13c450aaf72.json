  "text": "Billboard Music Awards Presented by Marriott Bonvoy It’s the end of the year, which means the end of another moviegoing era, and that means top 10 lists are flying in. Here’s IndieWire’s list of the 25 best films of 2024 if you didn’t see it. But in this week’s episode of IndieWire’s “Screen Talk” podcast, co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio share their individual top 10 films of the year. Overlapping on both are “All We Imagine as Light,” “Anora,” and “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” though their lists wildly diverge the closer we get to the #1 pick. There’s some debate over titles including “Dune: Part Two” and “A Complete Unknown,” two of Anne’s favorites. She’s more an admirer than outright fan of Jane Schoenbrun’s “I Saw the TV Glow,” another movie popping up everywhere on top 10 lists. But that places high on Ryan’s. Listen to the podcast to hear more. We also discuss the latest wave of major awards nominations, including the Golden Globes on Monday. Big snubs and surprises included Marianne Jean-Baptiste, winning critics awards everywhere for her performance in Mike Leigh’s “Hard Truths,” missing a Best Actress nomination. Old habits die hard at the Golden Globes, we suppose. Listen to the episode below. Screen Talk is produced by Azwan Badruzaman and available on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, and Spotify, and hosted by Megaphone.
