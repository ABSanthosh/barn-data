Variety has a first look at the Thanksgiving “Peanuts Night” edition of “The Masked Singer,” which kicks off with panelists Rita Ora and Robin Thicke performing “You Make My Dreams Come True.” Then, the Group C finals take place, with Sherlock Hound, Royal Knight and Strawberry Shortcake giving out “Thanksgiving-themed clues” and singing songs “I Hope You Dance,” “Holiday” and “Ho Hey.” The episode, which airs 8 p.m. ET on Thursday, will end with a battle royale and double elimination. To celebrate “Peanuts Night,” the show’s panelists also shared their favorite characters from the long-running comic strip (which marks its 75th anniversary in 2025). For Robin Thicke, he quips, “I kind of always related to Pig Pen, he just always needed a shower and I always wondered why he wouldn’t take a shower!” Popular on Variety Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg says she connected most to the Halloween “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown” special. “I love Charlie Brown. I love rooting for him, but I also love Lucy. If you go back to look at all of my school books, all I have—and I’m not joking—are pictures of Lucy. I drew Lucy, Lucy, Lucy everywhere. And then there’s a sweet connection to Donnie’s [Wahlberg] fans. Every band, or artist, has a fan group. You have Swifties, Beyonce’s BeyHive…well, the Blockheads come from Charlie Brown. They come from Peanuts. When you go to the concerts, the fans are always bringing Peanuts merch. Donnie has a ton of Peanuts stuff around the house. The Blockheads actually come from Peanuts.” Rita Ora says she also gravitates to Lucy, especially “with her psychiatric booth is my go-to because I always feel like I have these instincts personally so I’ve genuinely always related to her.” As for Ken Jeong, he feels a kinship with Charlie Brown: “Honestly my favorite thing ever in the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown, my favorite line is, ‘All I got was a rock.’ I just love that and it just keeps making me laugh to this day.” Here’s the first look: “Peanuts Night” on “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) “Peanuts Night” on “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) “Peanuts Night” on “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) “Peanuts Night” on “The Masked Singer” (Michael Becker/Fox) Drake Bell as Ice King, Bethany Hamilton as Macaron, Natalie Imbruglia as Bluebell, Laverne Cox as Chess Piece, Andy Richter as Dusty Bunny, Paula Cole as Ship, Marsai Martin as Woodpecker, Yvette Nicole Brown as Showbird and John Elway as Leaf Sheep are the celebrities who have been unmasked so far on “The Masked Singer” Season 12.
