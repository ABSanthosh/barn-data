  "text": "Sometimes, when you’re looking to be entertained, only a thriller will cut it. Sure, everybody loves a rom-com or an action movie, but If you ever find yourself feeling like life is getting inexplicably dark and morality is becoming more ambiguous, immersing yourself in a tense world of serial killers, terrorists, crooked sleazebags, and jaw-dropping twists of all kinds is a pretty great form of escapism. The genre is broad enough to encompass a wide variety of tropes. So you could probably watch thrillers forever and never get bored. Netflix‘s thriller offerings are surprisingly well-rounded this month, offering a good mix of undisputed classics from the likes of Steven Spielberg as well as newer indie flicks that you may have missed. This June, top-tier archival titles include “Vertigo” along with Netflix Originals like “Fair Play” and “Run Rabbit Run.” Whether you’re looking to revisit an old favorite, fill an embarrassing gap in your movie knowledge, or find something new and cutting-edge that will blow your mind, the thriller genre always has something for you. Keep reading for our favorite thrillers streaming on Netflix in June 2025. With editorial contributions from Christian Zilko. 19. “The Snowman” Is “The Snowman” a good movie? Absolutely not. But when Swedish director Tomas Alfredson (the man behind acclaimed films like “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “Let the Right One In,” to give some comparison) made this 2017 thriller, he created such a baffling, ill-conceived misfire that it loops around to become compulsively watchable. Starring Michael Fassbender as Harry Hole (yes, really), a detective searching for an illusive serial killer known for building snowmen at crime scenes, the movie has all the ingredients for a good thriller, from strong source material (it’s based on a 2007 Norwegian crime thriller novel) to a good director and a solid cast (supporting actors include Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Val Kilmer, and J. K. Simmons). And yet, quite literally nothing about it works: The plot is incomprehensible, the performances are scattered and uncertain, and the direction is shockingly amateurish. It’s a bad film, but one that proves genuinely memorable in a sea of far more anonymous Netflix productions. Watch it on a rainy day, and there’s plenty of entertainment value to be found in such an all-time modern failure. —WC 18. “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” ‘Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile’Netflix At first glance, the casting of Zac Efron as Ted Bundy seemed like an indulgence of all of the worst parts of mainstream true crime culture. As America’s fascination with serial killers continued to skyrocket, bringing in a former Disney star to play a brutal serial killer could have been a shameless attempt to cash in on the trend. But Efron delivers an excellent performance in a nuanced film that does nothing to glamorize the murderer, choosing instead to break down the cult of personality surrounding Bundy at every turn. —CZ 17. “Run Rabbit Run” ‘Run Rabbit Run’©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection Sarah Snook took on her first post-“Succession” leading role in this Australian thriller about a fertility doctor who begins to suspect that something is very, very wrong with her young daughter. In a performance that wildly diverges from her tightly-wound Waystar Royco heiress persona, Snook goes to great lengths to elevate a conventional thriller premise (complete with familiar tropes like ominous animal iconography) into one of the more entertaining films to hit Netflix in recent memory. Equal parts “The Babadook” and “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” it’s a film that will push you to your breaking point as quickly as Snook’s character reaches hers. —CZ 16. “Carry-On” Netflix’s latest action movie hit, “Carry-On” is better than the average original from the streamer. It helps that it comes from Jaume Collet-Serra, a journeyman director who nonetheless has all the chops to produce a great action thriller. And he gives the thriller some real panache, with some expertly staged action scenes that liven up the so-so storyline. Taron Egerton stars as Ethan, a TSA officer who gets way in over his head when a ruthless mercenary (Jason Bateman) blackmails him with his pregnant girlfriend’s life for access onto a commercial flight while carrying a case of Novichok nerve agent gas. The plot is full of holes, but the tension and action is top-tier, and Egerton and especially Bateman give excellently committed performances that make the lark all the more fun. —WC 15. “The Net” ‘The Net’©Columbia Tristar/Courtesy Everett Collection A silly, instantly dated techno-thriller from the late ’90s, “The Net” feels like a pure period piece today. But it’s still a well-made, enjoyable action flick that’s the perfect rainy-day watch. A lot of it comes down to Sandra Bullock, who’s typically great in the lead role as a systems analyst whose life comes crashing down when she receives a mysterious floppy disk that puts her in the center of a criminal conspiracy. Her identity gets erased completely and she’s branded a felon and sent on the run, with a contract killer (Jeremy Northam) hot on her tail. It’s a vintage slice of ’90s cheese, with crisp direction from Irwin Winkler that helps it go down smoothly. —WC 14. “El Camino” El Camino: A Breaking Bad MovieBen Rothstein Famously, “Breaking Bad” was extremely successful on broadcast but truly shot to success via Netflix. So perhaps it’s fitting that the show’s epilogue film landed on the streamer. Picking up almost immediately where the final “Breaking Bad” episode left off, “El Camino” follows Aaron Paul’s Jesse Pinkman as he attempts to flee New Mexico and the authorities for a new life. It’s not as good as the all-time show it spun off of, proving more of a treat for the fans than anything essential. But Paul is as good as ever, and Vince Gilligan shows great command of the camera directing the tense thriller. —WC 13. “Emily the Criminal” ‘Emily the Criminal’ screenshot A nasty crime thriller about how economic uncertainty can push people to desperate extremes, “Emily the Criminal” stars Aubrey Plaza as the titular Emily, a former art student whose college debt and former felony charge prevents her from escaping the drudgeries of service work. When a coworker connects her to a credit card fraud ring, Emily leaps at the opportunity to make some fast cash, and under the tutelage of organizer Youcef (Theo Rossi), she quickly becomes a natural at this very unsavory line of work. The screenplay is occasionally a bit silly, but John Patton Ford’s feature directorial debut shows great promise, and Plaza’s charismatic performance as an ordinary woman with a surprising capacity for violence and crime is damn near flawless. —WC 12. “Gerald’s Game” ‘Gerald’s Game’Netflix Stephen King’s chilling tale of bondage sex gone wrong was long thought to be unfilmable, due to so much of the novel “Gerald’s Game” taking place inside the mind of a woman who is chained to her bed. But “The Haunting of Hill House” creator Mike Flanagan found a way, turning the story into a chilling two-hander starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood that remains faithful to the novel while still thrilling viewers. —CZ 11. “Fair Play” ‘Fair Play’©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection The buzziest title of the 2023 Sundance Film Festival made its way to Netflix in October 2023 following a $20 million acquisition from the streaming giant. Chloe Domont’s take on the sexual power dynamics at the apex of the financial industry stunned Park City audiences by offering an unapologetic throwback to 1990s erotic thrillers like “Basic Instinct” and “Fatal Attraction” while still exploring contemporary gender politics. Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich star as two corporate climbers at an elite hedge fund whose dueling ambitions and depraved sexual chemistry reach a breaking point when her career begins to surpass his. It’s a non-stop thrill ride that never shies away from the ugly side of sex and is one of the most shocking titles to hit Netflix in 2024. —CZ 10. “The Guilty” ‘The Guilty’NETFLIX © 2021 It hews a tad too close to the story of the Danish film it is originally based on, but Jake Gyllenhaal’s one-man show “The Guilty” is still very much a clever, worthy watch. Antoine Fuqua directs the crime thriller, which casts Gyllenhaal as a police detective demoted to 911 phone operator duty who scrambles alone at his desk during the night shift to help save a caller who claims to have been abducted. For nearly the entire film, Gyllenhaal is the only face on screen, communicating with a parade of voices played by actors like Ethan Hawke, Riley Keough, Eli Goree, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Paul Dano, and Peter Sarsgaard. It works because Gyllenhaal, with his famously expressive eyes and hyper-intense performing style, is precisely the type of actor who’s capable of carrying a thriller like this, and his growing distress makes “The Guilty” the most nerve-wracking way to spend 90 minutes watching a man sitting at a desk. —WC 9. “The Killer” ‘The Killer’©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection David Fincher’s latest is one of his slightest works, but the “Fight Club” director is still in top form with “The Killer.” Based on a French graphic novel series, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a highly experienced professional hitman who’s more than a little burnt out by his profession and ends up flubbing a mission, leading him on an international journey to take out his former employers before they take him out first. The film’s dryly funny sense of humor and Fassbender’s perfectly stoic performance sometimes make it feel like a lark more than a pulsing thriller, but Fincher’s nimble direction and sleekly executed action can still get your heart racing. —WC 8. “The Hateful Eight” Probably Quentin Tarantino’s most divisive film, “The Hateful Eight” polarized critics when it premiered in 2015, with audiences alternatively praising or deriding its script and stage-like setup. But even Tarantino’s worst films are worth watching, and this one remains a fascinating and ambitious work. Set almost entirely in one cabin, the film focuses on a group of eight strangers stranded with one another during a blizzard in post-Civil War Wyoming. All of the characters have their secrets and agendas that raise suspicions throughout the night, and they’re played by a uniformly terrific cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. If you don’t think the original, nearly three-hour cut of the film works, you can check out the extended four-episode limited series version, also available on Netflix. —WC 7. “Woman of the Hour” One of the more impressive directorial debuts from an actor in recent memory, “Woman of the Hour” is an uncommonly smart and empathetic true crime story that’s tightly focused on the way institutions ignore and fail women. Heavily fictionalized, Anna Kendrick’s thriller nonetheless is based on the real 1978 taping of an episode of the syndicated game show “The Dating Game,” where serial killer Rodney Alcala (played by a menacing Daniel Zovatto) won a date with bachelorette Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick, whose typical spunky intelligence is used terrifically here). The date didn’t happen in real life — Bradshaw found Alcala creepy and canceled — but it does in the film, and “Woman of the Hour” is consistently suspenseful as it shows all the ways Sheryl and other women are put in danger by a system that doesn’t recognize violence until it’s too late. —WC 6. “Rebel Ridge” “Rebel Ridge” is the rarest of things: a truly great Netflix Original action thriller. That’s not surprising when it’s coming from Jeremy Saulnier, who has made some of the best recent films in the genre like “Blue Ruin” and “Green Room.” His latest is a tense slow burn set in a small Louisiana town where handsome stranger Terry Richmond (a terrific Aaron Pierre) cycles in one summer day looking to post-bail for his younger cousin. Instead, he’s harassed and hounded after by the town’s corrupt, racist police force, led by the sniveling Sandy Burne (Don Johnson, having a great time). The film’s anti-cop messaging is a refreshing antidote to years of copagada action movies of its ilk, but what makes the movie so good is Saulnier’s careful, immaculate pacing, which builds up the characters and their desperation before the situation boils over into immaculately staged fights. —WC 5. “Trap” Recently, M. Night Shyamalan has had something of a career resurgence via a string of lean, high-concept thrillers with pithy, ridiculous premises like a beach that makes you old. “Trap” is easily the most successful of this renaissance from the director, with a genius premise — a serial killer brings his daughter to a concert which he learns is a trap to catch him — that the film ingeniously spins out and complicates at every opportunity, as you delight watching a monster find a way to evade the closing walls around him. Shyamalan’s direction is slick and crisp, but what really makes the film great is Josh Hartnett, whose reptilian performance of a stilted, awkward dad with a black hole where his heart is proves mesmerizing to watch. —WC 4. “Ocean’s Eleven” ‘Ocean’s Eleven’©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection A masterpiece of slickly produced Hollywood entertainment, “Ocean’s Eleven” feels like the exact type of witty, entertaining heist movie Steven Soderbergh was put on this Earth to direct. An adaptation of a 1960 thriller most notable as a star vehicle for multiple Rat Pack members, the 2001 version manages to take the creaky parts and turn it into a stylish, fast-paced adrenaline rush. Not that this version is lacking in star power: on the contrary, it has an embarrassment of riches on that front, with George Clooney steering a squad that also consists of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, and Don Cheadle in a casino heist against Andy Garcia, with Julia Roberts in the middle of it all as Clooney’s love interest. Every actor is firing on all cylinders, and Soderbergh keeps the film clipping along at an effortless pace, while still leaving enough room to get the audience emotionally attached to this rag tag crew. Pretty much every heist film ever made pales in comparison to what Soderbergh achieves here. —WC 3. “Parasite” In retrospect, the wild success of “Parasite” — from its healthy box office run to its history-making Oscar wins — greatly impacted the thriller genre moving forward. Since “Parasite,” how many films have we seen that have tried to replicate the movie’s mix of black humor, tension, and critical eye toward capitalism and class systems? Many, many American movies have tried to match that magic, and all have failed to come within spitting distance of Bong Joon Ho’s masterpiece. Ludicrously enjoyable and constantly unpredictable, “Parasite” and its fable-like tale of a low-class Seoul family that bullshits their way into… well, not wealth but proximity to wealth, came out at the perfect time in late 2019, as criticism of the billionaire class and concern over late-stage capitalism began to rise. Six years later, the film is just as relevant as ever. But even beyond its political relevance and impact, “Parasite” is just a treat — an immaculately constructed film that’s both hilarious and edge-of-your-seat stressful, the work of a director and a cast operating on a frequency few artists can ever reach. —WC 2. “Vertigo” VERTIGO, James Stewart, 1958Courtesy Everett Collection Not just Alfred Hitchcock’s most broadly acclaimed film but one of the most well-regarded movies ever made, the slippery and enigmatic “Vertigo” is a triumph of thriller filmmaking, famous for pioneering the iconic dolly zoom technique and for telling a raw story of obsession and heartbreak. In one of his best performances, James Stewart plays Scottie, a detective with acrophobia who takes on an assignment to trail the wife of an old college acquaintance, played by Kim Novak in the most iconic of all Hitchcock blonde roles. Tracking her across the steep hills of San Francisco, Scottie soon falls in love with his mark, and the twists and turns the story takes are both engrained in pop culture and still surprising and gripping to this day. It’s thriller filmmaking of the highest order, and puts almost everything else on this list to shame. —WC 1. “Rear Window” REAR WINDOW, James Stewart, Grace Kelly, 1954″Courtesy Everett Collection Possibly Hitchcock’s finest hour, “Rear Window” taps into the heart of what makes thrillers such a compelling genre: the anxiety that you can’t trust the people around you, even your own neighbors. James Stewart stars in the director’s iconic 1954 murder mystery as Jeff, a photojournalist cooped up for the summer in his Greenwich Village apartment, recuperating from a broken leg. His glamorous girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) by his side, he spends most of his time spying on his neighbors via a telescope — and ends up witnessing an apparent murder on the opposite side of his courtyard. Filmed primarily from Jeff’s window, the iconic film nonetheless builds an entire world out of this neighborhood, with silent characters and storylines that make the giant soundstage feel teeming with life. Often seen as a metaphor for moviemaking, “Rear Window” is most impactful as a thriller about community, and how even the worst crimes can go unseen when everyone is wrapped up in their own lives. —WC",

Absolutely not. But when Swedish director Tomas Alfredson (the man behind acclaimed films like “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “Let the Right One In,” to give some comparison) made this 2017 thriller, he created such a baffling, ill-conceived misfire that it loops around to become compulsively watchable. Starring Michael Fassbender as Harry Hole (yes, really), a detective searching for an illusive serial killer known for building snowmen at crime scenes, the movie has all the ingredients for a good thriller, from strong source material (it’s based on a 2007 Norwegian crime thriller novel) to a good director and a solid cast (supporting actors include Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Val Kilmer, and J. K. Simmons). And yet, quite literally nothing about it works: The plot is incomprehensible, the performances are scattered and uncertain, and the direction is shockingly amateurish. It’s a bad \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/film/\" id=\"auto-tag_film\" data-tag=\"film\"\u003efilm\u003c/a\u003e, but one that proves genuinely memorable in a sea of far more anonymous Netflix productions. Watch it on a rainy day, and there’s plenty of entertainment value to be found in such an all-time modern failure. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"10-piercing\"\u003e18. “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1027\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?w=650\" alt=\"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png 1027w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=1024,628 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=163,100 163w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=600,368 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=1000,613 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=244,150 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=155,95 155w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=65,40 65w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=46,28 46w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=274,168 274w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=549,337 549w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=41,25 41w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=245,150 245w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=489,300 489w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=978,600 978w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=110,67 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=285,175 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=320,196 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=640,393 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.10.05-AM.png?resize=800,491 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile’\u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, the casting of Zac Efron as Ted Bundy seemed like an indulgence of all of the worst parts of mainstream true crime culture. As America’s fascination with serial killers continued to skyrocket, bringing in a former Disney star to play a brutal serial killer could have been a shameless attempt to cash in on the trend. But Efron delivers an excellent performance in a nuanced film that does nothing to glamorize the murderer, choosing instead to break down the cult of personality surrounding Bundy at every turn. \u003cem\u003e—CZ\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"17-run-rabbit-run\"\u003e17. “Run Rabbit Run”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1687\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"RUN RABBIT RUN, Sarah Snook, 2023. ph: Sarah Enticknap /© Netflix /Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=178,100 178w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=600,337 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=660,370 660w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1000,562 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=244,137 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1160,652 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=169,95 169w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=71,40 71w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=44,25 44w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=267,150 267w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=533,300 533w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1067,600 1067w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=110,62 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=285,160 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MCDRURA_ZX004.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Run Rabbit Run’\u003ccite\u003e©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Snook took on her first post-“Succession” leading role in this Australian thriller about a fertility doctor who begins to suspect that something is very, \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e wrong with her young daughter.

It helps that it comes from Jaume Collet-Serra, a journeyman director who nonetheless has all the chops to produce a great action thriller. And he gives the thriller some real panache, with some expertly staged action scenes that liven up the so-so storyline. Taron Egerton stars as Ethan, a TSA officer who gets way in over his head when a ruthless mercenary (Jason Bateman) blackmails him with his pregnant girlfriend’s life for access onto a commercial flight while carrying a case of Novichok nerve agent gas. The plot is full of holes, but the tension and action is top-tier, and Egerton and especially Bateman give excellently committed performances that make the lark all the more fun. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"15-the-net\"\u003e15. “The Net”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2850\" height=\"1908\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MSDNETT_EC020.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"THE NET, Sandra Bullock, 1995.

But it’s still a well-made, enjoyable action flick that’s the perfect rainy-day watch. A lot of it comes down to Sandra Bullock, who’s typically great in the lead role as a systems analyst whose life comes crashing down when she receives a mysterious floppy disk that puts her in the center of a criminal conspiracy. Her identity gets erased completely and she’s branded a felon and sent on the run, with a contract killer (Jeremy Northam) hot on her tail. It’s a vintage slice of ’90s cheese, with crisp direction from Irwin Winkler that helps it go down smoothly. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"14-el-camino\"\u003e14. “El Camino”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg 6000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1160,773 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=42,28 42w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=506,337 506w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1013,675 1013w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=38,25 38w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GB_00371r.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u003ccite\u003eBen Rothstein\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFamously, “Breaking Bad” was extremely successful on broadcast but truly shot to success via Netflix. So perhaps it’s fitting that the show’s epilogue film landed on the streamer. Picking up almost immediately where the final “Breaking Bad” episode left off, “El Camino” follows Aaron Paul’s Jesse Pinkman as he attempts to flee New Mexico and the authorities for a new life. It’s not as good as the all-time show it spun off of, proving more of a treat for the fans than anything essential.

The screenplay is occasionally a bit silly, but John Patton Ford’s feature directorial debut shows great promise, and Plaza’s charismatic performance as an ordinary woman with a surprising capacity for violence and crime is damn near flawless. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"12-gerald-s-game\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12. “Gerald’s Game”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"7360\" height=\"4912\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"\u0026#34;Gerald\u0026#39;s Game\u0026#34;\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg 7360w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=280,187 280w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1160,774 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=142,95 142w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1200,801 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=42,28 42w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=505,337 505w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1011,675 1011w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=37,25 37w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=899,600 899w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=320,214 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=800,534 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/geraldsgame_unit_01873_r.jpg?resize=1280,854 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 7360px) 100vw, 7360px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Gerald’s Game’\u003ccite\u003eNetflix\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStephen King’s chilling tale of bondage sex gone wrong was long thought to be unfilmable, due to so much of the novel “Gerald’s Game” taking place inside the mind of a woman who is chained to her bed.

Antoine Fuqua directs the crime thriller, which casts Gyllenhaal as a police detective demoted to 911 phone operator duty who scrambles alone at his desk during the night shift to help save a caller who claims to have been abducted. For nearly the entire film, Gyllenhaal is the only face on screen, communicating with a parade of voices played by actors like Ethan Hawke, Riley Keough, Eli Goree, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Paul Dano, and Peter Sarsgaard. It works because Gyllenhaal, with his famously expressive eyes and hyper-intense performing style, is precisely the type of actor who’s capable of carrying a thriller like this, and his growing distress makes “The Guilty” the most nerve-wracking way to spend 90 minutes watching a man sitting at a desk. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"9-the-killer\"\u003e9. “The Killer”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2205\" height=\"1275\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"THE KILLER, Michael Fassbender, 2023. © Netflix /Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg 2205w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1024,592 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1536,888 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=2048,1184 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=173,100 173w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=600,347 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1000,578 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=244,141 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1160,671 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=164,95 164w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=69,40 69w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=50,29 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1200,694 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=48,28 48w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=291,168 291w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=583,337 583w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1167,675 1167w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=43,25 43w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=259,150 259w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=519,300 519w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1038,600 1038w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=110,64 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=285,165 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=320,185 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=640,370 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=800,463 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/M230922_ZX029-e1699624622648.jpg?resize=1280,740 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2205px) 100vw, 2205px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘The Killer’\u003ccite\u003e©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Fincher’s latest is one of his slightest works, but the “Fight Club” director is still in top form with “The Killer.” Based on a French graphic novel series, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a highly experienced professional hitman who’s more than a little burnt out by his profession and ends up flubbing a mission, leading him on an international journey to take out his former employers before they take him out first. The film’s dryly funny sense of humor and Fassbender’s perfectly stoic performance sometimes make it feel like a lark more than a pulsing thriller, but Fincher’s nimble direction and sleekly executed action can still get your heart racing. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"8-the-hateful-eight\"\u003e8. “The Hateful Eight”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Jennifer Jason Leigh, 2015. ph: Andrew Cooper / © The Weinstein Company / courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1160,773 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=42,28 42w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=506,337 506w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1013,675 1013w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=38,25 38w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MCDHAEI_EC045.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProbably Quentin Tarantino’s most divisive film, “The Hateful Eight” polarized critics when it premiered in 2015, with audiences alternatively praising or deriding its script and stage-like setup. But even Tarantino’s worst films are worth watching, and this one remains a fascinating and ambitious work. Set almost entirely in one cabin, the film focuses on a group of eight strangers stranded with one another during a blizzard in post-Civil War Wyoming. All of the characters have their secrets and agendas that raise suspicions throughout the night, and they’re played by a uniformly terrific cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern.

Heavily fictionalized, Anna Kendrick’s thriller nonetheless is based on the real 1978 taping of an episode of the syndicated game show “The Dating Game,” where serial killer Rodney Alcala (played by a menacing Daniel Zovatto) won a date with bachelorette Sheryl Bradshaw (Kendrick, whose typical spunky intelligence is used terrifically here). The date didn’t happen in real life — Bradshaw found Alcala creepy and canceled — but it does in the film, and “Woman of the Hour” is consistently suspenseful as it shows all the ways Sheryl and other women are put in danger by a system that doesn’t recognize violence until it’s too late. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"6-rebel-ridge\"\u003e6. “Rebel Ridge”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3000\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"REBEL RIDGE, Aaron Pierre, 2024. ph: Allyson Riggs  / © Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg 3000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1160,773 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=42,28 42w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=506,337 506w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1013,675 1013w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=38,25 38w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MCDRERI_ZX002.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Rebel Ridge” is the rarest of things: a truly great Netflix Original action thriller. That’s not surprising when it’s coming from Jeremy Saulnier, who has made some of the best recent films in the genre like “Blue Ruin” and “Green Room.” His latest is a tense slow burn set in a small Louisiana town where handsome stranger Terry Richmond (a terrific Aaron Pierre) cycles in one summer day looking to post-bail for his younger cousin. Instead, he’s harassed and hounded after by the town’s corrupt, racist police force, led by the sniveling Sandy Burne (Don Johnson, having a great time). The film’s anti-cop messaging is a refreshing antidote to years of copagada action movies of its ilk, but what makes the movie so good is Saulnier’s careful, immaculate pacing, which builds up the characters and their desperation before the situation boils over into immaculately staged fights. \u003cem\u003e—WC \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-trap\"\u003e5. “Trap”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1384\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?w=650\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg 2560w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=300,162 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1024,554 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1536,830 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=2048,1107 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=185,100 185w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=600,324 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1000,541 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=244,132 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1160,627 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=176,95 176w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=74,40 74w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1200,649 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=46,25 46w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=277,150 277w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=555,300 555w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1110,600 1110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=150,81 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=110,59 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=285,154 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=320,173 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=640,346 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=800,433 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/trap-joshn-hartnett-review.jpeg?resize=1280,692 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, M. Night Shyamalan has had something of a career resurgence via a string of lean, high-concept thrillers with pithy, ridiculous premises like a beach that makes you old. “Trap” is easily the most successful of this renaissance from the director, with a genius premise — a serial killer brings his daughter to a concert which he learns is a trap to catch him — that the film ingeniously spins out and complicates at every opportunity, as you delight watching a monster find a way to evade the closing walls around him. Shyamalan’s direction is slick and crisp, but what really makes the film great is Josh Hartnett, whose reptilian performance of a stilted, awkward dad with a black hole where his heart is proves mesmerizing to watch. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-ocean-s-eleven\"\u003e4. “Ocean’s Eleven”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2100\" height=\"1382\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"OCEAN\u0026#39;S ELEVEN, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, 2001.\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg 2100w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1024,674 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1536,1011 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=2048,1348 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=152,100 152w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=600,395 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=284,187 284w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1000,658 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=244,161 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1160,763 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=144,95 144w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=61,40 61w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1200,790 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=43,28 43w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=255,168 255w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=512,337 512w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1026,675 1026w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=38,25 38w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=228,150 228w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=456,300 456w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=912,600 912w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=110,72 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=285,188 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=320,211 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=640,421 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=800,526 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MCDOCEL_EC004.jpg?resize=1280,842 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2100px) 100vw, 2100px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Ocean’s Eleven’\u003ccite\u003e©Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA masterpiece of slickly produced Hollywood entertainment, “Ocean’s Eleven” feels like the exact type of witty, entertaining heist movie Steven Soderbergh was put on this Earth to direct. An adaptation of a 1960 thriller most notable as a star vehicle for multiple Rat Pack members, the 2001 version manages to take the creaky parts and turn it into a stylish, fast-paced adrenaline rush. Not that this version is lacking in star power: on the contrary, it has an embarrassment of riches on that front, with George Clooney steering a squad that also consists of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, and Don Cheadle in a casino heist against Andy Garcia, with Julia Roberts in the middle of it all as Clooney’s love interest. Every actor is firing on all cylinders, and Soderbergh keeps the film clipping along at an effortless pace, while still leaving enough room to get the audience emotionally attached to this rag tag crew. Pretty much every heist film ever made pales in comparison to what Soderbergh achieves here. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-parasite\"\u003e3. “Parasite” \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2732\" height=\"1821\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"PARASITE, from left: PARK So-dam, CHOI Woo-sik, 2019. © Neon / courtesy Everett Collection\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg 2732w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=600,400 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=281,187 281w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1000,667 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=244,163 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1160,773 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=143,95 143w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=50,33 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=42,28 42w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=252,168 252w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=506,337 506w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1013,675 1013w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=38,25 38w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=225,150 225w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=450,300 450w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=110,73 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=285,190 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=320,213 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=640,427 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Parasite.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2732px) 100vw, 2732px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, the wild success of “Parasite” — from its healthy box office run to its history-making Oscar wins — greatly impacted the thriller genre moving forward. Since “Parasite,” how many films have we seen that have tried to replicate the movie’s mix of black humor, tension, and critical eye toward capitalism and class systems? Many, many American movies have tried to match that magic, and all have failed to come within spitting distance of Bong Joon Ho’s masterpiece. Ludicrously enjoyable and constantly unpredictable, “Parasite” and its fable-like tale of a low-class Seoul family that bullshits their way into… well, not wealth but proximity to wealth, came out at the perfect time in late 2019, as criticism of the billionaire class and concern over late-stage capitalism began to rise. Six years later, the film is just as relevant as ever. But even beyond its political relevance and impact, “Parasite” is just a treat — an immaculately constructed film that’s both hilarious and edge-of-your-seat stressful, the work of a director and a cast operating on a frequency few artists can ever reach. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-vertigo\"\u003e2. “Vertigo” \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"3360\" height=\"2160\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"VERTIGO, James Stewart, 1958\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg 3360w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1024,658 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1536,987 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=156,100 156w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=600,386 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=291,187 291w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1000,643 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=244,157 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1160,746 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=148,95 148w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=62,40 62w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=50,32 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1200,771 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=44,28 44w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=261,168 261w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=524,337 524w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1050,675 1050w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=39,25 39w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=233,150 233w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=467,300 467w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=933,600 933w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=110,71 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=285,183 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=320,206 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=640,411 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=800,514 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vertigo.jpg?resize=1280,823 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3360px) 100vw, 3360px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eVERTIGO, James Stewart, 1958\u003ccite\u003eCourtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot just Alfred Hitchcock’s most broadly acclaimed film but one of the most well-regarded movies ever made, the slippery and enigmatic “Vertigo” is a triumph of thriller filmmaking, famous for pioneering the iconic dolly zoom technique and for telling a raw story of obsession and heartbreak. In one of his best performances, James Stewart plays Scottie, a detective with acrophobia who takes on an assignment to trail the wife of an old college acquaintance, played by Kim Novak in the most iconic of all Hitchcock blonde roles. Tracking her across the steep hills of San Francisco, Scottie soon falls in love with his mark, and the twists and turns the story takes are both engrained in pop culture and still surprising and gripping to this day. It’s thriller filmmaking of the highest order, and puts almost everything else on this list to shame. \u003cem\u003e—WC\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"1-rear-window\"\u003e1. “Rear Window”\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2237\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"REAR WINDOW, James Stewart, Grace Kelly, 1954\u0026#34;\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg 2237w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1024,687 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1536,1030 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=2048,1373 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=149,100 149w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=600,402 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=279,187 279w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1000,671 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=244,164 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1160,778 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=142,95 142w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=60,40 60w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=50,34 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1200,805 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=42,28 42w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=251,168 251w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=503,337 503w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1007,675 1007w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=298,200 298w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=597,400 597w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1193,800 1193w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=37,25 37w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=224,150 224w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=447,300 447w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=895,600 895w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=110,74 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=285,191 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=320,215 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=640,429 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=800,536 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MSDREWI_EC019.jpg?resize=1280,858 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2237px) 100vw, 2237px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eREAR WINDOW, James Stewart, Grace Kelly, 1954″\u003ccite\u003eCourtesy Everett Collection\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly Hitchcock’s finest hour, “Rear Window” taps into the heart of what makes thrillers such a compelling genre: the anxiety that you can’t trust the people around you, even your own neighbors. James Stewart stars in the director’s iconic 1954 murder mystery as Jeff, a photojournalist cooped up for the summer in his Greenwich Village apartment, recuperating from a broken leg. His glamorous girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) by his side, he spends most of his time spying on his neighbors via a telescope — and ends up witnessing an apparent murder on the opposite side of his courtyard. Filmed primarily from Jeff’s window, the iconic film nonetheless builds an entire world out of this neighborhood, with silent characters and storylines that make the giant soundstage feel teeming with life. Often seen as a metaphor for moviemaking, “Rear Window” is most impactful as a thriller about community, and how even the worst crimes can go unseen when everyone is wrapped up in their own lives. \u003cem\u003e—WC  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
