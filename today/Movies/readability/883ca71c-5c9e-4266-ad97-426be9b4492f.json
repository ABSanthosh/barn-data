  "description": "\"Where am I now? Where am I now?\" Quiver has unveiled an official trailer for Creep Box, an indie horror sci-fi thriller from filmmaker Patrick Biesemans. This first premiered at the 2023 Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy, and it also played at the 2024 Boston Sci-Fi Film Festival last year. After his wife's death, a scientist tries to use ground-breaking technology to determine if there is life after death, but once he is through the looking glass, there is no turning back. He investigates both a murder case and a suicide looking for answers. As his mind begins to slip, he slowly starts to descend into obsession... The film stars Geoffrey Cantor, Sean Mahon, Ian Lithgow, Katie Kuang, and Adam David Thompson. This funky little sci-fi film is about the \"sense of isolation\" that technology creates nowadays, as well as processing grief and the many ways someone can navigate it. It looks a bit like a fresh spin on Primer with a few dark twists \u0026 turns.
