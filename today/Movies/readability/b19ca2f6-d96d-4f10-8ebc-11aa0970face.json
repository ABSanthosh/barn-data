  "text": "With streaming hit “The Idea of You” from Amazon MGM this year and her recently announced re-teaming with Christopher Nolan for his new project featuring Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Zendaya, Charlize Theron, Robert Pattinson, and Lupita Nyong’o, Anne Hathaway is in the midst of a career renaissance that hopefully only grows from here. Having performed on stage and screen since she was a child, Hathaway is finally in a moment where she’s articulating the kind of projects she wants to do and did just that in a recent interview with Women’s Wear Daily. “I haven’t made a great Christmas movie,” she said. “I know that’s a weird bucket list thing, but I’m desperate to make a Christmas movie.” She also highlighted her interest in working with Emma Seligman and Maggie Gyllenhaal, two filmmakers who have yet to make a holiday feature, but could surely whip up something brilliant for Hathaway. For now though, Hathaway is thrilled to be taking part in Nolan’s next project. While no plot details have been revealed, the actress did share her excitement over getting to step foot on another Nolan set. “I have so many feelings about it that I don’t even know how to articulate. It fills me with so much joy, and I don’t know how to talk about it,” said Hathaway to WWD. “I love Chris and Emma Nolan so much, and to be invited into their world is, I mean, I know from experience it’s one of the best places you can find yourself. Getting to be invited twice really felt like something, three felt like it would’ve been greedy, so I never let myself hope that that would happen, and that it has makes me emotional, to be perfectly honest. It makes me feel like I’m doing something right.” In discussing their work on “Interstellar,” which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary with an IMAX rerelease, Hathaway pointed to the film as a peak in her career, especially for where she was at that time. “Getting ‘Interstellar’ at any point in your life would have been a career highlight,” Hathaway said. “The moment that I got to go into that world, for me personally, it was the safest and most exhilarating place I could ever be as an actor and as a human.”",
