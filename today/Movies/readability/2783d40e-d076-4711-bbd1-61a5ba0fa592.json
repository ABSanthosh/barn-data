  "text": "Marvel Studios It was a very big day for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and also potentially a bit of a boring one for those who decided to watch all five-plus hours of a livestream that boiled down to slowly revealing names of actors on chairs. Be that as it may, the livestream in question revealed the massive cast of next year's \"Avengers: Doomsday.\" Directed by Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, of \"Infinity War\" and \"Endgame\" fame, this movie promises to be a big, multiversal affair. Advertisement The cast includes actors from just about every era of Marvel on the big screen, even before the MCU was even a thing. That includes many of the \"X-Men\" stars of old. With a cast this huge, it makes it all the more intriguing to examine the actors who weren't part of the announcement. Despite the fact that Marvel revealed a list of nearly 30 names, some of the missing names stuck out like a sore thumb. While we're not going to go into deep-cut characters here, nor are we going to talk much about the TV stuff for the purposes of this post, we are going to look at major actors from the MCU movies who apparently aren't going to be in \"Doomsday.\" Or, at the very least, the actors who are being kept a secret for the time being. Let's dig in. Advertisement Here are all of the major actors seemingly not returning in Avengers: Doomsday Sony Pictures The MCU has been going on for 17 years now, dating back to the release of \"Iron Man\" in 2008, so there are plenty of major characters in this universe at this point. With the multiverse becoming a factor in recent years, almost nothing is off the table. (Case in point, Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the MCU in \"Doomsday\" as Doctor Doom, as opposed to Iron Man.) Here's a list of major players from years past who were not included in today's announcement: Advertisement Chris Evans – Captain America Benedict Cumberbatch – Doctor Strange Tom Holland – Spider-Man Tobey Maguire – Spider-Man Andrew Garfield – Spider-Man Hugh Jackman – Wolverine Ryan Reynolds – Deadpool Halle Berry – Storm Mark Ruffalo – Hulk Jeremy Renner – Hawkeye Evangeline Lilly – Wasp Gwyneth Paltrow – Pepper Potts Iman Vellani – Ms. Marvel Famke Janssen – Jean Grey Elisabeth Olsen – Scarlet Witch Brie Larson – Captain Marvel Don Cheadle – Rhodey Teyonah Parris – Monica Rambeau Samuel L. Jackson – Nick Fury Paul Bettany – Vision The Guardians of the Galaxy Some might point out that Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow wasn't named in the casting announcement either. However, Johansson recently made it crystal clear that Black Widow is staying dead after the events of \"Endgame.\" Barring a major surprise here, that seems to be the truth. Advertisement Aside from that, lots of these names are big ones whom we might have expected to see in the next \"Avengers\" movie, but there is probably a good explanation as to why they aren't going to be part of the proceedings. Renner's Hawkeye was famously absent from \"Infinity War,\" only to have a pivotal part in \"Endgame.\" So some stuff like that could be happening here, as \"Avengers: Secret Wars\" is due to arrive in 2027, one year after \"Doomsday.\" Are these actors going to return in Avengers: Secret Wars? Marvel Studios The Russo Brothers are directing both \"Doomsday\" and \"Secret Wars,\" which will bring the Multiverse Saga to a close. The assumption is that next year's \"Avengers\" movie will tee up something even bigger, which probably means an even bigger cast. That's where the likes of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury or Mark Ruffalo's Hulk could come into play. Advertisement There are still lingering questions, though. Benedict Cumberbatch previously indicated he wasn't going to be in \"Doomsday,\" only to then later say that he actually was going to be in the movie. So, is he being kept a secret? Or is Marvel holding him in reserve for \"Secret Wars\" in 2027? For now, we have far more questions than answers. There were also reports that Chris Evans was coming back for \"Doomsday,\" but the actor is reportedly \"happily retired\" from the MCU. We shall see about that. Tom Holland's Spider-Man feels like another big omission, but the fact that \"Spider-Man 4\" is coming out between these two big \"Avengers\" movies might explain his absence. Without digging into every single actor individually, what's clear is that Marvel A) doesn't want to make \"Doomsday\" too unwieldy by loading it down with too many stars, and B) wants to save some heroes for \"Secret Wars.\"  Advertisement We'll surely learn more as filming progresses in the coming months. If Marvel Studios has taught us anything, it's that surprises are going to be in store with these big event films. So if they were willing to reveal nearly 30 cast members to the public, just imagine what they're not telling us.  \"Avengers: Doomsday\" is set to hit theaters on May 1, 2026.",

The assumption is that next year\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;Avengers\u0026#34; movie will tee up something even bigger, which probably means an even bigger cast. That\u0026#39;s where the likes of Samuel L. Jackson\u0026#39;s Nick Fury or Mark Ruffalo\u0026#39;s Hulk could come into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThere are still lingering questions, though. \u003ca href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1768582/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-marvel-avengers-doomsday-absence/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBenedict Cumberbatch previously indicated he wasn\u0026#39;t going to be in \u0026#34;Doomsday,\u0026#34;\u003c/a\u003e only to then later say that he actually \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e going to be in the movie. So, is he being kept a secret? Or is Marvel holding him in reserve for \u0026#34;Secret Wars\u0026#34; in 2027? For now, we have far more questions than answers. There were also reports that Chris Evans was coming back for \u003ca href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/1775802/chris-evans-captain-america-avengers-doomsday-marvel-rumors-response/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026#34;Doomsday,\u0026#34; but the actor is reportedly \u0026#34;happily retired\u0026#34; from the MCU\u003c/a\u003e. We shall see about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eTom Holland\u0026#39;s Spider-Man feels like another big omission, but the fact that \u0026#34;Spider-Man 4\u0026#34; is coming out between these two big \u0026#34;Avengers\u0026#34; movies might explain his absence. Without digging into every single actor individually, what\u0026#39;s clear is that Marvel A) doesn\u0026#39;t want to make \u0026#34;Doomsday\u0026#34; too unwieldy by loading it down with too many stars, and B) wants to save some heroes for \u0026#34;Secret Wars.\u0026#34; \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWe\u0026#39;ll surely learn more as filming progresses in the coming months. If Marvel Studios has taught us anything, it\u0026#39;s that surprises are going to be in store with these big event films. So if they were willing to reveal nearly 30 cast members to the public, just imagine what they\u0026#39;re \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e telling us. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u0026#34;Avengers: Doomsday\u0026#34; is set to hit theaters on May 1, 2026.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\n    \n\u003c/article\u003e                        \n            \n                            \n                           \n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
