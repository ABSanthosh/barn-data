Last week, the debut episode saw former WWE Champion CM Punk making an appearance on the show. CM Punk served as the special guest referee for Trick Williams and Ethan Page’s NXT Championship match. As WWE wanted to maintain momentum for NXT, this week’s edition featured Randy Orton in action. Orton faced the rising star Je’Von Evans in the main event of the program. Je’Von Evans fought hard against Randy Orton but botched a crucial moment during the match’s climax. However, in the match, Evans tried to finish with a double-jump twisting senton, which Orton was meant to counter with an RKO. Evans miscalculated the execution, leading to Orton missing the hit with an RKO. After the botch, Orton quickly regained his footing and delivered the attack, pinning Evans for the victory. In the aftermath, reports have emerged about whether Evans is facing any backstage heat due to the botch in the match. Reports reveal Je’Von Evans’ status after WWE NXT According to reports from Fightful Select behind a paywall, both Randy Orton and Je’Von Evans extensively rehearsed their spot before the show. However, despite the botch during the match, internal sources indicate there is no heat on Je’Von for missing the RKO. Je’Von Evans, a 20-year-old rising star, has made a significant impression on fans since his debut. After their match, Evans was seen apologizing to Orton, but Orton appeared unbothered by the botch. He praised Evans, saying, “You’re okay, you’re the man,” while raising his hand in support after the match. Evans even earned a number one contendership match against Ethan Page and Wes Lee following his performance against Orton.",
