On Friday, Latifah took to Instagram to share some parting words ahead of the “The Equalizer” series finale on May 4. She wrote that taking on the “kick-ass” role of a former CIA operative turned vigilante guardian angel, Robyn McCall, was “everything I hoped it would be.” “Shakim [Compere] and I at Flavor Unit are always excited to bring these kinds of roles and projects to life — and then we just hope you love them as much as we do,” Latifah wrote. “’The Equalizer’ blew past every dream we had for it, and having the opportunity to do this for five seasons honestly feels surreal.” Popular on Variety She continued, “Thank you to our amazing cast, crew, and producers and writers! And I can’t say enough about the FANS! Y’all have been so loyal, so loud, and so ride-or-die—and that’s exactly why we keep doing this. We can’t thank you enough. It means the world to us.” Latifah went on to tease a project in the works that she “can’t wait to share.” To close out her message, she wrote, “Don’t worry—I’ll be back kicking ass in something new real soon,” suggesting another action project on the horizon. “The Equalizer” is only one of a handful of projects that CBS has newly canceled. The network also recently put an end to “Poppa’s House,” as well as “FBI: International” and “FBI: Most Wanted.”",
