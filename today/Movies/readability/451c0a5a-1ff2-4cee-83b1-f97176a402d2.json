  "description": "\"You expect us to follow this hallucinating baboon?!\" Nah she's right. At D23 Brazil, Disney unveiled their third \u0026 final trailer for the Mufasa: The Lion King movie, from director Barry Jenkins (of Moonlight \u0026 If Beale Street Could Talk). The story about the rise of one of the greatest kings of the Pride Lands, returns to the African savanna where Rafiki tells Kiara about her grandfather. Told in flashbacks, we're introduced to Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost \u0026 alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion a lively journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny. This isn't so much The Lion King 2, more of a prequel + sequel combined. With the voices of Aaron Pierre as Mufasa and Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Taka, plus all the usuals: Seth Rogen as Pumbaa, Billy Eichner as Timon, and John Kani as Rafiki. With Tiffany Boone, Kagiso Lediga, Preston Nyman, Thandiwe Newton, Mads Mikkelsen, Anika Noni Rose, Keith David, and also Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala, and introducing Blue Ivy Carter as Kiara, daughter of King Simba \u0026 Queen Nala. Nothing new to see here. […]",

Nothing new to see here. This still looks like an instantly forgettable, entirely unexciting series of stories that really did not need to be told. It's so strange Disney is all about this. Is anyone excited for it? Here's the final official trailer (+ poster) for Barry Jenkins' movie Mufasa: The Lion King, via YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser for Barry Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King right here or the first full trailer here. Walt Disney Pictures' Mufasa: The Lion King enlists Rafiki to relay the legend of Mufasa to young lion cub Kiara, daughter of Simba and Nala, with Timon and Pumbaa lending their signature schtick. Told in flashbacks, the story introduces Mufasa as an orphaned cub, lost and alone until he meets a sympathetic lion named Taka—the heir to a royal bloodline. The chance meeting sets in motion an expansive journey of an extraordinary group of misfits searching for their destiny — their bonds will be tested as they must work together to evade a threatening and deadly foe. Mufasa: The Lion King is directed by Oscar-winning American writer / filmmaker Barry Jenkins, director of the films Medicine for Melancholy, Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk, plus many shorts and the \"The Underground Railroad\" series previously. The screenplay is written by Jeff Nathanson, the same writer as 2019's The Lion King movie. Based on Disney's The Lion King (1994), originally written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, Linda Woolverton. Produced by Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak. Walt Disney Pictures will debut Jenkins' Mufasa: The Lion King in theaters nationwide starting December 20th, 2024 at the end of this year. Will anyone be watching this?
