  "text": "Viewers are wondering if there’s a Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 Episode 11 release date and time. This drama series follows the journey of a young boy named Kanan, whose life becomes increasingly complicated as he navigates the drug mafia in South Jamaica. As Season 4 approaches its conclusion, fans are eager to know if there will be any additional episodes. Here’s all you need to know about the possibility of an additional number of episodes in Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4. Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 Episode 11 release date and time explained There isn’t an eleventh episode for the fourth season of Power Book 3: Raising Kanan. This is because Season 4 had only 10 episodes. Recently, streaming platforms have been dividing their shows’ seasons into parts. However, Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 isn’t following this trend as all its episodes have been released on their scheduled dates and times. Has Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 ended? Yes, Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 has finished. Season 4 dropped its last episode on May 16, 2025. Additionally, the series has been renewed for a fifth season. Starz’s original programming President, Kathryn Busby, said this about the show’s renewal for Season 5. “We know that our fans can’t get enough of ‘Raising Kanan.’ As the inevitable evolution of this young man into a killer plays out, we knew we had much more backstory to share in this ever-escalating family saga. As we continue to expand the storytelling within the ‘Power’ universe, we’re looking forward to how this story may intersect with other Power characters during this prequel era.” (via Variety) Where to watch previous Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 episodes You can watch Power Book 3: Raising Kanan Season 4 episodes via Starz.
