  "description": "\"It's happening. The war has begun.\" Vertical has revealed an official trailer for The Order, the latest film from Australian filmmaker Justin Kurzel, making his first film set in America this time around. The Order premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival recently, the same place his last film Nitram premiered. A series of bank robberies and car heists frightened communities in the Pacific Northwest. A lone FBI agent believes that the crimes were not the work of financially motivated criminals, rather a group of domestic terrorists. Based on a true story, an alarming surge in violent bombings \u0026 robberies leads a weathered FBI agent into a deadly cat-and-mouse game with a charismatic domestic terrorist plotting to overthrow the US government. All of this really happened, bad Americans like this do exist. Jude Law stars as the FBI agent, along with Nicholas Hoult as white supremacist Bob Mathews, Tye Sheridan, Jurnee Smollett, Marc Maron, Odessa Young, Alison Oliver, and Philip Granger. Arriving in theaters in December. A very good film - I reviewed this saying it's \"a riveting, intense story ...",

Arriving in theaters in December. A very good film - I reviewed this saying it's \"a riveting, intense story about neo-Nazis in America - and is as relevant as ever.\" Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Justin Kurzel's film The Order, direct from Vertical's YouTube: In 1983, a series of increasingly violent bank robberies, counterfeiting operations, and armored car heists frightens communities in the Pacific Northwest. As baffled law enforcement scramble for answers, a lone FBI agent, stationed in the sleepy, picturesque town of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, comes to believe the crimes are not the work of traditional, financially motivated criminals, but of a group of dangerous domestic terrorists, inspired by a radical, charismatic leader, plotting a devastating race war against the federal government of the United States. The Order is directed by Australian filmmaker Justin Kurzel, director of the films The Snowtown Murders, Macbeth, Assassin's Creed, True History of the Kelly Gang, and Nitram previously, and the upcoming Ellis Park doc. The screenplay is written by Zach Baylin. It's adapted from the book \"The Silent Brotherhood\" written by Gary Gerhardt and Kevin Flynn. Produced by Stuart Ford, Bryan Haas, Justin Kurzel, and Jude Law. This initially premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival this fall (our review). Vertical debuts Kurzel's The Order in select US theaters on December 6th, 2024 later this year. Find more posts: To Watch, Trailer",
