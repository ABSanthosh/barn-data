  "text": "One Piece is celebrating its return to Crunchyroll next month with a double episode premiere weekend on the anime streaming platform. During Anime Japan in Tokyo, Toei Animation and Crunchyroll announced new episodes will begin airing the weekend of April 5 and 6, following the Straw Hat Pirates’ meeting with the genius navy scientist Dr. Vegapunk in his mysterious lab. Kicking off with an 83-minute ‘Egghead Arc’ Part 1 recap special, the next two episodes will simulcast on Saturday and Sunday for fans in North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Latin America. Based on Eiichiro Oda’s iconic manga series, One Piece follows Monkey D. Luffy and his team of Straw Hat Pirates as they search the Grand Line for the titular treasure that will make him King of the Pirates. Watch on Deadline Although the animated show’s return follows a brief hiatus, its live-action counterpart is not expected to return to Netflix until 2026 after an extensive post-production on the manga adaptation. Season 2 wrapped production last month. Co-showrunner Matt Owens, who previously told Deadline about his six-year plan for the series, announced his exit this week after leading the first two seasons. Although rumors have circulated about the reasons for his departure, Owens cited his mental health.",
