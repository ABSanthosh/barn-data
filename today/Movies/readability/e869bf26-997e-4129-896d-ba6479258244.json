  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Shane Gillis has joined the cast of the Amazon MGM Studios film Madden. He will play an original character, one close to the Madden clan.   David O. Russell is directing the film, which stars Nicolas Cage as John Madden, Christian Bale as Al Davis, John Mulaney as Trip Hawkins, Kathryn Hahn as Virginia Madden and Sienna Miller as Carol Davis. Production is currently underway.  Russell is directing a script he wrote, following an earlier version by Cambron Clark. Escape Artists’ Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Steve Tisch are producing alongside Jonathan Shukat, Russell, Matthew Budman and Colin Wilson. Escape Artists’ David Bloomfield will executive produce alongside SMAC Entertainment’s Michael Strahan and Constance Schwartz-Morini. The film is produced in association with Skydance Sports.  Watch on Deadline The film follows Madden’s remarkable journey — from his Super Bowl-winning partnership with Al Davis and the Raiders, to creating the Madden NFL video game juggernaut, and becoming one of the most iconic voices in football history. A top touring comic, Gillis is currently in the midst of a 39-city international tour. The current leg has already set the all-time ticket record at six arenas including Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena, and achieved sellouts at 11 more, marking each of the venue’s all-time largest comedy shows. In TV, Gillis previously released his self-funded debut Shane Gillis: Live in Austin, a breakthrough with more than 40 million views, and followed that with a Netflix special Beautiful Dogs, produced by All Things Comedy and Gillis’ own production company Dad Sick Productions, which he runs with longtime comedy partner John McKeever. Alongside McKeever, Gillis will release Season 2 of his scripted series Tires in June 2025.; Gillis is also co-creator and star of the web series Gilly \u0026 Keeves. The sketch series, which premiered in 2020, spawned a feature-length special in 2022. Additionally, Gillis co-hosts the comedy podcast Matt and Shane’s Secret Podcast with comedian Matt McCusker and continues to grow his presence in major commercial campaigns. Gillis is represented by CAA, Range Media, and Yorn, Levine, Barnes.",
