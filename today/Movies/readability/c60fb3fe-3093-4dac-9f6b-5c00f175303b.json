  "description": "\"Fights? And races? Any other bad boy cliches?\" Meet another bad boy and his admirers. Prime Video has unveiled an official trailer for their sultry streaming movie called My Fault: London, ready for viewing in February on PV. This is actually an English language remake / London version of the Spanish series called Culpa Mía (which translates to My Fault) and also Culpa Tuya (which translates to Your Fault) from last year – based on the Culpables novel series by Mercedes Ron. Nick and Noah are about to take a trip that will change their lives forever. An 18-year-old girl moves from America to London with her mother and wealthy stepfather.

Starring Matthew Broome and Asha Banks, along with Eve Macklin, Ray Fearon, Enva Lewis, Jason Flemyng, Kerim Hassan, Sam Buchanan, Amelia Kenworthy, and Harry Gilby. I thought the Spanish series was already a big hit worldwide? Why remake it and do nothing different. It looks extra cheesy \u0026 angsty, but that's exactly what they're going for anyway.

Noah spends the summer adjusting to her new life, making new friends from Nick’s various circles, and navigating a complicated relationship with him while they fight to keep the attraction at bay. But unbeknownst to Noah, her estranged father has been released from prison and starts tracking her every move. Noah will ultimately be forced to deal with her devastating past while falling in love for the first time. My Fault: London is co-directed by the filmmakers Charlotte Fassler \u0026 Dani Girdwood, making her feature directorial debut after a few music videos + short films previously. The screenplay is written by Melissa Osborne. Based on the Spanish Culpa Mía film series created \u0026 written \u0026 directed by Domingo González. Produced by Ben Pugh and Erica Steinberg from 42.
