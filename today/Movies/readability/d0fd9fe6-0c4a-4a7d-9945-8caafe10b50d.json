  "description": "\"Orin is one of the boys.\" Netflix has revealed a quick clip trailer for a documentary film called The Only Girl in the Orchestra, made by filmmaker Molly O'Brien. This 34-minute short film originally premiered at the 2023 DOC NYC Film Festival last year. It's getting a global release on Netflix starting in December. Trailblazing double bassist Orin O'Brien was never one to seek the spotlight, but when Leonard Bernstein hired her in 1966 as the first female musician in the New York Philharmonic, she inevitably became the focus of media attention and, ultimately, one of the most renowned musicians of a generation. Remarkable. Somehow this story didn't make it into Bradley Cooper's Maestro film about Leonard Bernstein though it should've been in there. It's also shocking / amazing that even in 1966 there was not a single woman in the entire NY Philharmonic orchestra aside from her. Glad it's not like this anymore, and glad she made history.
