    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

You're not Steve Rogers.\" \"You're right – I'm not.\" Marvel has launched the main official trailer for the next MCU sequel Captain America: Brave New World - landing in theaters February 14th, 2025 early next year. Sooner than you know! From director Julius Onah comes the next Captain America evolution – Anthony Mackie stars as Sam Wilson, who has taken over as the new Cap from Steve Rogers after he retired at the end of the Avengers movies. Brave New World picks up with Harrison Ford as the US president, with the power dynamics in the world changing (a real meta reference). After an attack, Cap is aked to join the military - it's not long before finds himself in the middle of an international incident. The impressive cast includes Giancarlo Esposito, Danny Ramirez as a young Falcon, Carl Lumbly, Tim Blake Nelson as The Leader, Shira Haas, Liv Tyler, Xosha Roquemore; plus an appearance by a Red Hulk, who actually shows up properly in this trailer. Is he a big trick? This is actually an exceptionally good trailer playing up the noir conspiracy thriller elements of this next Marvel movie. Worth a closer look. Here's the full […]",

Marvel has debuted a new almost 4-minute long promo trailer from D23 Brazil for their next big MCU movie Thunderbolts*. This will kick off the summer 2025 movie season opening on May 2nd, 2025 next year. A ragtag group of antiheroes is sent on covert missions for the American government. This still just looks like Marvel's MCU version of The Suicide Squad, bringing together a group of offbeat superheroes / supervillains to join up as the \"Thunderbolts\" and do the fed's dirty work. The fun ensemble cast includes David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost, Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, Lewis Pullman as Bob aka \"Sentry\", Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, and Florence Pugh as Black Widow Yelena Belova, plus Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel, and finally Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the handler Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. This is a much better trailer than the first teaser, spending time introducing every single one of these misfits. Bob still looks like the most interesting. And Red Guardian looks like the funniest one. Enjoy. Here's the D23 Brazil promo trailer for Jake Schreier's movie […]",
