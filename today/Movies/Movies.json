    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"There was so much expected of her.\" Madman Films has revealed the first official trailer for a documentary film called Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story, a biopic look at the life of Liza Minnelli. This first premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year, and it just played at the 2025 Palm Springs Film Festival earlier this month. Actress / singer / dancer Liza Minnelli tells her own story in this fabulous salute to an iconic talent. This doc covers it all: her childhood in mother Judy Garland's shadow, her bonds with mentors Kay Thompson, Charles Aznavour, Bob Fosse, her up-and-down marriages, and the triumphs of Broadway and Cabaret. After the tragic death of her mother Judy Garland at the end of the 60s, she spent her next years seeking out extraordinary mentors: Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. Her concert performances at Carnegie Hall in 1979 and 1987 and at Radio City Music Hall in 1991 and 1992 are recognized among her most successful. From 1988 to 1990, she toured with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. in Frank, Liza \u0026 Sammy: The Ultimate Event. This doc seems like a triumphant celebration of the […]",

    "description": "\"Everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place.\" Janus Films has unveiled a new official trailer for the new 4K restoration \u0026 re-release of Picnic at Hanging Rock, an acclaimed Australian film from 1975. It was the third feature film at the time from director Peter Weir - way before he would go on to make The Last Wave, Gallipoli, The Mosquito Coast, Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show, Master and Commander, The Way Back and other films. It was a part of the Australian New Wave cinema movement at the time. Starring Rachel Roberts, Dominic Guard, Helen Morse, Vivean Gray, and Jacki Weaver. The plot involves the disappearance of several schoolgirls and their teacher during a picnic at Hanging Rock, Victoria on Valentine's Day in 1900, and the subsequent effect on the local community. Roger Ebert was also a big fan of this, calling it \"a film of haunting mystery and buried sexual hysteria\" which \"employs two of the hallmarks of modern Australian films: beautiful cinematography and stories about the chasm between settlers from Europe and the mysteries of their ancient new home.\" Well, that should be enough to convince you this is worth a watch […]",
