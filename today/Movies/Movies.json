A few stand above the rest, but more often we get left with something like DEVON - an experiment in indulgence that leaves its viewers wondering what they might have done to deserve such a slap-in-the-face.    As access to cameras and editing software has become more prevalent, more and more people are making content. Note I didn’t say “films.” Content creators are the new zeitgeist - a movement of User-Generated-Content that brings your friends and neighbors closer to your face while we all collapse deeper within ourselves. Some of these content creators are breaking the limitations of the phone screen and branching out to the cineplexes, to varying degrees of success.   If you survived the Pandemic then you likely know who Kris Collins is. Perhaps not by name, but you’ve almost certainly seen one of her many characters come across your TikTok feed, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram Reels. Kris rose to fame through TikTok in 2020 with light comedy and relatability as KallMeKris. Like many content creators who rocketed to fame quickly, she began to mingle in creator-circles, forging a friendship with Celina Myers, aka CelinaSpookyBoo. Celina’s content began as dad jokes, evolving into all manner of relatable antics and occasional cringe comedy. These two joined forces with Spooky AF Productions, a legitimate ghost hunting channel along with creators Sam and Colby.    Eventually the idea came to make a film based on these ghost hunting expeditions, mirroring the Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "SORRY BABY Thoughtfully Explores Trauma's Aftermath Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here after being enthralled with Sorry, Baby, a thoughtfully told story about the enduring effects of trauma. In theaters now, Eva Victor’s film proves both sensitive and candid. Although violence lies at the center of everything, it avoids showing any potentially triggering sequences. During the pivotal event that takes place within a house, the camera remains outside holding a static shot on the domicile’s façade. The viewer could only imagine what occurs behind the door. The stillness of the scene provides a stark contrast to the savagery we envision happening within. This masterful decision makes the scene more powerful as we must sit with the knowledge and gravity of what we suspect occurs inside. This quiet restraint characterizes much of the film, distinguishing it from other cinematic explorations of trauma. Much of the film proves artfully still as Agnes (Eva Victor) grapples with her life in the aftermath of the aforementioned event. While the topic is serious, it’s not an unrelenting, heavy film. Rather, it’s injected with humor and care throughout. The tale reveals the deep impact a moment in time could have on a life’s trajectory, and it shows the resilience of survivors as they struggle to find meaning, humor, and connection in the aftermath.   Sorry, Baby relies heavily on its brilliant cast who draw out the intricacies of each moment. Naomi Ackie and Eva Victor do most of the heavy lifting, carrying the emotional heart of the film, and I can’t get enough of either. Naomi imbues Lydie Finish the article on AICN",

Peacemaker is James Gunn's highly successful DC spin-off series that launched in 2022. This next season picks right up right where the first left off – the patriotic mercenary Chris Smith struggles to reconcile his past with his newfound sense of purpose while continuing to kick righteous evil-doer butt. \"Making peace with yourself is harder than it looks.\" He also discovers \"parallel worlds\" by entering a dimensional portal, and ends up preferring the one where the people in it actually like him. Peacemaker Season 2 cast includes John Cena, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Holland, Freddie Stroma, Steve Agee, and Robert Patrick returning. And they're joined by Frank Grillo, David Denman, Sol Rodriguez, Tim Meadows, as well as Nhut Le playing Rip Jagger aka \"Judomaster\". With episodes directed by James Gunn, Greg Mottola, Peter Sollett, \u0026 Althea Jones. This season looks like it's going to pack a punch with […]",

Set in Vietnam in 1968. A recon unit known as Vulture Squad is sent to an isolated jungle valley to uncover the fate of a missing Green Beret platoon. They soon discover they are not alone. There are dinosaurs of all kinds hiding out in this primordial valley. And it will take all they've got for them to make it out of there without becoming lunch. This dino action movie's cast has Ryan Kwanten, Jeremy Piven, Anthony Ingruber, Aaron Glenane, Tricia Helfer, Nick Wechsler, Ana Thu Nguyen, and Jake Ryan.
