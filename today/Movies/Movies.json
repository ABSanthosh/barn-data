James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened: 300 years ago superhumans became public knowledge on Earth, 30 years ago an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas, 3 years ago a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis, 3 weeks ago a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict, 3 hours ago another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis, and 3 minutes ago Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever).* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home. (*It is NOT mentioned in this exposition dump that Lois and Clark became romantically involved 3 months ago.) The Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Everybody needs to just grow up, if you ask me.\" Yep sounds about right. Music Box Films has debuted an official trailer for a smart little indie film finally releasing this year. A Little Prayer first premiered back at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival and earned plenty of good reviews from critics who saw it there (93% on RT). It is finally getting a chance to shine in theaters - opening in locations starting August 29th. When a proud family man begins to suspect that his son is having an affair, he spirals into a relationship minefield trying to protect his daughter-in-law Tammy and attempt to understand his son. It's \"a heart-tugging drama about finding kindred spirits in unexpected places, A Little Prayer is a sensitive and searching portrait of an American family.\" From writer / director Angus MacLachlan. Starring David Strathairn as Bill, with Jane Levy, Will Pullen, Celia Weston, Dascha Polanco, and Anna Camp. The reviews state it's \"filled with rich performances, complex characters, optimism, heartwarming revelations, and wisdom.\" This is a rather beautiful trailer that makes it look like an indie gem absolutely worth watching whenever it opens near you.

    "description": "\"What happened to my sweet girl?\" \"She's gone!\" Searchlight Pictures has debuted a brand new trailer for Darren Aronofsky's Oscar-winning thriller Black Swan, which originally opened in 2010. It is celebrating its 15th Anniversary this year, so they're giving it a quick re-release with this two-nights-only plan. The big news about this re-release is that its getting an update. The IMAX release will be digitally re-mastered into the image \u0026 sound quality of The IMAX Experience. It will also feature a new, immersive IMAX 5.0 sound mix. Black Swan is Aronofsky's thriller about the relationship between a veteran ballet dancer and a rival who's looking to win the same role in the new production of Swan Lake. Starring Natalie Portman \u0026 Mila Kunis, with Winona Ryder, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey. The superb film (my 2010 review) was nominated for five Academy Awards, but only won one for Natalie Portman as Best Actress (The King's Speech took home Best Picture instead). The score by Clint Mansell is exceptional, and cinematography by Matty Libatique also earned an Oscar nom. Tickets are now on sale at 250 IMAX theatres nationwide for showings around late August.
