    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Julianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, Edward Burns' latest with Eric McClanahan Read the full article on AICN Edward Burns made quite the impression after winning the Best Picture prize at the Sundance Film Festival with his 1995 masterpiece THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, signifying the emergence of a new and singular voice. The plot synopsis for the film was \"Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" Now, thirty years later, Burns has returned with a new vision, MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, with the plot synopsis sounding vaguely familiar - \"Three Irish Catholic siblings from New York struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" What can I say? Dude's got range. However, I'm not here to say that Edward Burns is a one-trick pony or that MILLERS IN MARRIAGE is recycled and tired. Truth is, I really liked this movie. The cast is impeccable and the narrative kept me interested, even when I thought some plot points were a bit contrived or predictable. Burns crafts characters that we want to care about, even if they're narcissistic, self-destructive, manipulative, or just plain wrong. Burns' gift of character and dialogue is that we are drawn into the maw of the devouring devils of his narratives.  This film is no different. Following the Miller siblings, Andy (Burns), Maggie (Julianna Margulies), and Eve (Gretchen Mol), and their orbiting cadre of lovers. Andy is a painter, fresh off a separation from his wife Tina (Morena Baccarin) and now dating one of her former colleagues Renee (Minnie Driver). Maggie is an active novelist married to inert novelist Nick (Campbell Scott), Finish the article on AICN",

This fantastic 2-min montage brings together all 10 of the nominees – from Anora to Wicked to The Brutalist to Conclave to The Substance – to reminds us why we love movies so much. And also to highlight each of the nominees and what makes them so powerful \u0026 unforgettable. The Academy has been putting out these final montages for the past few years: here's for 2023 and also for 2024 last year. This Oscars video was edited by a friend of the site, best known as \"Sleepy Skunk\", who has been creating movie trailer mashups and retrospectives for years (view them all there). The ending with the Wicked scene makes sense, because most people will recognize this film, but I'm still just happy to see Nickel Boys, The Brutalist, and Anora nominated for Best Picture anyway. Enjoy. Thanks to The Academy for posting this showcase video on their YouTube for everyone to enjoy (in full 4K!). Keep on making nice montages like this. The Best Picture nominees: Anora […]",

    "description": "\"Who's making this stuff?\" Good question - because wow this looks awful. DreamWorks Animation debuted a tiny 20 second teaser announcing Shrek 5, a new sequel in the Shrek franchise. This will be released a full 16 years after Shrek Forever After, the fourth movie that opened back in 2010. There hasn't been any other continuation since, unless you count the recent Puss in Boots movies or Shrek on Ice (for real) or whatever random brand concepts they've cooked up. Shrek 5 is the fifth movie in this popular animation series, which began in 2001. The original voice cast returns - Cameron Diaz as Fiona, Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey. With the addition of Zendaya voicing Felicia, Shrek \u0026 Fiona's not-so-young-anymore daughter. It's set for release on Christmas Day in December 2026 more than a year from now, after being pushed back from its original July 2026 date. This teaser footage shows that they've apparently redesigned the characters - and they look so bad. Everyone has been commenting on this footage all day, and everyone agrees - this looks terrible. They should've just left Shrek in the past, no need to bring him back again. Ugh. Here's […]",
