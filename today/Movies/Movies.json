    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"You were hurting yourself, and you were hurting everyone around you. Something has to change.\" Well, well, well. Lionsgate has revealed the second trailer for an entrancing odyssey through space and time and music called Hurry Up Tomorrow, the latest creation from the mind of director Trey Edward Shults (Krisha, It Comes at Night, Waves). Still set to open in theaters this May. It's made in collaboration with mega musician The Weeknd, who's using his real name now - Abel Tesfaye. Tesfaye stars as an unnamed musician, playing a version of himself, who is experiencing insomnia and strange visions. He encounters a mysterious stranger, leading to a journey that challenges everything he knows about himself. This trailer is just as abstract and strange as the first one. Co-starring Jenna Ortega as Anima, Barry Keoghan as Lee, and Paul L. Davis as Lavi. She begins to \"unravel the very core of his existence.\" Using some time travel or other technique? Very interesting footage in here - it's definitely worth a look. What do you make of all this?

    "description": "\"This is all I've got.\" An official trailer is available for a documentary film titled Shopping for Superman, created by filmmaker Wes Eastin. It's premiering soon - on Free Comic Book Day at a film fest in Columbus, Ohio. An in-depth look at the history of comic book shops and how they and the people that run them continue to make a difference. Through interviews with the shop owners themselves, the doc film explores the cultural significance and ever evolving relevance of your friendly neighborhood comic shop. After a 75% industry contraction, floundering sales, superhero fatigue, and online competition, can our heroes survive? Through the evolution of comics, bolstered by the shop owners, local communities gained access to safe spaces for individuals having a crisis of identity, a place that promoted literacy \u0026 critical thinking in areas where those things are scarce. Audiences will see, first-hand, just how necessary their support is in keeping these shops open \u0026 available for future generations. This sounds like a troubling look at the state of comics shops today and how they need us (to keep buying) to keep them around. Save them! Comics shops are legit.
