    "description": "Zak Hilditch’s Australian disaster feature “We Bury the Dead” wrestles with how much it wants to be a zombie movie. It’s at its most interesting and exciting when it approaches the well-worn subgenre with brand-new spins, resulting in haunting scenes that open a cinematic window into the darkest, most mysterious parts of the human condition.

    "description": "Barbarella Chats with BLOAT actors Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here to chat about feeling bloated. Wait that’s not right. I’m here to chat a bit about Bloat, which will be in Theaters, On Demand and On Digital March 7, 2025. It’s a new horror thriller in which Ben McKenzie (“Gotham,” “The O.C.”) plays Jack, a man stuck working while his family vacations in Japan. As if the FOMO isn’t bad enough, one of his sons starts behaving strangely after almost drowning, and his wife, played by Bojana Novakovic (Edge of Darkness, Drag Me to Hell), must grapple with everything essentially alone, while Jack grows increasingly frustrated with his inability to do anything more than bear witness and offer recommendations and theories.  Bloat proves to be pretty fun, generating some tension from the fact that poor Jack is stuck in front of a screen in another country, balancing work and family drama from afar. His sense of powerlessness and the increasing frustration that develops as he video-chats with his family and hears increasingly more unsettling news makes him relatable and really heightens the unease I feel while watching. While the final act doesn't engage me as much as the setup leading up to it, I enjoy enough of the concepts within the story that overall, I like the movie.  I got the opportunity to chat with the actors who play the two sons, Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones. Check it out! Barbara: Would you guys tell me about the casting process. Did you get sent the script or did you have to audition? What was that like Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"It's an adventure unlike anything on this planet!\" Who needs a dose of super low budget, extra wacky fun science fiction from the 70s? Try this on for size! Laserblast is a hilariously bonkers, trashy fun, vintage 70s sci-fi film made by Michael Rae about a kid who gets hold of an alien laser weapon. This looks totally rad! Featuring some crazy cool stop-motion alien characters, clunky special effects and obvious sets, terrible acting and everything else you'd expect from something this schlocky. The film was also mocked in \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" once before, turning it into a fan favorite. Ostracized teenager, Billy, finds a laser gun and terrorizes the town with it as he mutates with each blast. Now it's a race against time before the aliens return to claim the weapon... and his life. Starring Kim Milford as Billy, Cheryl Smith, Gianni Russo, Keenan Wynn, Dennis Burkley, and the Roddy McDowall. Yep this looks like every sci-fi fan needs to watch this – if you're not already a major fan. For those ready to click play, there's a remastered version of Laserblast available on Prime Video and it's also out for streaming on a few other sites […]",

    "description": "\"All I want... is for you to be proud of me.\" Dread has revealed an official trailer for an indie horror thriller film titled Ed Kemper, a story about the serial killer named Ed Kemper, Jr. This is set for release in April in a few theaters and on VOD if anyone is interested. The only thing that sells now is true crime and murder mysteries! This is the chilling true story of Ed Kemper, a manipulative serial killer whose charm hid a dark obsession with murder, revenge, and his tormented past. Based on actual events surrounding the American serial killer Edmund Kemper, who murdered his grandparents at age 15 and, after being paroled for that crime, then killed eight women in 1972 and 1973 including his own mother. Scary. Also known as the \"Co-ed killer\", don't confuse Kemper with Ed Gein (who inspired Hitchcock's Psycho) this is a different guy. Writer Stephen Johnston explains: \"I originally envisioned Ed Kemper as having a sort of punk rock horror energy, and seeing that realized by Chad Ferrin’s sure-handed direction, deft performances from the cast, and the hard work of a great crew... has truly been magical. Sure, it's a disturbing sort […]",
