Read the full article on AICN Parenthood is sacrifice, and that is the message behind the latest horror film from filmmaker Michael Cummings, aka Spider One of Powerman 5000, aka Rob Zombie's brother. As he puts it in his director's statement: \"In the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bites are her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. We are in solidarity with Mindy, even if, at times we are frustrated and baffled by her actions. And that is exactly the point. She doesn’t know what to do. None of us do. Framing this movie in horror was a natural choice.\" LITTLE BITES tells the story of Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox, TERRIFIER 3), who is inexplicably saddled with a demon, Agyar (Jon Skarloff, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) that demands to feast upon her daughter, Alice. Unwilling to acquiesce, Mindy sends Alice to stay with her mother (Bonnie Arons, THE NUN) while she placates the monster with bites of her own flesh, spinning a plan to rid of her the burden once and for all.  I had the opportunity to speak with writer/director Spider One and lead actress Krsy Fox, neither of whom I felt comfortable addressing by name because I didn't feel entirely sure if Krsy was just pronounced \"Krissy\" and I couldn't rightly look a man in the face and call him \"Spider\". I really wanted to like this feature when I sat down to watch it, and a lot about it is quite Finish the article on AICN",

Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world. Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"What have you done!?\" Netflix has unveiled an official trailer for a new mini-series titled Adolescence, streaming in March on Netflix worldwide. Adolescence reunites actor Stephen Graham and filmmaker Philip Barantini, who previously collaborated on making Boiling Point (from 2021), critically acclaimed for its one continuous shot. This new thriller series is created \u0026 written by Graham with Jack Thorne. Adolescence tells the story of how a family's world is turned upside down when 13-year-old Jamie Miller (starring newcomer Owen Cooper) is arrested for the murder of a teenage girl who also goes to his school. Stephen Graham takes on the role of Jamie's father. The cast also includes Ashley Walters, Erin Doherty, Faye Marsay, Christine Tremarco, Mark Stanley, Jo Hartley, and newcomer Amélie Pease. The four-part limited series, directed by Philip Barantini, is filmed in one unflinching continuous shot, with each episode holding focus on the main characters and the unparalleled drama as it unfolds in real time. This looks wild! A crime thriller but with a \"real time\" filmmaking twist. This will be extremely tense to watch! Watch out for it soon.

    "description": "\"David - you have the heart of a lion. What do lions do? They roar!\" So let David roar! Prime Video has debuted a second official trailer for the series House of David, based on the biblical story that many are familiar with already. This epic series streaming later this week brings the iconic David vs. Goliath story (from the Book of Samuel) to the screen. The term David and Goliath is most often used as a reference for a single person taking on a corporation or government, but this is telling the original story from history about a real battle. The once-mighty King Saul falls victim to his own pride, as an outcast shepherd boy, David is anointed as the second king. This depicts Goliath as an actual giant. Newcomer Michael Iskander, who they cast after months of searching (also seen in Kimberly Akimbo on Broadway), stars as David; along with Ali Suliman as King Saul, Ayelet Zurer as Queen Ahinoam, Stephen Lang as Samuel, Indy Lewis as Mychal, and Martyn Ford as Goliath. Can one stone change the course of history? I guess it can. Even as a religious series, this looks properly entertaining. Also seems like it's […]",
