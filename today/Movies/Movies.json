That notion is illustrated by “Alarum,” which features Scott Eastwood and Willa Fitzgerald as a budget “Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Smith,” ex-spies united in an under-radar domesticity interrupted by heavily armed […]",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

    "description": "\"Why would anyone wanna limit the spectacle of competition based on gender?\" The full official trailer has debuted online for a true story movie called Queen of the Ring, about one of the pioneering women pro wrestlers in the early days of wrestling. This premiered at the 2024 Buffalo Film Festival last year and has been touring around festivals - with a release set for March 2025 in a few months. This is the true story of Mildred Burke, the first ever million dollar female athlete and champion pro-wrestler who pioneered the sport in a time when all girl wrestling was banned in most of America. Emily Bett Rickards stars in this as Mildred Burke - a small town single mother who embraces the danger to change culture as she dominates America's most masculine sport to become the first million dollar female athlete in history. The ensemble cast includes Josh Lucas, Francesca Eastwood, Tyler Posey, Marie Avgeropoulos, Adam Demos, Kelli Berglund, Damaris Lewis, and others. This is an excellent trailer - packs a punch, features quite a bit of the story but just enough to get your interest and make you want to watch. It's definitely worth a look. Here's […]",

    "description": "\"I don't keep passphrases just lying around!\" Well Go USA has unveiled an official trailer for an indie crime thriller called Cold Wallet, the second feature from Cutter Hodierne after his indie hit Fishing Without Nets from a decade ago. This \"crypto heist movie\" premiered at last year's SXSW Film Festival and is being present by Steven Soderbergh. After losing everything in a cryptocurrency scam, a ragtag team of vigilante Redditors attempt to kidnap the kingpin who screwed them over. But when the home invasion takes a turn for the worst, they become victims in a sadistic game. The film stars Raul Castillo, Melonie Diaz, Tony Cavalero, Josh Brener, and Zoe Winters. Soderbergh states: \"This smart, spiky, off-center take on the vigilante genre really kept me engrossed in a how-much-crazier-is-this-going-to-get way, which I love.\" This looks like a wacky horror riff on \"Roaring Kitty\" – but with a twist that this guy has some tricks of his own. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Cutter Hodierne's thriller Cold Wallet, direct from YouTube: An intense thriller set in the world of cryptocurrency, Cold Wallet stars Raúl Castillo as a man whose life is ruined by crypto grifter Charles Hegel (Josh […]",
