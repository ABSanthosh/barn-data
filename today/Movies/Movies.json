    "description": "Hercules loves Superman 2025 Read the full article on AICN Superman 2025 FAQ I am – Hercules!! What’s it called? “Superman.” Who’s responsible? James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened: 300 years ago superhumans became public knowledge on Earth, 30 years ago an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas, 3 years ago a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis, 3 weeks ago a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict, 3 hours ago another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis, and 3 minutes ago Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever).* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home. (*It is NOT mentioned in this exposition dump that Lois and Clark became romantically involved 3 months ago.) The Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Glory will be yours!\" Janus Films has debuted a brand new trailer for the 4K restoration of a lost Kazakh war epic film titled The Fall of Otrar. The story is based on actual history following Genghis Khan and his decisive victory at the city of Otrar around 1219 \u0026 1220. Made by Kazakhstan filmmaker Ardak Amirkulov, the film was completed around 1991 \u0026 1992, but hasn't been shown many places aside from film festivals. It most recently showed at the 2024 New York Film Festival last year as the 4K restoration. This historical epic charts political intrigue among the Kipchaks, a confederation of tribes on the steppes of central Asia. \"One of the most astute historical films ever made, Amirkulov's staggering epic (co-written by Aleksei German) concerns the intrigues and turmoil preceding Genghis Khan’s systematic destruction of the lost East Asian civilization of Otrar.\" Restored by (Martin Scorsese \u0026) The Film Foundation's World Cinema Project and Cineteca di Bologna at L'Immagine Ritrovata laboratory. The Fall of Otrar restored in 4K from the original camera \u0026 sound negatives. Scanning was performed by ARDFILM in Almaty.

    "description": "There are more and more stories being told in film about people growing old. Earlier this summer, Music Box released the lovely little film Familiar Touch, described as a \"coming-of-old-age\" story about a woman who moves into a nursing home. A few years ago, there was a Japanese film titled Plan 75 about the option for anyone after 75 to be terminated so they don't overburden Japanese society – but, of course, not all old people really want to go. I'm also a big fan of the Oscar nominated documentary from Chile titled The Mole Agent, which was recently adapted into the Netflix series A Man on the Inside set inside a retirement home. Another film about aging is this one from Brazil – The Blue Trail, the latest feature directed by Brazilian filmmaker Gabriel Mascaro (also of the films August Winds, Neon Bull, Divine Love). It first premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival, where it won Grand Jury Prize at the end, but I just caught up with at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in Czechia and I'm glad I had a chance to catch it on the big screen.
