    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric highlights a few spooky films for your Halloween night, including DIE ALONE and HOLD YOUR BREATH. Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles. Carrie-Anne Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"You don’t change the world by following the rules. Max has revealed an official trailer for a documentary series titled Call Me Ted, tell the story of \"the man who changed media forever.\" Yep it's a doc about Ted Turner, the original founder of CNN back in 1980. Turner is actually still alive - he's currently 85 years old. The series spans most of his life and career. In one episode covering the 1980s: Ted’s focus on launching CNN prompts him to sell the last of his billboard business and to end his sailing career. His interest in protecting the environment and promoting world peace leads to yet another ambitious — and expensive — concept known as the Goodwill Games. And so much more in his life - so many TV networks and ambitious ideas and even baseball. Featuring interviews including Jane Fonda, John Malone, Christiane Amanpour, Alan Horn, his children, and others. This 6-part doc series will already be out this week on Max if anyone wants to dive in. Looks interesting, plenty to learn from Ted about the media saturated world we're now in. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Keith R. Clarke 's film Call Me […]",

Marvel has dropped the new official trailer for the latest season of What If...?, their fun anthology series taking crazy all-out \"what if\" imaginative looks at different characters and ideas in the MCU. This might be the final season because Marvel's own intro from YouTube states: \"Witness the season that ends it all.\" The Watcher even comes out and says this, too. The first season launched in 2021 to mixed reviews, and this second season debuted in late 2023 one year ago. The opening once again is: Welcome back to the multiverse. So much to see in these 8 episodes! The voice cast set for Season 3 includes Jeffrey Wright as The Watcher, once again, along with Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Laurence Fishburne as Goliath, Oscar Isaac as Moon Knight, Simu Liu as Xu Shang-Chi, Kathryn Hahn as Agatha Harkness, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Cap, Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop, Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter.
