    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"The ocean is a dangerous wonder. That kingdom is your kingdom, too.\" Signature Ent has revealed an official trailer for Into the Deep, yet another new shark movie to dive in with. This one is from filmmaker Christian Sesma, best known for a lot of junk B-movie action thrillers. Richard Dreyfuss returns to face off against the ocean's most deadly predator in this jaws-some underwater thriller. A group of divers searching for sunken treasure witness the murder of drug dealers by modern-day pirates, but a killer great white is determined not to let any of them escape its waters. A daughter must confront her greatest fear to survive and make it home alive. The movie stars Scout Taylor-Compton, Jon Seda, Stuart Townsend, and AnnaMaria Demara, along with Dreyfuss. This is an interesting concept mixing a pirate thriller with a shark horror. Still looks very cheap and cheesy, but hey, most shark movies are like this nowadays. Enjoy. Here's the official trailer for Christian Sesma's shark movie Into the Deep, direct from YouTube: \"It's do or die.\" 🦈 Off the coast of Madagascar, a young father and his daughter, Cassidy, share a playful swim until a looming shark attack shatters their […]",

    "description": "\"You still believe in what we're doing?\" \"More than anything,.\" Fathom has debuted an official trailer for a down home Americana drama called Green and Gold, marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Anders Lindwall. This is opening in theaters nationwide at the end of January, a few weeks before the actual Super Bowl game in early 2025. Starring legendary and multiple Emmy and Golden Globes-nominated actor Craig T. Nelson as farmer Buck, joined in the cast by Brandon Sklenar, Annabel Armour, Madison Lawlor, and the late M. Emmet Walsh in his final performance. Lindwall's Green and Gold tells the story of a fourth-generation dairy farmer fighting to preserve his family's land and legacy against overwhelming odds and foreclosure pressure. Featuring music by Jackson Browne and S. Carey, the movie highlights the resilience of small-town America. A struggling family farmer wagers everything on a high-stakes Super Bowl bet in favor of his favorite team the Green Bay Packers, while his own granddaughter's musical ambitions could be their ticket to a new beginning. One of the most America! films we've posted a trailer for this year. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Anders Lindwall's film Green and Gold, direct from […]",
