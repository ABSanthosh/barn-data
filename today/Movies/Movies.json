    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

Apple has unveiled their exciting 5-minute music video / promo spot for their AirPods 4 (the 4th generation AirPods featuring Active Noise Cancellation - they're actually damn good). Yes it's just a big commercial, but it's also so much fun to watch, and it's always exciting whenever a brand new Spike Jonze creation drops (this one with Dick Van Dyke is wonderful). Someday is a AirPods commercial starring Pedro Pascal, who walks out onto a freezing cold, icicle-covered street. As soon as he pops shiny white AirPods into his ears, everything turns bright and colorful, and the street is suddenly full of flowers everywhere. 💐 He goes off dancing down the street, interacting with everyone, because the world's better with AirPods in. And that's about it! Maybe one day soon we'll see another new Spike Jonze movie? Because we really, really need one... He's still got it. Thanks to Twitter for the tip on this dropping online. Here's the only description from Apple: \"Experience the magic of AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation in a new film by Spike Jonze, starring Pedro Pascal.\" This […]",

    "description": "\"Who were you trying to contact on that radio last night?\" Decal Releasing has unveiled an official trailer for a WWII mystery thriller film titled Fog of War, made by filmmaker Michael Day. This will be released sometime in the spring for anyone who wants to find out who is who. An injured American pilot Gene, and his OSS agent fiancee Penny, retreat to a remote estate in Massachusetts to visit her extended family. The agent has recruited Gene to spy on the family and the surrounding community. At the height of World War II, a couple stranded on a remote estate become aware of a Nazi spy hiding amongst them. Unsure who to trust, they must uncover the spy’s identity as the outcome of the war hangs precariously in the balance. The cast features Brianna Hildebrand, Jake Abel, Geza Rohrig, and Mira Sorvino, with John Cusack. Unfortunately this looks like direct-to-video movie, despite the intriguing mystery about who is really a spy. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Michael Day's film Fog of War, direct from YouTube: \"The most powerful weapon is deception.\" With World War II raging around them, Gene (Jake Abel), an injured American pilot, and […]",
