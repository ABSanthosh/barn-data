    "description": "\"Carefully crafted to break your heart. Simply stunning.\" Janus Films has debuted the official US trailer for Caught by the Tides, the latest creation of beloved Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke. This premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year and critics loved it there. It's a unique new creation that is made up of various bits of footage from his previous films and other projects. He shot a few new scenes to add in as well. A Chinese woman lives for herself in silence, celebrating the prosperous Belle Epoque with songs and dance. Caught by the Tides follows his eternally magnetic muse Zhao Tao across decades in China. \"Telling a love story in three parts spanning more than twenty years, Jia offers a summing up before he turns a new page.\" The film also co-stars Zhubin Li as the mysteriously elusive lover... She never speaks a single line of dialogue in the film, as it follows her strolling through an evolving, changing China. \"The always captivating Zhao Tao carries the film with her delicate expressiveness, while Jia constantly evokes cinema’s ability to capture the passage of time and the persistence of change: of people, landscapes, cities, politics, ideas.\" The […]",

    "description": "\"We're gonna sort this out, my man.\" Ohh I bet we will. Cineverse has debuted a badass new teaser for the fresh horror remake of The Toxic Avenger, ready to hit theaters this August near the end of the summer. After a two year wait since this first premiered at the genre festivals - it's time to unleash Toxie on everyone evil! The original The Toxic Avenger from 1984 is a Lloyd Kaufman / Troma horror cult classic, introducing the world to one of the most iconic mutant heroes \"Toxie\". Many sequels were made, and spin-offs, but now Troma has teamed up with Legendary for a brand new take. Macon Blair's The Toxic Avenger reboot follows struggling everyman-janitor Winston Gooze (starring Peter Dinklage), who is transformed by a horrible toxic accident into a new evolution of hero: The Toxic Avenger! With super-human strength and wielding a glowing mop, he must race against time to save his son and stop a ruthless, power-hungry corporate tyrant hellbent on harnessing toxic superpowers. Also packed with a kick ass supporting cast: Jacob Tremblay, Taylour Paige, Julia Davis, Jonny Coyne, Elijah Wood, and Kevin Bacon. Yes this is a much better teaser than the previous […]",
