    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul. The action opens in the eighties with young Alex and Mark ringside Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"You see much more than what you see with your eyes open...\" An official trailer is out for this abstract, experimental indie film titled Invention, made by filmmakers Callie Hernandez and Courtney Stephens as a collaborative effort. This initially premiered at the 2024 Locarno Film Festival last year and won an award there, and it also played at the 2025 New Directors/New Films at MoMA recently, with a theatrical release set for April. In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father's sudden death, his daughter inherits his patent for an experimental healing device. Starring Callie Hernandez, Sahm McGlynn, Tony Torn, Lucy Kaminsky, and Joe Swanberg. The film fictionalizes the aftermath of Hernandez's father's death using a real archive of varied TV appearances he made as an alternative health doctor in the late 90s through 2020. The storyline also revolves around the patent of an experimental healing device that becomes his daughter's (played by Hernandez as the character of 'Carrie Fernandez') sole inheritance. Featuring other independent filmmakers in acting roles, Invention serves as a portrait of America in its late period, a country in which widespread disappointment infuses the culture with hopeful fictions \u0026 toxic nostalgia.

    "description": "\"It starts with love, it gets into trouble because of love, and ends for love.\" Bleecker Street has debuted a charming featurette for the ensemble comedy The Wedding Banquet, a brand new modern day remake of the 1993 Ang Lee movie of the same name. Arriving in theaters this April! Go watch it! This time the story features four people living together in one house: two gay men and two lesbian women in relationships. Korean Min makes a deal with his lesbian friend: a green-card marriage for him, in exchange for costly IVF treatments for her. But their plans to quietly elope are upended when Min's skeptical grandmother flies in right from Korea unannounced, insisting on an all-out wedding extravaganza. Starring Bowen Yang, Lily Gladstone, Kelly Marie Tran, Han Gi-chan, Bobo Le, Joan Chen, and Academy Award winner Youn Yuh-jung, this fresh reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved, rom-com teems with humor \u0026 heart in a poignant reminder that being part of a family means learning to both accept \u0026 forgive. This premiered at the 2025 Sundance Festival in January earlier this year. In my glowing review I wrote that \"I laughed, I cried, I smile, I cheered, I wiped away […]",
