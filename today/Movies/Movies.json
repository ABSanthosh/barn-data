    "description": "\"The death loop.\" Another remake of an American movie! Check out this official trailer for The Shallows, a Chinese remake of the 2016 shark movie thriller that starred Blake Lively as a surfer attacked by a violent shark. This Chinese version keeps the same name - it's literally called The Shallows (also going by 鲨滩 in Mandarin) and is mostly similar. With a few crazy new technological additions - early reviews say that it features AI and VR - which this trailer hints at as part of her replaying this scenario. Of course in 2025 they add AI and VR. The Shallows is \"the story of a girl who loves extreme sports. When she came to the beach alone to surf, she was attacked by a sudden giant shark.\" Xiaoyun Chen stars in the Blake Lively lead role, with a cast also including Sinan Li, Sen Wang, and Peng Bi Yao. The movie already opened in China in January a few months ago, but we're only catching up with it now. An early review says it's solid - \"Clocking in at 73 minutes, there is entertainment a-plenty in this title, with a rather bloodthirsty opening.\" Hmmmm. Here's the first trailer […]",

    "description": "\"What's that you're always tuned into? Worth anything?\" Whoa! Video game studio Bungie released this 8-minute sci-fi short as promotion for their newest game Marathon (out in September). This new 2025 version of Marathon is actually a reboot of a classic 90s video game also called Marathon - one of the first shooter games Bungie ever made, released on Mac OS in 1995. This latest update is a \"team-based extraction shooter.\" This cinematic short film isn't representing the exact gameplay - it's created by acclaimed Spanish animation filmmaker Alberto Mielgo, who won an Academy Award for 2022's The Windshield Wiper. This cinematic short features the voices of Erica Lindbeck as Glitch, Elias Toufexis as Void, Nika Futterman as Blackbird, Donnla Hughes as ONI, and Ben Starr as the Narrator. Very cool to see Bungie let Alberto play around and come up with something unique \u0026 fun with these characters. It definitely got my attention. Thanks to Catsuka for the tip on this short film. Here's the brief intro to the cinematic short via YouTube: \"Death is inevitable. ☠ From the creators of Halo and Destiny comes Marathon, a team-based extraction shooter.
