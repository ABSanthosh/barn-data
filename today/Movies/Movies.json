    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"I must kill that old wolf.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official US trailer for a Korean historical thriller called Harbin, the latest from director Woo Min-ho. This premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival a few months ago, giving it a chance to shine at a film festival before its debut in theaters in the US \u0026 also in Korea this winter. In 1909, several years after Korea is forced into becoming a Japanese colony, freedom fighters plot the daring assassination of Japan’s prime minister during their quest for independence. The film tells the true story of the 1909 assassination of Itō Hirobumi - who was the Prime Minister of Japan and former Resident General of Korea. It's the story of a group of passionate Korean freedom fighters who organized and planned the assassination in opposition to the Japanese rule of Korea. The film stars Hyun Bin, Park Jeong-min, Jo Woo-jin, Jeon Yeo-been, Park Hoon, Yoo Jae-myung, and Lee Dong-wook. This looks gripping \u0026 empowering, with good reviews from TIFF to back it up. Keep an eye out for it. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Woo Min-ho's historical film Harbin, direct from YouTube: Harbin is […]",

    "description": "\"A shimmering film about love and resilience.\" Yes! Kino Lorber has finally unveiled an official trailer for a wonderful little film called Every Little Thing, which first premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. I watched this at the world premiere and have never forgotten it - always on my mind. Now it's ready to open a year later after its debut! It's the story of a humble woman who takes care of and nurses hummingbirds back to health and re-releases them. Author and wildlife rehabber Terry Masear has an ambitious goal: to save every injured hummingbird in Los Angeles. But the path to survival is fraught with danger. This heart-expanding Sundance doc hit introduces audiences to Terry's diminutive patients through breathtaking slow-motion photography and emotional storytelling. I love this film! If you live anywhere where hummingbirds fly, you've probably heard or seen one fly into a window or glass door. What do you do next? She teaches us how to save them. It's such a wholesome, uplifting little film... I wrote in my glowing review: \"Take a moment to appreciate \u0026 heal with this lovely doc film whenever you have a chance.\" Enjoy.
