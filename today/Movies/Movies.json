    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times.

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"If you stay inside, you are protected.\" Kino Lorber has revealed a brand new trailer for the 4K re-release of the iconically weird Yorgos Lanthimos film titled Dogtooth, which originally premiered back in 2009. Before he went on to make the hit films The Lobster, The Favourite, Kinds of Kindness, and Poor Things, Yorgos Lanthimos rocked the cinema world with Dogtooth - which earned rave reviews at its initial Cannes Film Festival premiere before earning a surprise Best Foreign Language Film nomination in early 2011. A controlling, manipulative father locks his three adult offspring in a state of perpetual childhood by keeping them prisoner within the sprawling family compound with strict rules. Starring Christos Stergioglou, Mary Tsoni, Christos Passalis, and Michele Valley. Restored in 4K from the 35mm camera \u0026 sound negatives by Boo Productions and mk2 Films at Asterisk* Post and I Hear Voices sound studio. With color grading by Gregory Arvanitis and Thimios Bakatakis. And digital sound restoration by Landros Ntounis. The 4K restoration process was supervised Lanthimos. This film is definitely not for everyone, but it's a fabulous example of Yorgos' quirky, kinky, playful ideas \u0026 how he prefers narratives that go against the grain. Enjoy. Here's […]",

    "description": "\"Riveting.\" Grasshopper Film has revealed the official US trailer for the documentary film from Spain titled Afternoons of Solitude, directed by acclaimed Catalan-Spanish filmmaker Albert Serra. It premiered at the 2024 San Sebastian Film Festival last year, and also played at NYFF, Tokyo, Tromso, Palm Springs, and many other festivals. Now set for release in the US in art house cinemas this summer. The film follows one matador, a famous bullfighter – it's still a sport that happens regularly all the time in Spain. The life of the bullfighter Andrés Roca Rey during a day of bullfighting, from the moment he dresses up to the moment he undresses. Serra's doc \"explores the spiritual pain of bullfighting, the tormented torero in a ring, one of the most excessive \u0026 graphic examples of the origin of Southern European civilization.\" Uh huh. Sounds like Serra just likes watching bullfighting. This purely observational doc is described as a \"spellbinding blend of showmanship \u0026 barbarity.\" Definitely not for anyone who hates this violent towards animals Spanish sport. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Albert Serra's doc film Afternoons of Solitude, from YouTube: A film from the visionary director of Pacifiction, Albert Serra's Afternoons of Solitude […]",
