    "description": "SORRY BABY Thoughtfully Explores Trauma's Aftermath Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here after being enthralled with Sorry, Baby, a thoughtfully told story about the enduring effects of trauma. In theaters now, Eva Victor’s film proves both sensitive and candid. Although violence lies at the center of everything, it avoids showing any potentially triggering sequences. During the pivotal event that takes place within a house, the camera remains outside holding a static shot on the domicile’s façade. The viewer could only imagine what occurs behind the door. The stillness of the scene provides a stark contrast to the savagery we envision happening within. This masterful decision makes the scene more powerful as we must sit with the knowledge and gravity of what we suspect occurs inside. This quiet restraint characterizes much of the film, distinguishing it from other cinematic explorations of trauma. Much of the film proves artfully still as Agnes (Eva Victor) grapples with her life in the aftermath of the aforementioned event. While the topic is serious, it’s not an unrelenting, heavy film. Rather, it’s injected with humor and care throughout. The tale reveals the deep impact a moment in time could have on a life’s trajectory, and it shows the resilience of survivors as they struggle to find meaning, humor, and connection in the aftermath.   Sorry, Baby relies heavily on its brilliant cast who draw out the intricacies of each moment. Naomi Ackie and Eva Victor do most of the heavy lifting, carrying the emotional heart of the film, and I can’t get enough of either. Naomi imbues Lydie Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Hercules loves Superman 2025 Read the full article on AICN Superman 2025 FAQ I am – Hercules!! What’s it called? “Superman.” Who’s responsible? James Gunn, writer and director of the wonderful “The Suicide Squad” (the one with Idris Elba and John Cena, not the one with Will Smith) and all three excellent “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies. Is it any good? Like much of Gunn’s prior work, it’s funny and moving and exciting, and never boring. There’s plenty to nitpick, but you’d be a fool to miss this very entertaining entertainment. What says Warner Bros.? “Superman embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.” How does it start? As John Williams’ Superman theme plays, a lot of text catches us up on what happened: 300 years ago superhumans became public knowledge on Earth, 30 years ago an alien spacecraft crashed into Kansas, 3 years ago a new superhuman arrived in Metropolis, 3 weeks ago a superhuman interfered in a middle-eastern conflict, 3 hours ago another new superhuman, one billing himself as The Hammer of Borovia, arrived in Metropolis, and 3 minutes ago Superman loses a brawl for the first time ever.* Then we see what a lot of fans have already seen in that famous clip: a bloodied and beaten Superman crash-lands in a field of snow, then summons Krypto to take him home. (*It is NOT mentioned in this exposition dump that Lois and Clark became romantically involved 3 months ago.) The Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"We're kinda different... I bet you can't guess how!\" Can you guess how this little guy is different? There's just something that seems a little off about him... But I can't tell what it is! He looks pretty normal to me. Enjoy this especially funny animated short film called We're Kinda Different, created and directed by the animation filmmaker Ben Meinhardt based up in BC, Canada. He's been working in animation for two decades so far, creating cartoons and more. The characters in this film are created by his son, who drew this picture of Mr. Butt Face (or is it Ms.?) and a new character was born. Ben took this one-of-a-kind creation and turned it into a 3-minute cartoon musical which is now online for everyone to enjoy. It played at a few film festivals earlier this year, including at the Ottawa Animation Festival \u0026 Waco Film Festival in TX, and now it's on YT and Vimeo. As much fun as this character is, it's actually a wholesome little film about not caring about differences and appreciating exactly who you are \u0026 whatever makes you so unique. View below.

    "description": "\"If you can read these pages, it means you are looking for my treasure.\" Filmax in Spain has revealed the first teaser trailer for a new animated adventure film titled El Tesoro de Barracuda, or The Treasure of Barracuda in English, based on the book series of the same name. This thrilling new pirate adventure has all the usual ingredients: secret maps, chases, naval battles, and unforgettable characters. On board the dreaded ship The Southern Cross, she's the only hope for an illiterate crew to find the legendary treasure of Phineas Krane. Together with Captain Barracuda \u0026 John La Ballena, protector of Sparks, they will form an unforgettable trio. The big twist: the pirates can't read. But Sparks will teach them! Of course. No voice cast is listed yet. From director Adrià García, the Spanish production is animated by Hampa Animation Studio in Valencia, produced by Inicia Films and Belvision. This is designed for kids, to teach them about the joys of reading, but it still looks like fun anyway. And this colorful 2D animation style is lovely. Check it out below.
