Read the full article on AICN Found footage horror. Do you love it? Do you hate it? Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element. I am a superfan of horror films; I have been since I Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "HIPPO'S Writer/Director Mark Rapaport Chats Video Games, Sex Talks, and Black-and-White Filmmaking Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends! Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that. When Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"So long as this stream flows strong and clear, our people will be filled with life and hope... But if these waters cease to flow or lose their clarity, our lands will decay and die.\" Indeed - the story of America and where we are today. This fascinating animated short film called Freedom River is originally from 1971. A full 53 years later (!!) and everything it talks about is happening right now - the river of freedom is murky \u0026 poisonous, and most Americans don't seem to get it... Freedom River is a \"parable told by Orson Welles.\" The maestro lent his voice to this project after the producers convinced him by sending a script \u0026 recorder in the mail to him in Paris. It's a parable about America – obviously this \"river of freedom\" is referring to the USA – and how xenophobia, racism, and greed will cause that river to become tainted and toxic. \"They could not see it. For their pride made them blind.\" Kind of amazing how accurately this film predicts what is happening to America right now, and how relevant it is even 50+ years later. Another reminder America is far from the prosperous […]",

Also known as just The Professional in the US, this has gone on to become a cult classic with a ton of fans who absolutely love it. Celebrating its 30th Anniversary this year, Madman is releasing a new Blu-ray 4K Special Edition for anyone to add to their shelves. 12-year-old Mathilda is reluctantly taken in by Leon, a professional assassin, after her family is killed. An unusual relationship forms as she becomes his protégé and learns the assassin’s trade with him. This stars Jean Reno as Léon, Natalie Portman as Mathilda, Gary Oldman, Danny Aiello, Michael Badalucco, \u0026 Ellen Greene. I always like the little plant she has. Roger Ebert originally gave it a mixed review back in the day at only 2-1/2 stars, though he did praise it saying: \"It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style. And it is well acted.\" Yes the whole cast in this […]",
