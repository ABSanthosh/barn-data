    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time.

    "description": "\"You've been given a gift, and it's up to you on how you're going to use it.\" Abramorama has unveiled an official trailer for a film titled The Short Game, a young golfer drama about family. The feature directorial debut of filmmaker Frank Sanza, this is getting released in limited theaters at the end of July this summer. Ben Krieger stars as Jeremy, a talented golfer, who initially dismisses his autistic brother Ethan's golfing abilities. Faced with the choice between a scholarship and his relationship with Ethan, Jeremy chooses his brother... learning life lessons. A teenage golf prodigy struggling with his game has to care for his autistic brother, who unexpectedly helps him rediscover his confidence—and what truly matters in life. Along with Ben Krieger, the cast includes Mackenzie Astin, Katherine Cunningham, Glenn Morshower, Tyler Lofton, Emma Parks, Adyn Alexander, Brandon Potter, and introducing Owen Himfar as Ethan. There was also a doc in 2013 titled The Short Game about young golfers. This seems like the cheesy opposite to Happy Gilmore 2, more about the nice side of golf and what's possible when we put family above all else.

    "description": "\"They're willful creatures. You either gonna break them, or they're gonna break you.\" Briarcliff Ent. has revealed the first look teaser trailer for the film titled Sovereign, an American thriller marking the feature directorial debut of filmmaker Christian Swegal. It just premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival earlier this month, and will be out to watch in July in just a few more weeks. Inspired by true events, Sovereign is a tense and provocative true crime thriller about a father and his teenage son — Jerry and Joseph Kane — who follow the \"Sovereign Citizen\" belief system, a deeply anti-establishment worldview rooted in distrust of government authority. Their journey brings them into conflict with Police Chief Jim Bouchart, setting off a tragic chain of events that forces a reckoning with power, principle, and the limits of freedom. Starring Nick Offerman, Jacob Tremblay, Dennis Quaid, Martha Plimpton, Thomas Mann, and Nancy Travis. Reviews from Tribeca say the film is \"emotionally gripping \u0026 strikingly captured\", a tense look at these kind of American extremists. I definitely do want to see more from this film. Stay tuned for the main trailer soon. Here's the first look teaser trailer (+ poster) for Christian […]",
