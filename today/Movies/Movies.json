    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "This film is the story of what happens when you don't get a colonoscopy. Yes that is actually the premise for this documentary film directed by Tony Benna, but it's also about much more than just that important PSA, of course. Andre is an Idiot is the one film at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival with the most unique title out of all the films in the line-up this year. And I'm glad it has this title because, if anything, this film will be useful (perhaps even life-saving) in seriously encouraging people to book a colonoscopy to check for colon cancer. Andre is an Idiot is about a kooky, one-of-a-kind creative individual named André Ricciardi. He was afraid of getting a colonoscopy and shrugged it off for years – until a doctor finally examined him and diagnosed him with stage 4 colon cancer. Unfortunately this film documents his dying after this diagnosis – it's a tragic story about cancer taking another life – but we're lucky we get to spend so much time with Andre and this film lets his humor and wit shine as he honestly discusses his situation, his feelings, and his family. Andre is an Idiot marks the […]",

    "description": "\"It makes my heart happy to see our young people witness this long tradition.\" Vertical has revealed an official trailer for an indie film called Jazzy, the third feature film from acclaimed indie filmmaker Morrisa Maltz following The Unknown Country with Lily Gladstone previously. This premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year, and it also played at Nashville, Montana, Santa Fe, San Diego, \u0026 Denver Film Fests. Maltz's film Jazzy navigates the space between childhood and young adulthood. When her best friend moves away, Jazzy experiences both a sense of loss and her first inkling of independence. This coming-of-age tale is about Jasmine Bearkiller Shangreaux, a young Oglala Lakota girl growing up in Spearfish, South Dakota, from the ages of six to twelve. Reviews state that, \"while the energy of this world is intoxicating, much of it bolstered by a zippy soundtrack that runs the gamut, we see small pains taking shape, too.\" Starring the real Jasmine Bearkiller Shangreaux, with Syriah Foohead Means, Richard Ray Whitman, Raymond Lee, and Oscar-nominee Lily Gladstone. This looks like a very powerful \u0026 authentic coming-of-age story. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Morrisa Maltz's film Jazzy, direct from Vertical's YouTube: In […]",
