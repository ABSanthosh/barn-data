    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "And then God said, let there be farts! And thus the universe was born. This hilarious 2-minute short film is now online for everyone to enjoy. Godfart is the bonkers creation of comedy filmmaker Michael Langan. He's be whipping up films, commercials, music videos and more but this takes the cake. From the universe of Doxology comes Godfart, the epic creation myth that traces the origins of everything to God's quest for breakfast. Russel Hodgkinson stars as God - before he could make the universe, he needed something to eat first. And the rest is history... Literally. Even though this may seem like a simple concept to pull off, it's not as easy as it looks. To find the right guy for the role of God, to make it all seem plausible and hilarious, and to bring it together with that big bang finale – as the Italians say, that's amore. Plug your nose \u0026 enjoy. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip on this funny short landing online.

Odysseus Entertainment has revealed the official trailer for a movie called The Martial Artist, starring and directed by Pakistani-American actor Shaz Khan. Yet another exceptionally generic film about a MMA fighter and how hard it is to be successful in this sport. An MMA fighter destined for greatness must face his biggest rival yet: himself. Shaz Khan stars as Ibby \"The Prince\" Bakran, a fighter who is about to achieve greatness when he's offered a deal by a major promoter. As his star begins to fade, he points the finger at everyone but himself, becoming withdrawn and puling away from his family who never wanted him to fight. So he returns to Pakistan to \"find what he's lost.\" The cast also includes Sanam Saeed, Babar Peerzada, Thesa Loving, Gregory Sporleder, and Faran Tahir. This looks so cheesy and over-the-top, every line of dialogue and every shot is so cliche. Meh. I hope the fights are cool at least?
