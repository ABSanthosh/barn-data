Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a review of the Furst Brothers' new horror/comedy A BREED APART, out now in theaters and on-demand. The film follows several Internet celebrities who are invited to an island overrun by rabid dogs to compete for a prize... survival. Check out the trailer: The film stars Grace Caroline Currey (SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, FALL), Virginia Gardner (FALL, 2018's HALLOWEEN), Page Kennedy (THE MEG, THE MEG 2), Troy Gentile (ABC's \"The Goldbergs\"), Riele Downs (Nickelodeon's \"Henry Danger\"), Zak Steiner (Netflix's \"Jessica Jones\"),and Hayden Panittiere (NBC's \"Heroes\"). The film is directed by Griff Furst and brother Nathan Furst, whose previous collaboration as co-directors brought us NIGHTMARE SHARK. Solo, Griff Furst has directed such films as SWAMP SHARK, GHOST SHARK, and TRAILER PARK SHARK, so he clearly knows his way around a creature feature... even if he doesn't really want to. \"Who is Louie Myman?\" I asked when we spoke this past Friday. [Louie Myman is the credited director of Furst's films 100 MILLION BC and ALLIGATOR ALLEY.) \"Oh, Louie Myman! Do you know Alan Smithee?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's Alan Smithee's brother. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing. It's an interesting thing to explore. It's like when you do a creature feature and it rates well, and it does well, they just offer you more of them. And I love them, don't get me wrong. I grew up watching all these creature features - Mysterious Island and Jaws and Cujo. I love those movies, but I love ALL kinds of movies. The creature feature, itself, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Says Tim Robinson Makes FRIENDSHIP Fantastic! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship, which is out NOW! Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men Finish the article on AICN",

After a two year wait since this first premiered at the genre festivals - it's time to unleash Toxie on everyone evil! The original The Toxic Avenger from 1984 is a Lloyd Kaufman / Troma horror cult classic. Many sequels were made, and spin-offs, but now Troma has teamed up with Legendary for a brand new take.
