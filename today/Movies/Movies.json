    "description": "\"It inhabits him now.\" \"Our boy is sick, that is all.\" Well Go USA has revealed an official trailer for an indie horror film titled Shaman, set in rural Ecuador. Made by filmmaker Antonio Negret, Shaman will debut to watch including on VOD starting in August this summer. Shot on location in Ecuador. A Missionary trying to convert an Indigenous Community on this remote Ecuadorian volcano must come to terms with her Faith when her son is possessed by dark forces. Candice believes that an exorcism in the Catholic tradition will free her boy from the evil bonds that bind him. The local shamans know that this spirit is older than her religion and must be dealt with or the demon will take them all. Starring Sara Canning, Daniel Gillies, Jett Klyne, Alejandro Fajardo, \u0026 Segundo Fuérez. It looks like it has some seriously creepy moments and actually unsettling jump scares. It's definitely not for the faint of heart! Stay away from ancient demons. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Antonio Negret's horror film Shaman, direct from YouTube: A missionary family travels to rural Ecuador to convert the indigenous population.

Every shot in this is absolutely jaw-dropping. This short film originally debuted back in 2017, but was recently reposted by National Geographic on their channel and it's a breathtaking must watch. Directed and shot by cinematographer Macgregor, the 13-min film is titled The Mauritania Railway - Backbone of the Sahara. \"One of the longest and heaviest trains in the world, the 1.8-mile beast runs from the mining center of Zouerat to port city of Nouadhibou on Africa’s Atlantic coast. The train is the bedrock of the Mauritanian economy and a lifeline to the outside world for the people who live along its route.\" The best \"holy shit\" shot is at 6:08. This video also adds an especially fascinating context to the outstanding film Sirat, which premiered to rave reviews at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival this year (here's mine).

How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 21 Jun 2025 15:18:00 +000083618Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCKhttps://www.aintitcool.com/lifeofchuckreview2025-83617/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsBarbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 21 Jun 2025 13:27:00 +000083617THE DAILY SHOW writer Daniel Radosh and editor Lauren Beckett Jackson Interviewhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-the-daily-show-writer-editor-83616/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coaxialMcEric sits down with THE DAILY SHOW writer Daniel Radosh and editor Lauren Beckett Jackson for an interview Read the full article on AICN Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” has been on-air for almost thirty years, garnering 26 PrimeTime Emmy Awards and several Peabody Awards for its writing and execution. Many are familiar with the show’s blend of current news commentary and informational journalism from comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrell, John Oliver, Samatha Bee, Roy Wood, Jr, Rob Riggle, Jordan Klepper, Wyatt Cenac, Hasan Minhaj, Larry Whitmore, Lewis Black, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, and a bevy of others. “The Daily Show’s” audience has grown up alongside the show, with viewership now skewing in higher age demographics than the coveted 18-34 bracket it dominated during its inception. That maturity is reflected in the current iteration of the show, with Stewart hosting on Monday’s while the rest of “The Best F**king News Team” fill in the remainder of the week. “The Daily Show” is a bit of a misnomer as the show broadcasts nightly on Comedy Central (or Paramount+ for those living in the streaming age) from Monday to Thursday. I suppose “The Intermittent Show” just doesn’t have the same ring to it. “The Daily Show” is not unique in its position as a satirical news program, however it remains the definitive iteration of the format. Everyone knows about “The Daily Show,” love it or hate it. A foundational pillar of the show’s ubiquity and popularity is in the writing and execution of the show, which stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.   I was honored to speak with senior writer Daniel Radosh Finish the article on AICN McEricFri, 13 Jun 2025 16:57:00 +000083616Scott Adkins Talks DIABLOhttps://www.aintitcool.com/scott-adkins-interview-diablo-mceric-83615/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsScott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN McEricWed, 11 Jun 2025 05:48:00 +000083615Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Griefhttps://www.aintitcool.com/bringherbackreview2025-83614/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsBarbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times.

Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES.

Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a review of the Furst Brothers' new horror/comedy A BREED APART, out now in theaters and on-demand. The film follows several Internet celebrities who are invited to an island overrun by rabid dogs to compete for a prize... survival. Check out the trailer: The film stars Grace Caroline Currey (SHAZAM: FURY OF THE GODS, FALL), Virginia Gardner (FALL, 2018's HALLOWEEN), Page Kennedy (THE MEG, THE MEG 2), Troy Gentile (ABC's \"The Goldbergs\"), Riele Downs (Nickelodeon's \"Henry Danger\"), Zak Steiner (Netflix's \"Jessica Jones\"),and Hayden Panittiere (NBC's \"Heroes\"). The film is directed by Griff Furst and brother Nathan Furst, whose previous collaboration as co-directors brought us NIGHTMARE SHARK. Solo, Griff Furst has directed such films as SWAMP SHARK, GHOST SHARK, and TRAILER PARK SHARK, so he clearly knows his way around a creature feature... even if he doesn't really want to. \"Who is Louie Myman?\" I asked when we spoke this past Friday. [Louie Myman is the credited director of Furst's films 100 MILLION BC and ALLIGATOR ALLEY.) \"Oh, Louie Myman! Do you know Alan Smithee?\" \"Yes.\" \"He's Alan Smithee's brother. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing. It's an interesting thing to explore. It's like when you do a creature feature and it rates well, and it does well, they just offer you more of them. And I love them, don't get me wrong.

Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship, which is out NOW! Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 17 May 2025 14:41:00 +000083611New (and Old) Releases This Week, with McEric!https://www.aintitcool.com/renner-neighborhood-watch-mob-cops-young-werther-83610/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsMcEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN McEricThu, 24 Apr 2025 20:33:00 +000083610Gina Gershon talks HIGH ROLLERShttps://www.aintitcool.com/gina-gershon-interview-killer-joe-showgirls-83609/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsActress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN McEricTue, 18 Mar 2025 19:24:00 +000083609New Releases - RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMERhttps://www.aintitcool.com/reviews-raging-midlife-american-dreamer-83608/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsMcEric reviews (new) releases RAGING MIDLIFE and AMERICAN DREAMER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all! McEric here with a quick review of two (new) releases hitting the market this St. Patrick's Day Weekend, both of which I actually enjoyed. RAGING MIDLIFE First was RAGING MIDLIFE, a movie that was pitched to me as starring Paula Abdul (I'm a massive fan), Eddie Griffin (DOUBLE TAKE), Walter Koenig (STAR TREK), and Motch O. Mann, the world's foremost Macho Man Randy Savage impersonator. Yeah, I hear it, too. Luckily, I didn't read any further. I saw Paula Abdul's name and shouted \"I'm in!\" Going in to this film blind is the best way to see it. As I'm furnishing you with a review, however, I must speak further to the film. If you want to skip down to AMERICAN DREAMER and go in blind, I do suggest it. Otherwise, here we go. The film, written by Nic Costa and Rob Taylor, and directed by the latter, follows childhood friends Alex and Mark, now in their midlives (see that?) who are chasing their dragon - a purple tanktop once worn by their favorite wrestler, Raging Abe. Raging Abe is a Macho Man Randy Savage-type character who wears a stove pipe hat and chin beard and lives by five \"proclamations,\" all meant to help his young fans navigate life and walk as better people. The film opens with grainy footage of a talk show appearance (think Arsenio Hall) from Raging Abe and his handler, Mary Todd, played by Abdul.

Barbarella here to chat about feeling bloated. Wait that’s not right. I’m here to chat a bit about Bloat, which will be in Theaters, On Demand and On Digital March 7, 2025. It’s a new horror thriller in which Ben McKenzie (“Gotham,” “The O.C.”) plays Jack, a man stuck working while his family vacations in Japan. As if the FOMO isn’t bad enough, one of his sons starts behaving strangely after almost drowning, and his wife, played by Bojana Novakovic (Edge of Darkness, Drag Me to Hell), must grapple with everything essentially alone, while Jack grows increasingly frustrated with his inability to do anything more than bear witness and offer recommendations and theories.  Bloat proves to be pretty fun, generating some tension from the fact that poor Jack is stuck in front of a screen in another country, balancing work and family drama from afar. His sense of powerlessness and the increasing frustration that develops as he video-chats with his family and hears increasingly more unsettling news makes him relatable and really heightens the unease I feel while watching. While the final act doesn't engage me as much as the setup leading up to it, I enjoy enough of the concepts within the story that overall, I like the movie.  I got the opportunity to chat with the actors who play the two sons, Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones.

Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN McEricWed, 26 Feb 2025 20:15:00 +000083606Julianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGEhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-julianna-margulies-gretchen-mol-mceric-83605/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsJulianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, Edward Burns' latest with Eric McClanahan Read the full article on AICN Edward Burns made quite the impression after winning the Best Picture prize at the Sundance Film Festival with his 1995 masterpiece THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, signifying the emergence of a new and singular voice. The plot synopsis for the film was \"Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" Now, thirty years later, Burns has returned with a new vision, MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, with the plot synopsis sounding vaguely familiar - \"Three Irish Catholic siblings from New York struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" What can I say? Dude's got range. However, I'm not here to say that Edward Burns is a one-trick pony or that MILLERS IN MARRIAGE is recycled and tired. Truth is, I really liked this movie. The cast is impeccable and the narrative kept me interested, even when I thought some plot points were a bit contrived or predictable. Burns crafts characters that we want to care about, even if they're narcissistic, self-destructive, manipulative, or just plain wrong. Burns' gift of character and dialogue is that we are drawn into the maw of the devouring devils of his narratives.  This film is no different. Following the Miller siblings, Andy (Burns), Maggie (Julianna Margulies), and Eve (Gretchen Mol), and their orbiting cadre of lovers. Andy is a painter, fresh off a separation from his wife Tina (Morena Baccarin) and now dating one of her former colleagues Renee (Minnie Driver).

Read the full article on AICN Parenthood is sacrifice, and that is the message behind the latest horror film from filmmaker Michael Cummings, aka Spider One of Powerman 5000, aka Rob Zombie's brother. As he puts it in his director's statement: \"In the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bites are her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. We are in solidarity with Mindy, even if, at times we are frustrated and baffled by her actions. And that is exactly the point. She doesn’t know what to do. None of us do. Framing this movie in horror was a natural choice.\" LITTLE BITES tells the story of Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox, TERRIFIER 3), who is inexplicably saddled with a demon, Agyar (Jon Skarloff, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) that demands to feast upon her daughter, Alice. Unwilling to acquiesce, Mindy sends Alice to stay with her mother (Bonnie Arons, THE NUN) while she placates the monster with bites of her own flesh, spinning a plan to rid of her the burden once and for all.  I had the opportunity to speak with writer/director Spider One and lead actress Krsy Fox, neither of whom I felt comfortable addressing by name because I didn't feel entirely sure if Krsy was just pronounced \"Krissy\" and I couldn't rightly look a man in the face and call him \"Spider\".

Moreover, who shepherded us into this bold new world? Director Greg Kohrs and producer Gary Krieg sought this very answer and it brought them to Demis Hassabis.   Demis Hassabis began his journey as a young chess prodigy before shifting gears toward changing the world. He was drawn to the game as a “A fun thinking game,” but after a particularly long battle at a world tournament, he saw a futility in wasting his brain on games when there were real challenges to which he could apply his talents.    During a gap year between high school and college, Demis got an internship at Bullfrog games, where he implemented rudimentary AI into a PC game called Theme Park. His innovation allowed the NPCs to react to each other as well as the gamers’ intervention and create a more interconnected and immersive experience. This caught the eye of Electronic Arts and changed the trajectory of video games for years to come. Despite this transformative influence, Demis focused on college and after graduation sought to tackle the issue of Artificial General Intelligence.   For the uninitiated, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a true thinking creation. Inspired to a point by the AI Deep Blue defeating Chess master Kasparov in 1997, Demis was duly impressed by the victory but saw the limitation of an innovation that could ONLY play chess. As admirable as that was, Demis saw an imminent future where an AI could beat Finish the article on AICN McEricThu, 06 Feb 2025 01:26:00 +000083603Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH MEhttps://www.aintitcool.com/touch-me-sundance-midnight-83602/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsMcEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too.

Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN McEricTue, 31 Dec 2024 01:37:00 +000083601James Fox Discusses His Documentary THE PROGRAMhttps://www.aintitcool.com/interview-james-fox-the-program-uap-reports-83600/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=reviewsFilmmaker James Fox discusses his new documentary THE PROGRAM which examines the United States government's pre-existing relationship with UAPs.

Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

Read the full article on AICN Everything about film has changed, and while some lambast this brave new world, it does have its silver linings. Streaming services took over channels and then became their own studios. For every Netflix dud there's a great horror film championed by SHUDDER, Bloody Disgusting, or Fangoria that would go otherwise unproduced. SHUDDER, specifically, has been picking up amazing films, from last year's LATE NIGHT WITH THE DEVIL to this year's IN A VIOLENT NATURE. The studio is ending the year strong with a meta take on the coming-of-age slasher rom-com called BLOODY AXE WOUND, releasing in limited theaters before landing on the streamer in early 2025. The synopsis is as follows: Abbie Bladecut (Sari Arambulo, \"A.P. Bio\") is a teenager torn between the macabre traditions of her family’s bloody trade and the tender stirrings of her first crush (Molly Brown, \"Dexter: Original Sin\"). In the small town of Clover Falls, Abbie’s father, Roger Bladecut (Billy Burke, TWILIGHT), has built an infamous legacy by capturing real-life killings on tape and selling them to eager customers, but as Abbie delves deeper into the grisly family business, she begins to wonder if it’s time to take the family tradition in a new direction.  The conceit of the film is surprisingly fresh in a genre that finds new ways to reinvent itself with shocking regularity.

Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Do you think it is its own genre or do you lump it in with its overarching tone - slasher, supernatural, monster, etc. Love it or hate it, the convention is here to stay, as it offers a realistic, relatable approach to horror that blurs the lines between reality, film, empathy, and voyeurism.   So, when I got an email asking if I wanted to screen the feature DEVON, written and directed by Jenni “JWoww” Farley, I said “of course I do!” My wife is a fan of “Jersey Shore” and has been since day one, so I mostly did it for her, but I was also very curious what the singular star would bring to the horror pantheon. The logline read:   Devon's parents never stopped searching for answers after her disappearance from a notorious asylum. Years after the incident, a mysterious website draws five adventurers to the abandoned asylum where she was last seen. Armed with cameras, they plunge into the darkness, unaware they’re filming their own descent into horror—never meant to return.     I got the chance to chat with writer/director/producer Jenni “JWoww” Farley about jumping into a feature-length film, the serendipitous location, and her crew.      Eric McClanahan: Hey, Jenni! How are you?   Jenni “JWoww” Farley: Good. Nervous.    EM: Nervous? Why are you nervous?   JJF: I feel like this is [me] kind of starting my career over. It’s a different world, a different element.

Barbarella here to talk about dark comedy Hippo, or more accurately to share the conversation I had with Hippo’s director and writer Mark Rapaport. Genuinely funny, this incredible film has the potential to achieve cult status, so long as people take a chance on this black-and-white gem and actually see it. I recommend that they do. Hippo stars Kimball Farley, Lilla Kizlinger, Eliza Roberts, and Eric Roberts as the narrator. It tells the story of two exceptionally different teens being raised by their mother in a somewhat isolated existence. At times, it reminds me of Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, in the way that the children in Hippo are sheltered, while not in the same extreme way they were in the Greek film, both films make strong points about the detriment of isolation. The two would make a great double-feature, but if you want to jump on this one first, Hippo will be in select theaters November 8.  At any rate, after a night of minimal sleep due to staying out late at the Pink concert, I caught up with Mark Rapaport, and we had a fun chat about the movie. Check it out! Barbara: Why go black and white with this?  Mark: I've always loved classic movies, but I never thought I would make a movie in black and white until my cinematographer started taking photos of black and white, and I was like, “These are so cool and good, why don't more people shoot in black and white? Maybe we should do something like that.” He was very into that.

Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN staffSat, 05 Oct 2024 14:56:00 +000083593STRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024!https://www.aintitcool.com/strangeharvestinterview2024-83592/?utm_source=full-feed\u0026utm_medium=feed\u0026utm_term=coolnewsSTRANGE HARVEST: THE OCCULT MURDER IN THE INLAND EMPIRE Premieres at Fantastic Fest 2024! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends. Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.    Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!   Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric! How are you?   EM - I’m well, thank you!   KS - Look at that cat!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN BarbarellaSat, 14 Sep 2024 13:57:00 +000083589",

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",
