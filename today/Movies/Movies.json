    "description": "McEric highlights a few spooky films for your Halloween night, including DIE ALONE and HOLD YOUR BREATH. Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles. Carrie-Anne Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"If you really care for her, then move on...\" Meet Werther. Lionsgate has unveiled an official trailer for a fresh indie romantic comedy called Young Werther, which is the feature directorial debut of filmmaker José Avelino Gilles Corbett Lourenço. This Canadian production premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Fest and earned some good buzz there. It's already set for a December release on VOD in the US if anyone wants to hang out with Werther. The film is a clever contemporary adaptation of Goethe's smash hit 1774 novel of tragic romance. Set in Toronto, Douglas Booth stars as Werther - a wealthy young man who instantly falls for a woman named Charlotte, co-starring Alison Pill. \"He falls more in love with her as they spend time together. She’s introverted, loves to read, and has been the main caretaker of her siblings since the deaths of their parents. A small snag to their union, however, is that Charlotte is engaged to successful lawyer Albert.\" It's a tale of unrequited love, but can he win he heart anyway? The cast includes Iris Apatow, Patrick J. Adams, Amrit Kaur, and Jaouhar Ben Ayed. I've seen this one and it's pretty good. Don't write […]",

Blue Fox Ent. has unveiled an official trailer for an indie survival thriller called Year 10, marking the feature directorial debut of British filmmaker Ben Goodger. It first premiered at FrightFest 2024 but it hasn't show up anywhere else. This will be on VOD in December if anyone thinks it looks good. 10 years after the fall of civilization, the few survivors have been driven to cannibalism. A young man must confront a violent tribe that has murdered his father and stolen the medicine that keeps his girlfriend alive. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic world, the film focuses on a man fighting wild dogs, nature, and other brutal humans in order to save his love. Starring Toby Goodger, Hannah Khalique-Brown, Duncan Lacroix, Alexander Anderson. I'm tired of these bland survival thrillers that are always \"people will turn horrible and start eating each other!\" Every time they all have the same gritty look and nothing new to offer.
