    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "Kevin Smith Talks to McEric about THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Kevin Smith’s THE 4:30 MOVIE is coming home today, available on digital through all major retailers. The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.    Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!   Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of “Movies With Kev,” where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening.   Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smith’s newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

It feels a little wrong that I have a ton of pep today while I’m covering a movie about the very serious topic of suicide, but here we are. Continue makes a personal and powerful statement from writer, director, and star Nadine Crocker, who survived her own suicide attempt in her twenties. In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film.  Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it. Check out his response and the rest of our conversation!  Shiloh: That is so sweet. It’s still one of my favorite movies.

    "description": "Barbarella and Director Audrey Cummings Discuss Western PLACE OF BONES! Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here. A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.    I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.   I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes. While she placed Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzy Bear in the lead roles of Calhoun (Corin Nemec), Pandora (Heather Graham), and Hester (Brielle Robillard), I took a completely different approach, thinking it would be fun to have Statler and Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "#ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn talk to McEric about the new slasher comedy! Read the full article on AICN There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.  Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.” The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.   Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

    "description": "Amazon MGM Revives the Legendary Studio United Artists! Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:   “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films Finish the article on AICN",

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories?

But when I got an email that said there was a new film coming out with Chuck Norris and Marc Singer, and would I like to talk to Marc Singer about it, I practically broke the sound barrier with my swift response of “hell to the yes!”     I’m a man of a certain age, and I grew up in the wilds of Southeast Texas. As I recall my rough and tumble childhood, I don’t say I’m from the streets - I’m from the roads. Concrete jungle films didn’t interest me quite as much as actual jungle films, so if you wanted my ticket money, throw an animal or two in your film. Want to see Clint Eastwood act with a monkey? Hell yes, take my money.   So for me there was no greater action franchise than the BEASTMASTER films starring Marc Singer. The Sword \u0026 Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another.

This plot borrows from the classic Kingpin (make money pro bowling), which for decades has been one of the only bowling comedies to ever exist. The Gutter is an \"outrageous and hilarious spin\" on sports comedy. Walt is pressured to embrace his bowling talent, sparking backlash from detractors seeking to undermine his sudden pro success.

And there's potential for us to change it.\" Focus has debuted a second trailer for Piece by Piece, a LEGO version of the story of musician Pharrell Williams. Opening in theaters THIS weekend! This is one of the first LEGO movies that is not related to another franchise (like Star Wars), instead it's all about Pharrell, but told using the same animated LEGO style anyway. It's described as a \"one-of-a-kind cinematic experience about one of music's most innovative minds.\" Told through the lens of LEGO animation, turn up the volume on your imagination and witness the evolution of one of music's most innovative minds. With appearances by Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg. Follow this autobiographical movie where Pharrell shows his imaginative \u0026 creative process using LEGO, as he constructs models representing his artistic development. Each build reflects a different creative milestone. It's directed by doc mastermind Morgan Neville. I'm looking forward to watching this! Kinda cool to see them visualize ...",

They're gonna have to accept that!\" Neon has debuted the second US trailer for Anora, the beloved Palme d'Or winner from the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, made by acclaimed filmmaker Sean Baker (of Tangerine, The Florida Project, Red Rocket). This has been getting rave reviews from everyone since Cannes, with stops at TIFF and NYFF. Ani, a young sex worker from Brooklyn who works nightly as a stripper in Manhattan, gets her chance at a Cinderella story when she meets and then impulsively marries the son of a Russian oligarch named Vanya (aka Ivan). Once the news reaches Russia, their little fairytale is threatened as the parents set out for New York to get the marriage annulled. So begins 24 hours of stressful NYC mayhem as hired goons pick her up and try to find Ivan.

Yes it's based on the book (and British movie) of the same name. The 1973 movie is also called The Day of the Jackal, starring Edward Fox, and it's adapted from the book by Frederick Forsyth. There's a 1997 Hollywood movie called The Jackal also about an assassin, borrowing the same story with a few alterations. The series is a bold, contemporary re-imagining of the beloved and respected novel \u0026 film - presented as a cat \u0026 mouse chase. While remaining true to the DNA of the original, this contemporary drama will delve deeper into the life of the chameleon like \"anti-hero\" at the heart of the story, in a high octane, cinematic, globetrotting \"cat \u0026 mouse\" thriller, set amidst the turbulent geo-political landscape of these times.

This doc is a juicy true story about deception, denial, fraud, and the seductive promise of fame and fortune. It premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival and is already on VOD to watch now. \"With shocking revelations at every turn, the film questions the fabric of the entertainment business, where a fake it till you make it mentality blurs the lines between reality and facade in the cutthroat pursuit of success.

    "description": "\"That's the thing about folks like us, Artie. We're all living with ghosts.\" Samuel Goldwyn Films in the US has revealed a new US trailer for the drama titled The Last Rifleman, made by filmmaker Terry Loane. This already opened in the UK last year - we posted the first trailer almost a year ago but it's only opening in the US now. Another patriotic \"never forget!\" story about old WWII veterans – this film tells the exact same story as The Great Escaper with Michael Caine. The same exact characters and everything. A WWII veteran escapes his care home in Northern Ireland and embarks on an arduous but inspirational journey to France to attend the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, finding the courage to face the ghosts of his past. The film stars Pierce Brosnan (in prosthetics) as 92 \u0026 3/4-years-old Artie Crawford, Clemence Poesy, John Amos, Jürgen Prochnow, Claire Rafferty, and Desmond Eastwood. This looks like a heartwarming, uplifting story about honoring our veterans and how lonely they get at the end of their lives. Worth a ...",

It's landing on VOD directly next month. The night before Claire Reynolds' big trip to Paris, she catches the eye of a mysterious, handsome stranger. That's the last thing she remembers before waking up on a plane with no recollection of what happened after that. Things take a dangerous turn when someone slips her a note warning that there is a threat on the plane and that she might be the target. What!? This bastard is messing with her! The full cast features Tiffany Smith as Claire, along with Maria Russell, Ashley Jones, Daniel Robaire, Brandon Morales, Sandi McCree, Scott Dean, Alisa Allapach, Tiagz, Darren Weiss, Jeff Torres, Kelsie McDonald, with Cristo Fernández.

A father and son working as security guards for an armored truck company encounter a team of would-be robbers while on a bridge. They become trapped and must come up with a plan to escape and ensure their survival. They discover the value of what they have been carrying and join forces to outgun and outwit their attackers. Why is every last action screenplay so boring \u0026 derivative these days? Armor stars Jason Patric and Sylvester Stallone, along with Dash Mihok, Josh Wiggins, Blake Shields, and Erin Ownbey.

    "description": "\"I'm already proud of you, Marcel.\" Sony Pictures Classics has revealed the first teaser trailer for a French animated film called Magnificent Life of Marcel Pagnol, the latest creation from Sylvain Chomet. You already know his other films - The Triplets of Belleville and The Illusionist. This is his latest feature since Attila Marcel in 2013. He also directed the animated short at the start of Joker: Folie à Deux about his shadow. His new film follows the life of Marcel Pagnol, a playwright, novelist, and a filmmaker who became one of the world's most inventive \u0026 prolific artists in the mid-20th century. Based on Pagnol's book, examining his entire life from childhood through his successful career in France and beyond. No US release date is set - expected in early 2025. This teaser features an English-language voice cast with what sounds like Tom Hiddleston as the voice of Marcel, though they did not announce the cast yet. This looks like a mesmerizing, compelling, vibrant follow-up to his previous films, with more eccentric characters. Definitely curious to see more footage ...",
