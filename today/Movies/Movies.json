    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

It'll be playing in cinemas nationwide starting December 25th, Christmas Day, this week. At the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, a young Bob Dylan shakes up his act on the folk music scene by going electric and siring rock as the voice of a generation - defining one of the most transformative moments in 20th century music. Timothée Chalamet stars as a young Bob Dylan in this film written and directed by James Mangold, coming off of the Indiana Jones movie. It also stars Edward Norton as Pete Seeger (one of the best supporting performances of the year), Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, Monica Barbaro as Joan Baez, Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz, and Scoot McNairy as Woody Guthrie. I finally had a chance to see this and it's exceptional - earning a spot on my Top 10 list just before the end of the year. Now is your chance to catch it on the big […]",

The truth is the truth, but it's not always the most important thing.\" Netflix has revealed a first look teaser trailer for an intense new upcoming thriller series called Zero Day, debuting to watch on Netflix streaming starting in late February (this teaser will also air during NFL games). This highly anticipated Netflix conspiracy series is about finding the perpetrators of a devastating cyber attack (known as \"Zero Day\") that has caused chaos around the country. In the midst of crisis: how can we discover the truth when it seems that the world is being destroyed by uncontrollable forces? Also, to what extent are conspiracy theories our own inventions or products of our imagination? For those curious to learn more, you can watch Alex Gibney's doc film also titled Zero Days about the realities of a cyber attack like this. Starring Robert De Niro as a former President, Angela Bassett as the current President, Lizzy Caplan, Jesse Plemons, Joan Allen, Connie Britton, Matthew Modine, Dan Stevens, Bill Camp, Gaby Hoffmann, and Clark Gregg.
