    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "Get ready for an epic showdown amongst God and Men! The epic first trailer for the Chinese action fantasy sequel Creation of the Gods II: Demonic Confrontation has debuted online. It's worth a watch just to see some gigantic Gods involved in an epic battle. This is a follow-up to Wuershan's Creation of the Gods I: Kingdom of Storms film from 2023. This next one was originally supposed to open earlier this year, but was delayed because (as the director states): \"they needed more time for postproduction work due to the huge number of special effects required for the film.\" Now set for release on/around Lunar New Year in 2025 in China (no info on the US release yet). So what is this next one about? Here's the brief intro: Taishi Wen Zhong led the army of Shang Dynasty including Deng Chanyu and four generals of the Mo Family to Xiqi. With the help of Kunlun immortals such as Jiang Ziya, Ji Fa leads the army \u0026 the civilians of Xiqi to defend their homeland. Featuring Yosh Yu, Huang Bo, Kris Phillips, Xuejian Li, Shaofeng Feng, and Kun Chen. Still not entirely sure who is fighting who or why, but […]",

    "description": "\"That place should never, ever be inhabited by human beings.\" Freestyle Digital Media debuted the official trailer for a documentary titled Half-Life of Memory: America's Forgotten Atomic Bomb Factory. As much as it may seem like some conspiracy theory doc, it's anything but – it's the true story of an atomic bomb facility. The film tells the story of how the U.S. secretly manufactured thousands of atomic weapons in the suburbs of Denver, leaving behind a toxic legacy that will persist for many generations. Colorado's Rocky Flats plant produced a staggering 70K atomic bombs, each serving as a \"trigger\" for thermonuclear warheads. Concealed by U.S. government secrecy, the plant's fires, leaks, \u0026 illicit dumping of nuclear waste contaminated the Denver area with long-lived radioactive toxins. A major and highly visible plutonium fire sparked a decade of mass protests, culminating in an unprecedented FBI raid that ultimately shuttered the plant. Today, the radioactive legacy of Rocky Flats continues to threaten public health, yet surprisingly few people are aware the plant ever existed. Me either! As someone who grew up in Colorado, I'm fascinated by this harrowing true story (the plant was shut down for good in 1992). Scary they got away […]",
