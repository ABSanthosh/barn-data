    "description": "Julianna Margulies and Gretchen Mol Talk MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, Edward Burns' latest with Eric McClanahan Read the full article on AICN Edward Burns made quite the impression after winning the Best Picture prize at the Sundance Film Festival with his 1995 masterpiece THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, signifying the emergence of a new and singular voice. The plot synopsis for the film was \"Three Irish Catholic brothers from Long Island struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" Now, thirty years later, Burns has returned with a new vision, MILLERS IN MARRIAGE, with the plot synopsis sounding vaguely familiar - \"Three Irish Catholic siblings from New York struggle to deal with love, marriage, and infidelity.\" What can I say? Dude's got range. However, I'm not here to say that Edward Burns is a one-trick pony or that MILLERS IN MARRIAGE is recycled and tired. Truth is, I really liked this movie. The cast is impeccable and the narrative kept me interested, even when I thought some plot points were a bit contrived or predictable. Burns crafts characters that we want to care about, even if they're narcissistic, self-destructive, manipulative, or just plain wrong. Burns' gift of character and dialogue is that we are drawn into the maw of the devouring devils of his narratives.  This film is no different. Following the Miller siblings, Andy (Burns), Maggie (Julianna Margulies), and Eve (Gretchen Mol), and their orbiting cadre of lovers. Andy is a painter, fresh off a separation from his wife Tina (Morena Baccarin) and now dating one of her former colleagues Renee (Minnie Driver). Maggie is an active novelist married to inert novelist Nick (Campbell Scott), Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN Parenthood is sacrifice, and that is the message behind the latest horror film from filmmaker Michael Cummings, aka Spider One of Powerman 5000, aka Rob Zombie's brother. As he puts it in his director's statement: \"In the film, Mindy’s relationship with her monster, Agyar, is clearly my allegory for parenthood. His bites are her pain. His words are her insecurities. His intentions are to prove Mindy’s failure as a parent. We are in solidarity with Mindy, even if, at times we are frustrated and baffled by her actions. And that is exactly the point. She doesn’t know what to do. None of us do. Framing this movie in horror was a natural choice.\" LITTLE BITES tells the story of Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox, TERRIFIER 3), who is inexplicably saddled with a demon, Agyar (Jon Skarloff, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) that demands to feast upon her daughter, Alice. Unwilling to acquiesce, Mindy sends Alice to stay with her mother (Bonnie Arons, THE NUN) while she placates the monster with bites of her own flesh, spinning a plan to rid of her the burden once and for all.  I had the opportunity to speak with writer/director Spider One and lead actress Krsy Fox, neither of whom I felt comfortable addressing by name because I didn't feel entirely sure if Krsy was just pronounced \"Krissy\" and I couldn't rightly look a man in the face and call him \"Spider\".

    "description": "\"Save the date for one killer night.\" Netflix has unveiled a first look teaser along with a final release date for the next offering in this horror franchise - Fear Street: Prom Queen. This is the fourth installment so far, following up the original three films. Netflix launched the Fear Street series, adapted from R. L. Stine's horror books, with the interconnected Fear Street Part One: 1994, Fear Street Part Two: 1978, Fear Street Part Three: 1666. They all debuted in the summer of 2021, so we've been waiting for a follow-up for 4 years. In this new Fear Street movie, prom season at Shadyside High is underway and the school's It Girls are busy with campaigns for the crown. When an outsider puts herself in the running, then girls star disappearing, the class of '88 is in for one hell of a prom night. Starring India Fowler, Suzanna Son, Fina Strazza, Chris Klein, David Iacono, Ella Rubin, Ariana Greenblatt, along with Lily Taylor and Katherine Waterson. There is actually a single new book this is based on. Stay tuned for updates before the release in May. This teaser uses the phrase \"a new era\" which means there might be […]",

The Power of Chi is a documentary film about Tai Chi, and the power it has to change lives. Maybe. Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman narrates this documentary - which offers viewers a journey across cultures \u0026 practices, capturing the timeless appeal of the mystical and unseen. The website claims: \"It is the first time in history that a movie has scientifically and demonstrably proven that this internal power exists and to watch this is spectacular for any human to see.\" Take a look as even the youngest and smallest Tai Chi masters best some of the strongest and most celebrated athletes in the world when they channel this extraordinary harmonic \u0026 Herculean life force. This sounds like one of these pseudo-science YouTube doc that is somehow being released as an actual movie, so tread carefully.
