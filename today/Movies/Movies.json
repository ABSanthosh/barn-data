Sure enough, “Dead Lover” features the resurrection of a dead creature, and yet, writer-director Grace Glowicki keeps surprising the audience and gives much more than they expected. The characters she creates and the situations […]",

    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"She thinks that you are in possession of nukes and are planning to blow up Texas.\" Wait, what!? Yellow Veil Pictures has revealed an official trailer for a wacky, weird, indie comedy film titled Rats! set in Fresno, Texas. This initially premiered at the 2023 Cucalorus Film Festival a few years ago, and played at more fests throughout 2024 including Fantasia and Seattle and Calgary Underground. In Fresno, Texas, graffiti artist Raphael's arrest leads to his involvement in a chain of surprising events involving a sting operation, suicide, drug deals, criminal suspicions, weapons, a newswoman, and a plutonium deal gone wrong, creating chaos. Reviews add even more superlatives: \"Chock-full of gross-out humor, emo haircuts, and a female cop who loves the c-word, Rats! is a shockingly touching coming-of-age story.\" Rats! stars Danielle Evon Ploeger, Luke Wilcox, Darius Autry, Khali Sykes, Ariel Ash, Jacob Wysocki, and John Ennis. Looks like a crazy punk rock indie film from the 90s that they used to make. Bonkers! This actually seems like good fun.

    "description": "The official awards for the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, held in Utah every January, were announced this morning with a small ceremony held in person in Utah. This always marks the end of the fest, with a few days of screenings left. The festival continued this week with at-home viewings in addition to all the in-person events. This year's line-up featured a grand total of 88 feature films, quite a few less than expected, with a number of indie gems in the selection. The main winners for 2025 include Atropia, taking home Grand Jury Prize; along with Brittany Shyne's Seeds winning the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary. The Audience Awards went to Twinless and (doc) Andre is an Idiot, entirely expected based on the effusive reactions to both. The winners this year are rather mild \u0026 unexciting, even though there are some amazing films at Sundance not many of them got any awards. As always, if any of these films interest you, we hope you note them down and catch up with them as soon as you can. All of the main 2025 winners listed below.
