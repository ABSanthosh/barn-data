    "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

And many won't see this either. It's getting a VOD release this summer if anyone wants to watch - but it just doesn't seem worthwhile. It follows a ruthless hitman who, after narrowly escaping a fatal attempt on his life, betrays his gang in an effort to find forgiveness but ends up becoming a target himself. Bang, one of the most feared hitmen, questions his violent life after a near-death experience. Seeing a new future beyond bloodshed, he wants out—but his old crime boss won’t let go without a fight.

This one looks as bland and forgettable as they come – not really worth a watch unless you need to see another hitman movie with the same plot as others.
