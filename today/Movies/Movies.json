    "description": "\"Look what you unleashed...\" After plenty of waiting, nearly time for this superhero movie to hit theaters. Marvel has unveiled a final trailer for Thunderbolts*, their next MCU offering - an anti-hero team-up dark comedy thriller launching the summer movie season on on May 2nd. After finding themselves ensnared in a death trap, an unconventional team of anti-heroes must embark on a dangerous mission that will force them to confront the darkest corners of their pasts. The key ensemble cast includes David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost, Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, Lewis Pullman as Bob aka \"Sentry\", and Florence Pugh as Black Widow Yelena Belova, plus Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel, and finally Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the handler Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. This trailer leans heavy on the emotion this time, playing this up as an actual high stakes, gripping, eerie thriller over all the comedy of the previous trailers. And this \"Void\" darkness-bringer villain guy looks super creepy, too. One last look before it arrives in theaters in early May. Here's the final official trailer (+ new poster) for Jake Schreier's Thunderbolts*, from Marvel's YouTube: […]",

    "description": "\"I was there when took his last breath...\" Chilling. Vertical has unveiled the trailer for Sharp Corner, a thriller made by Canadian filmmaker Jason Buxton. This first premiered at the 2024 TIFF last year, and it also played at the most recent Rome, Glasgow, and San Francisco Film Festivals. A dedicated family man named Josh becomes obsessed with saving the lives of the car accident victims on the sharp corner in front of his house – an obsession that could cost him everything. A troubled man begins to spiral, consumed by the fatal car crashes caused by the sharp corner in front of his house. As his sick obsession takes hold, he places his wife and son in jeopardy, threatening to permanently break the family apart. Sharp Corner stars Ben Foster, Cobie Smulders, Gavin Drea, \u0026 William Kosovic. This obviously should remind anyone of Cronenberg's Crash film, but without the sexual intrigue, thoguh even more unsettling as he breaks down. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jason Buxton's thriller Sharp Corner, direct from YouTube: On the night they move from the city into a sprawling suburban home, parents Josh (Ben Foster) \u0026 Rachel (Cobie Smulders) are jolted by a […]",
