    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times.

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

This teaser features about 60 seconds of excellent footage. This is Johnson's follow-up to Knives Out (2019) and Glass Onion (2022) continuing with Daniel Craig returning as Benoit Blanc in what is described as \"his most dangerous case yet.\" In this one he's investigating a murder at a church, though this teaser sets it up more as a miracle of some kind. So it's a religious horror mystery thriller?? Yep I am very down for this... The superb ensemble cast includes Josh O'Connor \u0026 Josh Brolin as priests, Glenn Close, Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Kerry Washington, Andrew Scott, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church. That's one helluva good line-up, too! Josh O'Connor looking totally crazy in this already, can't wait to see what he's up to with Rian at the helm.

Is everyone ready for the grand finale? Will 456 finally put an end to this? We'll find out... Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept an invitation to play a series of games. A very tempting cash prize awaits with deadly high stakes: a whopping ₩45.6 billion prize for whoever can stay alive until the end.
