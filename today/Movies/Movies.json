    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Actress Gina Gershon speaks with McEric about new film HIGH ROLLERS with John Travolta and cult classics SHOWGIRLS and KILLER JOE. Read the full article on AICN When I received an email asking me if I wanted to watch a brand new independent film starring John Travolta, Gina Gershon, and Lukas Haas, my first instinct was to say no. When I was told I might be able to interview Gina Gershon, I said sure, and watched Ives’ HIGH ROLLERS. What follows was my experience: This film isn’t good, you guys, but I did watch the whole thing, not only because I had to. It’s a caper, and once I get into a caper, I can’t walk away. I’ve got to know if and how they’ll pull it off. I think that’s universal. That said, this is not a good caper.    The film opens with Travolta as Mason with Gershon as Amy on a beautiful beach, looking out at the crystal blue water. They are gathered with their friends and team to watch two of their own tie the knot, but before they can both conclude their “I dos,” attack helicopters descend, accompanied by SUVS filled with masked mercenaries. They are held at gunpoint and Amy is taken. In a blink, the baddies are gone and the team is unharmed - you know, like mercenaries are wont to do. Next, Mason is giving chase in his muscle car in a poorly edited road piece, concluding in a crash that likely accounts for the film’s entire budget.This is followed by the team grouped around a table while Mason exposition dumps their accolades for the sake of the audience. They are contacted by Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"It's time to play one last time...\" Here we go again! Netflix has unveiled the teaser trailer for Squid Game 3, the third (and final!!) season of the hit Korean thriller series Squid Game from 2021. The second season debuted last December though it's just half of a story - Netflix decided to split it up and play it out across these two final seasons. Squid Game 3 drops on Netflix worldwide in June this summer. Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to play a series of games. A very tempting cash prize awaits with deadly high stakes: a whopping ₩45.6 billion prize for whoever can stay alive until the end. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk writes and directs and seems poised to hit us hard at the end. Squid Game 3's cast features Lee Jung-jae as 456, Lee Byung-hun as The Front Man, Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Wi Ha-jun, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Jo Yuri, Lee David, Roh Jae-won. After the brutal second season, where 456 had trouble changing anyone's mind, will they finally really end this vicious game? Or will it go on forever? This is a rather chilling no-dialogue teaser. I can't wait […]",

A group of outsiders in a once-thriving Rust Belt town form an unlikely friendship over a mutual love of automobiles. Created by writer John A. Norris (of \"One Tree Hill\", \"All American\"), the series has episodes directed by filmmaker Neil Burger (of The Illusionist, Limitless, Divergence). \"The wheel is yours if you want it.\" Motorheads is about first love, first heartbreak and turning the key in your first car. Set in a once-thriving rust-belt town that’s now searching for a glimmer of hope, It's an adrenaline-filled story of a group of outsiders who form an unlikely friendship over a mutual love of street racing, while navigating the hierarchy and rules of high school. With Ryan Phillippe, Nathalie Kelley, Michael Cimino, Melissa Collazo, Uriah Shelton, Nicolas Cantu, Drake Rodger, Josh Macqueen, Mia Healey, Matt Lanter, Audrey Gerthoffer, \u0026 Johnna Dias-Watson.
