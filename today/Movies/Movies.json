    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"No eating friends.\" Only the bad guys! The concept for this is pretty much: what if they mashed up E.T. and Alien into one fun-for-the-whole-family adventure movie? Take a look at the trailer for XENO, produced by Kevin Hart and his production company called Hartbeat. \"One Bond. Two Worlds.\" A teenage girl makes a terrifying extraterrestrial alien her friend after it crashes nearby in the desert. The youngster manages to deal with her sad mother and the mother's violent boyfriend while simultaneously protecting her dangerous new buddy. Together they embark upon an adventure that questions the nature of good and evil. \"I didn't just find it... we found each other.\" Awwww, that's adorable. Starring Lulu Wilson, Omari Hardwick, Trae Romano, Wrenn Schmidt, Paul Schneider, and Garrett van der Leun. And the most exciting part - the movie features creature designs by the legendary Jim Henson Company's Creature Shop. To bring to life this alien creature that she befriends. This looks pretty cheesy, of course, but I have to say - it doesn't look that bad. I'm definitely intrigued. Especially with a practical creature? Maybe I do have to watch this...

The Asylum has revealed an official trailer for their next offering titled Jurassic Reborn, a boring riff on the upcoming Jurassic World: Rebirth movie this summer. Even after all these years later, The Asylum still loves to mock and make fun of all the Hollywood movies by making this knock-off B-movie crap. Someone is still paying to watch this! When cutting-edge research leads to the creation of living dinosaurs, a team of scientists on a secluded island must risk their lives to prevent the rapidly growing creatures from escaping \u0026 then attacking the mainland. Huh, this plot sounds familiar! But that's the point, obviously. Jurassic Reborn stars Daniel Baldwin, Danielle Titus, Esmeree Sterling, Bryan Scamman, and William Castrogiovanni. VFX have improved so much over the years they can put very cheap dinosaur VFX in this and they still don't look as bad as they used to in films. The rest of this looks as terrible as expected from The Asylum - so have fun.
