    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time.

    "description": "\"Welcome to the Chatsubo, cowboy.\" Apple TV has debuted a short promo to announce the Neuromancer series is now officially in production - filming on location in Tokyo. This has been a long time in the making! William Gibson's seminal sci-fi masterpiece was published in 1984, and Hollywood has been trying to adapt it and many of his other novels since then. It's finally happening. They've started shooting, and we'll actually get to see his cyberpunk world brought to life. From Skydance Television (also behind the the Foundation series) the series is created by Graham Roland \u0026 J.D. Dillard (best known as director of the films Sleight, Sweetheart, Devotion). The sci-fi series stars Callum Turner as Case, a data-thief, Briana Middleton as Molly, a street-samurai, with Joseph Lee as Hideo, Mark Strong as Armitage, Clémence Poésy, Peter Sarsgaard, Emma Laird, plus Max Irons and Dane DeHaan. The video reveals a small piece of the set - a look at The Chatsubo, or also Chat, a bar on Ninsei in Chiba City, a place mainly serving expats where Case spends time. That's all we get so far, but I'm hyped - I've got a very, very good feeling about this series. […]",
