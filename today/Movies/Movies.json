    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver drops on Digital on Friday, December 6, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience. Michael’s film provides enough information about the Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

Coldplay has released a brand new music video for the single \"All My Love\" off their brand new album called \"Moon Music\". But it's nothing like any usual music video. Coldplay's Chris Martin hangs out with the legendary Dick Van Dyke, who is turning 99 years old (!!) and plays on his piano while Dick dances around his home. All of it is filmed \u0026 edited into a lovely tribute to the iconic performer / comedian / actor Dick Van Dyke, cut with footage \u0026 photographs from his illustrious career in show business. It's co-directed by the filmmakers Spike Jonze \u0026 Mary Wigmore, which actually makes it the first real Spike Jonze-directed project we've seen in a while. And it's just so delightful. Shot in location at his home in Malibu, it's a lovely, heartfelt look at his life as he reflects on his age. \"I'm acutely aware that I could go any day now... but I don't know why it doesn't concern me. I'm not afraid of it. I have the feeling that I'm gonna be alright.\" Dance […]",

It's always so much fun to find out what John Waters' favorite films are every year! (And then argue about them!) One of the most exciting \"best of the year\" lists that kicks off this time of the year is from filmmaker John Waters - his Top 10 favorite films in a list that is unlike any other. For 2024, Waters has chosen a less quirky, more sexy selection of mostly LGBTQ films as his best of the year. His previous Top 10 list from 2023 included Beau is Afraid and Master Gardener and Fallen Leaves. One of his most controversial picks for 2024 - he loved Joker 2 (aka Joker: Folie à Deux) and is big on defending it. 🤦‍♂️ \"Stupid critics. Gaga so good.\" His numero uno opened much earlier in 2024 - the dark \u0026 wild Love Lies Bleeding starring Kristen Stewart and Katy O'Brian, released by A24. After years of publishing this list with the magazine ArtForum, Waters has switched it up and sent it to Vulture instead. Peruse all of his Top 10 favorites from […]",
