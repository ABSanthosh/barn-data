    "description": "Barbarella Dives into Conversation with FREEDIVER Director Michael John Warren! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here. Michael John Warren’s latest documentary Freediver is available on Prime Video, or buy or rent on Digital starting December 7, 2024. The film plunges viewers into the world of competitive freediving as it chronicles Alexey Molchanov’s unprecedented attempt to set world records in multiple categories of the sport. Opening with some explanations about diving’s impact on the body, the film draws me back to memories of getting certified to scuba. Prior to those classes, the risks about which I knew were drowning, underwater predators (e.g. sharks), and the bends. Yet, those first days in the classroom, we learned a whole horde of other damaging or fatal consequences of diving that I had never previously considered. Once we were all sufficiently terrified of the consequences of our planned endeavor, it was time to don our gear and plunge into the depths. And we did, despite the inherent risks of injury and death.  Although risk-free to myself, witnessing Alexey move gracefully deeper into peril in Freediver proves almost as nerve-wracking as my first open-water dive and leaves me pondering questions, like “How long could I hold my breath?” - the answer is not long at all - or “Would I ever consider free diving?” The answer is maybe, but absolutely not competitively. Those people are insane, superhuman, or both! Whether they are insane or not, I spend much of the film in awe of these people who have trained their bodies to perform skills the human body was never meant to experience.

Read the full article on AICN When I got into this racket over six years ago, I did so as a fan. In fact, it was a passing text exchange with a friend about the movie A QUIET PLACE that ended with “Hey, do you want to write about movies for a website?” Flash forward, here I am, having interviewed over a hundred creatives in my time with this site and others. Typically, I’ll get an email from a PR firm asking if I want to screen a film and speak with attached talent or read a book and speak with the author. I rarely say no as I firmly believe that everyone is worth talking to and every person you come in contact with can teach you something that you might not learn in your own sphere of social contacts or experiences.   This interview is different. This subject I hunted down. I saw that he was going to be at New York Comic Con this year signing books in Artist Alley, and I’d already interacted with him briefly on Twitter (back when it was Twitter) so I felt I could swing over and say hello. I did, and of course he had some fans in front of him when I arrived so I decided to hang back and let them have their moment. Watching him interact with these fans confirmed everything I believed about this writer - he couldn’t be any nicer, any more accommodating, or any more grateful for the people who celebrate his art.

    "description": "\"I'm gonna get outta here, and when I do I'm gonna look after ya...\" Transmission Films has revealed the main official trailer for the film Spit – yes that's the actual title for it. David Wenham stars as infamous criminal John Francis \"Spit\" Spitieri in Jonathan Teplitzky's film Spit - debuting in Australia next March. In the sequel to the award-winning crime comedy, Gettin' Square, ex-junkie John Spitieri returns to Australia, only to find himself locked up in an Immigration Detention Centre with a massive target on his back, as old enemies come looking for him, determined to settle old scores. As Johnny talks up a storm without saying anything at all, he makes new friends amongst the detainees, and teaches them his version of mateship. The full cast also includes Helen Thomson, David Field, David Roberts, Gary Sweet, Arlo Green, Ayik Daniel Chut Deng, Sam \u0026 Teagan Rybka, \u0026 Sami Afuni. Not sure this will appeal to many outside of Australia, but it does look like a quirky, wonky, peculiar crime story similar to Trainspotting. Give it a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jonathan Teplitzky's film Spit, direct from Transmission's YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser […]",

    "description": "\"This is a true story. About identity.\" Gravitas has revealed the official trailer for a documentary film called Brother Orange directed by the filmmaker Abe Forman-Greenwald. This doc is officially Brother Orange: The Movie, a whole film based on the actual story of what happened when a BuzzFeed writer had his phone stolen. Many may remember this, as writer Matt Stopera covered it all extensively in a series of articles published from 2014 to 2015. His stolen iPhone ended up in China where it was rebought by a guy who was taking photos of himself in front of an orange tree. Matt flew over there to meet him, became friends with him (\"Brother Orange\" aka Li Hongjun) and the rest is history. But there's also so much more to it than that. As their 10-year friendship anniversary nears, this extraordinary true story showcases the power of personal connection between two ordinary people-one American and one Chinese-who look beyond political tensions to form a profound bond. This actually looks wonderful - I'm glad they turned this story into a doc to watch. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Abe Forman-Greenwald's doc Brother Orange, from YouTube: In 2014, BuzzFeed writer Matt […]",
