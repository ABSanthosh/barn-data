    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN In a new AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SEGMENT, I will do something terrifically similar to what I did the last time I did this segment, and now that I'm reading that out loud I realize how ridiculous it sounds. Regardless, I once again enter the realm of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and speak with a specialist about what the United States knows, what it doesn't, and the barriers that are preventing it from disclosing its full knowledge to the public. Let's get one thing established right away: the conversation around alien visitation has changed. When I chatted with Disclosure Activist Stephen Bassett back in 2021, we weren't discussing if these visitations were real but rather why we weren't being told about them. Even the classification has changed - they're no longer Unidentified Flying Objects but Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon, or UAPs. Our government has come clean about their interest in UAPs, largely due to military concerns, and they take sightings seriously. The Defense Department's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office was created to investigate unidentified anomalies to determine if they're foreign or domestic, dangerous or innocuous, earthbound or alien. That part is transparent, but THE PROGRAM's findings aren't, and that is the subject of filmmaker James Fox's new documentary, THE PROGRAM. I chatted with James Fox, filmmaker of The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and I Know What I Saw, to discuss THE PROGRAM after viewing it, and though we were able to talk for quite a while, I didn't really have that many questions.

One of them that debuted just days before the New Year arrives is this one created by a filmmaker / editor known as Clementine Narcisse who often just goes by simply \"Clementine\". Her 2024 in Film video is a ravishing, refreshing, amusing roundup of some of her favorite films from this year. I'm delighted to see her include a bunch of under-the-radar picks that aren't mentioned as much as they should by others - terriific films such as Monkey Man, Problemista, Blink Twice, Bird, The Outrun, Cuckoo, Saturday Night, The Last Showgirl, Love Lies Bleeding, Oddity, The Shadow Strays. Her editing in this so good, especially cutting together all the emotion \u0026 violence in the middle. Very nice work. Thanks to Twitter for the tip on this debuting online.

Artist James Chapman, based in Leeds, UK, has just published his Top 10 Films of 2024 list on Instagram - by drawing an adorable little illustration for each \u0026 every favorite film. I've been an avid follower of Chapman for a few years already (we also posted his illustrations for 2022 and for 2023) and I am a big fan of his artistic style. He draws and colors images in a little notepad and includes the pens \u0026 markers in the shot every time. They make me smile every time. Each image is so clever. Many of these films are my faves, too (Conclave and Dune: Part Two and Sing Sing and Anora are also in my Top 10). Many critics put La Chimera on their list this year due to a late release (it was my #1 last year). This year he posted only 10 picks, and I've included all 10 images below.
