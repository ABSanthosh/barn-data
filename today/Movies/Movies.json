    "description": "Barbarella Says Tim Robinson Makes FRIENDSHIP Fantastic! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship, which is out NOW! Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Linklater you mad genius! The Austin, TX-based filmmaker is back at a second film festival this year with his other movie in 2025. Richard Linklater's Blue Moon premiered at the 2025 Berlin Film Festival earlier in the year, and his next film Nouvelle Vague just premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. Nouvelle Vague is Linklater's very first film shot entirely in French - because it's a spunky tribute to the iconic French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, who passed away in 2022 at 91 years old. Nouvelle Vague, which translates simply to New Wave in English, is about the French New Wave of the 1960s. Specifically about the making of Godard's first full-length film titled Breathless (or À bout de souffle in French). While making it they had no idea if it would be any good, but the film went on to debut at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and then influence cinema forever as the defining French New Wave film at the time. This is Linklater's meta tribute to Breathless by recreating the making of Godard's film with the exact same artsy B\u0026W style as the original. Nouvelle Vague is fantastique! Filmmaking fun! Inspiring and entertaining and so geeky! It's […]",

    "description": "In this angry world we live in today, with so many troubles and so much death and so much worry all around us, sometimes we need some peace and calm instead of rage to help us heal. But it's not easy to provide this kind of peace when there is so much raging going on. Way too many films nowadays feel the need to address the problems with the world by simply showing us the problems and using cinema to express some kind of anger. As if just showing us what is wrong will help us solve what is wrong – it rarely ever does. However, we really do need a bit of peace and calm these days, some soothing quieter moments to allow us to take a breath and become whole again. Miroirs No. 3, which is also simply titled Mirrors No. 3 in English, is the 11th feature film made by prolific German filmmaker Christian Petzold (also the director of Barbara, Phoenix, Transit, Undine, Afire). And it's just delightful – one of my favorite Petzold films already. Not at all what I was expecting, and that's a good thing, because I'm glad to discover it's such a charming […]",
