    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I'm a monster.\" Voltage Pictures has unveiled an official trailer for a horror movie called O.T.H.E.R, a French production made by the French filmmaker David Moreau. He most recently made the awesome one-long-take horror film MadS, which I highly recommend watching (it's on Shuddder). O.T.H.E.R is filmed in English, starring actress Olga Kurylenko as a woman who returns home to discover a strange secret there. Alice reluctantly returns to her childhood home after her mother's death. During her visit, Alice gradually gets to know the peculiar features of her surroundings and, eventually, learns the disturbing truth: she is being watched by a camera surveillance system, and a cloaked figure lurks around and drives her towards a horrifying revelation. What is going on in this creepy home?! Starring Olga Kurylenko, Philip Schurer, and Jean Schatz. This film has plenty of style and looks disquieting, but it's hard to really make sense of what is happening in this. All these weird VHS tapes? Weird dude following her? Any idea what is going on? Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for David Moreau's horror film O.T.H.E.R, direct from YouTube: This unsettling horror thriller movie follows Alice (starring Olga Kurylenko), who reluctantly returns to […]",

    "description": "\"You don't know the pieces you are going to get... One day you will get that piece you need, you will find that success.\" IGN has revealed the first official trailer for a documentary film titled Blue Scuti: Tetris Crasher, which is premiering in the next few weeks at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival. This is the story of the kid who beat Tetris! For real! Willis Gibson, who was only 13 when he pulled this off, known online as \"Blue Scuti\", is an American classic Tetris player from Stillwater, OK. He is best known for becoming the first person to \"beat the game\" of Tetris in December 2023, after he triggered a game crash on the previously unreached level 157. This doc from director Chris Moukarbel takes a look at his story and more about the legacy behind video game achievements. \"Thirteen-year-old Willis Gibson's life changes overnight when he becomes the first to beat Tetris. It explores grief, community, and the rise of an unexpected internet icon.\" I love a good doc that takes a simple (nerdy) story and turns into so much more, something exciting and life-affirming to watch, with extra context that makes it a great revelatory […]",
