    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here. Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland Empire is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking I’m watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, it’s only a movie.  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, and I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara: I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter: Bless You.  Barbara: But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew it’s fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.  Stuart: Thank you.   Barbara: Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?  Stuart: I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

From director Thom Zimny, Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen \u0026 The E Street Band offers the most in-depth look ever at the creation of the band's legendary live performances, including footage of rehearsals, backstage moments, rare archival clips, and many personal reflections from Springsteen himself. It's more than just a \"road diary\" about their most recent tour, it's a deep dive into the world of live performances and rock concerts, and what it's like for the musicians to play to giant audiences day after day after day. It premiered at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival - they also add: \"Springsteen could be called a poet, a master craftsman, a voice of his generation. Above all, he is a magnificent performer, and leader of one of the world's greatest-ever live rock bands.

    "description": "\"I thought I got hired here to talk about real cinema.\" Ha! Oh, you wish buddy. Freestyle Digital Media is finally releasing this acclaimed Canadian indie film in America. I Like Movies is the feature directorial debut of Canadian filmmaker Chandler Levack and it premiered at the 2022 Toronto Film Festival a few years ago. It's an exceptionally smart, nuanced, entirely original take on a young movie nerd geeking out over his job at a video store. Although he comes to learn that his obsession with movies prevents him from connecting with others. Set in the early 2000s (back when video stores still existed), Lawrence Kweller, a socially inept 17-year old cinephile, gets a job at a video store, where he forms a complicated friendship with his older female manager. I Like Movies stars Isaiah Lehtinen as Lawrence, along with Romina D'Ugo, Krista Bridges, Percy Hynes White, Alex Ateah, and Andy McQueen. I wrote a rave review of this film in 2022, calling it \"a remarkably empathetic and warm-hearted film about the challenges of growing up as a nerd and growing into yourself.\" Highly recommend watching I Like Movies once it's on VOD in the US.
