    "description": "Barbarella Declares BRING HER BACK is an Intense Depiction of the Effects of Grief Read the full article on AICN Hey, friends. Barbarella here still reeling from the incredibly intense Australian horror flick Bring Her Back, which comes out on May 30th. Not for the weak of heart, this follow-up from the minds behind Talk to Me grips one’s innards early on and doesn’t let go for the entire duration.  While themes of grief and the different ways individuals cope with loss may not be uncommon in cinema, Bring Her Back approaches the concept in a truly unique fashion through the individuals involved and the manner in which their stories are told.  Sora Wong debuts as the young Piper. Giving a powerhouse performance, she proves that a face doesn’t have to be recognizable to bring the awesomeness. While Piper may be the nucleus of the story, it’s not just her, but also those around her, who drive the points, like nails, into your soul.  I’ll start with Sally Hawkins, whom you may recognize from The Shape of Water. Her portrayal of the adoptive parent is nothing short of exceptional. Nuanced when necessary, flat out psycho when required, she navigates the extremes and subtleties like a master.  While I could ramble about Sally Hawkins more, let’s move on to Jonah Wren Phillips. He’s incredible as the creepy kid, but it’s in those moments where we glimpse his humanity that this young talent shines. I should warn you, though, if he’s onscreen, the odds of you feeling uncomfortable increase 85%. Owning the most disturbing scenes, he can be hard to watch at times. In fact, when Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric takes a look at some of the films screening at this year's Tribeca Film Festival in NYC from June 4th - 15th. Read the full article on AICN The Tribeca Film Festival is set to descend once again upon New York City this June 4th through 15th. Begun in 2002 by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, and Craig Hatkoff, the festival sought to revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks and has since become one of the premiere film festivals of North America. This year, alone, the programmers narrowed down their selections from over 13,000 submissions. This year's line-up boasts 95 world premieres from filmmakers across 36 countries, collecting everything from feature films to shorts, episodic content, audio storytelling, interactive games, and more.  I'll be on site for several days of the festival to screen films and speak with attending talent, so let's take a look at some of the selections that made my shortlist of interest: First off, the big trend this year is music documentaries - the festival has programmed at least fifteen music-based films, beginning with the opening night gala selection BILLY JOEL: AND SO IT GOES. The festivities will likely be more of a eulogy than a celebration due to recent developments, but it's still nice to kick off a definitively New York festival with one of the City's own beloved sons as the subject of its inaugural film. Other documentaries that feature prominently are METALLICA SAVED MY LIFE, BILLY IDOL SHOULD BE DEAD, BOY GEORGE 7 CULTURE CLUB, DEPECHE MODE: M, I WAS BORN THIS WAY: CARL BEAN, MOVE YA BODY: THE BIRTH OF HOUSE, and THE SIXTH BOROUGH. This final film made my shortlist as Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"He was a good boy...\" Music Box has revealed an official US trailer for Kill the Jockey, the Argentinian film starring Nahuel Pérez Biscayart as a rogue horse racing jockey who goes on the run. Thi premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year, and also played at the Toronto, San Sebastian, Viennale, Tokyo, and Stockholm Festivals. It's a gem! One of my favorites from last year – an especially clever, perfectly shot fable with an unforgettable lead performance. Spanish-Argentina actor Nahuel Pérez Biscayart stars as Remo, the on-the-run jockey at the center of this cinematic tale of a man in the midst of transition. Remo's self-destructive behavior and alcoholism overshadows his talent. Abril, an upcoming jockey is pregnant by Remo and has to decide between child or continuing to race. They both race for Sirena, a businessman who saved Remo's life in the past. Also starring Úrsula Corberó, Daniel Giménez Cacho, Daniel Fanego, Osmar Núñez, and Roberto Carnaghi. This already opened in many places last year, and is finally ready for US release in summer. Catch it on the big screen for the full cinematic experience.

Fathom has revealed an official trailer for a horror comedy movie called Ick, the latest fun movie from music video director Joseph Kahn (who also directed the films Torque, Detention, Bodied). This one played on the genre festival circuit last fall - it premiered at TIFF in Midnight Madness then played at Fantastic Fest, Sitges, and Screamfest. Science teacher Hank's life changes when he reconnects with his first love and suspects a new student is his daughter, all while facing an alien threat in their town. The movie is about a weird substance called \"The Ick\" that has been growing all over America (an obvious metaphor). But it's getting worse and suddenly will start taking over, unless this teacher and his smart student can figure out how to stop it. \"A wild ride driven by a power punk spirit, Ick is a dizzyingly fun \u0026 hilariously grotesque homage to throwback PG horror flicks, as well as an ode to Millennial nostalgia manifested in soundtrack needle drops by American Rejects, Paramore, and Blink 182.\" Starring Brandon Routh, Malina Weissman, Mena Suvari, Harrison Cone, Mariann Gavelo, and Cory Hart.
