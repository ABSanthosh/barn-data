    "description": "McEric chats with the writer/director and stars of the Sundance Midnight Selection TOUCH ME Read the full article on AICN The Sundance Film Festival is preparing to hit Park City, Utah once again this Thursday, January 23rd through February 2nd, boasting 88 feature films and a slew of shorts and industry panels. One of the highlights of the festival each year is the Midnight Program, which screens genre pictures late at night. Just last year this program brought us I SAW THE TV GLOW, IN A VIOLENT NATURE, and LOVE LIES BLEEDING, to give you an idea of the type of fare one might find. One particular title in this year's program caught my interest when I read the synopsis and stood out as something that would assuredly be unique. The film is called TOUCH ME by writer/director Addison Heimann, and its synopsis reads: Two codependent best friends become addicted to the heroin-like touch of an alien narcissist who may or may not be trying to take over the world. TOUCH ME is a brilliant meditation on addiction, codependency, and the universal search for acceptance and peace in an ever-increasingly chaotic world. The film's use of color is exquisite, and the four lead actors who propel the story turn in some amazing work. I knew the film would be weird but it exceeded my expectations, and if you like your allegories laugh-out-loud funny and interspersed with tentacle sex, you will love this film, too. I was able to talk to writer/director Addison Heimann, stars Olivia Taylor Dudley, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jordan Gavaris, and Marlene Forte about the film, some of the technical wizardry Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Eric McClanahan reviews Robert Eggers's latest film, NOSFERATU. Read the full article on AICN Wouldst thou like to live immortally? Robert Eggers is back in theaters with his latest vision, NOSFERATU, a remake of the 1922 film of the same name, which was itself an unlicensed retelling of Bram Stoker's DRACULA. For those who don't know, Eggers is the visionary behind such standout films as THE VVITCH, THE LIGHTHOUSE, and THE NORTHMAN. His films have earned him a fiercely dedicated fanbase and heavy auteur status in Hollywood, essentially giving him carte blanche when it comes to making his films. NOSFERATU is the culmination of that legacy and that power, for better or worse. I saw NOSFERATU last night in a packed theater, my second choice theater as the first had already sold out by the time I arrived. It was preceded by trailers for THE WOLF MAN and THE MONKEY, tailored to its audience of artistic horror hounds. The movie begins with simple white text over black backgrounds, and the first thing the audience hears is a woman crying the darkness. From there, the film is two plus hours of atmosphere and mood, stretched to its near breaking point before the final fade out. Eggers is a master of tone, an Edgar Allan Poe of the visual form, and his legacy as a visual storyteller receives no tarnish with this entry into his oeuvre. So much is explored with a muted color palette and expert use of light and shadow. The camera pulls into darkness, pulls the bodies onscreen into rooms into which they cannot see, Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"I have something I was wondering if you could look into...\" Apple TV has unveiled the main official trailer for Surface - Season 2, the continuation of the thriller series created by writer Veronica West. The first season launched in 2022 and features Gugu Mbatha-Raw - following her in her quest to rebuild her life after a suicide attempt, and her struggle to understand all the things that led up to that moment. Season 2 brings back Gugu Mbatha-Raw and this time she heads across the pond to the UK. Desperate to uncover the truth about her mother's death, Sophie must infiltrate London's most powerful and secretive family. From Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine, comes the second chapter of this tense mystery with Mbatha-Raw, Phil Dunster, Frieda Pinto, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Stephan James, Ari Graynor, Millie Brady, François Arnaud, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. Partnering with a dogged journalist, Sophie takes on the untouchable Huntley family exposing their dark secrets and unraveling her own past along the way. This is starting to sound a bit like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series. Looks quite good - check it out below. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Apple TV's series Surface - Season […]",

    "description": "\"I want each and every one of them torn to shreds!\" Not if they take you out first. Netflix has revealed an official trailer for an intense action thriller movie called Counterstrike, made by the Mexican filmmaker Chava Cartas. This is set for a streaming debut on Netflix starting at the end of this month. When a hostage rescue mission creates a new enemy, Capt. Guerrero and his elite soldiers must face an ambush by a ruthless drug cartel. While there have been a few other movies titled Counterstrike before (like this one), this new movie reminds me of the popular video game Counter-Strike made by Valve. With a similar concept about a group of five elite soldiers (basically a group of players hanging out \u0026 working together on the same team?) outsmarting the dangerous cartel and taking out the bad guys. Starring Luis Alberti, Noé Hernández, Mayra Batalla, Leonardo Alonso, Pedro Joaquín, Guillermo Nava, and David Calderón León. This definitely is worth a look for anyone who's into action movies - might actually be an entertaining watch. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Chava Cartas' action film Counterstrike, direct from YouTube: On a shopping trip to the US […]",
