Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles.

    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"We just drop her off and go...\" Abramorama has released the main official trailer for an indie film called Wayward, marking the feature directorial debut of writer / filmmaker Jacquelyn Frohlich. This one first premiered at the 2023 Deauville Film Festival last year, but is only now getting released - starting in a very select number of theaters this fall. Wayward follows eleven-year-old Cleo who becomes enchanted with the charismatic female hitchhiker who her mother picks up as they drive to their new home in Los Angeles from Idaho. When Cleo and the hitchhiker form an unlikely bond, the line between kidnapping and running away becomes dangerously blurred. The mom is played by Jess Weixler, along with Chloe Guidry as Cleo, plus Jessica Sula, Rob Morrow, Will Brittian, and Colleen Camp. An intriguing little story showing both sides of a kidnapping situation, along with this tale of a young girl feeling the need to escape her own mom. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jacquelyn Frohlich's film Wayward, direct from YouTube: While mov­ing from Ida­ho to Los Ange­les with her moth­er, 11-year-old Cleo (Chloe Guidry), who is yearn­ing for sta­bil­i­ty in her life, becomes smit­ten with a charis­mat­ic female […]",

    "description": "In honor of this year's Election Day in the US, have a look at one of our favorite conspiracy thrillers. The Parallax View, directed by the great Alan J. Pakula, originally opened in theaters June 1974. It's one of many conspiracy thrillers from the 70s about how the US government is super shady and caught up in all kinds of sneaky operations. It's about a reporter's investigation into a secretive organization, the Parallax Corporation, whose business is political assassination. 3 years after witnessing the murder of a senator atop Seattle’s Space Needle, reporter Joseph Frady digs into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the event—and stumbles into a labyrinthine conspiracy far more sinister than he could have imagined. Warren Beatty stars with Hume Cronyn, William Daniels, and Paula Prentiss. I had never seen this movie until the Criterion re-release a few years ago, and it blew me away. Its been stuck in my mind ever since. The unsettling secrecy of everything, the visuals, the never-ending maze he is in. Criterion adds: \"The Parallax View's coolly stylized, shadow-etched compositions by the acclaimed cinematographer Gordon Willis give visual expression to a mood that begins as an anxious whisper and ends as a scream into […]",
