    "description": "McEric highlights a few spooky films for your Halloween night, including DIE ALONE and HOLD YOUR BREATH. Read the full article on AICN ‘Tis the season, for a few more hours, before Mariah Carey breaks through her ice-cocoon and heralds in the winter holidays. If you need a couple of thrillers to hold back the tide of the inevitable, I’ve got you covered with a couple of brand new features released this very month: HOLD YOUR BREATH and DIE ALONE.   DIE ALONE stars Carrie-Anne Moss (THE MATRIX, “The Acolyte”), Frank Grillo (CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, ONE DAY AS A LION), Douglas Smith (HBO’s “Big Love”), and Kimberly-Sue Murray (Netflix’s “V-Wars”). The film is written and directed by Lowell Dean (WOLFCOP, SUPERGRID) and released by Quiver Distribution. After an outbreak turns the majority of the population into plant-based zombies, a young man (Smith) with amnesia searches for his lost love and stumbles across a rugged survivalist (Moss). Check out the trailer:     If you’re getting “The Last of Us” vibes, you’re on the right track. The film features some pretty great creature effects, apt desolation to sell the apocalypse, and a surprisingly original story. Moss is the star of the show, by far, and carries her scenes with a deadpan humor that keeps the heavy subject matter from swallowing the viewer in despair. The budget limitations are clear but the film that emerges is certainly a smart, fun ride that hits all the points of an apocalyptic thriller with a (predictable) plot twist and great performances.   I got the chance to chat with Carrie-Anne Moss about the production of the film, her bicycle-riding skills, and dream roles. Carrie-Anne Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. I’m a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you haven’t seen it, is one of Lee’s best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. It’s amazing.  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee – who, in an uncanny imitation of Lee’s sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"Orin is one of the boys.\" Netflix has revealed a quick clip trailer for a documentary film called The Only Girl in the Orchestra, made by filmmaker Molly O'Brien. This 34-minute short film originally premiered at the 2023 DOC NYC Film Festival last year. It's getting a global release on Netflix starting in December. Trailblazing double bassist Orin O'Brien was never one to seek the spotlight, but when Leonard Bernstein hired her in 1966 as the first female musician in the New York Philharmonic, she inevitably became the focus of media attention and, ultimately, one of the most renowned musicians of a generation. Remarkable. Somehow this story didn't make it into Bradley Cooper's Maestro film about Leonard Bernstein though it should've been in there. It's also shocking / amazing that even in 1966 there was not a single woman in the entire NY Philharmonic orchestra aside from her. Glad it's not like this anymore, and glad she made history.

Set for a VOD release in December if anyone wants to watch. Not sure why they needed to use the same Persona title as the iconic 1966 Ingmar Bergman film. A woman wakes up locked in a house, injured with no memory. She's terrified yet relieved to find a woman bound in another room. These two strangers must work together to figure out what's really going on before the door is unlocked. Who is coming back for her? Why are they locked up in this house? Starring Shanti Lowry and Sophia Ali, with Andrew Howard and Omar Gooding. This doesn't look so interesting - better to just rewatch Saw again. Here's the official trailer (+ scary poster) for Mike Ho's hororr film Persona, direct from YouTube: Two women wake up injured, with seemingly no memory of how they got there, trapped inside a secluded home.
