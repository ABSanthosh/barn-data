What are they going to do?\" 🐺 I can't start this review without admitting that I have loved wolves all of my life. When I was in third grade, I spent time during school lessons trying to convince a wolf sanctuary to bring a wolf down to our elementary school in Colorado so my class could meet one in person and learn more about them (it didn't happen – but I tried anyway). Anyone who knows me will not be surprised to hear me say that I loved this film about wolves and will now proclaim that it is one of the best documentaries of the year. Lost Wolves of Yellowstone is a brand new IMAX Original Documentary film, formerly known as Mollie's Pack. It premiered at the 2025 CPH:DOX Film Festival in Copenhagen, along with premieres at the American Conservation Film Festival \u0026 DC Environmental Film Festival in the US. A deeply moving, emotional, profoundly inspiring, completely riveting film telling two distinct, intertwined stories about wolves \u0026 humans and their intrinsic connection. Lost Wolves of Yellowstone is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Thomas Winston, known for nature docs including […]",
