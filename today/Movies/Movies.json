    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing Materialists is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.  For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense.   For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who’s been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who’s ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they’re not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.  For her to apparently have this “revelation” that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn’t track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Barbarella Adores THE LIFE OF CHUCK Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here. Have I ever told you what a huge Stephen King fan I am? It started when a teenage me read Pet Sematary and became so enthralled with the author’s work that my mom’s Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn’t appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King’s short stories, The Life of Chuck, I knew I’d love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who’s responsible for my favorite horror miniseries, The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought Doctor Sleep to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it’s told in three acts using reverse chronology. It’s a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.  Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that’s not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time. Uncertainty and fear weigh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"To a new friendship!\" \"Cheers!\" Bleecker Street has revealed the first look teaser trailer for a horror thriller dark comedy called Bone Lake, arriving to watch starting in October in theaters. This originally premiered at Fantastic Fest last year, but didn't show up at too many other fests since then. When two young couples are mistakenly double-booked into the same vacation rental, their romantic weekend becomes a twisted maze of sex, lies, and survival. It's directed by Mercedes Bryce Morgan as her latest horror feature following Spoonful of Sugar and Fixation. Starring Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Eliane Reis, and Clayton Spencer. Lots of fun critics' quotes packed into this teaser trailer, describing it as \"steamy and twisted\", and \"an absolute blast from start to finish.\" This isn't the first film about a double booked vacation rental, but it does seem like it goes down its own crazy path once the two couples settle in. Here's the red band teaser trailer for Mercedes Bryce Morgan's horror thriller Bone Lake, from YouTube: \"Sleek, sexy, erotic.\" A couple's romantic vacation at a secluded lakeside estate is upended when they are forced to share the mansion with a mysterious and […]",
