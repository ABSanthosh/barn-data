    "description": "Barbarella Says Tim Robinson Makes FRIENDSHIP Fantastic! Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here back from hiatus, and I’m delighted to share my thoughts on A24’s newest release, Friendship, which is out NOW! Sometimes people watch trailers and think, “Oh this movie is like [insert movie about a similar topic].” If you’re thinking that about Friendship, it’s not. Genuinely funny without being cruel, Andrew DeYoung’s exploration of adult male friendship proves charming and elicits more than a few hearty laughs from me.  In an era where seemingly fewer friendships exist in the real world than online, making new friends may be challenging, particularly for adult men. Keeping them may be nearly impossible.  When Craig (Tim Robinson) receives a misdelivered package intended for cool new neighbor Austin (Paul Rudd), Craig walks it over to him. Upon meeting the charismatic and friendly guy, he quickly gets invited in and finds himself actually making friends. His expressions reveal his delight in this newly formed camaraderie with someone who is just so darned interesting. One can’t help but feel happy for his new accomplishment.   Sadly, new friendships are fragile, and in a group setting, Craig doesn’t make the best impression on the guys. It doesn’t take long before Austin begins distancing himself from the awkward neighbor. In his desperation to rekindle the closeness they once shared, Craig makes some questionable decisions that lead to more awkward situations and laughs. On the surface, this is a quirky comedy that relies heavily on Tim Robinson’s performance. However, there is much more to this movie. Throughout, it addresses many common insecurities that men Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric cleans up his inbox by dumping reviews for NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, RENNER, MOB COPS, and YOUNG WERTHER. Read the full article on AICN Hello all!  I've got some reviews of two films releasing this Friday, April 25th - but thought I'd also take this opportunity to highlight two other films that are already out there but I haven't yet found the time to cover. Hopefully there's something here for everyone, so let's get right to it: First up is NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH, starring Jack Quaid (NOVOCAINE, THE COMPANION, \"The Boys\"), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\"The Boys,\" \"The Walking Dead\"), and Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN, SLAYERS), directed by Duncan Skiles (THE CLOVEHITCH KILLER) and written by Sean Farley. The film features troubled young man Simon McNally (Quaid), who is trying to find his feet after spending a decade in a facility for mental health treatment, and his paranoid ex-security guard neighbor Ed Deerman. The two form an unlikely partnership when Simon believes he's seen a woman kidnapped but is deemed an unreliable witness by police due to his history and behavior. The two men take it upon themselves to investigate the crime and rescue the woman, revealing a deeper web of villainy in their quiet town. Quaid and Morgan have great chemistry, and Quaid, specifically, does some great work in this film. Whereas the majority of his characters have been able to rely and charm and humor, Simon is stripped of these tools due to the abuse he received at a young age, so the tricks that Quaid would normally utilize to endear himself to audiences are out of reach. Quaid does a great job of humanizing McNally as a Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"There's only one way to kill it... we must fight together!\" 20th Century has unveiled a second trailer for the animated movie Predator: Killer of Killers, an anthology feature made by filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg. The first of two new Predator movies made by Trachtenberg following Prey from 2022 (which I still think should've been released in theaters). Predator: Killer of Killers is an animated anthology feature containing three stories that will be released streaming on Hulu in June this summer. His next live-action feature is called Predator: Badlands, and it's currently set to hit theaters on November 7th this fall. It looks like it will kick ass as much as this, too. The hunt begins. Three legendary warriors – a Viking mother seeking vengeance, a ninja fighting his samurai brother, and a WWII pilot facing cosmic horrors – become prey to an unstoppable hunter of killers. \"Most characters are dealing with generational [issues], trying to break a cycle. All the chapters are different genre-wise,\" Dan explains. The voice cast features Lindsay LaVanchy, Louis Ozawa, Rick Gonzalez, and Michael Biehn. The other trailer was already awesome, this is even better. Totally sold on all this footage and these three storylines - […]",

This is her highly anticipated follow-up to Titane, which won the Palme d'Or in 2021 when Spike Lee was head of the jury. She's back again 4 years later with her next feature - filmed in Le Havre in the north of France. It's described as her \"most personal, profound work\" yet - the rest of the plot is being kept a secret. Alpha, a troubled 13-year-old lives with her single mom. Their world collapses the day she returns from school with a tattoo on her arm. What does it all mean? We'll know soon. Starring Mélissa Boros as Alpha, with Golshifteh Farahani as Maman, Tahar Rahim, Emma Mackey, and Finnegan Oldfield. The film is premiering tonight at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival in the Main Competition - which is why this teaser is out now. Stay tuned for initial reactions \u0026 reviews very soon. Good news is Neon will release this later in 2025, and I expect they'll be putting all their weight behind it just like with her film Titane […]",
