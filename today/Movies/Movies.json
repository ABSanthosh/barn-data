    "description": "üõ∏ \"Any extraterrestrial visiting or transiting via Earth, must undergo a mandatory registration process. That's standard protocol!\" This amusing 7-minute short is worth a watch! Oslo-based filmmaker Martin Sofiedal has just debuted his latest creation - a Men in Black fan film tilted Neuralize This! The last real MIB movie they made was Men in Black: International in 2019 (but it got bad reviews) so I'm intrigued that someone is still making fan films for this sci-fi franchise. MIB: Neuralize This! is a fan-made MIB short film ‚Äî a gooey, action-comedy tribute where nothing goes according to protocol. Two agents try to contain an alien incident, but end up dealing with a malfunctioning neuralizer, a Nerf gun, a confused child, and a very angry Polish muscle man. Starring Torgny Gerhard Aanderaa and Cecilie Svendsen, with Eirik Hallert and Lijana Brahimi. With VFX by the same company doing the VFX on Troll 2. It's just the right amount fun using the MIB concept and gimmicks. Everyone wishes they had one of these neuralizers, right? Thanks to Martin for the tip on this short. Intro via YouTube: \"When the alien explodes, the neuralizer fails, and a little girl sees everything... Neuralize This! [‚Ä¶]",

    "description": "\"You can always tell which neighbors are gonna last... Good luck, son.\" Ha! Blue Finch Films has revealed the teaser trailer for a film titled Hold the Fort, which is premiering this month at the prestigious 2025 Fantasia Film Festival up in Montreal. üëª This wacky fun horror comedy is a riff on the scariness of being new home owners: after moving to the suburbs, a young couple finds themselves trapped in an epic battle between their new HOA and an onslaught of monsters from hell. Writer / director William Bagley says it \"has been a goal of mine since The Murder Podcast and to finally have the opportunity to play there is a dream come true!\" The film is described as an action-packed horror-comedy that follows Lucas and Jenny, a couple thrilled to buy their first home‚Äîuntil they discover it comes with a deadly catch. As dark forces close in, they must defend their new home. Hold the Fort stars Chris Mayers, Haley Leary, Julian Smith, Mark Ashworth, and Levi Burdick. This looks great! It goes right on my watchlist. Seems like it's more than just one kind of monster - all kinds of malevolent forces are out to [‚Ä¶]",

    "description": "Barbarella Finds MATERIALISTS Pointless Read the full article on AICN Hey friends, Barbarella here to tell you how completely disappointing¬†Materialists¬†is. How can a movie where Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans vie for the affections of a matchmaker fail so badly? Well, let me tell you.¬† For starters, the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and either romantic rival doesn't quite feel like it's intense enough, so perhaps the casting has some impact, but I don't think that's the issue. I think the script deserves the blame. Don't get me wrong. The story includes lots of laughable moments around dating expectations and so forth. However, one expects characters to evolve throughout a story, to learn lessons, gain deeper understanding or just grow into better people through interactions with others or situations in which they find themselves. None of this happens. So much of the story just makes no sense. ¬† For instance, we are led to believe that Lucy, who‚Äôs been a top matchmaker for quite some time, never knew that people in real life are sometimes different than they appear on paper. She only learns this when an incident occurs with one of the couples she matches. I mean, anyone who‚Äôs ever been on a dating site or watched a True Crime story should know that people can portray themselves as something that they‚Äôre not. Technically, she apparently does already know people lie on the questionnaire because she comments about guys lying about their height.¬† For her to apparently have this ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù that makes her reevaluate her priorities simply doesn‚Äôt track. While that bothers me Finish the article on AICN",

It started when a teenage me read¬†Pet Sematary¬†and became so enthralled with the author‚Äôs work that my mom‚Äôs Christmas shopping became immensely easier. She started gifting me Stephen King books for every Christmas and birthday thereafter, knowing I would eagerly devour every page. I did, with relish. Eventually, I began working my way through movies based on his works. Some ventured from the source material in ways I didn‚Äôt appreciate, but when I heard Mike Flanagan would be tackling one of King‚Äôs short stories,¬†The Life of Chuck, I knew I‚Äôd love it. And I did. Mike Flanagan, who‚Äôs responsible for my favorite horror miniseries,¬†The Haunting of Hill House, and who was the mastermind who brought¬†Doctor Sleep¬†to screens, remains incredibly faithful to the source material, including how it‚Äôs told in three acts using reverse chronology. It‚Äôs a film that offers a feast of reflection on life, but I suspect some will dig in more ravenously than others. This is a story about those magical moments in life, the influence others have on our lives, and the decisions we make day to day that steer us one way or another.¬† Narrated by Nick Offerman, the film begins ominously enough, with the world seemingly coming to an end. Natural and unnatural disasters plague the planet, and as if that‚Äôs not bad enough, the internet also appears to be out, possibly for good this time.
