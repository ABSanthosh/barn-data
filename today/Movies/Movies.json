    "description": "Barbarella Chats with BLOAT actors Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones Read the full article on AICN Hey friends! Barbarella here to chat about feeling bloated. Wait that’s not right. I’m here to chat a bit about Bloat, which will be in Theaters, On Demand and On Digital March 7, 2025. It’s a new horror thriller in which Ben McKenzie (“Gotham,” “The O.C.”) plays Jack, a man stuck working while his family vacations in Japan. As if the FOMO isn’t bad enough, one of his sons starts behaving strangely after almost drowning, and his wife, played by Bojana Novakovic (Edge of Darkness, Drag Me to Hell), must grapple with everything essentially alone, while Jack grows increasingly frustrated with his inability to do anything more than bear witness and offer recommendations and theories.  Bloat proves to be pretty fun, generating some tension from the fact that poor Jack is stuck in front of a screen in another country, balancing work and family drama from afar. His sense of powerlessness and the increasing frustration that develops as he video-chats with his family and hears increasingly more unsettling news makes him relatable and really heightens the unease I feel while watching. While the final act doesn't engage me as much as the setup leading up to it, I enjoy enough of the concepts within the story that overall, I like the movie.  I got the opportunity to chat with the actors who play the two sons, Malcolm Fuller and Sawyer Jones. Check it out! Barbara: Would you guys tell me about the casting process. Did you get sent the script or did you have to audition? What was that like Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Director Simon West and star Lucy Liu talk OLD GUY, starring Christoph Waltz, now streaming everywhere! Read the full article on AICN Director Simon West should be a household name; his first film was a little picture from 1997 called CON AIR. Perhaps you've heard of it? He went on to helm similar big budget action extravaganzas, such as 2001's LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER and 2012's THE EXPENDABLES 2. Eventually, however, time and changing tastes caught up with West, and now he's directing smaller budget flicks, from action to drama, that move at a slightly slower pace and appeal to a different audience.  The same could be said for Danny Dolinski, the titular OLD GUY of West's latest feature, played by Academy-Award Winner Christoph Waltz (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, THE GREEN HORNET). Danny's a wetworks expert in a field saturated with hot young assassins, desperately trying to prove he's still relevant, often to his detriment. After recovering from a wrist injury that found him relegated to a cleaner role at a local bakery, Danny is itching to get back in the field. When he's told the only role available is support for young assassing Wihlborg (Cooper Hoffman), he is understandably unenthused. He invites his longtime friend Anata (Lucy Liu) along for their job since it'll take them to some charming locations around Europe, and once underway, tries to take point on every hit. Things don't go as planned. As you can probably already divine, there are so many parallels between Waltz's OLD GUY and West's career. Danny was once the best, the biggest game in town, and his name still opens doors... but the game has Finish the article on AICN",

Marvel has debuted a wacky joke (or not?) trailer for Thunderbolts*, the kooky anti-hero MCU movie kicking off the summer movie season on May 2nd. This whole trailer is a riff on A24's trailers with the same style \u0026 title cards. A ragtag group of bad guys is sent on covert missions for the American government. The fun ensemble cast includes David Harbour as Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr / Ghost, Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, Lewis Pullman as Bob aka \"Sentry\", and Florence Pugh as Black Widow Yelena Belova, plus Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel, and finally Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the handler Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. The trailer points out this has: The Green Knight cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo, Hereditary production designer Grace Yun, Minari editor Harry Yoon, and Everything Everywhere All At Once composer Son Lux. Which is a good line-up. But it still doesn't make me want to watch another Marvel movie?
