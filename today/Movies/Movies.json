    "description": "McEric sits down with THE DAILY SHOW writer Daniel Radosh and editor Lauren Beckett Jackson for an interview Read the full article on AICN Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” has been on-air for almost thirty years, garnering 26 PrimeTime Emmy Awards and several Peabody Awards for its writing and execution. Many are familiar with the show’s blend of current news commentary and informational journalism from comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrell, John Oliver, Samatha Bee, Roy Wood, Jr, Rob Riggle, Jordan Klepper, Wyatt Cenac, Hasan Minhaj, Larry Whitmore, Lewis Black, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta, and a bevy of others. “The Daily Show’s” audience has grown up alongside the show, with viewership now skewing in higher age demographics than the coveted 18-34 bracket it dominated during its inception. That maturity is reflected in the current iteration of the show, with Stewart hosting on Monday’s while the rest of “The Best F**king News Team” fill in the remainder of the week. “The Daily Show” is a bit of a misnomer as the show broadcasts nightly on Comedy Central (or Paramount+ for those living in the streaming age) from Monday to Thursday. I suppose “The Intermittent Show” just doesn’t have the same ring to it. “The Daily Show” is not unique in its position as a satirical news program, however it remains the definitive iteration of the format. Everyone knows about “The Daily Show,” love it or hate it. A foundational pillar of the show’s ubiquity and popularity is in the writing and execution of the show, which stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.   I was honored to speak with senior writer Daniel Radosh Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "Scott Adkins talks with McEric about his new action film, DIABLO Read the full article on AICN If you’re a fan of current action films then you likely know the name Scott Adkins. He’s either kicked the ass of or had his ass kicked by every action star of the last five decades: Dolph Lundgren, Jackie Chan, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and even Keanu Reeves. That’s right - he was the big guy with the grill in JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4.  Scott’s newest film is DIABLO, which hits theaters and on demand this Friday, June 13th. Conceived alongside action compatriot Marko Zaror, the film takes place in Colombia following Adkins as Kris, a former convict, who seeks to make good on a promise to a fallen friend, which runs him afoul of Zaror’s mercenary, El Corvo. This film isn’t just another straight-to-streaming no-budget piece of content - DIABLO delivers on every front. The fight scenes, choreographed by Zaror, are intense and deftly photographed, thanks to director Ernesto Diaz Espinoza. The gunplay is intense, the acting is top tier, and the film never lags.    Marko Zaror steals his scenes as El Corvo, a mercenary with an iron fist, literally. The six-foot-two Chilean action star has a chilling villain introduction, followed by a massive action scene in a sketchy hideout that plays out like a scene from TERMINATOR. He mows through assailants and bystanders alike with no emotion, only showing a hint of fear when Adkins’s Kris shows up to give him a real fight. El Corvo is fucking terrifying. Their final confrontation is a throwback to Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "\"What are they after?\" \"They're hungry...\" Vertical has revealed an official trailer for an action movie called Osiris, a sci-fi thriller about a group of soldiers trying to survive on a hostile alien spacecraft. It's directed by filmmaker William Kaufman, a former US Army Calvary Scout, who has made a bunch of action movies over the last decade most people haven't seen. In this movie, a team of Special Forces commandos are in the middle of an operation when they are abducted by a mysterious spacecraft. When they wake up aboard the extraterrestrial spaceship, they soon discover they are being hunted as prey by a merciless alien race. Uh oh. The full cast includes Max Martini, Brianna Hildebrand, LaMonica Garrett, Michael Irby, David B. Meadows, Linds Edwards, Tyler Galpin, Jaren Mitchell, Dawson Towery, and Stanley White Jr. Plus the OG Terminator badass heroine Linda Hamilton. Reminds me of Predator, of course, but with different kinds of aliens who just want to eat all these humans as food. Not sure if this will end up any good. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for William Kaufman's sci-fi thriller Osiris, direct from YouTube: A team of Special Forces commandos wake up on […]",

    "description": "\"My flame gives you life... My crater is your home... Stay close to me...\" Meet Ginger, a tiny little porcelain tea pot created by the Fire God. But there is something a bit strange about him... which is what makes him unique. Potlems is a mesmerizing animated short film created \u0026 directed by Spanish animation filmmaker Alberto Allegri Rodríguez. This is his official graduation project from The Animation Workshop / VIA University College in Denmark, where he has been studying Character Animation over these past few years. Potlems is a 3D mini-opera styled in the aesthetic of 70s stop-motion. In a town of ever-smiling porcelain children, Ginger is created with a fatal flaw: a frown is accidentally painted on his face. \"What started as a fun world-building concept evolved into an exploration of my feelings of vulnerability related to growing up with a disability,\" Alberto explains. The result is an empowering, emotional little animated film about what makes us different and why we should embrace those differences instead of trying to hide them. View below. Thanks to Short of the Week for the tip. Intro from YouTube: \"In a town of ever-smiling porcelain children, Ginger is created with a fatal […]",
