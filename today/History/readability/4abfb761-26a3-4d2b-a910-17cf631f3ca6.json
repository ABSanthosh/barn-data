  "text": "Rated 5 out of 5 davelovelock75 – December 9, 2018 I was enlightened by a friend. It seems I am always “the history guy” and my friend said I cant live without this. It’s TRUE. What got me into history, was sitting on my granddad’s knee, and having him tell me accounts of his dad that fought in WWI for the RFA, and his time in WWII in the aluetean islands. Such fond memorys… THIS is the quality you get with Dan Carlin. I’ve tried to get into historical podcasts before..this is not it. This is highly researched, intellectually produced, intricately detailed, STORY TELLING…that is so warm, focused, and just all around damn smart, you cant help but be hooked. Get into this. Start with king of kings. He starts with the Spartans at Thermopylae and asks, “we know who these Spartans are..who are the persians? ” and takes you on a journey all the way back to assyria and Babylon…he is amazing. 100 stars.",
