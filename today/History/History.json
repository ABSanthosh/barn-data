    "description": "The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World are often cloaked in the haze of legend and antiquity, but a strong argument can be made that these structures were indeed real and not mere myths.Terry Bailey explains. A 16th-century depiction of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. By Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck.First, several of the wonders, such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, still exist and can be seen today, offering undeniable, physical proof of their historical reality. The Great Pyramid, constructed around 2560 BCE, is a marvel of engineering that continues to impress modern architects and archaeologists. Its continued existence proves that at least part of the list is firmly grounded in historical fact rather than myth or exaggeration.In addition, ancient historical sources from a variety of cultures describe the other wonders in surprisingly consistent detail. For instance, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were both described by ancient writers such as Philo of Byzantium, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder. Their writings, based on first-hand accounts or reports from credible travelers, suggest these were real places seen and admired by ancient audiences. Archaeological evidence supports their accounts: for example, the ruins of the Temple of Artemis were unearthed in the 19th century, revealing the temple's grand scale and artistic richness, aligning with historical descriptions.Furthermore, the construction of such wonders was entirely within the technological capabilities of the civilizations that built them. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, often the most disputed of the seven, have been the subject of scholarly debate, but even here there is plausible evidence, such as references in cuneiform texts and possible confusion with gardens built in Nineveh by the Assyrian king Sennacherib. Historians suggest that rather than being mythical, the Gardens may have been misattributed in location or form, rather than fabricated altogether.Needless to say, the Seven Wonders were likely real, tangible structures that inspired awe in ancient times. While embellishments and inaccuracies may have crept into their stories over centuries, the core reality of their existence is supported by physical evidence, credible ancient testimony, and the engineering capabilities of the societies that built them. Rather than myths, they should be regarded as historical milestones in humanity's architectural and artistic achievements.  The Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt)Location: Giza Plateau, near Cairo, Egypt. Constructed: c. 2560 BCE. Builder: Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops). Status: The only surviving wonder.The Great Pyramid of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt, is the oldest and only surviving intact structure of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom around 2580–2560 BCE, it served as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu (also known by the Greek name Cheops). Originally rising to a height of approximately 146.6 meters (481 feet), it remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. Today, due to the loss of the outer casing stones and erosion, the pyramid stands at about 138.8 meters (455 feet) tall.The Great Pyramid was constructed using an estimated 2.3 million limestone and granite blocks, some weighing up to 80 tons. Despite extensive studies, the exact techniques used to build the pyramid remain a subject of debate and fascination. Ancient records suggest that tens of thousands of skilled workers, rather than slaves as once believed, toiled for decades to complete the colossal monument. Its alignment with the cardinal points and precise proportions demonstrate a high level of mathematical and architectural sophistication for its time.Inside the pyramid, the most famous internal structures include the King's Chamber, the Queen's Chamber, and the Grand Gallery, all part of a complex network of tunnels and passageways. The pyramid was originally covered in polished white Tura limestone, which would have made it shine brilliantly under the Sun. Although many of these casing stones have since been removed or eroded, the Great Pyramid still evokes awe and wonder. It remains a symbol of ancient Egyptian ingenuity, and religious devotion, and a lasting testament to humanity's ability to achieve monumental feats. Historical referencesHerodotus (5th century BCE) described the pyramid in Histories, attributing a 20-year construction period and noting slave labor, though as indicated modern scholars now believe skilled workers were used.Ancient graffiti found within the pyramid's chambers mentions the \"Friends of Khufu\" work crew, lending credence to organized labor groups. Archaeological evidenceExcavations at Giza have revealed worker villages, bakeries, and tools, confirming a highly organized and well-fed workforce, likely composed of seasonal laborers rather than slaves. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (Iraq)Location: Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Iraq. Constructed: c. 6th century BCE (disputed)Builder: Traditionally attributed to King Nebuchadnezzar II. Status: Destroyed; location and existence debated. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, often regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, evoke images of a lush, terraced paradise rising amidst the arid landscape of Mesopotamia. Said to have been located in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah in Iraq, the gardens were described by ancient Greek writers as a marvel of engineering and beauty.Towering terraces were allegedly filled with exotic trees, flowering plants, and cascading waterfalls, creating the illusion of a verdant mountain built in the heart of the desert. The most popular legend attributes the gardens' construction to King Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605–562 BCE), who supposedly built them to please his Median wife, Amytis, who longed for the green hills of her homeland.Despite the gardens' fame, there is significant debate among historians and archaeologists about whether they existed. There are no definitive Babylonian records describing the gardens, and they are conspicuously absent from the extensive inscriptions left behind by Nebuchadnezzar himself, who otherwise documented many of his building projects in Babylon.The most detailed descriptions of the Hanging Gardens come from later Greek and Roman writers, such as Strabo and Philo of Byzantium, who never saw them firsthand and would have relied on secondhand accounts that may have confused them with other sites. Some scholars have proposed an alternative theory that the gardens may have existed, but not in Babylon. The Assyrian capital of Nineveh, under King Sennacherib (r. 705–681 BCE), is now considered a possible candidate for the true location of the Hanging Gardens. Archaeological excavations in Nineveh have uncovered evidence of elaborate palace gardens and an advanced irrigation system, including aqueducts and a water-raising screw, which could match the technological feats described in ancient texts.Whether myth or reality, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon continue to capture the imagination as a symbol of opulence, innovation, and the timeless human desire to bring nature into the heart of civilization. Historical referencesStrabo and Philo of Byzantium provided detailed descriptions of the gardens.As indicated Babylonian texts, including Nebuchadnezzar's inscriptions, never mention the gardens. Archaeological evidenceExcavations by Robert Koldewey in the early 20th century uncovered a large vaulted structure in Babylon, possibly used for irrigation. However, evidence suggests alternative theories that place the gardens in Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, as described by Sennacherib's inscriptions, which boast of similar engineering marvels which may be more accurate. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Greece) Location: Olympia, Greece. Constructed: c. 435 BCE. Builder: Sculptor Phidias. Status: Destroyed (possibly by fire in the 5th century CE).The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, ( (Ζεύς ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ), a monumental sculpture that stood as a testament to the grandeur and artistic achievement of ancient Greece. Created around 435 BCE by the renowned sculptor Phidias, the statue was housed in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia, the site of the ancient Olympic Games. This majestic statue depicted Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, seated on a magnificent throne, radiating both authority and benevolence.Made primarily of ivory and gold over a wooden framework (a technique known as chryselephantine), the statue reached an estimated height of 12 meters (approximately 40 feet), making it so large that its head nearly brushed the temple's ceiling. Zeus held a figure of Nike, the goddess of victory, in his right hand and a scepter topped with an eagle in his left. The intricate detailing on his robes, the throne's decorations with mythical creatures, and the overall scale of the piece left ancient visitors in awe, with some ancient writers claiming that it gave the impression Zeus himself had descended from Olympus.The statue stood for over 800 years, but its fate remains somewhat mysterious. It was likely moved to Constantinople in the 4th century CE, where it was eventually destroyed, possibly in a fire. Although the statue no longer survives, descriptions from ancient texts and depictions on coins give us a glimpse of its grandeur. The Statue of Zeus was not only a religious icon but also a symbol of Greek artistic excellence and devotion to their deities. Its legacy continues to capture the imagination of historians, artists, and enthusiasts of classical antiquity. Historical referencesPausanias, the Greek traveler, offers a detailed 2nd-century CE account of the statue's grandeur, in addition to, the description by Philo of Byzantium.Coins and ancient illustrations depict Zeus holding a scepter and a statue of Nike (Victory) in his outstretched hands. Archaeological evidenceExcavations at Olympia have revealed the workshop of Phidias, complete with tools, terracotta molds, and a cup inscribed with \"I belong to Phidias\", confirming the statue's place and construction. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Turkey)Location: Ephesus, near modern Selçuk, Turkey. Constructed: Multiple phases, most notably c. 550 BCE. Builder: Croesus of Lydia (funded the grandest version). Status: Destroyed (arson, plunder, and natural disaster)The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, (Ἀρτεμίσιον ἐν Ἐφέσῳ), located near the modern town of Selçuk in Turkey, stood as a masterpiece of architecture and religious devotion. Dedicated to Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and fertility, the temple was originally constructed around 550 BCE by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes, under the patronage of the wealthy Lydian king Croesus.Built entirely of marble and adorned with sculptural decorations by some of the most skilled artists of the time, the temple was considered the largest of its kind in the ancient Greek world, far surpassing the size of the Parthenon in Athens. The grandeur of the temple was not merely in its scale but also in its cultural and religious significance. It served as a major center for worship, pilgrimage, and commerce, attracting visitors from across the Mediterranean.Artemis of Ephesus was worshipped in a form distinct from the classical Greek goddess, often depicted with multiple breast-shaped orbs considered symbols of fertility, reflecting a blend of Anatolian and Hellenic traditions.The temple complex also functioned as a bank and refuge during times of conflict, further underscoring its importance in the ancient world. Tragically, the original temple was destroyed by arson in 356 BCE, reportedly by a man named Herostratus who sought fame through infamy. A new temple, even more magnificent, was later rebuilt on the same site, but it too fell into ruin after successive invasions and centuries of neglect.Today, only a few remnants of the great structure remain, including scattered columns and foundations, yet the legacy of the Temple of Artemis endures as a symbol of ancient architectural brilliance and the rich cultural history of Ephesus. Historical referencesPliny the Elder described its dimensions and details in Natural History.Antipater of Sidon called it more marvelous than any other wonder. Archaeological evidenceExcavations by British archaeologist John Turtle Wood in the 1860s uncovered foundations and column fragments. Some sculpted column drums and decorative elements are now housed in the British Museum. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Turkey)Location: Bodrum, Turkey (ancient Halicarnassus). Constructed: c. 350 BCE. Builder: Queen Artemisia II of Caria for her husband Mausolus. Status: Destroyed (earthquakes, 12th-15th centuries CE). The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, located in present-day Bodrum, Turkey, was built around 350 BCE as a monumental tomb for Mausolus, a satrap (governor) of the Persian Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II. The structure not only served as a tomb but also as a lasting tribute to Mausolus' legacy. So grand and unique was this structure that his name, Mausolus, became the root of the modern word \"mausoleum.\"The Mausoleum stood approximately 45 meters (148 feet) high and was an extraordinary blend of Greek, Egyptian, and Lycian architectural elements. It featured a large rectangular base, a colonnaded midsection with Ionic columns, and a stepped pyramid roof topped by a grand statue of a chariot pulled by four horses. The sculptural decorations, created by some of the most celebrated sculptors of the time, Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis, and Timotheus, depicted scenes from myth and history, showcasing the artistic richness of the era.Though the Mausoleum survived for many centuries, it was eventually brought down by a series of earthquakes during the medieval period. By the 15th century, the remaining ruins were dismantled by the Knights of St. John, who used the stones to build the nearby Bodrum Castle.Despite its destruction, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus remains a symbol of architectural innovation and cultural fusion. Its artistic and structural legacy continues to influence funerary architecture even today. Historical referencesPliny the Elder and Vitruvius gave accounts of its structure and significance.Antipater of Sidon praised its symmetry and ornamentation. Archaeological evidenceExcavations in the 19th century revealed foundation stones, frieze reliefs, and statues, some of which are displayed at the British Museum, including fragments of the quadriga (four-horse chariot). The Colossus of Rhodes (Greece)Location: Rhodes, Greece. Constructed: c. 292–280 BCE. Builder: Sculptor Chares of Lindos. Status: Destroyed by an earthquake (226 BCE).The Colossus of Rhodes, (Κολοσσὸς Ῥόδου), was a massive bronze statue that once stood proudly at the entrance to the harbor of the island city of Rhodes, Greece. Built around 292–280 BCE, the statue was erected to honor the Sun god Helios, the patron deity of the Rhodians, following their successful defense against a siege by Demetrius I of Macedon. It was intended not just as a symbol of divine protection, but also as a celebration of the city's resilience and unity. The statue stood approximately 33 meters, (108 feet) high, making it one of the tallest statues of the ancient world.Constructed by the sculptor Chares of Lindos, a native of Rhodes and a student of the great sculptor Lysippos, the Colossus was created using bronze plates over an iron framework, a technique similar to that used centuries later for the Statue of Liberty. It is believed that the statue stood on a pedestal near the harbor entrance, although the popular image of it straddling the harbor with ships passing beneath its legs is considered a later myth. The project reportedly took 12 years to complete and was funded by selling the abandoned equipment left behind by the defeated Macedonian army.Tragically, the Colossus stood for only about 54 years before it was toppled by a massive earthquake in 226 BCE. Though it lay in ruins, its remains still inspired awe for centuries. The broken statue lay on the ground for over 800 years before Arab conquerors sold the scrap metal during their invasion of Rhodes in 654 CE.Despite its relatively short existence, the Colossus of Rhodes remains one of the most iconic symbols of ancient Greek engineering and artistic ambition, a testament to the ingenuity and pride of a city that once stood at the crossroads of ancient maritime power. Historical referencesPliny the Elder provides measurements and notes the broken statue's remains were visible for centuries.The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia, mentions the statue's grandeur and eventual destruction. Archaeological evidenceNo physical remains have been definitively identified. However, ancient foundations consistent with monumental statuary have been found near the harbor, and Rhodes minted coins featuring Helios with a radiant crown, indicating the cultural significance of the statue. The Pharos (Lighthouse) of Alexandria (Egypt)Location: Pharos Island, Alexandria, Egypt. Constructed: c. 280 BCE. Builder: Commissioned by Ptolemy I, completed under Ptolemy II. Status: Destroyed by earthquakes (between 956–1323 CE).The Pharos of Alexandria, also known as the Lighthouse of Alexandria, stood as a marvel of engineering and architecture for centuries. Built on the small island of Pharos just off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt, it was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter and completed during the reign of his son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, around 280 BCE. Designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus, the lighthouse was constructed to guide sailors safely into the busy harbor of Alexandria, one of the most important trading centers of the ancient world.Estimates of the lighthouse's height vary, but ancient sources suggest it stood between 100 and 130 meters, (roughly 330 to 430 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest man-made structures of antiquity. Its design was tiered, comprising a square base, a cylindrical middle section, and a smaller circular beacon at the top, possibly topped with a statue, some accounts say of Zeus or Poseidon. During the day, the Sun reflected off polished bronze mirrors that helped guide ships, while at night, a fire was maintained, magnified by reflective surfaces to create a beam visible for miles. The Pharos was both a functional aid to navigation and a symbol of Alexandria's grandeur and Hellenistic sophistication.The lighthouse endured for many centuries, but it was severely damaged by a series of earthquakes between the 10th and 14th centuries CE. Eventually, it collapsed and was no longer functional, though its legacy endured. In the 15th century, the Sultan of Egypt used some of its fallen stones to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the same site.Today, underwater archaeological explorations have uncovered remnants of the lighthouse in the harbor, providing insight into its structure and significance.Side note:- Pharos (Latin: Pharus) was the name of the island where the lighthouse was built. The Lighthouse of Pharos became so iconic that the name Pharos became synonymous with any lighthouse. The original root of the word is derived from the Greek word for the island: Φάρος (Pháros). Historical referencesStrabo and Pliny the Elder praised its design and function.The Arab traveler Ibn Battuta witnessed its ruined form in the 14th century. Archaeological evidenceIn 1994, underwater archaeologists discovered large stone blocks, statues, and sphinxes submerged near Alexandria's Eastern Harbor, likely remnants of the lighthouse. Some artefacts are now visible in underwater tours and museum exhibits ConclusionIn conclusion, the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World represent far more than a nostalgic list of lost marvels, they are enduring testaments to humanity's early pursuit of architectural mastery, artistic brilliance, and cultural identity. While only the Great Pyramid of Giza still stands today, the other wonders, though destroyed or lost to time, are far from mythical.Through a combination of ancient historical writings, surviving ruins, and archaeological discoveries, a compelling case emerges that these wonders were real, physical structures that once inspired awe in those who beheld them.Each wonder reflects the values and capabilities of the civilization that created it: the Pyramid demonstrates the precision and ambition of ancient Egypt; the Hanging Gardens, whether in Babylon or Nineveh, embody the ingenuity of Mesopotamian irrigation and design; the Statue of Zeus reveals the grandeur of Greek artistry and religious devotion; and the Temple of Artemis shows the cultural richness and architectural sophistication of ancient Anatolia.Together, these wonders speak not only to the glory of the ancient world but also to our enduring desire to commemorate the extraordinary. Rather than being dismissed as legend, the Seven Wonders should be embraced as real expressions of ancient human achievement.Their stories blend fact, tradition, and some inevitable exaggeration, offering a valuable understanding into the civilizations that shaped the foundation of our modern world. They continue to inspire curiosity, scholarship, and admiration, reminding us that even across millennia, humanity's drive to build, create, and remember is a wonder in itself. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

He was born in Byzantium but spent a significant part of his life in Alexandria, one of the great centers of learning in the Hellenistic world. Philo is best known for his contributions to mechanics and engineering, particularly in pneumatics, siegecraft, and automation. His work reflects the blending of practical engineering with theoretical science, a hallmark of Hellenistic intellectual achievement.One of Philo's most notable achievements is his treatise Mechanike Syntaxis (\"Compendium of Mechanics\"), a large work that originally consisted of nine books. Only parts of it survive today, including sections on pneumatics and military engineering. In his Pneumatica, Philo described various devices that operated using air, steam, or water pressure, some of which may be considered early forms of automation. These included water fountains, force pumps, and even a primitive form of the steam engine.Philo is also one of the earliest known writers to mention the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In a lost work titled Peri tōn hepta theamatōn (Greek: Περὶ τῶν ἑπτὰ θεαμάτων, \"On the Seven Wonders\"), he compiled a list of what were considered the most magnificent man-made structures of his time.Although the original text is lost, later sources preserve parts of it and refer to his descriptions, which helped shape the canonical list known today. Philo's writings emphasized not only the grandeur and aesthetics of the wonders but also their architectural and engineering ingenuity, aligning with his interests in mechanical and structural excellence.Through his surviving works and his lost but influential writings on the wonders of the world, Philo of Byzantium remains a key figure in understanding both ancient engineering and how classical civilizations valued technological and artistic marvels. Linking the goddess Nike to the modern OlympicsThe statue of Zeus at Olympia, (Ζεύς ἐν Ὀλυμπίᾳ), held in his outstretched right hand a smaller figure of the goddess Nike, (Νίκη), the personification of victory. This symbolic gesture captured the heart of the Olympic spirit: the pursuit of excellence, triumph, and divine favor. The ancient Olympic Games were held in Zeus's honor and were as much about pleasing the gods as they were about celebrating human achievement. Nike, literally \"Victory,\" embodied the glory bestowed upon those who emerged triumphant in athletic competition, linking sport with the divine.That association between athletic excellence and military prowess became even more poignant after the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE. In that iconic clash, the vastly outnumbered Athenians defeated the invading Persian forces, a moment seen not just as a military victory, but as a triumph of democratic courage and physical endurance. According to legend, a runner named Pheidippides, (Φειδιππίδης), ran from the battlefield to Athens, over 26 miles, in armor across rough mountain trails after the battle to announce \"Νενικήκαμεν!\" (Nenikēkamen) — meaning \"We have won!\" or \"We are victorious!\" before collapsing and dying.This legendary feat of endurance is the mythic origin of the modern marathon event. In the aftermath, Nike was more than just the goddess of victory, she became a national symbol of survival, resilience, and the favor of the gods.When the modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896, the legacy of Nike and the ideals represented by the statue of Zeus lived on. The inclusion of the marathon race honored the Athenian spirit at Marathon, tying the Games directly to that moment of historical heroism.Nike remains a potent symbol today: her winged figure graces medals and trophies, embodying the timeless quest for greatness. Through Zeus's hand and the battlefield of Marathon, the thread of victory stretches across millennia, binding the ancient and modern Olympics in a celebration of strength, perseverance, and the enduring power of human ambition. The Breasts of ArtemisArtemis, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt, wild animals, wilderness, childbirth, and the Moon, was one of the most widely venerated deities in the Greek world. As a virgin goddess and the twin sister of Apollo, Artemis represents an archetype of fierce independence, often depicted with a bow and accompanied by a deer or hunting dogs. While many temples were dedicated to her across the Greek world, the most iconic and enigmatic representation of Artemis comes from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, (Main text), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.The Ephesian Artemis, however, departs dramatically from the typical youthful huntress image. Her statues display a rigid, frontal pose and an unusual adornment on her chest that has sparked scholarly debate for centuries: the presence of multiple rounded protuberances, often interpreted as multiple breasts.The traditional interpretation of these rounded shapes suggests that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing Artemis as a universal mother and fertility goddess. This view aligns more closely with Anatolian mother goddess figures like Cybele and reflects the syncretism between Greek and earlier local deities in Asia Minor.The Ephesian Artemis may therefore represent a convergence of identities, combining the Greek Artemis with pre-Greek fertility goddesses. Her cult at Ephesus was deeply rooted in the notion of life-giving power, suggesting that the many breasts symbolized abundant nourishment and fertility.However, more recent hypotheses challenge the breast interpretation. Some scholars propose that the objects are not anatomical at all but represent offerings or ritual items, such as gourds, often used in ancient fertility rites. Others suggest they could be amber or acorn-like pendants, possibly meant to invoke protective powers or symbolize abundance and bounty.One compelling theory, supported by archaeological analysis of earlier statues, is that the \"breasts\" might be rows of bull scrotums, commemorating animal sacrifices made in her honor. This theory finds some grounding in ancient practices, where votive offerings included preserved animal parts.Another hypothesis posits that the shapes were symbolic, meant to indicate celestial or astrological concepts rather than biological fertility. Artemis, as a lunar goddess, may have been associated with the heavens and the cyclical nature of the moon. In this reading, the strange protuberances could symbolize stars, moons, or other astral forms rather than reproductive organs, shifting Artemis from a mother goddess to a cosmic force of nature.A more recent hypothesis suggests that the rounded protuberances on the Ephesian Artemis may be stylized representations of beehives. This theory draws on the deep symbolic relationship between bees, feminine power, and divine wisdom in the ancient Mediterranean world.In several cultures, bees were associated with goddesses and priestesses, most notably the Melissae, or \"bee priestesses,\" who served various deities including Artemis, Demeter, and even the Delphic Oracle of Apollo. Artemis herself was occasionally linked to bees through inscriptions and myths that emphasized her role as a guardian of nature and a nurturer of hidden wisdom.The beehive theory adds a fascinating new layer to the understanding of Artemis's cult at Ephesus. Bees, and by extension hives, symbolize fertility, community, regeneration, and sacred knowledge, concepts that align well with Artemis's multifaceted nature as both a protector of virginity and a goddess of childbirth. The idea that her chest might display stylized hives rather than anatomical features or votive offerings challenges earlier fertility-only interpretations, suggesting instead that Artemis presided over a sacred ecology, where every element of nature was connected through divine order and maternal stewardship.This symbolic interpretation also repositions the Ephesian Artemis as a cosmic queen bee, overseeing the structured, mystical order of nature and life itself. Such a reading would explain her unearthly, rigid posture and the heavily adorned, almost architectural, stylization of her statues, not as depictions of the natural human form, but as sacred icons encoded with layers of meaning for the initiated. The beehive theory thus resonates with broader ancient themes of sacred geometry, female divinity, and the microcosmic order of nature within the divine feminine.The true meaning remains elusive, largely because the cult of the Ephesian Artemis was highly localized and her rituals closely guarded. What is clear, however, is that Artemis of Ephesus embodies a richly layered fusion of religious symbolism, blending themes of fertility, sacrifice, protection, and cosmic order into one of antiquity's most mysterious and enduring images.",

    "description": "The Battle of Shiloh (April 6–7, 1862) almost ended Generals Grant and Sherman's careers. Instead, it is considered their first great victory, a testament to their tenacity and determination.During the chaotic first day, several Union generals played critical roles in holding defensive positions or delaying the Confederate advance. These efforts helped prevent a total collapse of the Union army and bought time for General Ulysses S. Grant to establish a stronger defensive line near Pittsburg Landing. Lloyd W Klein here looks at how the battle ended in the final part of the series. Part 1 is here. Ulysses S. Grant.Important Union Contributions:·       Brigadier General Benjamin Prentiss who commanded the 6th Division in the Union center. He was a critical first responder given that his was the most forward division. He would then move to the Hornet’s Nest.·       Major General John A. McClernand who commanded the 1st Division on the Union right flank. McClernand’s division faced some of the heaviest fighting early in the day as the Confederates launched their surprise attack. Despite being pushed back, McClernand’s forces fought stubbornly, slowing the Confederate advance and preventing an early collapse of the Union right flank.·       Brigadier General Stephen A. Hurlbut, who commanded the 4th Division.Hurlbut’s division held a defensive position near the Union left flank, covering the approach to Pittsburg Landing.. His troops absorbed significant Confederate pressure and played a key role in protecting the Union army’s retreat and regrouping efforts. Important Confederate Contributions:·       Major General Braxton Bragg, commander of a Confederate corps, whose aggressive leadership helped drive the Confederate advance early in the battle. He coordinated several assaults on key Union positions, including the Hornet’s Nest, which was crucial in breaking Union resistance in the center. Bragg’s relentless pressure contributed to the Union army’s retreat toward Pittsburg Landing.·       Major General William J. Hardee, who commanded the lead Confederate corps.Hardee’s corps spearheaded the initial Confederate assault at dawn, achieving significant success in surprising and overwhelming the Union front lines. His leadership was instrumental in the early Confederate momentum, driving Union forces back several miles.·       Major General Leonidas Polk who commanded of a Confederate corps. Polk’s corps provided critical support during the Confederate attacks on the Union right flank. While his contributions were solid, Polk’s performance was less decisive compared to Bragg and Hardee. who were instrumental in executing the Confederate attacks, particularly in the early phases of the battle, and their actions shaped the battlefield dynamics.            Hornet’s NestA key defensive stand occurred at an area later known as the Hornet’s Nest, where Union forces under Prentiss and Brigadier General W.H.L. Wallace held off repeated Confederate assaults for several hours. This resistance bought critical time for Grant to organize a defensive line near Pittsburg Landing. The Hornet’s Nest was a name given to the area of the Shiloh battlefield where Confederate troops made repeated attacks against Union positions along a small, little-used farm road.. Southern soldiers said the zipping bullets sounded like angry hornets; according to tradition, one man said, \"It’s a hornet’s nest in there.\"The narrow farm road ambles generally southeast from its junction with the Eastern Corinth Road (Corinth-Pittsburgh Road). Fairly level toward its northwest end, it makes a rather sharp climb up a hill near its center, descending again near the William Manse George cabin and the Peach Orchard. That hill, where Brigadier General Benjamin Prentiss commanded an ad hoc group of regiments, comprises the area of the Hornet’s Nest. To Wallace’s right was a division of Federals under Brig. Gen. W.H. L. Wallace, and to his left was another division under Brig. Gen. Stephen Hurlbut. Wallace held a position stretching along the farm road from the Eastern Cornith Road and up the slope to where Prentiss’s line began. Wallace’s men were in a deep ravine on the east side of the farm road; that area is now known as the Sunken Road. Often, but erroneously, the positions of Wallace and Prentiss are lumped together as the Hornet’s Nest. Confusing matters further is the fact that as the farm road passes over the hill where Prentiss had his command, it is sunken for a portion of its 600-yard length there.Brigadier General W.H.L. Wallace commanded the 2nd Division. An Illinois volunteer soldier who was a lawyer in his civilian life, I believe a law partner at one time of Abraham Lincoln (they were friends, at least). Coolness under fire leading a brigade as a colonel at Fort Donelson had earned him a promotion to Brigadier General Wallace’s division also played a central role in defending the Hornet’s Nest, fighting alongside Prentiss’s men. Wallace was mortally wounded during the battle, but his leadership and the determination of his troops were crucial in holding the line for much of the day. Charles Ferguson Smith had been the division commander but developed a leg infection just prior to the battle. In fact, he died of it a couple of weeks later. General William HL Wallace took command, and ended up defending the Hornet’s Nest for 6 hours, eventually being killed there.Wallace commanded the 2nd Division of the Army of the Tennessee. His division formed a critical part of the Union line, holding off repeated Confederate assaults. During the intense fighting in the late afternoon, Wallace was mortally wounded. A bullet struck him in the head as his troops were withdrawing from the Hornet’s Nest. He was left on the battlefield during the Union retreat but was later found alive by Union forces. Wallace was taken to a field hospital, but his injuries were too severe. He died on April 10, 1862, four days after the battle. His death was a significant loss to the Union army, as he was a respected and capable commander.Benjamin Prentiss commanded the 6th Division of the Army of the Tennessee. Early on Day 1, his division bore the brunt of the Confederate surprise attack. Despite being initially driven back, Prentiss regrouped his forces and established a strong defensive position in the Hornet’s Nest, a dense thicket that became a focal point of the battle. Alongside W.H.L. Wallace, Prentiss held this position for hours, slowing the Confederate advance and buying time for Union forces to reorganize near Pittsburg Landing. Prentiss took full command of the position after Wallace was fatally wounded.  Late in the afternoon, after being surrounded and running low on ammunition, Prentiss and his remaining troops were forced to surrender. Prentiss was taken prisoner along with about 2,200 Union soldiers. Prentiss was held as a prisoner of war until he was exchanged in October 1862. His leadership at the Hornet’s Nest earned him recognition for his bravery, despite his capture.The defense of the Hornet’s Nest by Prentiss and Wallace delayed the Confederate advance, preventing them from reaching Pittsburg Landing and potentially destroying the Union army on Day 1. While both men suffered tragic outcomes—Prentiss as a prisoner and Wallace from mortal wounds—their actions contributed significantly to the Union’s ability to regroup and ultimately win the battle on Day 2. The Confederate forces launched repeated attacks on this strong Union defensive position, but it took hours and significant effort to overcome it.  General Beauregard has been criticized for his conduct of this aspect of the battle because of the time delay it caused. He could have bypassed the Hornet’s Nest entirely and gone straight for Pittsburg Landing.After the battle he was considered a hero, having held off the Confederate States Army long enough to allow General Grant to organize a counterattack and win the battle. Grant later played down Prentiss's role in the victory, possibly because of mutual dislike between the two generals. He was exchanged in October 1862.  Prentiss was promoted to major general and served on the court-martial board that convicted Fitz John Porter. His dissenting voice in the final vote damaged his political clout in the Army, and he resigned in 1863.Colonel Randall L. Gibson commanded a brigade under Bragg. Gibson’s brigade launched multiple assaults on the Hornet’s Nest but was repelled repeatedly with heavy losses. His inability to break the Union line underscored the strength of the Union position and the difficulty of the Confederate task. While Gibson would go on to become a long-serving brigade commander with a solid service record, Braxton Bragg (the man who ordered the repeated charges) would fault him and bring him up on charges after the battle. He had graduated Yale as valedictorian, a member of Skull and Crossbones, and the son of a wealthy plantation owner.  An interesting factoid about Gibson is that his great-great-grandfather was a free man of color whose descendants were able to integrate into Louisiana's white society. He would go on to be the US Senator from Louisiana who was instrumental in ending Reconstruction.An artillery barrage organized by the Ruggles Brigade ultimately caused the Union line to break and the Union line was broken with units heading to the rear. Ruggles' Battery, not an actual unit but a Napoleonic style Grand Battery collecting numerous artillery units under the direction of Confederate division commander Daniel Ruggles. Brigadier General Daniel Ruggles lined up eleven batteries of cannon (62 in all according to Ruggles, 53 according to other sources) and bombed the hell out of the Union troops for nearly an hour beginning at 4:30 PM on April 6th. At the time, this was the greatest concentration of artillery pieces on a North American battlefield.An uncoordinated double envelopment was in progress. The Confederates eventually surrounded and overwhelmed the Hornet’s Nest, capturing Prentiss and many of his men. However, the delay proved crucial for the Union. Although Prentiss and most of his men were eventually surrounded and captured, their stubborn defense significantly delayed the Confederate advance, allowing Grant to organize a stronger line closer to Pittsburg Landing. The Death of Albert Sidney Johnston Johnston  personally led a critical charge during the afternoon, inspiring his troops and helping to push Union forces back. A bullet to the back of his knee killed Johnston, where the popliteal artery is located. This wound should not have resulted in death; a simple tourniquet would have been lifesaving. Unfortunately, the wound went unnoticed until too late.The death of Albert Sidney Johnston of course was a major event in the war; the Confederate western theater never really found its general. Johnston was shot while leading a charge. Why the commanding general was doing this has been speculated about ever since. His losses at Fort Donelson and Henry, and the criticism following his abandoning Nashville certainly occupied his mind. Johnston was killed by a bullet to the back of his knee, where the popliteal artery is located. Unfortunately, the wound went unnoticed until too late because Johnston had received a wound to that leg in the Mexican War, decreasing his sensation. Meanwhile, the bleeding became severe and filled his boot with blood. Essentially he exsanguinated on the field from what ought to have been a non-fatal wound. This wound should not have resulted in death; a simple tourniquet would have been lifesaving. Lew WallaceA casualty of a different kind was the Union general Lew Wallace. Wallace took a road that was correct if the lines were where they had been at the start of the day but by the time he arrived, those lines were pushed back and so Wallace was behind enemy lines. Thus, he had to countermarch. He never did arrive on day 1 but he was very effective on day 2. Grant never really forgave him; only in his autobiography, after Wallace died, did Grant recognize that he had misinterpreted the situation. Wallace spent years trying to make up for the supposed error, a theme he used in his famous novel Ben Hur.Lew Wallace is one of the most interesting men who came out of the war, and we have done extensive challenges on almost every aspect of his life. The nature of the misunderstanding that would change his life forever occurred in a flash: at Crump’s Landing, Grant verbally ordered Wallace to the battlefield but didn’t clearly specify what road to take. Wallace ended up on the wrong one (see map). He never did arrive on day 1 (until 7 pm) and Grant never really forgave him. I have read Wallace’s autobiography, and Grant’s Battles and Leaders article and of course his Memoirs.  It all seems like a mix-up of the kind the fog of war will inevitably produce, and way too complicated to review here. Unquestionably, Grant tried to blame Wallace for his day 1 mishaps for many years. Only in his autobiography, after Wallace died, after the wife of the other General Wallace, Mrs. WHL Wallace, sent Grant information that bore out Lew Wallace’s explanation, did Grant recognize that he had misinterpreted the situation. Wallace spent years trying to make up for the supposed error, which was not really his fault, a theme he used in his famous novel Ben Hur. In the interim, Wallace saved Washington DC at the Battle of Monocacy, served as governor of New Mexico territory, and diplomat to the Ottoman Empire. Ben Hur became one of the best sellers of the century, making Wallace a wealthy man, so he did quite well for himself despite it all. He is one of my favorite Civil War characters. And we are not done with him here either. EveningGrant’s back was to the river; he could have been entirely destroyed. His defense at Pittsburg Landing in the afternoon of day 1 saved his army. By evening, Grant had established a strong defensive line near Pittsburg Landing, supported by artillery and the Tennessee River. The presence of Union gunboats added firepower, repelling further Confederate advances.  Generals Hurlbut and McClernand contributed to this final defensive stand, ensuring the Union army survived the first day of battle.General Beauregard, confident in the day’s success, decided to halt the attack for the night, believing the Union army was on the verge of collapse. However, this decision allowed Grant to regroup and prepare for a counterattack.The first day of Shiloh was chaotic and bloody, with heavy casualties on both sides.The Confederates had pushed the Union forces back significantly but failed to achieve total victory.  The ferocity of the fighting on Day 1 shocked both sides and marked Shiloh as one of the war’s most brutal battles.That night, reinforcements from Buell’s Army of the Ohio began arriving, giving Grant the strength to launch a counteroffensive on April 7.Sherman commanded 5th Division, which was stationed at Shiloh Church on the Union right flank. His division was among the first to face the Confederate onslaught.  Despite being surprised and initially overwhelmed, Sherman quickly rallied his troops and organized a defense to slow the Confederate advance. His division absorbed significant pressure, buying time for other Union units to organize and retreat toward Pittsburg Landing.Shiloh was quite possibly Sherman's best day of combat command during the war.  After being wounded in Rea Field, he galloped back to his camps and got his brigades in line (some were already up and forming) along a ridge overlooking a creek (variously know as Shiloh Branch, Rhea Creek, or Rea Creek).  He was able to hang on here (joined by one brigade from McClernand on his left) from 7 a.m. until 9:30 or so, repelling a series of uncoordinated single-brigade attacks from four Confederate brigades.  Eventually the position was flanked on the left, and Sherman and McClernand fell back to the Hamburg-Purdy Road.  Between 10:30 and 11:30, this position was attacked by a force that one source characterized as \"two-thirds of the Confederate army\" and driven back to Jones Field.  Sherman and McClernand then carried out the only Federal counterattack of the day, driving the enemy back before losing steam and retiring back to Jones Field in the early afternoon.  In the middle of the afternoon they retired further, across Tilghman Branch..Sherman demonstrated remarkable composure under fire, personally leading counterattacks and encouraging his men despite being wounded in the hand and shoulder. His ability to maintain discipline and inspire confidence among his troops helped prevent a total rout of the Union right flank. Sherman worked closely with McClernand, whose division was positioned near his own, to establish a series of defensive lines as they fell back under Confederate pressure. Their combined efforts helped slow the Confederate advance and delayed a complete Union collapse.As the Union forces were pushed back toward Pittsburg Landing, Sherman played a key role in organizing the final defensive line. His leadership ensured that his battered division held its position, contributing to the Union army’s survival at the end of the first day. Sherman’s ability to rally his troops under chaotic and dire circumstances demonstrated his leadership skills and earned him forever the trust of General Grant. His actions at Shiloh marked a turning point in his career, proving his capability as a battlefield commander. Grant later praised Sherman’s performance, calling him one of the key figures in preventing the Union army from being destroyed on the first day of the battle.When Sherman arrived at Grant’s headquarters later that evening, he found the general chewing on a soggy cigar in the rain, which had begun soaking the battlefield. ‘Well, Grant, we’ve had the devil’s own day, haven’t we?’ ‘Yes,’ replied Grant, ‘lick ’em tomorrow, though.’After making a brief attempt to assail Grant's line behind Dill Creek Branch they retired to the Federal camps for the night.  Polk took his Corps back to their own camps of the previous night; which did not help the Confederate effort on the 7th. They slept on their arms. All of the brigades were entangled and exhausted. Command and control had become weak during the afternoon for this reason. Beauregard had thrown in all of his men, there were no reserve units now. He expected the next morning to be a mop-up operation. He did not anticipate Don Carlos Buell’s Army of the Ohio arrival, nor Lew Wallace’s division., which was now on the field. The Confederate lines had become confused and now they were outnumbered. A dispatch from Colonel Benjamin Hardin Helm led Beauregard to believe that Buell was en route to Decatur, Ala., away from Grant’s army. The report was entirely inaccurate, but Beauregard believed it. Cavalry Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest had observed Buell’s men crossing the river by ferry. He frantically tried to warn Beauregard, but was unable to locate the Confederate commander.Lew Wallace arrived on the right between 7:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.  On the left, Nelson's Division of Buell's Army was just beginning to cross as the Confederates made their final effort, and finished by 9:00 p.m.  Crittenden was in place by 1:00 a.m., and McCook followed after that. Buell arrived that same evening with nearly 20,000 men. Wallace’s division, consisting of about 5,800 men, was well-rested and unscathed from the previous day’s fighting. These reinforcements completely changed the balance of forces, but Beauregard didn’t know it was happening. The Battle – Day 2The fortunes of Day 2 went the opposite way. Beauregard’s men were entangled and exhausted. Don Carlos Buell’s Army of the Ohio arrived. But so did Lew Wallace’s division.General P.G.T. Beauregard had effectively managed the Confederate forces after Johnston’s death, but his decision to halt the attack on the evening of April 6 had significant consequences. He believed the Union army was defeated and delayed further attacks until the next day, giving Grant time to regroup and receive reinforcements.Overnight, Union reinforcements under General Don Carlos Buell and Lew Wallace arrived, significantly bolstering Union forces. Early on April 7, Union forces launched a coordinated counterattack against the Confederate army, which had been exhausted from the previous day’s fighting. Confederate troops, under General P.G.T. Beauregard (put up stiff resistance but were gradually pushed back.After failing to reach the battlefield in time on Day 1 due to miscommunication and delays, Wallace’s troops arrived fully intact and ready for action, making a significant contribution to the Union counteroffensive.  His troops were positioned on the Union right flank, where they attacked the Confederate left, putting additional pressure on the exhausted Southern forces. Wallace’s division executed a coordinated attack with other Union forces, pushing the Confederate left flank back. This disrupted the Confederate defensive lines and contributed to their eventual retreat. His troops were instrumental in recapturing ground lost on Day 1, helping secure Union control of the battlefield. Wallace’s arrival helped General Ulysses S. Grant execute a unified counteroffensive across the entire front. Wallace’s division worked in conjunction with Buell’s reinforcements and other Union divisions to overwhelm the Confederates.The Union counterattacked the morning of day 2. Sherman’s division participated in the Union counteroffensive, helping to drive the Confederate forces back. His troops, though exhausted and bloodied from the previous day’s fighting, played a significant role in regaining lost ground and securing a Union victory. The Union army recaptured lost ground, including areas around Pittsburg Landing. .By afternoon, the Confederate forces, realizing they were outnumbered and outmaneuvered, began retreating toward Corinth, Mississippi.The Confederate lines had become confused the day before and now they were outnumbered. The Union now had the advantage and pushed the lines back completely beyond where the battle lines had been before the fighting began.Buell met with Sherman at sunset, and learned that Grant planned to attack at sunrise. An understanding was made that Grant would have the west side of the line, while Buell would plan his own attack on the east side. General Don Carlos Buell’s troops made a critical contribution, no doubt. His added reinforcements helped ensure a Union victory on the battle’s second day when a massive Union counterattack routed Confederate forces. Buell’s soldiers played a key role in the Union counterattack. They attacked the Confederate right flank, forcing the Confederates to stretch their already exhausted lines. This pressure, combined with attacks from other Union forces, gradually drove the Confederates back. Buell’s troops helped stabilize the Union’s left flank, which had been vulnerable on Day 1.Their presence allowed Grant to organize a coordinated assault across the entire line, rather than focusing solely on defense. The fresh energy and discipline of Buell’s troops were instrumental in breaking the Confederate resistance. By mid-afternoon, their efforts contributed to forcing the Confederates into a full retreat, ensuring a Union victory. Buell’s timely arrival and the effectiveness of his troops underscored the importance of reinforcements in Civil War battles, where exhaustion and attrition often determined the outcome. General Buell would later insist that he deserved credit for turning the tide at Shiloh, while others—in particular Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman—argued that his troops ultimately had little effect on the outcome. In summary, both Grant’s and Buell’s armies made important contributions on day 2.Could Beauregard have won day 2 if he had prepared differently? For many years, this was the conclusion of many historians. Modern historians, such as Cunningham and Daniel, disagree with that assessment. Cunningham wrote that Beauregard's critics ignore \"the existing situation on the Shiloh battlefield\"—including Confederate disorganization, time before sunset, and Grant's strong position augmented by gunboats. Daniel wrote that the thought that \"the Confederates could have permanently breached or pulverized the Federal line in an additional hour or so of piecemeal night assaults simply lacks plausibility.\" He mentions that it took the Confederates six hours to conquer the Hornet's Nest, and Grant's Last Line was a stronger position. He also cites exhaustion, and low ammunition. Dill Creek Branch would have been a formidable position to capture by tired troops. On April 7, Beauregard attempted to continue offensive operations, but his troops were outnumbered, exhausted, and lacked reinforcements. Recognizing the arrival of Union reinforcements, Beauregard could have shifted to a defensive posture, fortifying positions and conserving his forces for a controlled retreat. This might have minimized casualties and preserved his army for future campaigns. On day 2, the Confederates were outnumbered but had they entrenched and set up a defensive perimeter, they might well have held off the Union counterattack. Beauregard could have ordered a relentless night attack to exploit the disarray in the Union lines. While risky due to exhaustion and poor visibility, this might have prevented Union reinforcements (Buell’s and Wallace’s troops) from stabilizing the Union position overnight. Confederate cavalry under Nathan Bedford Forrest was underutilized during the battle, particularly for reconnaissance and disrupting Union reinforcements. Beauregard could have deployed cavalry more aggressively to harass Buell’s approaching forces or cut off the Union supply lines to Pittsburg Landing. This could have delayed or weakened the Union counteroffensive on Day 2. He could have anticipated Buell’s arrival and adjusted his strategy accordingly, perhaps by retreating under cover of darkness on April 6 to avoid being outflanked and overwhelmed. Finally, his single road route from Corinth was problematic logistically, as ammunition would become depleted. The AftermathBeauregard retreated from the field in the late afternoon and returned to Corinth. The Union Army had recovered all of the ground it had lost on day 1 and swept the field on day 2. Grant did not pursue, in part because his own army was in disarray but also because General Halleck would not allow it. Both sides suffered significant losses, with over 23,000 combined casualties, making Shiloh one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War up to that point. The Union army claimed victory, though at a heavy cost.The Union had 63,000 men engaged, with 13,000 casualties (1754 killed, 8400 wounded, 2900 captured vs. the Confederates with 40-45,000 men with 10,700 casualties (1728 killed, 8000 wounded, 1000 captured). The Union therefore had more casualties, but on a percentage basis, a slightly lower rate of casualties. The battle demonstrated the brutality of the war and marked a turning point in the Western Theater, giving the Union control of key regions in Tennessee. “Scareder than I was at Shiloh” The battle remains famous for the brutal fighting, the high casualties on both sides, and the evidence that the war was going to be a long one. At that time, this battle had more American casualties than every prior war combined! Yet by the end of the war, this battle barely made the top ten list.General Grant initially was the recipient of an outpouring of public support at first, hailed as a hero of a great battle. The perception of Grant as a drunkard was utilized to explain the horrific losses suffered at the Battle of Shiloh by officers jealous of Grant’s rapid rise. Newspaper reports critical of Grant’s command were intended to increase sales, if not influence the political debate, after the shocking casualties of that bloody battle. Shocked by the casualties of what, up to that point, was the war’s bloodiest battle, newspaper reporters wrote articles critical of Grant’s command. These criticisms fed the rumors that Grant, who many believed had been forced out of the pre-war Army because of alcohol consumption, had been caught drunk and off guard by Confederate General Albert Sydney Johnston’s surprise attack. The losses suffered by both sides at Shiloh had more to do with the nature of nineteenth-century warfare than the nature of Grant’s relationship with liquor, but rumors of his affection for spirits now became generally accepted.Whitelaw Reid, Cincinnati Gazette, reported the events of the battle incorrectly, stating that Grant had been taken by surprise at Shiloh and that soldiers had been bayonetted in their tents. This myth persists to this day.  The high casualty rate at Shiloh was related to the intensity of the battle, not the nature of Grant’s problems with liquor, but rumors of his drinking increased. Halleck arrived at Pittsburg Landing on April 11 and took personal command—as he had planned earlier. On April 30, he named Grant as his second-in-command. This was a meaningless position, but Halleck's solution to the Grant criticism was a de facto suspension that satisfied the critics. Some of the more \"savage denunciations\" of Grant came from politicians representing Ohio and Iowa. One politician complained to Lincoln, saying Grant was an incompetent drunk that was a political liability. Lincoln's response was \"I can't spare this man; he fights.\"On April 8, Confederate President Jefferson Davis reported to the Confederate congress that Johnston had gained a complete victory. A last-minute addition to his speech mentioned Johnston's death. Before the battle, the public had wanted Johnston removed because of the loss of most of Tennessee. Now he was a hero. Over the next few days, more information about the battle became available. The initial perception was that only \"untoward events\" had saved the Union army from destruction, and the withdrawal to Corinth was part of a strategic plan. Eventually, critics began to blame Beauregard for the defeat, citing the lack of a twilight attack on the first day of the battle.The perception of Grant as a drunkard was utilized to explain the horrific losses suffered at the Battle of Shiloh by officers jealous of Grant’s rapid rise. Newspaper reports  critical of Grant’s command were intended to increase sales, if not influence the political debate, after the shocking casualties of that bloody battle. Shocked by the casualties of what up to that point was the war’s bloodiest battle, newspaper reporters wrote articles critical of Grant’s command. These criticisms fed the rumors that Grant, who many believed had been forced out of the pre-war Army because of alcohol consumption, had been caught drunk and off guard by Confederate General Albert Sydney Johnston’s surprise attack. The losses suffered by both sides at Shiloh had more to do with the nature of nineteenth-century warfare than the nature of Grant’s relationship with liquor, but rumors of his affection for spirits now became generally accepted. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content for over 12 years.

    "description": "When James Garfield won the Presidency in 1880, Charles Guiteau got ready to accept his new government job. No one had actually offered him a job – but he'd campaigned for Garfield, so he assumed he'd be rewarded. That was the spoils system, and it was how the government worked.But President Garfield didn't hire him. Guiteau was furious. And on July 2, 1881, he followed Garfield to a Washington D.C. train station and shot him.Today on the show: how an assassination meant to restore the spoils system instead led to its end, and birthed the modern federal workforce.An earlier version of this episode incorrectly said that Abram Garfield fought a fire with his brothers. In fact, he fought the fire with his neighbors.Learn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoicesNPR Privacy Policy",
