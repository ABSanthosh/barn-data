    "description": "This September is a significant milestone in the history of Finnish democratic socialism; marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the first socialist-led coalition of Kalevi Sorsa. A journalist who went on to work for UNESCO and the Finnish foreign ministry on multiple occasions, while also going on to serve as Secretary and later Chairman of his own Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sorsa became prime minister following a general election held in Finland in 1972. Over the next three years, Sorsa presided over a truly transformative administration. Although circumstances led to his government’s premature collapse in 1975, Sorsa would go on to serve as prime minister again for three non-consecutive terms; in the process holding that position for a longer period than any of his predecessors.Vittorio Trevitt explains. Finnish politician Kalevi Sorsa in 1975. Source: http://www.finna.fi/Cover/Show?id=musketti.M012%3AHK7155%3A309-75-1\u0026index=0\u0026size=large\u0026w=1200\u0026h=1200Image record page in Finna: musketti.M012%3AHK7155%3A309-75-1, Available here. Despite the electoral victory achieved by the SDP, it failed to win enough seats to win majority representation in both the cabinet and in the legislature; a situation that remained unaltered during Sorsa’s subsequent premierships. The lack of socialist majorities in these two bodies, however, was no obstacle to radical social reform. What helped the SDP was the fact that the Centre Party, one its main coalition partners during the Sorsa years (though not always seeing eye to eyewith the Social Democrats), had a progressive outlook on social issues, advocating not only extensions to the welfare state but also the facilitation of rented housing, further educational opportunities and the utilisation of income policies in reducing inequalities. Additionally, the Liberal People’s Party and the Swedish People’s Party (two long-established groups that would become mainstays of various cabinets led by Sorsa) were advocates of activist, socially responsible government. Thanks to the intervention of the country’s president, a broad-based coalition comprising parties of differing philosophical persuasions was formed, with Sorsa at the helm. Thus marked the beginning of an age of reform that one could call “The Sorsa Era.”Sorsa’s electoral successes can be seen in the wider context of a global trend towards socialism, in which certain developments witnessed left-wing parties enter government in several countries; many for the first time. In 1974, after Portugal’s long-established right-wing dictatorship came to a long-awaited end following a coup, the Portuguese colonies of Angola, São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau became independent states with leftists at the head of these new, free nations. In Europe, an election held in Ireland in 1973 produced a coalition formed between Fine Gael and the social-democratic Labour Party, with the latter awarded cabinet posts related to social concerns that enabled it to realise important advances in social security in subsequent years. Five years later, an election in San Marino resulted in the formation of a socialist-communist governing alliance that would lead the principality for the next 13 years. “The Sorsa Era” was therefore not unique to Finland, but a reflection of international politics at that time. Notable governmentWhat was notable about Sorsa’s longevity was the fact that his SDP, unlike its counterparts in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, had failed to establish itself as the dominant force in national politics, with most governments that led Finland following its independence from the Russian Empire in the early Twentieth Century being of a liberal or conservative orientation. This did not mean, however, that the SDP remained a political outsider. In 1926, the SDP made a breakthrough when it formed a minority administration (albeit a temporary one), and nearly a decade later formed a key part of what was known as a “Red-Earth” ministry with liberal and agrarian-oriented figures. Lasting from 1937 to 1939, it was responsible for milestones in social legislation such as the introduction of comprehensive maternity aid, better dietary requirements for seamen, and wide-reaching pension coverage. After the Second World War, the SPD often provided positions in coalition cabinets, two of the most notable being the “Popular Front” cabinets from 1946-48 and from 1966-70 (the former communist-led and the latter SDP-led) which affected major reforms in areas like education,social security, occupational safety, and workers’ rights. The SDP also governed alone, first from 1948-50 and again from 1956-57. During these periods, it presided over notable undertakings in social policy. Amongst others, these included measures to improve accident insurance and combat TB (including free treatment for poorer patients), provide care for mentally disabled people, and facilitate employment opportunities. Sorsa’s terms enabled him to build on the record of past left-wing coalitions, leaving his own imprint on domestic policy in the process.The legislative output of Sorsa’s first administration was considerable, with a broad array of reforms carried out that reflected the democratic socialist aspirations of his party. New pension benefits were introduced in cases of disablement together with farmers’ retirement and succession, while a greater number of people became entitled to financial support for housing. The innovative Day Care Act required municipalities to provide either childminders at home or day care facilities; effectively making childcare an integral part of the Finnish welfare state. Extra grants for children under the age of three were introduced, together with recompense (both monetary and in kind) in cases of wrongful arrest, detainment and criminal damage; the latter including the property in addition to the person involved. Guaranteed pay in cases of insolvency and bankruptcy was also enshrined into law, along with measures aimed at ensuring safe working conditions, while the replacement rate of supplementary private sector pensions was raised by a sizeable amount. Legislation was introduced providing for free trials and the establishment of local legal aid offices (aimed at ensuring that limited resources were not barriers to justice), together with compensation for farmers leaving their profession for a certain amount of time. Laws aimed at promoting exercise in open spaces, providing special treatment in intoxication cases, and establishing separate taxation of married partners were also passed; the latter of which helped more women to enter the workplace. Government spending also went through an expansionary phase, which rose by double-digits during Sorsa’s premiership.Sorsa’s tenure, however, was cut short by gathering financial storms not of his own doing. Finland’s economy was battered by an international oil crisis, which contributed to a decision Sorsa made to stand down as prime minister in 1975. Two years later, however, Sorsa returned to the premiership with the Finnish economy in a parlous state, which the government successfully tackled by the application of measures designed to weather the financial storm. Symbolically, the policies pursued by the SDP-led government were shaped by the “Bad Sillanpää” programme adopted by the SDP in early 1977, which committed the party to more market-friendly policies as a means of strengthening the economy. Social progressThe economic difficulties of this period, however, did not lead to social progress being neglected during Sorsa’s second term, which exhibited a similar reforming zeal to the first. Poorer pensioners became eligible for a special aid supplementwhile maternity leave was more than doubled and paid absence for fathers of newborn babies was established for the first time. An additional week of general paid leave was instituted, together with requirements of firms to not only set up health services in the workplace, but also for there to be negotiations between employers and workers or their representatives over matters that directly impacted staff, like dismissal. Laws intended to safeguard consumers and provide support services tailored to the needs of certain disabled people were also implemented.In 1978, however, the cabinet fell; precipitated by division over financial policy. Sorsa regained the post of prime minister in 1982, but his new premiership faced a premature end due to internal cabinet opposition over a planned, significant rise in defence expenditure; with one of his coalition partners, the communist Finnish National Democratic League (SKDL), opposed to such a move. Although Sorsa made the SKDL leave the coalition, it was quickly replaced by a different party. Thus Sorsa came to lead his fourth and final administration; serving what would be his longest term in office. While some regressive decisions concerning the way pension increases are calculated were made, social policy for the most part was forward-looking during Sorsa’s last term. A compensation scheme for those afflicted by healthcare-associated injury and a universal income support benefit were established, together with a home care allowance for vulnerable groups and reforms to unemployment benefits that included higher levels of payment. A law aimed at putting a stop to gender discrimination was passed, together with measures designed to guarantee the safety of consumer goods, provide adequate shelter for those living with severe disabilities and those experiencing homelessness, and ensure supportive networks for those with issues concerning alcoholism and addiction. More people were also brought into compulsory pension insurance and a shared system of parental leave was inaugurated, together with a cash allowance for parents who stayed at home in place of daycare. This particular reform, which was promoted by the Cente Party, was a bone of contention for the SDP, who would only accept it if Centre agreed to greater public assistance for childcare. 1987 electionThese accomplishments, however, did not translate into electoral success, with the SDP losing seats in a national election in 1987 and a new administration formed under the leadership of the centre-right National Coalition Party. Although the SDP maintained a degree of cabinet representation in what became known as the “red-blue” coalition, “The Sorsa Era” had finally drawn to a close.Sorsa’s departure from the premiership did not spell the end of his involvement in public life, however. He went on to serve as Governor of the Bank of Finland, and back in the Nineties became involved in talks with employers and workers in an effort to hammer out an agreement between the two groups during a time when the country experienced a severe economic recession, with the former calling for an effective reduction in labour costs that trade unionists opposed (an agreement supported by the latter was eventually made). Sorsa also sought to become his party’s candidate for an upcoming presidential race, but despite his impressive credentials there was a clamouring for change within the SDP, with over six out of ten party members voting for a rival candidate; thus sadly ending Sorsa’s aspirations to one of the highest offices in the land.Although Sorsa’s political career was at an end, the SDP has continued to play a prominent part in Finnish politics; participating in numerous cabinets to the present day. Since 2023, however, Finland has been led by a conservative ministry (which includes members of a radical right-wing party) that has pursued reactionary policies in regards to social security and asylum. Although the next election isn’t due until 2027, the SDP has consistently outperformed its rivals in countless polls for over a year, strongly suggesting a swing back to the Left if the SDP maintains its momentum. The legacy that “The Sorsa Era” left for Finland, with the many beneficial reforms and higher levels of social justice left in its wake, is one that a future SDP-led administration can use as a roadmap in leading Finland towards a brighter, fairer future. The memory of Kalevi Sorsa, who tragically passed away in 2004, should live on not only in the hearts and minds of Finnish social democrats today, but in their future actions as well. Did you find that piece interesting?

    "description": "The Tokugawa period of Japan limited foreign trade beginning in the 17th century. For example, Chinese traders were restricted to the port of Nagasaki or through indirect routes like the Ryūkū Islands. Dutch traders also became the only Europeans allowed to enter Japan. Similarly, Japanese people were not permitted to go abroad. Those who resided in another country and returned to Japan could face the death penalty. These policies lasted for over 200 years. Yet, at least one Japanese person made it to the United States and back again during this time.Michael Mirra explains. Manjiro Nakahama.Five Fishermen from JapanOn Japan’s island Shikoku, a 13-year-old boy named Manjirō lived in a village called Nakanohama (now part of the city Tosashimizu). His father had died when he was eight or nine years old. To support his mother and siblings, Manjirō got a job on a fishing expedition. The crew consisted of three brothers named Fudenojo (37), Jusuke (24), and Goemon (15), and their neighbor Toraemon (25). They set sail on January 5, 1841 in search of either bonito, mackerel, or tuna. The trip was expected to last only a few days.A storm hit the five fishermen on the second or third day. They were about twenty miles from the coast of Japan. Fighting the wind while trying to make it back to land, their sculling oarlock broke off and soon their sculling oar broke in half. Propelling the boat was no longer in their control.The boat was blown off course for three or four days and the fishermen ran out of provisions. Around January 13th, they finally spotted an island. It was the small and uninhabited Izu-Torishima (also known as “Bird Island”) a few hundred miles from the mainland. They were unable to find a beach to land the boat and decided to swim for it. Right before jumping in, a high wave overturned the boat and injured Jusuke’s leg, but all made it to land.Manjirō turned 14 years old a couple of weeks later as the crew attempted to survive on the island. Fudenojo cared for Jusuke in their cave shelter while the others searched for food. Shellfish and seaweed could be gathered. Albatross were also plentiful until their migration season began in late April or early May. However, there was no spring water or edible plants on land.  A Ship from New England On June 27th, a whaling ship appeared near the island. The John Howland had sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts and was now sending two boats to the island in search of turtles to eat. As the boats approached, its members noticed Goemon, Manjirō, and Toraemon waving their clothes attached to sticks and shouting for help. The whalers could not understand anything that the trapped fishermen were saying, but recognized that they were distressed and hungry. All five castaways were taken aboard.From there, the John Howland sailed to the north Pacific in search of whales for oil and baleens. Unlike Japanese whalers, the Americans discarded the rest of the whale. Through attempted sign language and eventually learning some English words, the rescued fisherman were able to communicate with the whalers and were given chores aboard the ship. Manjirō was assigned to the crow’s nest to look for whales in the distance. He was successful at least once and was given a seaman’s cap as a reward from the ship’s captain, William H. Whitfield.Heading east, the John Howland stopped at Oahu (then part of the independent Kingdom of Hawai’i ruled by Kamehameha III) on November 20th. It was still not known to the Americans where the fishermen were from. Whitfield brought them to a medical missionary, Dr. Gerrit P. Judd, who reasoned they were Japanese after showing them Japanese coins.Arrangements were made for the fishermen to stay in Honolulu. However, Whitfield wished to take Manjirō with him to the United States. Accepting the offer, Manjirō left Oahu on December 1st. Whitfield renamed him “John Mung” with “John” coming from the ship’s name and “Mung” being a shortened version of Manjirō. The John Howland continued to hunt for whales and stopped in Guam in March of the following year before finally heading back to Massachusetts. Life in AmericaIt was on May 6, 1843 that the John Howland reached New Bedford. Whitfield led the now 16-year-old Manjirō to his home in the neighboring town of Fairhaven. Shortly afterward, Whitfield married his second wife, Albertina. The couple had become engaged before Whitfield’s whaling voyage. Whitfield’s first wife, Ruth, had died while he was at sea a few years earlier. The wedding to Albertina, however, was held at the home of Whitfield’s uncle in New York. He left Manjirō in the care of a friend named Eben Aiken until he returned. A teacher named Jane Allen also began tutoring Manjirō to prepare him for the upcoming school year.Upon returning from the wedding, Whitfield bought a farm in the Sconticut Neck part of Fairhaven. Living there gave Manjirō the opportunity to learn how to ride a horse. Manjirō was then enrolled in the nearby Bartlett School where he studied math, navigation, and surveying. He went on to apprentice as a cooper–crafting and repairing barrels and casks–in New Bedford.New Bedford was generally viewed as a place of acceptance partly because its people lived and worked with the inclusive whaling industry. It was also seen as a safe-haven for freed and escaped slaves–notably Frederick Douglass. Unfortunately, this sentiment was not always extended. Members of a Congregational church disapproved of Manjirō sitting in the Whitfield family pew. The Whitfields responded by joining a more accepting Unitarian church. Coincidentally, one of the Unitarian church’s members was Warren Delano Jr. who later spoke about Manjirō to his grandson, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Journey Home After he had turned 19 years old, Manjirō was asked to join a whaling ship by Ira Davis who had been the harpooner on the John Howland and was now the captain of the Franklin. On May 16, 1846, they took an eastern route to the Pacific via the Cape of Good Hope to avoid impacts of the Mexican-American War on the Cape Horn route.Almost a year later, in March of 1847, the Franklin stopped in Guam. It was there that Manjirō wrote to Whitfield about the ship’s plans to sail to the Ryūkyū Islands, which were not yet annexed by Japan but an independent vassal state. He expressed hope at opening a whaling port there. The Franklin arrived in May and Manjirō acted as an interpreter. However, he was unable to understand their dialect and returned to the ship.In October of 1848, the Franklin stopped in Honolulu and Manjirō was reunited with the castaway fishermen. Fudenojo had changed his name to Denzo to make it easier for the locals to pronounce. He and Goemon had recently come back from an unsuccessful attempt at returning to Japan. Toraemon was working as a carpenter. Sadly, Jusuke had died five years earlier.The Franklin arrived back in New Bedford on September 23, 1849. The three year plus trip had earned Manjirō $350. At this time, news of gold in California reached him. There was no doubt that Manjirō missed his mother. If he made enough money in the gold industry then he could afford to take a passenger ship to the Pacific and maybe find his way back to Japan. Two months later, he took a job on the Stieglitz, which was carrying lumber to San Francisco.Arriving in the spring of 1850, Majiro began looking for gold near Sacramento. He earned $600 in about seventy days. Heading back to San Francisco, he booked a passenger ticket to Honolulu on the Eliza Warwick, which left on September 17th.Manjirō met with his old friends in Honolulu. Denzo and Goemon agreed to go with him back to Japan. Toraemon, however, wished to stay in Honolulu since he was successful as a carpenter and had married a local woman. The next step was to purchase a small boat. A friend of Whitfield’s named Reverend C. Damon spread the story of the three fishermen hoping to return home and asked for donations. With his help, the fishermen bought a boat that they named the Adventurer. Now the fishermen had to get the Adventurer close to Japan. To do this, they brought their small boat onto the Sarah Boyd, which was headed for China on December 17, 1850. As the Sarah Boyd passed the Ryūkyū Islands on its way to China, the three fishermen lowered the Adventurer into the water. They rowed home on February 2, 1851.The Adventurer landed on Okinawa, which was controlled by the daimyō of the Satsuma Province on Kyūshū. The three fishermen were soon taken by Satsuma officials to the city of Naha for interrogation. In the meantime, they were put under house arrest. After this period of interrogation, the fishermen were moved from Okinawa to Kyūshū–in the city of Kagoshima and then Nagasaki–to be interrogated by Tokugawa officials. They were finally set free in June of 1852 and made it to their respective homes in October.Manjirō found his mother still alive. Although, she had long thought he had died. Their reunion lasted for three days, for Manjirō was called to the city of Kochi to teach English to samurai among others.  Japan-United States RelationsThe following year, the American Commodore Matthew C. Perry arrived at the harbor of Uraga with four warships. He was carrying a letter from President Millard Fillmore that demanded Japan open its ports to the outside world. The shogunate ordered Manjirō to Edo (Uraga is located at the entrance of Edo Bay–now Tokyo Bay) to provide information on the United States. In response to his service, Manjirō was given samurai status at the end of the year. He then adopted a surname, Nakahama, after his home village. Japan signed the Treaty of Kanagawa with the United States on March 31, 1854 putting an end to its isolation.Manjirō put his English language knowledge to other uses. In 1857, he translated Nathaniel Bowditch’s The New American Practical Navigator into Japanese. He also authored the first English text to be published in Japan, A Shortcut To Anglo-American Conversation, in 1859. Around this time, he taught English to future leading dramatist Fukuchi Gen’ichirō.1859 saw a story similar to Manjirō, but with the roles reversed. An American named John Mercer Brooke was commanding a surveying expedition in the Pacific aboard the Fenimore Cooper. This time it was the Americans that were shipwrecked as a typhoon destroyed the ship off the coast of Yokohama. Japan happened to be looking for an experienced navigator to help bring an embassy to San Francisco on its way to Washington, D.C. Brooke accepted the job at Japan’s request. He chose nine American crew members and the draftsman Edward Meyer Kern from the Fenimore Cooper to join him.Brooke boarded the Kanrin-maru, a Dutch ship that had been purchased by Japan two years earlier for approximately $70,000. It escorted an American warship, the Powhatan, that carried the embassy. The Kanrin-maru, however, carried a samurai “Magistrate of Warships” named Kimura Toshitake. Should something happen to the Powhatan, it would be Kimura’s responsibility to represent Japan in Washington. The translator on the Kanrin-maru was Manjirō.Apart from Manjirō, none of the Japanese crew members had been on a sea voyage before. The ship faced a storm right after leaving Yokohama. Together, Brooke and Manjirō taught the inexperienced crew how to manage their vessel. The ship’s captain, another samurai named Katsu Rinatarō, soon became ill from seasickness and delegated the running of the ship. Despite these trials, both ships made it to San Francisco safely on March 17, 1860.Japan treated this voyage as a test of their naval capabilities. Katsu would go on to become the chief architect of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which was formally created in 1869. A Return to WhalingJapanese whaling soon evolved in two ways. First, whalers searched for new shore stations. This indirectly aided colonial expansion, so the government offered financial backing to whalers. Second, foreign whaling techniques were incorporated, which eventually influenced modern Japanese whaling. These two evolutions intertwined around Korea where Japan competed with Russia and where fin whales were so fast that they could only be caught by Norwegian whaling technology.The city of Hakodate welcomed foreign whaling ships into its harbor so the Japanese could observe their techniques. Around 1862, Manjirō started an American-style whaling operation out of Hakodate. He went on to help the government bring whaling to the Ogasawara Islands (known as the Bonin Islands to the British). He had previously visited the islands on a whaling expedition after the government grew concerned that American, European, and Hawaiian colonizers–who had encroached on the territory in 1830–were getting more use from the whales than Japan. This expedition was ultimately shortened by a typhoon. Manjirō returned in 1863 for more whaling. However, Japan abandoned its plans for a few years due to expenses and pressure from foreign powers. Manjirō was sent on another diplomatic mission that stopped in the United States and Europe in 1870. While docked in New York City, Manjirō took a train to Massachusetts where he visited Whitfield. His American homes, both Fairhaven and New Bedford, became sister cities with his native home, Tosashimizu, in 1987.On a final note, a 21-year-old Herman Melville left New Bedford on the whaling ship Acushnet two days before Manjirō went fishing in 1841. This trip was the genesis for his novel Moby-Dick in which he wrote, “If that double-bolted land, Japan, is even to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.” Moby-Dick was published the same year that Manjirō returned to Japan. Did you find that piece interesting?

    "description": "What's the role of government in society? What do we mean when we talk about individual responsibility? What makes us free? 'Neoliberalism' might feel like a squishy term that's hard to define and understand. But this ideology, founded by a group of men in the Swiss Alps, is a political project that has dominated our economic system for decades. In the name of free market fundamentals, the forces behind neoliberalism act like an invisible hand, shaping almost every aspect of our lives.
