    "description": "As the conclusion of World War II approaches its 80th anniversary, the memories of this historic event are at risk of fading into darkness. As the number of surviving veterans from the war diminishes, the responsibility of preserving their history falls to the next generations.Here, Dallas Dores considers this in the context of film depictions of World War II. John Wayne in the 1962 World War II film The Longest Day.Historians the world over work diligently to protect the legacies of World War II from being forgotten, but they are not the only ones. Entertainment media such as film and television production has also sought to preserve the memory of World War II through a more visual process. Movies and television series in America have captured the attention of younger generations who could not otherwise have ‘experienced’ the events of World War II. While these films and series may serve as a means of preserving the historical legacy of World War II, they are not a reliable source of historical accuracy. Movies and television shows, no matter how educational they may attempt to be, are designed for entertainment. As such, these modern depictions of World War II will often substitute much of their historical accuracy for attention catching action or even ulterior agendas, such as national patriotism. Such depictions can even fall on the wrong side of the fine line between fact and fiction for the sake of public reception. This favoritism of entertainment over education has dangerous consequences for the modern day public memory of World War II. As such films and series become increasingly popular, much of the American public, unfamiliar or otherwise disconnected with the generation of the 1940’s, is at risk of accepting these false film narratives of the war as facts, leading to a fictionalized, homogenized interpretation of World War II. MotivationsThe greater acceptance of film interpretation over historical research of the war traces back to the growing popularity of such films. It is no secret that war films, particularly World War II films, have a large and enthusiastic audience in the 21st century, especially in the United States. The modern day film is able to engage with the viewer and bring them subconsciously into the action being depicted in typically more powerful ways than the average textbook. As Anton Kaes discusses in his article History and Film, historical films are able to play with certain aspects of the story being told and translate it in a present tense, giving the viewer a stronger connection with the events unfolding before them. This ability to reshape history, however, is where the primary concern with such historical films begins. Although a film may be more ‘engaging’ than a basic textbook, the historical accuracy of a film is at far greater risk of corruption. As Richard Godfrey observes in his work Visual Consumption, historical films in the US, particularly those concerned with World War II, are rarely without ulterior motives. Many of these films strive to affirm a desired national identity, one that invokes a militaristic patriotism, by elevating the role of the United States above its more accurate standing, while simultaneously minimizing the more negative aspects of the past. Historical films concerning the war, particularly from the American perspective, oftentimes seek to create their own interpretations of the war rather than present the original story, with all its flaws and mistakes. This is also done with the theory that American audiences do not want to see the negatives of their nation’s past, only the positives. As Barry Schwartz puts it in his article Memory as a Cultural System, “We cannot be oriented by a past in which we fail to see ourselves”. This logic plays a critical role in the development of the historical film narrative. If a filmmaker wants their viewer to identify with the main character of their movie, they remove as many flaws associated with that character as possible, or at the very least give the character a sense of redemption for past mistakes. Thus begins the creation of the distorted memory. As films gain greater attention over books, the average viewer begins to accept what is depicted on the screen as fact. Although there are films that clearly represent fiction, others leave the viewer questioning reality vs imagination. Semi-authentic storiesWith entertainment taking priority over education, these films oftentimes take liberties in their unique interpretations of historical events. This can take both a simple form such as a semi-authentic story based on true events, or a more extreme form where the film becomes more fictional than historical. The Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds is a prime example of the latter. The film’s director himself made it clear that this film is a work of fiction, with the events and characters therein being created out of pure imagination. A film such as this would not be looked to for historical accuracy or information. On the opposite side of the coin is Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan, arguably one of the most historically accurate World War II films. The film has been hailed as one of the most authentic depictions of the American soldier’s experience in World War II put into film. This authentic feel contributed to the film’s popularity, and as Lester Friedman discusses in Citizen Spielberg (University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Chicago), it is also the cause of the film's memory distortion. The popularity of the film carried over far beyond simple entertainment, as viewers of the film began to confuse the event of the movie with real life. A number of accounts from the Omaha Beach memorial in France tell of tourists needing to be told that there is no grave for Captain John Miller, the fictional main character of the film. Although there were incidents during World War II where multiple brothers served and died in the war, the story of Private James Ryan is fictional. Even though the film is a work of fiction, it is viewed by many as fact. As John Whiteclay Chambers explains, “the public memory of war…has been created less from a remembered past than from a manufactured past”. As the collective memory of World War II becomes shaped by film rather than account, it is also distorted and altered in a way that does not clearly distinguish fact from fiction.  WomenNot only is the film narrative of World War II inaccurate, it is also incomplete. The stereotypical World War II film in America, which in turn is connected with the stereotypical American narrative of the war, features stoic, Caucasian male soldiers on the frontlines of battle. This image contributes to many of the national identities filmmakers and studios attempt to emphasize in such films. However, in elevating certain images and narratives, others are either diminished or even left out. The story of American women is rarely depicted in World War II films, and when it is, as Victoria Tutino examines, it does not tell the entire story. Tutino agrees that “Society needs these films in order to understand the context of the wartime era”, however, she warns that “society must be wary as this medium only explores one side of women’s multi-dimensional roles”. The role of American women during the war is often limited in its film depiction, either to that of a field nurse or a patriotic homefront worker. The life and times of Rossie the Riveterby Connie Field attempts to overcome this underrepresentation by revealing the untold story of women workers. In creating this film, Fields collected the accounts of 700 American women who worked during the war and presented five main speakers on screen, two Caucasian and three African American, all from different backgrounds. The purpose of Field’s work was to challenge the notion that American women joined the workforce solely out of patriotism, as depicted in many films, and reveal their true desires for economic gain in a male driven workplace. Although this film attempts to fill in the incomplete narrative of women’s role during the war, it still falls into the same trap of trying to convince the audience that this is the complete story. While 700 individual accounts is certainly a substantial source of information, it is only a small portion of the larger image of millions of women who entered the working and military forces, all from different backgrounds and for different purposes. While attempting to correct the shortcomings of many films, The life and times of Rossie the Riveter falls into the same trench of trying to create its own narrative. African American soldiersJust as with women in World War II, the legacy of African American soldiers is severely underrepresented in film history. Just as with women, countless African Americans served in the US military during the war and fought for their nation. While this piece of history is remembered in text, it is all but forgotten in film, with the overwhelming majority of American World War II films focusing primarily, if not entirely on the more commonly seen Caucasian soldier. This once again falls under the umbrella of a national identity, one that chooses to overlook past mistakes rather than accept them. Though some films have in recent years attempted to shed a stronger light on the African American soldier, they should not be taken without caution. Just as with the narrative of women, Clement Alexander Pricequestions if “moving images of black soldiers enhance an understanding of the black experience in war, or do they, like so many written documents, reflect a circumscribed view”. The film can only encompass so much of history accurately before it becomes infected by the imagined narrative. In 2008, director Spike Lee released Miracle at St. Anna  (Touchstone Pictures, 2008), a film which he had hoped would draw some much needed attention to the experiences of African Americans during the war. The film addressed racial situations that many African Americans faced on the homefront, presenting a subject matter which other similar films typically shy away from. However, the film’s realism does not last and the all too common element of fiction distorts the narrative. Near the end of the film, a scene takes place in which a commanding German Officer takes pity on one of the main African American characters, handing him a pistol and offering words of encouragement to him in English. A situation such as this, in which a ranking officer of the Nazi military would not only spare but arm an enemy soldier, let alone one of non-Caucasian descent, is completely inconceivable from a historical standpoint. As such, the audience is left questioning whether or not the film’s context should be taken literally or metaphorically, as fact or fiction. This creates a paradox in which accepting the film as fact leads to the belief of false narratives, but interpreting the film as fiction distorts the true realities as exaggerations. In either case, the film’s credibility as a reliable source of historical memory is tarnished.  ConclusionAs World War II continues to be the subject of modern popular culture, the memory of its past becomes further entangled in a web of distortion. The use of film and television as a source for memory is increasing, and as such its factual evidence is replaced by imagined narrative. As the generation of the 1940’s rapidly diminishes, their memories are left in the hands of those who use and warp it for ulterior purposes. The desire to promote a national agenda over less-than-comfortable details creates an altered narrative of the past, one that magnifies only small portions of the war and replaces the rest with imagination. As filmmakers take their own liberties in substituting certain aspects of history with more media-adjacent interpretations, the public memory of these events is changed and distorted into an imagined fiction. These films place entertainment over education, leaving viewers wondering how these films should be interpreted and oftentimes fail to discern between fact and fiction. Furthermore, as the presented narratives of films are accepted, the excluded facts are forgotten. The true experiences of individuals such as women and African Americans are more often than not either misinterpreted and altered or completely left out of the greater image, leaving these aspects of the past to be lost in history. The use of film over text as historical reference is a dangerous path, one that homogenizes the public memory into a synthetic image so detached from reality that the true memory of the past is all but erased.   ReferencesLester Friedman, Citizen Spielberg, (University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Chicago)Richard Godfrey, Simon Lilley, Visual consumption, collective memory and the representation of war, (Consumption Markets \u0026 Culture, Taylor and Francis Online, 2009), Visual consumption, collective memory and the representation of war: Consumption Markets \u0026 Culture: Vol 12 , No 4 - Get Access (tandfonline.com)Anton Kaes, History and Film: Public Memory in the Age of Electronic Dissemination, (History and Memory 2, no. 1, 1990), History and Film: Public Memory in the Age of Electronic Dissemination on JSTOR (asu.edu)Spike Lee, Miracle at St. Anna, (Walt Disney Studios, 2008).Barry Schwartz, “Memory as a Cultural System: Abraham Lincoln in World War II.”, (American Sociological Review, 1996) Memory as a Cultural System: Abraham Lincoln in World War II on JSTOR (asu.edu)Steven Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan, (Dreamworks Pictures, 1998).Victoria Tutino, Stay at Home, Soldiers: An Analysis of British and American Women on the Homefront during World War II and the Effects on Their Memory Through Film, (Of Life and History, College of the Holy Cross, 2019), Stay at Home, Soldiers John Whiteclay Chambers, David Culbert, World War II, Film, and History, (Oxford University Press, 1996), ProQuest Ebook Central - Reader (asu.edu)",

    "link": "http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2025/3/27/americas-path-to-polarization-a-short-history",
    "description": "Most Americans are disgusted by politics. Asked in 2023 for one word to describe politics, they responded, “divisive,” “corrupt,” “polarized.” For many, polarization is the root of the problem. Writers lament polarization’s dysfunctional consequences, and a national organization devoted to bridging the partisan divide is flourishing.Yet the 2024 election only deepened polarization. Despite a divisive, topsy turvy campaign, the polls changed little throughout 2024, and the results were within the margin of error. Most voters were locked in, and few changed their minds.Many assume that our current predicament goes back to the 1960s. After all, the ‘60s was decade of dissent and division. It generated bitter conflict over foreign policy, race, women’s rights, sexuality, and a host of highly charged moral issues that would dominate American politics for the next half century.Author Don Nieman’s recent book The Path to Paralysis: How American Politics Became Nasty, Dysfunctional, and a Threat to the Republic, challenges that assumption. Partisanship may be endemic, but polarization is a recent development. Jefferson attacked as an Infidel, available here. How Partisanship and Polarization DifferThere is a big difference between partisan conflict and polarization. American politics has always been contentious. That’s the nature of democratic politics in a country as big, diverse, and dynamic as the U.S. A positive vision may inspire, but negative campaigning and appeals to fear mobilize voters. Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless Jacobin. Andrew Jackson’s managers alleged that John Quincy Adams had served as a pimp for the Russian Czar. LBJ suggested that Goldwater would unleash nuclear war. George H.W. Bush used Willie Horton to appeal to White fear of Black men.However, there is much more to polarized politics than bitter partisanship and negative campaigning. Politics become polarized when support for the two major parties is  closely divided and upwards of 90% of voters have decided which side they support. When voters get their news from sources that reinforce their prejudices and can’t agree on basic facts.  When wild, baseless conspiracy theories become widely accepted and fear and loathing of the oppositionmotivates voters more than support for their party’s position on the issues. When politicians favor political theater that thrills their base over making the compromises necessary to govern.In 1968, the U.S. was bitterly divided over race and the Vietnam War. Richard Nixon and George Wallace waged divisive presidential campaigns that appealed to fear and promised law and order. It was the opening salvo in a succession of culture wars that would define American politics for the next half century and counting.Yet the country wasn’t polarized. Ticket-splitting was common. States routinely sent Democrats to the U.S. Senate while casting their electoral votes for Republican presidential candidates. And vice versa. Most states were in play in presidential elections and swung back and forth between red and blue control. Some Republicans were moderate and some Democrats conservative. Politicians knew they had to reach the middle, valued compromise, and got things done.Richard Nixon used racially coded language to appeal to White Southerners, but he became the architect of affirmative action.Ronald Reagan was the face of conservative resurgence, but he cut a deal with Democrats to raise taxes, reduce deficits, and save Social Security (a program he hated). President Ronald Reagan with Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neil.George H.W. Bush worked with Democrats to strengthen environmental regulations. He incorporated cap-and-trade policies championed by Democratic senator Al Gore into the Clean Air Act of 1991. He also recognized the threat of climate change and signed the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change—the precursor to the Kyoto, Copenhagen, and Paris Climate Agreements.After surviving scurrilous attacks from the right, Bill Clinton joined his nemesis Newt Gingrich to forge a grand compromise on Social Security that was only derailed by Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment.  George W. Bush worked closely with Senator Ted Kennedy to pass sweeping education reform that combined the accountability Republicans demanded with a massive infusion of federal support for schools that served poor children. The Tipping PointPartisanship hardened into polarization following Barack Obama’s election in 2008, when seven long-developing trends converged in a perfect storm. US President Barack Obama taking his Oath of Office. First, massive changes that transformed the media began in the 1980s. Cable TV and talk radio, then the internet and social media ensured that more and more Americans got their news from sources that confirmed their biases. News outlets proliferated. Many were fact free, spreading lies and wild conspiracies. Debates became hotter because Americans couldn’t agree on basic facts much less the best solutions to problems.Second, the transition from an industrial to a service economy, coupled with trickle-down economic policy, led to a sharp increase in income inequality. After 1980, the top 10% did very well, the top 1% better, and the top .1% enjoyed wealth that put the Robber Barons to shame. But middle and working-class Americans struggled. That left many angry, alienated, and suspicious. The 2008 recession and the bank bailouts that followed stoked their anger.Third, the Republican Party became more conservative as it made big gains in the South in the mid-1990s and after. By 2008, well over half of Republicans in the House and Senate came from the South—long the most conservative region of the U.S. The Democratic Party shifted modestly leftward while the GOP took a hard right turn. With moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats endangered species, those most inclined to compromise were missing in action.Fourth, beginning in the late 1960s, immigration surged. By 2020, immigrants constituted 15% of the population, a proportion not seen since the 1910s. Approximately 11 million had entered the country illegally. Many White Americans worried that they were losing their country. The election of a Black president in 2008 reinforced that fear. In 2011, polling revealed that a majority of Republicans believed the baseless birther conspiracy that alleged that Obama hadn’t been born in the U.S. (and therefore wasn’t qualified to serve). It was a sure sign of growing anger, alienation, distrust, and willingness to believe the worst about the enemy.Fifth, the Great Recession of 2008 damaged the Republican brand, and Obama’s convincing victory rattled Republican leaders. They feared a political realignment that would make Democrats the dominant party for a generation. They decided to dig in, oppose everything Obama proposed, refuse to compromise, create gridlock, and make the Democrats look ineffective.Sixth, gerrymandering created safe congressional districts. By the early 2000s, few seats in the House were competitive. Republican incumbents had more to fear from the right flank of their own party than from Democrats. Moving toward the center to compromise with Democrats was unnecessary to sway undecided voters in the general election, and it might invite a conservative challenge in primaries.Finally, and fatally, the GOP embraced populism. The party that had traditionally appealed to fiscal conservatives, the college educated, and the country club set found that by appealing to discontented rural and working-class Whites without a college education they won new recruits. Sarah Palin offered a glimpse of the power of populism in 2008, and the Tea Party Revolt of 2010 confirmed that it worked as Republicans re-took the House. Populism brought new recruits to the party. Many were angry, hostile to establishment politicians they believed had sold them out, and got their news from outlets that traded in conspiracy theories. They didn’t want civil debate or politicians who compromised. They wanted leaders who would fight. Plenty of politicians—including many with Ivy League credentials—eagerly obliged.After the 2010 mid-term elections, politics were polarized. Government regularly faced shutdowns and even default. What little the federal government accomplished was done through executive order.Mainstream Republicans led by alumni of the George W. Bush administration sought to pull the party back after Mitt Romney’s loss in 2012. They produced a major report—the Growth and Opportunity Project—that insisted the party broaden its appeal to the young, people of color, and immigrants. It demanded a return to the center.That didn’t happen. Donald Trump understood how the Republican Party and American politics had changed. Appeals to moderates and undecided voters had become less important in a polarized polity. There were too few of them. Mobilizing his base with a polarizing, populist campaign full of invective, exaggeration, lies, and racist and sexist language worked. It disgusted many Republicans, but Trump’s success and threats of retribution by his base against those who bucked him brought them aroundTrump captured the Republican nomination, won the White House in 2016, and ultimately made the Republican Party his own. Even after two impeachments, unsteady leadership during a global pandemic, incitement of an attempted coup on January 6, 2021, and conviction of a felony, Trump’s base never wavered. They supported him as he waltzed to the Republican nomination and won re-election on November 5, 2024.  Where Do We Go from Here?Since 2016, the U.S. has experienced three presidential and two mid-term elections. The margins of victory have been tight, and power in Washington has shifted between the two major parties. The result has been wild swings in policy exemplified by withdrawing, then re-entering, and once again withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. Congress is gridlocked, and executive orders have taken the place of legislation to address critical issues. American politics remains polarized, to the disgust of most voters, even as they refuse to budge from their commitment to one side of the great divide.Those hoping for a way out of divisiveness and gridlock might look to history. From the 1840s to the early 1860s, conflict over slavery created bitter animosity and stalemate that led to civil war. The war ended slavery and realigned American politics, producing two decades of Republican hegemony. The end of Reconstruction, industrialization, and the agrarian crisis of the 1880s and 1890s once again left the two major parties closely divided with control in Washington shifting frequently. Political conflict was bitter and gridlock the order of the day. The election of 1896 broke the logjam and ushered in over 30 years of Republican dominance. Only a fool would predict how or when or current impasse might end. If history is our guide, the most likely scenario is a crisis that scrambles political loyalties and permits one of the parties to achieve dominance. We can only hope that it’s more like the crisis of the 1890s than the cataclysm of the 1850s. Author Don Nieman’s recent book is The Path to Paralysis: How American Politics Became Nasty, Dysfunctional, and a Threat to the Republic.
