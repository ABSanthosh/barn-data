    "description": "As the thunder of cannon fire echoed across the Black Sea, shattering the illusion of stability in 19th-century Europe, the Crimean War developed into more than a mere clash of empires, it was a crucible of change, where outdated military doctrines met the brutal efficiency of modern warfare. Nations entered the conflict seeking power, prestige, or survival, but few emerged unchanged.Terry Bailey explains.Read part 1 in the series here. Tsar Nicholas I of Russia in the 1850s. By Georg von Bothmann.From the battle-scarred plains of Crimea to the diplomatic chambers of Europe, the war reshaped alliances, exposed weaknesses, and accelerated transformations that would define the century to come. This was no ordinary war; it was a turning point in history.In this second instalment of the series, the profiles of the combatant nations, their leaders, and the forces that shaped this conflict will be reviewed. This clash of titans brought Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire, and the Kingdom of Sardinia into a coalition against the might of Imperial Russia, each contributing distinct strengths, weaknesses, and strategies to the war. Britain: An Empire at the CrossroadsAs Britain waged war in the mid-19th century, it stood at a turning point between its imperial past and the demands of modern conflict. At the helm of British forces was Lord Raglan, a seasoned veteran of the Napoleonic Wars.Though his experience was undeniable, his leadership was marked by outdated tactics, a reluctance to adapt, and infamous miscommunication, most notably, the disastrous Charge of the Light Brigade. His reliance on traditional methods underscored the growing pains of an army struggling to transition into a new era of warfare.Britain's military prowess rested on its powerful navy, which dominated the Black Sea and secured critical supply lines. Its infantry, battle-hardened by colonial campaigns, maintained discipline and skill on the battlefield. However, these advantages were offset by significant weaknesses.Outdated tactics, poor logistical planning, and an over-reliance on aristocratic leadership created inefficiencies that often clashed with the harsh realities of war.Strategically, Britain sought to curb Russian expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean, safeguarding its influence and protecting vital trade routes to India. However, the war exposed severe shortcomings in military organization, particularly in supply chains and medical care.The horrific conditions endured by British soldiers in field hospitals prompted Florence Nightingale's revolutionary work in battlefield nursing, highlighting the urgent need for reform. The conflict ultimately forced Britain to reevaluate its military approach, paving the way for modernization in the years to come. France: Revitalized under Napoleon IIINapoleon III, the Emperor of France, was a shrewd statesman determined to restore his nation's prestige on the world stage. Balancing diplomacy with military modernization, he played a crucial role in shaping the coalition against Russia. His support for the Ottoman Empire was not merely strategic, it was part of a broader vision to curb Russian influence while reinforcing France's status as a dominant European power.Under Napoleon III's leadership, the French military emerged as a formidable force. Recent combat experience in Algeria had refined their tactics, and their superior artillery, particularly rifled cannons, giving them a significant edge over their adversaries. However, internal political divisions occasionally weakened their cohesion, and coordination with allies was not always seamless.Despite these challenges, French forces played a decisive role in key battles of the Crimean War. Nowhere was their impact more evident than at the Battle of Malakoff, where their innovative siege tactics shattered Russian defenses. Through victories like these, Napoleon III's vision of France as Europe's arbiter became a reality, securing its place at the heart of 19th-century geopolitics. The Ottoman Empire: Defending the Sick Man of EuropeThe mid-19th century saw the Ottoman Empire, long derided as the \"Sick Man of Europe,\" fighting for its very survival. Beset by internal strife and external threats, the empire found itself locked in a desperate struggle against Russian expansion.Leading the charge in its defense was Omar Pasha, a Serbian-born military leader whose tactical brilliance helped revitalize Ottoman forces. By skillfully blending traditional strengths with modern military techniques, he played a pivotal role in resisting Russian advances during the early stages of the war.Despite facing considerable challenges, the Ottomans proved to be formidable opponents. Their forces, though underfunded and technologically outdated compared to the European powers, demonstrated resilience in battle. Well-acquainted with the harsh and unforgiving terrain, they made effective use of fortified positions and defensive strategies to hold their ground.Yet, the empire's military shortcomings were undeniable. Financial constraints and internal instability weakened their war effort, forcing them to rely heavily on foreign allies for support.For the Ottomans, this war was more than just another conflict, it was an existential fight to maintain sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression. Against the odds, they stood firm, proving themselves as crucial partners in the broader coalition. In the end, their resistance not only delayed Russian ambitions but also underscored the enduring strength of an empire that many had already written off as doomed. Russia: The Bear on the defensiveIn the mid-19th century, the Russian Empire was embroiled in the Crimean conflict exposing its deep-seated military and logistical weaknesses. Under the rule of Tsar Nicholas I, Russia was an autocratic powerhouse, its policies driven by a commitment to Orthodox Christianity and territorial expansion. However, Nicholas miscalculated the resolve of European powers, particularly Britain and France, who united against him.This misstep proved disastrous, dragging Russia into a war for which it was woefully unprepared. When Nicholas died in 1855, his successor, Alexander II, inherited not just a war, but an empire in urgent need of reform.Russia's military was vast, boasting one of the largest standing armies in the world. It had an abundance of manpower, reinforced by the formidable Cossack cavalry, whose skill in open terrain made them invaluable on the steppes.Yet, these strengths masked critical flaws. The majority of Russian soldiers were poorly trained conscripts equipped with outdated weaponry, a stark contrast to the well-armed and organized forces of their Western adversaries.Furthermore, Russia's infrastructure was severely lacking. The empire's logistical networks struggled to support large-scale operations, particularly in Crimea, where inadequate supply lines hampered its war effort. Russia's strategic reliance on fortifications, especially at Sevastopol, showcased both its strengths and vulnerabilities.While the city's defenses held out for nearly a year against relentless Anglo-French bombardment, the war exposed Russia's inability to adapt to modern warfare. Superior Western artillery, naval power, and battlefield tactics overwhelmed Russian positions, forcing a painful reckoning. The Crimean War laid bare the empire's systemic weaknesses, compelling Alexander II to embark on sweeping military and social reforms, these reforms would shape Russia's trajectory for decades to come. The Kingdom of Sardinia: A small but strategic playerAmid the great powers of Europe, the Kingdom of Sardinia, often referred to as Sardinia-Piedmont was a relatively minor force. Yet, under the leadership of Victor Emmanuel II and his astute Prime Minister Count Camillo di Cavour, this small state played a shrewd diplomatic game.In 1855, Sardinia joined the Crimean War, not out of direct strategic necessity, but as a calculated move to gain favor with France and Britain, an alliance that would prove crucial in the pursuit of Italian unification.Despite its modest military size, Sardinia's army was well-trained and disciplined. More importantly, the state's leadership understood that battlefield victories were not the only path to success. Cavour used Sardinia's involvement in the war as a means to secure a voice in European politics, positioning the kingdom as a committed and capable player in continental affairs.However, Sardinia's resources were limited, and its direct impact on major battles remained minimal. Nonetheless, the kingdom's participation paid off. By taking part in the postwar peace negotiations, Sardinia earned diplomatic recognition that would later prove instrumental in the Risorgimento, the movement for Italian unification.Though small in military might, Sardinia's strategic engagement in the Crimean War helped pave the way for its ambitious transformation from a regional power into a key architect of a united Italy. Comparative Analysis: Strategies, technologies and logisticsThe Crimean War bridged the gap between traditional warfare and the advent of modern combat techniques. It was a conflict where outdated doctrines met emerging technologies, and where logistics played as crucial a role as battlefield tactics.The war involved the major European powers, (Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire), and Sardinia against one of the largest standing armies in the world at the time, (Russia), each bringing its own strengths, weaknesses, and strategic approaches to the theatre of war. Technological AdvancesOne of the most striking aspects of the Crimean War was the technological divide among its participants. Britain and France led the way in military modernization, equipping their forces with rifled firearms that boasted superior range and accuracy compared to older smoothbore muskets. They also capitalized on steam-powered ships, which allowed for greater mobility and effectiveness in naval operations.Russia, in contrast, lagged behind its Western adversaries. Its army still relied heavily on smoothbore muskets, which were significantly less effective in combat. Similarly, its navy depended on wooden sailing ships, a stark contrast to the steam-powered vessels of the British and French fleets. This technological disparity had dire consequences for Russian forces, who found themselves outgunned and outmaneuvered on both land and sea. Logistical challengesLogistics played a defining role in the success and failure of the various armies involved. The British forces suffered from severe supply shortages, exacerbated by poor administration and mismanagement. The harsh Crimean winter further compounded these difficulties, leading to widespread disease and deprivation among British troops. These failings underscored the necessity for improved military logistics, prompting future reforms in army supply chains and medical services.In contrast, the French military demonstrated superior organization in provisioning their troops. Their well-coordinated supply lines ensured that soldiers remained adequately equipped and fed throughout the campaign.Whereas, the Ottoman Empire, while a crucial participant in the war, struggled with logistics and relied heavily on British and French support to maintain its forces in the field. Naval dominanceNaval power played a decisive role in shaping the strategic landscape of the war. The British and French navies, with their technologically advanced fleets, dominated the Black Sea, allowing them to impose blockades and launch amphibious operations with relative ease. Their control of the seas enabled them to disrupt Russian supply lines and exert constant pressure on enemy forces.Russia's naval position was significantly weaker. Faced with overwhelming naval superiority from the Anglo-French alliance, Russian commanders resorted to desperate measures, including the scuttling of their fleet at Sevastopol to prevent its capture. This move underscored the dire state of Russia's naval capabilities and the broader challenges it faced in contending with Western military advancements. A quick breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of each forceEach participant in the Crimean War brought a unique set of strengths and weaknesses to the battlefield:·       Britain:- possessed a formidable navy, yet its land forces suffered from poor administration and logistical failures.·       France:- combined military innovation with efficient supply lines, though its political situation remained fragile throughout the war.·       The Ottoman Empire:- proved to be resilient in its defense but was technologically inferior to its European allies and adversaries.·       Russia:- wielded an enormous manpower advantage, but its forces were burdened by outdated weaponry and severe logistical constraints.·       Sardinia:- though a relatively minor military player, leveraged its involvement in the war for diplomatic and political gains, aligning itself with the victors. In conclusion, the Crimean War was far more than a regional conflict, it was a transformative event that reshaped the military, political, and diplomatic landscapes of Europe. It exposed the vulnerabilities of established powers, accelerated the modernization of warfare, and foreshadowed the shifting balance of influence on the continent.The war's conclusion did not result in a decisive territorial conquest but rather a strategic recalibration among Europe's great powers, with lasting consequences for each participant.For Britain, the war was a wake-up call, revealing significant flaws in its military organization, logistical capabilities, and leadership structure. The failures witnessed in Crimea led to crucial military reforms, particularly in medical care, with Florence Nightingale's pioneering efforts marking the beginning of modern battlefield medicine.Britain also reassessed its role in European conflicts, gradually adopting a more cautious approach to continental affairs while focusing on global imperial expansion.France, under Napoleon III, emerged from the war with enhanced prestige, having played a decisive role in securing victory. The war reinforced France's military modernization efforts, bolstered its geopolitical influence, and strengthened its alliance with Britain.However, the triumph was short-lived, Napoleon III's ambitions for continued European dominance would ultimately contribute to France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871).The Ottoman Empire, long considered a declining power, proved that it could still mount a formidable defense. However, its dependence on European allies highlighted its strategic vulnerability. While the war delayed Russian expansion into Ottoman territories, it did little to resolve the empire's deeper structural weaknesses.The eventual decline of Ottoman power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was, in many ways, foreshadowed by the Crimean War's revelations of internal instability and military shortcomings.For Russia, the war was a humbling experience that exposed the limits of its vast but outdated military apparatus. The defeat at Sevastopol and the inefficiencies in its army and infrastructure forced Tsar Alexander II to embark on a series of sweeping reforms, including the abolition of serfdom in 1861 and the modernization of the Russian military. While these reforms helped Russia regain strength in the long term, the war had shattered its image as an invincible empire, marking the beginning of a more cautious approach to European affairs.The Kingdom of Sardinia's involvement, though limited in scale, was a masterstroke of diplomacy. By aligning itself with Britain and France, Sardinia secured its place at the negotiating table, leveraging its participation to gain international recognition. This diplomatic success laid the groundwork for the unification of Italy, which followed in the subsequent decade.Beyond the strategic and political consequences, the Crimean War introduced several key innovations that would shape future conflicts. The use of railways and telegraphs revolutionized military logistics and communications, while advances in weaponry underscored the shift toward industrialized warfare. The war also marked the beginning of modern war reporting, with journalists like William Howard Russell providing firsthand accounts that shaped public perception and influenced political decision-making.In the grand scope of history, the Crimean War stands as a harbinger of change. It was a conflict that forced nations to confront their weaknesses, adapt to new realities, and prepare for the challenges of an increasingly modern world. Though often overshadowed by later, larger wars, its legacy endures in the lessons it imparted on military strategy, geopolitics, and the evolution of warfare. The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content for over 12 years.

At the time, Greece was a relatively young and small kingdom, having gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830.However, many ethnic Greeks still lived under Ottoman rule, particularly in Epirus, Thessaly, and Crete. The war between the Ottoman Empire and Russia, supported by Britain and France, presented an opportunity for Greek nationalists to push for territorial expansion.King Otto of Greece, a Bavarian monarch ruling the country, sympathized with the Russian cause and saw the war as a chance to reclaim Greek-populated lands from the Ottomans. In 1854, Greece encouraged and covertly supported uprisings in Ottoman territories, particularly in Thessaly and Epirus, where Greek irregular forces launched attacks against Ottoman garrisons.However, this intervention was not welcomed by Britain and France, who sought to maintain the balance of power in the region and prevent Russian influence from expanding. Viewing Greece's actions as destabilizing, they imposed a naval blockade on the country and even occupied Piraeus, the port of Athens, in April 1854 to force King Otto to abandon his expansionist ambitions.As a result of the blockade and occupation, Greece was effectively neutralized for the remainder of the war, and the uprisings it had supported were suppressed by Ottoman forces. The episode weakened Otto's position domestically, as many Greeks resented the foreign intervention but were also frustrated by their government's failure to achieve territorial gains.Ultimately, Greece's involvement in the Crimean War highlighted both its nationalist aspirations and its limitations as a small power caught between the interests of larger European nations.",

    "description": "The Roaring Twenties were a time period filled with tales of adventure and glamour. Prohibition fueled a party lifestyle - and made available a dangerous but adrenaline fueled life to some of the more enterprising members of the underworld. In Chicago, Illinois, the Twenties have become a time of legend and usually call to mind one man, Al Capone. But Capone, for all intents and purposes, was only a figure head during the Beer Wars. He ran his gang and racket, but he delegated the dirty work.To the north of him was a group that was, as one newspaper of the time called them, Modern Day Pirates, The North Side Gang. Consider Capone the Prince John to their Robin Hood and his Merry-men, an analogy that Rose Keefe introduced in her book, Guns and Roses: The Untold Story of Dean O’Banion. Robin Hood isn’t quite as steal from the rich to give to the poor and you’ll need to give Little John a temper and thirst for vengeance that was unrivaled. Also, make the merry-men a little crazier and a lot more deadly. You get the picture. Three years, three bosses dead. The North Side track record was less than desirable, George Moran would have been well aware of this when he took over after the death of Vincent Drucci in April of 1927. He had said goodbye to three of his good friends, the flower shop was gone, Mr. Schofield having kicked them out after Hymie Weiss’s assassination, and having run from the past at least once already in his life, George Moran took stock of his life and probably thought about throwing in the towel. But Chicago was home and he couldn’t just forget everything that had happened. A part of him still wanted revenge and leaving the North Side would have felt like letting his friends down. So Moran did what he did best, he carried on.Erin Finlen continues her series.Part one is here, part two is here, and part three is here.Note: An image of Moran is available here. Minnesota YearsGeorge Moran, the prohibition gangster most associated with being the arch enemy of Al Capone and by extension Chicago was actually from St. Paul, Minnesota and named Adelard Cunin. Born on August 21, 1893 to a French immigrant named Jules and his wife Marie, he was, like his friends enrolled in a Catholic School. And also like his friends, turned to crime at a young age, in fact he had served time three times before he reached the age of twenty one.He and his father did not get along and Adelard regularly was hit with a belt by his dad for his behavior at home. At school, they also believed in corporal punishment and by the time he got home his father could be waiting to punish him again. Strong willed and resilient, the beatings did nothing to change his personality or willfulness. He turned to crime as an outlet for his frustration. At the age of eighteen, he escaped from jail and made his way south to Chicago. His father refused to have anything to do with him, but his mother still kept in touch.It was after arriving in Chicago that Adelard started adopting different names, including George Gage, George Morrisey, George Miller and, of course, George Moran.In photos, Moran typically is wearing something that covers his neck. When he was living in Chicago in 1917, he got in the face of someone heckling a public speaker. A fight broke out and Moran was cut several times on the neck with a knife. He was rushed to the hospital where they managed to stop the bleeding and save his life. He was lucky but also self-conscious of the way the scars looked and would do his best to hid them throughout his life. There was good to come of the incident, though. In his recovery he would meet Dean O’Banion. The Beginnings of the North Side and Rise to LeaderIn 1917, Dean O’Banion was working as a waiter at McGovern’s Tavern, charming customers with his beautiful singing voice. This tavern was where Moran began to become a regular during his recovery. He met there a man named Charles Reiser, who introduced him to bigger kinds of burglary. For the most part, George would steer clear of bootlegging, at least at first, he preferred to stick with thieving and safe cracking.One of Reiser’s safe cracking proteges was O’Banion and the two were drawn to each other, both with independent, stubborn spirits. Although, Moran was much quieter and kept his cards close to his chest. They were joined shortly after by Hymie Weiss and the three became a trio of safecrackers. They were joined by Drucci last and though he was also readily accepted, it was not likely that it was for his thieving skills as his charm and reckless bravery.They were well on their way to becoming the North Side Gang of legend, when Moran was sent to jail again and this time, after an escape attempt that was going well until he got caught, Moran would be absent in Chicago until 1921 as he served his sentence at Joliet Penitentiary.When Moran got out his friends were waiting with good news: they were big shots in the bootlegging business and Moran was happy to help. He even went to Canada to see about a shipment for O’Banion. That wasn’t to say that bootlegging was his only occupation. He was arrested at least once with O’Banion and Weiss for burglary. And at one point Weiss and Moran were both involved in a police chase that ended when the police fired on the car and the pair decided it was safer to pull over.Also, in 1921, Moran met a woman with whom he fell instantly in love, Lucielle Logan. Lucielle was worried that George would run when he found out she had a son, but George was just as smitten with him and adopted him, spoiling him and helping him learn English, as Lucielle and her son, who would go by John George Moran for the rest of his life, spoke French. Surprisingly, he loved being a family man and when one reporter asked him what was next after a funeral, he probably wasn’t lying when he said he just wanted to live with his wife and kid in peace.In 1924, when O’Banion was murdered, Moran was fully on board with Hymie Weiss’s plans to get revenge. There was also another item of business that Moran could not wait to handle. He had never been a fan of O’Banion’s bodyguard, Louie Alterie. So, when Alterie was talking to the media about shooting the murderers of O’Banion and, strangely, following Torrio and Capone to New York after the funeral, Moran sent Alterie packing, saying there was no place for him in the North Side Gang. With that taken care of, it was time to get to the real business of getting even, even if the boss was in jail. While Weiss was in jail in the summer of 1925, Drucci and Moran tried several hits on the Gennas. They weren’t exactly subtle about it though.Between the two of them, neither Moran nor Drucci was known for thinking revenge plans through to the full extent. And with Weiss in jail and the grief over losing O’Banion mixed with a disdain for the Gennas they were more gung ho than usual. Amatuna, who had been a shooter of Dean O’Banion had agreed to hand over to Moran and Drucci the other two men believed to be responsible: John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. They believed Amatuna and went to the rendezvous where they were promptly shot at and both had to be treated at a nearby hospital.After Weiss’s death, Moran agreed with Drucci that peace was the best option but he wasn’t happy about it. And when Drucci died, he kept the peace but he could feel his nagging hatred for Capone, the man who had stolen O’Banion and Weiss from him, itching at him. Then, after Capone battled with other men, he eventually started eyeing a Northwest gang whose territory he wanted. He had the leader bumped off. The man, John Touhy, was an old friend of Moran’s. Seeing another of his friends dead by the hand of Capone reopened the wounds that had never closed from O’Banion and Weiss’s deaths. The war was back. And this time it was going to take a massacre to end it.  CheckmateAfter the death of Touhy, Moran and Capone continued to battle. Murdering continued until Capone had had enough. Somehow word got back to him that Moran was having a meeting at the North Side’s garage on Clark Street. Al Capone was never one to do anything quietly, a fact which irritated his friends back in New York, who found his ostentatiousness to be too attention seeking for their comfort. And what Capone had planned was nothing short of attention grabbing. Unfortunately for him and the seven men who would be in the garage, it wouldn’t see the end of his arch enemy.On February 14, 1929, Moran was late to his meeting at the Clark Street garage. If he was like people of today, running late to your first meeting on a very cold, snowy morning, probably makes you think that your day isn’t going to go well. So, when he turned onto Clark Street and saw black police vehicle sitting outside his garage, he changed his course and went into a nearby diner to wait.Men had been waiting across the street for Moran to enter the garage. When they thought they saw him enter, the signal was given and two men dressed as police officers entered. They had the men surrender their weapons and face a wall with their hands raised. Then they pulled out Thompson submachine guns and opened fire. Six of the men were killed instantly but one was still alive when the real cops arrived, although in his short time left he refused to identify the killers. The carnage was unlike anything Chicago had ever seen and the police and medical examiners were sickened by it. The lone survivor was the mechanic, James Mays, dog, Highball. When the police finally arrived they found him howling and shaking. He was later euthanized due to being unable to recover from what he had witnessed.Word of what happened reached Moran and in a rare show of emotion, he checked himself into a hospital for exhaustion and a stomach issue. When police eventually found him, the only thing he would say was “Only Capone kills like that.” The man who was killed in Moran’s place was Al Weinshank. He looked uncannily like Moran in build and facial features. He was not a criminal, he simply associated with them.Moran didn’t stay long in Chicago after that. And the North Side Gang was no more. Capone had won the Beer Wars. Find that piece of interest? If so, join us for free by clicking here.  Sources:Binder, J. J. (2017).
