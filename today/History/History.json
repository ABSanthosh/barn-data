Charlie’s Place was revolutionary, and that meant it was dangerous. Host Rhym Guissé explores the unbelievable true story of Charlie Fitzgerald, a mysterious Black businessman whose nightclub became an unlikely site of integration in Myrtle Beach. Charlie broke down racial barriers through the power of music and dance, hosting some of the greatest musicians of our time: Little Richard, Count Basie, Ray Charles, Duke Ellington, and many more. But who was Charlie? How did he rise to power? And what price did he pay for achieving the impossible—an integrated club in the Jim Crow South? This is a story of joy and passion that erupted into violence and changed a community forever. Listen to Charlie’s Place wherever you get your podcasts.

    "description": "George Washington is often remembered as the figurehead of the American Revolution. The first President of the United States and Commander and Chief. His leadership was absolutely instrumental in our nation’s founding, his Presidency has continued to be seen as a guiding light among many leaders today. Yet, behind the image of a resolute commander and statesman lay a man who, after stepping down from power in 1797, faced a deep sense of anxiety and uncertainty over the future of the country he helped create. Far from basking in the glory of his achievements and historic relinquishing of power, Washington found himself haunted by doubts over the fragility of the new republic and his own role in the life of an ex-politician.Preston Knowles explains. George Washington - The 1796 Lansdowne portrait.The Man Behind the LegendGeorge Washington wrote to Thomas Jefferson in 1796 “I am wearied by the public service.. But still am I anxious for the success of our republican experiment.”  This quote would set the tone for his post-presidency years, a time where the founding father, despite his long known desire to retire, was deeply affected by the political divisions springing up in the youthful United States.Washington’s desire to retire from public office wasn’t simply a political maneuver; it was a personal choice, Washington had long expressed his desire to return to Mount Vernon. And In his 1796 farewell address, Washington famously warned against “the spirit of the party,” describing it as a danger that could lead to the “destruction of the republic.” He cautioned against the divisiveness of political factions, understanding the potential for them to destabilize the unity of the nation.Washington’s farewell address is one of the most enduring pieces of advice in American political history. Yet, despite his warnings, political parties emerged almost immediately after his departure of office. With Hamilton leading the Federalists on one side and Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans on the other.Washington held increasing concerns as these factions grew more hostile and entrenched. In his personal letters and conversations, he expressed frustration with the direction the country was taking. He feared that the growing divide would prevent the nation from achieving its potential and would ultimately lead to a breakdown in national unity. Even leading Washington to consider taking up public life again. In a letter to John Adams in 1796 he wrote,“I have long been of the opinion that nothing but the most imperious necessity could ever call me to the helm again. I feel that we are in a dangerous situation, and I have no patience with the spirit of party that threatens to tear the country asunder.”  Seeking Peace, Finding ConflictWashington’s post-presidency years at Mount Vernon were meant to offer him a chance to rest and return to a simpler life he had long dreamt of. He attempted to focus on the management of his estate. Yet, even in retirement, Washington was never truly free from the demands of public life.His daily life at Mount Vernon was filled with a much loved routine: overseeing his land, attending to correspondence, and meeting with visitors. Washington's influence continued to loom large over the young nation. Presidents, legislators, and foreign leaders often turned to him for advice or reassurance. His very presence was a stabilizing force, and Washington’s judgment was still highly valued by those in power.But even in the peaceful surroundings of his estate, Washington found himself troubled by the political turmoil that continued to roil the nation. Despite his desire to retire from public affairs, he remained a prominent figure, and his opinion was still sought after by those in power. In several letters in 1798 Washington frequently discusses his fear of the division the political parties were causing.To John Jay in 1798, Washington reflected on the growing political conflict: “The party spirit has been carried to such lengths that it threatens to subvert the very government which it is supposed to protect.” These words, written from Mount Vernon, underscore his deepening anxiety about the emerging divisions within the government.To Hamilton in 1798, Washington wrote, \"I am fully persuaded that we have no alternative but to preserve the Union. Yet, how to do so, with the factionalism that is emerging, I cannot say.”Washington’s letters to Jefferson were similarly filled with apprehension. In one, he lamented the growing ideological divide between the two men’s parties, saying, “It seems to me that we are drifting farther apart, and I fear the consequences of this estrangement.”Despite his desire to avoid political involvement, Washington was repeatedly called upon to mediate disputes and offer guidance on ever evolving situations the Country faced. He was particularly concerned with the rise of foreign threats, particularly from France and Britain, and often expressed anxiety over how the country would navigate its position in the international arena.In a letter to his friend James Madison, Washington wrote, “I tremble for the future when I think of our dependence on foreign nations. It is a great and dangerous experiment we have undertaken.” His thoughts on foreign relations reflected the weight of his concerns about the vulnerabilities of the young Republic, even in his retirement. The Cost of CommandDespite his retirement, Washington found himself ever consumed by a longing sense of devotion to a nation he had given most of his life to serve. Finding himself ever worried over the turmoil the young country was facing, his anxieties speak to the immense pressures of leadership and the uncertainty even the most revered figures in history face when navigating the ever complex world of politics. In the end, Washington did not find the peace he sought but he did provide an excellent and valuable lesson in the art of leadership, illustrating how even the most steadfast and stoic of leaders can be deeply affected by division and uncertainty. Spending his last years at Mount Vernon we see an often unseen side of Washington, not as the mythical figure of a revolutionary force. But as a man, whose doubt, worry and deep sense of responsibility weighed heavy on his mind through the last years of his life. Did you find that piece interesting?

    "description": "The Bay of Pigs Invasion was a failed US-supported landing on Cuba against Fidel Castro’s Communist Cuba in 1961. Here, J.J. Valdes considers Britain’s involvement in the affair. Bay of Pigs Invasion: The flagship Blagar, near the Cuban coast, April 16, 1961.“Speak in English,” Bob Hines, radio operator at the airport tower in Grand Cayman, kept telling the Spanish-speaking pilot of the Douglas B-26 Invader circling overhead. There was no scheduled arrival of a plane on that early morning of April 15, 1961, so Hines was perplexed about the identity of the unexpected flight. Hines spoke some Spanish and could understand that the pilot was asking for landing instructions. Unable to get the man to communicate in English, he gave him instructions in Spanish as best he could and the plane finally landed. The radio operator, who was working alone in the tower at the time, then went out to meet the plane on the tarmac. The pilot, in military garb, was the first to exit the aircraft, which bore Cuban air force markings. “Give you this,” he said to Hines, holding two pistols in his outstretched hand. Hines took the pistols then, deciding that this was something for the government to handle, summoned the islands’ Immigration Officer (also the Chief of Police) and Administrator Jack Rose. Cayman IslandsThe Caymans, consisting of Grand Cayman and two other smaller isles, came under British rule in 1670. In 1961 the territory was administered as a dependency of Jamaica, where the governor resided. Jack Rose, a former Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter pilot during World War II, was the island’s resident administrator.Rose quickly arrived at the airport. The Cubans were demanding to be flown to Miami and at first Rose assumed that they were defectors from that county. But in fact, the unexpected arrivals were Cuban exile pilot Alfredo Caballero and navigator Alfredo Maza. They were part of a force trained in Central America by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for an invasion of Cuba intended to topple Fidel Castro. Their plane was one of three B-26s that had attacked San Antonio de los Baños airbase, near Havana, as part of pre-invasion strikes on three of the country’s main airfields. Caballero had discovered en route to Cuba from Nicaragua that there was a malfunction with the plane’s droppable fuel tanks. Despite his flight leader’s order to turn back, he had opted to continue with the mission. However, his fuel situation had become critical on the return trip, forcing him to divert to Grand Cayman.   No one had bothered to inform Rose about the possible arrival of such visitors and he was “far from pleased to see them” because he “smelt trouble.” Adding to his foreboding was the fact that one of the plane’s rockets had apparently misfired and was still attached under a wing. The Cuban crew offered no cooperation in addressing the dangerous situation. Rose, therefore, called on his old RAF skills to remove the device and other ordnance from the plane with help from ground personnel and an American tourist onlooker who had been a bomber crewman. Rose’s next order of business was to contact the governor in Jamaica, Sir Kenneth Blackburne. As there was no telephone connection at the time between Kingston and the Caymans, messages had to be exchanged via radiotelegraphy. Blackburne, it turned out, was as surprised as Rose by the incident and had little to offer. This left Rose in a crux regarding “what attitude to adopt in practical and propaganda terms.” He thought it prudent “to try to keep the lid on what had happened.” Thus, in addition to requesting local ship owners to refrain from radio chatter about the B-26’s arrival, he arranged for the postmaster to hold off all outgoing mail for a time.  Lack of knowledgeEven the highest levels of the British government had apparently not been informed by the Americans of their plans for an invasion of Cuba, let alone that an airstrip on British territory had been designated as an emergency landing alternative. British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, despite his close association with President John F. Kennedy, had been kept in the dark about such plans when he had visited Washington in early April. The American strategy seemed to have been not to involve the British authorities pending the advent of actual emergency landings on the Caymans. If the British then decided to intern any landed aircraft, the Americans considered raising the specter that Cuba and other nations might view the planes’ presence there as indicative that the islands were being used as a launch base. As it happened, however, the British government proved most cooperative. During the evening, Rose received a radiogram from Sir Blackburne informing him to expect “a visitor” during the night who “should be given every courtesy.” Around midnight, a transport aircraft with no landing lights approached the dark runway (which lacked an illumination system) at low level. Upon touching down, the “visitor” and several other CIA men deplaned. The leader of the group introduced himself and, over the course of their conversation, revealed to be intimately acquainted with assorted details about Rose’s life. The rest of the group consisted of aviation technicians who immediately set to work on the parked B-26.  After sizing up the situation, the lead CIA man indicated that he needed to phone Washington. He initially thought Rose was joking when the latter informed him that the island had no telephone connection to the outside world. Arrangements were then made via radiogram for a charter plane from Jamaica to pick up the American in the morning and fly him there so he could make his call. Afterward, he returned on the plane to Grand Cayman. Rose came to find out that, to pay for expenses, this fellow carried a case containing stacks of US paper currency, “neatly packed just as one sees them in films or television as ransom money.”Events took a precipitous turn on April 17 when the disembarkation of troops at the Bay of Pigs began. Throughout the day, the invasion force received air support from B-26 bombers arriving over the area from Nicaragua in staggered fashion. The aircraft, which lacked tail guns, were often engaged in lopsided aerial battles by fighter planes from Castro’s air force. By day’s end, two more B-26s had arrived at Grand Cayman. One, piloted by Marío Zúñiga, diverted there in the early morning low on fuel after engaging in a dogfight with, ironically, a British-made Hawker Sea Fury. A number of the prop fighters had been inherited by Castro from former Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Another B-26, piloted by Antonio Soto, arrived in the early afternoon after having one of his engines shot out by a T-33 jet.  In retrospectBoth Rose’s and Hines’s oral accounts, recorded more than three decades after the events, are imprecise in various respects, including the total number of B-26s, each carrying a two-man crew, that diverted to Grand Cayman. Whereas they both claim that a total of four planes arrived, CIA documents indicate that only three did, including Caballero’s on the 15th. The three aircraft were flown back to Nicaragua by CIA personnel as soon as each was made airworthy. Meanwhile, the six Cuban exile crewmen they had carried were issued civilian clothes and flown out on regular air service flights to Miami. Zúñiga and Soto arrived back in Nicaragua in time to join the invasion’s most devastating air support mission late on the afternoon of April 18. Caballero, however, was transported by mistake to Retalhuleu, the CIA’s airbase in Guatemala, and remained there until the invasion’s collapse on April 19. Both Administrator Rose and Governor Blackburne subsequently received letters of commendation for their handling of the affair from the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Frederick Millar. However, Rose was “given to understand” that if the matter had attracted any adverse publicity, he alone would have been assigned blame for the incident. The role of British territory in the CIA’s Cuban invasion has largely remained hush and been little publicized over the years. Radio operator Hines declared in his 1995 oral account that he “was the only person allowed to take pictures [of the landed planes], on word that I would not publish them; I have never published them.”  To this day, the pictures have never come to light.  Author J.J.
