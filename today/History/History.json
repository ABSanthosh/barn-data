    "description": "The Battle of Gaugamela (Γαυγάμηλα), or Battle of Arbela (Ἄρβηλα), fought on the October 1, 331 BCE, was a turning point in ancient history, marking Alexander the Great's decisive victory over the Persian Empire and solidifying his place as one of history's greatest military tacticians and strategists.The confrontation was the culmination of escalating hostilities between the ambitious Macedonian king, Alexander III of Macedon who became known as Alexander the Great, (Αλέξανδρος ο Μέγας), and Darius III, the ruler of the vast Persian Empire.Terry Bailey explains. The Battle of Gaugamela by Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1602.The lead-up to GaugamelaFollowing his father King Philip II's unification of the Greek city-states and establishment of the League of Corinth, Alexander ascended to the Macedonian throne with aspirations of expansion beyond Greece's borders. His campaign against Persia began in 334 BCE, with Alexander's victories in battles such as Granicus, (Μάχη του Γρανικού), 334 BCE and Issus, (Ἱσσὸς Μάχη), 333 BCE setting the stage for a showdown.These early successes inspired confidence among Alexander's ranks and raised concerns for Darius, who had underestimated Alexander's prowess. In the wake of the Battle of Issus in 333 BCE, where Alexander had struck a significant blow to the Persian forces, Darius offered peace terms, including a generous ransom for his captured family and large territorial concessions.Alexander, however, saw himself as Darius's equal and declined the offer, seeking to claim the Persian Empire for himself. Politically, Darius now faced mounting pressure from his subjects to protect the empire's core territories, therefore, moved to consolidate his forces near Gaugamela, a strategically chosen location on the Mesopotamian plains, where he could deploy his army's full strength and exploit the open terrain. Commanders and armies, strategy and tacticsOn the Macedonian side, Alexander commanded a seasoned, highly disciplined army composed of approximately 47,000 troops, including phalanx infantry, elite companion cavalry, and specialised units like archers and highly mobile light infantry. Alexander's forces were strategically flexible and accustomed to his aggressive, calculated tactics. Central to Alexander's strategy was a deep understanding of mobility and the use of oblique formations to outflank larger forces.Darius III, on the other hand, led a considerably larger force, with estimates ranging from 100,000 to as high as 250,000 troops. The Persian army was a diverse coalition, including cavalry, infantry, chariots equipped with scythes, and a small contingent of war elephants. Darius positioned himself at the centre of his forces, with infantry and heavy cavalry on the flanks and chariots prepared for a decisive charge. His strategy relied on overwhelming Alexander's smaller army with sheer numbers, hoping to use the flat plains of Gaugamela to his advantage. The battle unfolds, tactics and actionAs the battle began, Darius attempted to use his numerical superiority by sending waves of cavalry on both flanks to encircle Alexander's troops. However, Alexander the Great's tactics at the Battle of Gaugamela were masterfully adapted to the open, flat terrain, which should have favoured Darius III's much larger Persian forces. Recognising that a direct, head-on confrontation with such a massive army would be risky, Alexander orchestrated a strategy to exploit his troops' agility, discipline, and skill.Central to this was his innovative integration of cavalry and infantry, forming a highly flexible, responsive battle line that allowed him to neutralise the Persians' numerical advantage and leverage his own army's strengths. Alexander placed his heavy infantry, the Macedonian phalanx, at the centre of his formation, forming a strong, disciplined core that could hold against Persian attacks.His famed companion cavalry, led personally by Alexander, was positioned on the right flank, along with other light infantry and cavalry units. This flank was the decisive wing of his army, where Alexander intended to deliver a powerful blow. On the left, under the command of General Parmenion, were additional cavalry and light infantry, tasked with holding their ground against Persian attacks. The integration of cavalry and infantry on both flanks gave the Macedonian army flexibility, allowing Alexander to adapt quickly to Persian moves.Alexander also employed a tactical feigned retreat and oblique advance, pulling his right-wing cavalry gradually to the right. This manoeuvre drew Persian forces away from their solid front line, stretching them and exposing gaps. When Darius ordered his cavalry to pursue Alexander's right flank, Alexander seized the opportunity.The Persian line thinned, especially near the centre, where Darius was stationed. At the critical moment, Alexander and his companion cavalry swung sharply to the left, charging through the gap in the Persian centre toward Darius himself. Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx advanced, keeping the Persian infantry occupied and preventing them from reinforcing their vulnerable centre.This coordinated use of cavalry and infantry allowed Alexander to drive a wedge into the Persian army, isolating Darius and forcing him to flee. As the Persian king retreated, the morale of his troops broke, leading to a chaotic withdrawal. Alexander's tactical ingenuity in using a mix of direct engagement and flanking manoeuvres on such open terrain proved decisive, showcasing his ability to adapt and exploit the unique conditions of the battlefield. Aftermath and legacyThe Battle of Gaugamela signalled the collapse of the Persian Empire, opening the doors for Alexander's forces to capture the key cities of Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis. This victory marked the effective end of Persian power and the beginning of a new era of Hellenistic influence across the former empire. Alexander's victory at Gaugamela became a testament to his strategic brilliance, shaping his legacy as one of history's most formidable conquerors.The site has been offering a wide variety of high-quality, free history content since 2012.

Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centred on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the southwest, Illyria to the northwest, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south.Not to be confused with the Republic of North Macedonia, a landlocked country in Southeast Europe, sharing land borders with Greece to the south, Albania to the west, Bulgaria to the east, Kosovo to the northwest and Serbia to the north. Alexander the Great's empireAlexander the Great's empire was one of the largest in the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwest India. Extent of the EmpireAt its height, Alexander's empire covered approximately 5.2 million square kilometres (2 million square miles), making it the largest empire in the world at the time.It stretched from Macedonia and Greece in the west, across the Middle East, through Persia (modern-day Iran), and reaching India in the east. The empire also included Egypt and parts of Central Asia. Key regions and territories conqueredMacedonia and Greece: The empire began here and remained Alexander's cultural and administrative base.Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey): Alexander moved here after defeating the Persians at the Battle of Granicus, (Μάχη του Γρανικού), 334 BCE.Persian Empire (modern Iran, Iraq, Syria, and parts of Central Asia): After his decisive victory at the Battle of Gaugamela, (Γαυγάμηλα), in 331 BCE, Alexander claimed the entirety of the Persian Empire, which was the dominant power in the region.Egypt: He was welcomed in Egypt as a liberator and founded the city of Alexandria.Mesopotamia and Babylon: These regions became central to his empire after the fall of Persia.Punjab Region in India: Alexander's easternmost conquests reached the Punjab region, but he did not extend further due to his army's reluctance. Population and diversityAlexander's empire was highly diverse, encompassing various cultures, languages, and religions. The empire was home to tens of millions of people, though exact population estimates vary. Administration and influenceAlexander's conquests helped spread Greek culture, language, and ideas across these regions, influencing them for centuries to come in what became known as the Hellenistic Period. His empire, however, was difficult to govern due to its sheer size, and it began to fragment soon after he died in 323 BCE.Alexander's empire was significant not only for its size but also for its lasting cultural impact. Greek influence persisted through the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded his empire, blending with local cultures across Asia and the Mediterranean. Phalanx, (φάλαγξ)One of the most effective and enduring military formations in ancient warfare was that of the Greek phalanx. The age of the phalanx formation may be traced back to Sumeria in the 25th century BCE, through Egypt, and finally appearing in Greek literature through Homer in the 8th century BCE (and since has been generally associated with Greek warfare strategy, the name itself coming from the Greek word for 'finger').The phalanx formation was a close-rank, dense grouping of soldiers armed with long spears and interlocking shields with the first few ranks of soldiers projecting their spears out over the first rank of shields.",

    "description": "The Thanksgiving story most of us hear is about friendship and unity. And that's what Sarah Josepha Hale had on her mind when she sat down to write a letter to President Lincoln in 1863, deep into the Civil War. Hale had already spent years campaigning for a national day of thanksgiving, using her platform as editor of one the country's most widely-read magazines and writing elected officials to argue that Americans urgently needed a national story. But she'd gotten nowhere – until now.Five days after reading her letter, Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday. At the time, no one was talking about Pilgrims and Native Americans. But that too would change.Today on the show: a Thanksgiving story you may not have heard, how it happened, and what it leaves out.Learn more about sponsor message choices: podcastchoices.com/adchoicesNPR Privacy Policy",
