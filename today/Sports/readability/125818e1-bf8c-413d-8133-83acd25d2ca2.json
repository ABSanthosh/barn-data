  "text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim knows he can rely on Bruno Fernandes to step up when he needs it - but he wishes his captain would \"trust\" his team-mates a bit more.The Portuguese manager's praise came after his compatriot's hat-trick in United's 4-1 Europa League victory against Real Sociedad at Old Trafford.Fernandes is the type of player who attracts criticism and praise in equal measure.His captaincy was condemned by former United captain Gary Neville in the wake of an horrific 7-0 hammering at Liverpool in March 2023.More recently, another legendary club figure and skipper Roy Keane criticised Fernandes' performances in typically forthright manner and ridiculed those who said the current tortuous campaign would be even worse without him by stating \"how much worse could it be\".United are 14th and heading for their worst league campaign since they were relegated in 1973-74.Yet Fernandes is clear as top scorer with 15 goals. None of his team-mates have reached double figures.This was also the 12th match this season in which Fernandes has scored. In eight of those games his contribution was decisive, with his goals turning losses into draws and draws into wins.\"When we need it, he is always there,\" said Amorim. \"He can bring the ball forward. He can score goals.\"He is a perfect captain for our team and we need to help him win titles.\"In the past month alone, it was Fernandes who scored his side's goal in their creditable draw with Arsenal, their equaliser in an FA Cup tie with Fulham they ended up losing on penalties and the superb free-kick that dragged United back into a game at Everton they seemed destined to lose.Fernandes' latest intervention rescued his team, who had fallen behind against Sociedad, knowing only victory could keep alive their hopes of winning a trophy this season and securing a European place next term.\"Over this last six-to-seven weeks he's been brilliant,\" said former United midfielder Paul Scholes on TNT Sports. \"He's playing a bit deeper these days rather than that 10 role.\"He's carrying this team to a little bit of success.\"Fernandes' other quality is that he is hardly ever injured.Of United's outfield players, only fellow Portuguese Diogo Dalot has made more than his 43 appearances this season. Yet Amorim says Fernandes has a flaw.Too often, he wrecks United's team shape by vacating his position in a search for possession.Amorim feels the answer has to come from within.\"We know that sometimes he is frustrated,\" he said. \"We know he wants to win so badly and when things are not going well, he is changing position and going after the ball.\"Sometimes he needs to trust his team-mates.\"",
