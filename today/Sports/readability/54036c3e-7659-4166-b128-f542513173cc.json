  "text": "Lee Carsley says England are in \"a good position\" to win the 2026 World Cup under new manager Thomas Tuchel.German Tuchel takes up his new role on 1 January after being handed an 18-month contract by the Football Association.The 51-year-old has been tasked with ending England's long wait for a major trophy - and outgoing interim boss Carsley believes the squad can succeed at the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\"I think we are in a good position to do that,\" he said. \"I think we have the talent to do it.\"We have got all of the tools. We just need to play them in the order.\"Carsley clinched England's promotion to Nations League A with five wins from his six games in charge after replacing Gareth Southgate. He also gave debuts to eight players during his temporary spell, including Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones and Southampton centre-back Taylor Harwood-Bellis.The 50-year-old's tenure ended with Sunday's emphatic 5-0 win over the Republic of Ireland at Wembley Stadium.\"Thomas' pool of players has increased so we have left the squad in a fantastic position,\" added Carsley, who will return to his job as boss of the England Under-21s side.\"I have been lucky now to be at the last couple of World Cups and the timing of the players being in form, physically and mentally, at the right time, picking the right squad.\"Carsley is unsure when he will meet up with former Chelsea and Bayern Munich boss Tuchel to discuss the players, but admitted \"the sooner the better\". \"We will collate our thoughts, along with the rest of the players in terms of handing over something he can read and look through that's valuable,\" he said.\"And then we'll step back to support him.\"England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford agreed there is \"new energy\" surrounding the team, which will lead to \"a lot of competition for places\".\"But that's what it's about,\" added the Everton player. \"You want the best players for England at the right moment, and hopefully going forward next year we've got that squad ready to win.\"Former England strike Chris Sutton on 5 live's Monday Night ClubHas Lee Carsley made it easier by using so many players? Could Thomas Tuchel possibly be more confused about who to pick?Tuchel is his own guy and would he have paid attention to the way England had played under Carsley? It's his job to, but he's a strong character and strong-willed - he'll know what he wants.The strength and depth England have, looking ahead 18-19 months to the World Cup, there is only one nailed-on starter and that is Jordan Pickford. You can have a really good debate about every other position.I'm not so sure [about] Harry Kane another 18 or 19 months further on. He's brilliant at linking the play as a goalscorer, but if you're not supplying him with the chances he is predictable in the way that he plays and Ollie Watkins isn't.Watkins mixes his game up and runs in behind. I get the argument for Kane but he is getting older and isn't as mobile as he once was. If you're a centre-half you know what Kane is going to do, whereas Watkins will mix his game up and offer a threat in behind.Kane is a phenomenal striker but I think that is a real debate. I always thought he should have been in the team in the Euros but he can't do the running in behind now. I'm not doubting his quality, but it is food for thought for Tuchel.Pickford is the one position where Tuchel could come in and see him as a stick-on. There's so many right-backs, midfielders, centre-forwards where there's debate. There's no real competition for Pickford. He's so good with his feet, he's unflustered and he made some phenomenal saves in Greece.",
