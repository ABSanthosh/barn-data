The Duke Blue Devils and Alabama Crimson Tide, who each scored 100 or more points in the last round, will close the night out in Newark (8:49 p.m. ET on TBS).Follow along as our reporters on-site and editors from coast to coast track the action in both games.Elite Eight live tracker(3) Texas Tech vs. (1) FloridaFinal: Florida defeated Texas Tech 84-79How Florida won: With Florida on the brink of elimination, Walter Clayton Jr. scored 13 of his game-high 30 points over the game's final 5:24 to erase the 10-point deficit to Texas Tech and send the Gators to their first Final Four since 2014. Florida had been unable to score back-to-back buckets the entire second half, but Thomas Haugh finally shot back-to-back 3s to cut the deficit to 75-72 with 2:27 to play before Clayton Jr. took the baton, also hitting back-to-back shots from beyond the arc to give Florida its first lead since early in the half and ice the game in its closing moments with a pair of free throws. -- Kyle Bonagura",
