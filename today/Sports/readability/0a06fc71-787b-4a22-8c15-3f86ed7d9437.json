  "text": "OXFORD — Ole Miss women's basketball star Madison Scott's WNBA journey is underway.The Dallas Wings selected Scott in the second round with the No. 14 pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft on April 14 in New York City. Scott became the eighth Ole Miss women's basketball player in history to be drafted. Scott will team up with UConn star Paige Bueckers, who the Wings selected with the No. 1 overall pick.Scott is a 6-foot-2 player from Indian Head, Maryland who can play guard and forward. She played five seasons at Ole Miss. Scott averaged 11.8 points and 3.7 assists per game in 2024-25 and was named to the 2025 All-SEC Second Team. She is the fourth player in Ole Miss history to surpass 1,600 career points and 1,000 career rebounds.The positivesScott's strength is her versatility. She doesn't have off-the-charts statistics in any one category, but she routinely fills up stat sheets in a way that has a big impact in games. Scott led Ole Miss in points (11.8 per game) and assists (3.7 per game). She also averaged 5.1 rebounds, which was No. 3 on the team.Scott was a mature, key leader for Ole Miss in her five-year career in Oxford. She played in a program-record 155 games for the Rebels.The concernsWhile Scott's defense and physicality should help her crack into a WNBA rotation, she will need to develop her offense to become a star.Perimeter shooting is not a big piece of Scott's game. She is a career 21% 3-point shooter, but she's only attempted 29 3-pointers. Scott has been an efficient overall shooter in college (49%) but feasting in the paint and relying on drives to the rim will be more difficult in the WNBA without a reliable 3-point shot for defenders to account for.Final thoughtsScott hasn't put up eye-popping offensive number, but she was not asked to do that at Ole Miss. Scott isn't likely to contend for MVP honors in the WNBA, but she is a versatile, hard-working player who can slot in nicely to a rotation.Sam Hutchens covers Ole Miss for the Clarion Ledger.
