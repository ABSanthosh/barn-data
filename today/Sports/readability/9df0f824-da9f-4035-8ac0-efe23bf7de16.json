(Photo by Warren Little/Getty Images) (Warren Little via Getty Images)Amari Avery played the U.S. Women's Open in Wisconsin on Friday while her clubs were en route from Los Angeles, due to a scary night and a mix-up the next morning.According to Golf Channel’s Paige Mackenzie, the 20-year-old Avery played the second round at Erin Hills with competitor Gabriela Ruffels' set of clubs after a chaotic 24 hours. The trouble began when someone allegedly attempted to break into her rental home the night after the first round.AdvertisementAvery and her boyfriend, USC golfer Gavin Aurilia, responded by quickly packing up their things and running to a hotel. Crucially, Aurilia and Avery, who also played for USC, apparently have the same travel bags, so when Aurilia left to return to Los Angeles the next morning, he accidentally took all of Avery's equipment with him.Ruffels, another fellow Trojan, played her round earlier in the morning and offered Avery her bag. Meanwhile's Aurilia's mother was reportedly en route to Erin Hills with Avery's clubs.Avery reportedly even took the Nike visor off Ruffels' head.Per Golf Channel, Avery and Ruffels use a very similar set of TaylorMade clubs. Ruffels also didn't need her clubs after missing the cut at 7-over in the morning.AdvertisementAvery, who shot a 1-under 71 in the first round, didn't miss a beat. When play was suspended due to dangerous weather, she was tied for 19th at 2-under and in contention behind leader Mao Saigo (8-under).Avery is in her second year as a professional after an All-American career at USC. She previously made the cut at the 2023 U.S. Women's Open at 18 years old.",
