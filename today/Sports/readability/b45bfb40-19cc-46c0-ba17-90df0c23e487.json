  "text": "Super Bowl champion Phil Simms believes Aaron Rodgers will come up big for the Pittsburgh Steelers this season.The Pittsburgh Steelers aren't calling on 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers to be the Aaron Rodgers of old. The one that torched the league throughout the 2010s with multiple MVP awards and a Super Bowl title.That level of play is long behind him, understandably. Still, the Steelers are hoping another year of health and a motivated mindset could contribute to better quarterback play - and more wins - than what they've had during this recent rut.Critics brushed aside Rodgers' commitment due to him signing his free-agent contract late in the offseason and missing time in the Steelers facility that could've been used to get acclimated.One former quarterback, however, is making a major prediction about Rodgers' health and ambition as he embarks on his second full season back from a torn Achilles in Week 1 of the 2023 season.\"I can say here - and I think I'm 100 percent right - [Rodgers] is in the best shape and changed his body a little bit to fit who he really is,\" said Super Bowl champion Phil Simms on his podcast. \"You have an Achilles injury like he had, it takes time for everything to come back 100 percent. At the end of the year, he was throwing the football. That arm, they need to cut it off and put it in some museum or whatever. If he's given the opportunities, man, I think he'll come through big time.\"The arm talent clearly hasn't gone anywhere, but at his age, a lower-leg injury takes time to get back to anywhere near full health. Rodgers could be approaching that stage where he feels like himself again, because his performance at the end of last year showed it.Rodgers averaged over 250 passing yards a game with nine touchdowns and three interceptions in the New York Jets' last five games. Although last season didn't end in a lot of wins, Rodgers was objectively better as the season went on.The Steelers are banking on the future Hall of Famer returning to that form and supplementing their lowly offense with more production in 2025.",
