  "text": "'We're not underdogs' - England seek redemption against SpainImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England captain Leah Williamson (left) missed the 2023 World Cup final because of an anterior cruciate ligament injuryBBC Sport womenâ€™s football news reporter at St. Jakob-ParkEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalist at St. Jakob-ParkEngland will be seeking redemption in Sunday's Euro 2025 final when they take on Spain in a repeat of the World Cup final two years ago.Sarina Wiegman's side are in their third successive major final after winning Euro 2022 before Spain beat them to become world champions in 2023.It is the first time Spain's women - who were knocked out in the quarter-finals in 2022 by England - have reached a European Championship final.England captain Leah Williamson says they are aware of \"what it means to the nation\" and they will do everything they can to bring home the trophy.The Lionesses are hoping to become the first team in the history of English football to win a major trophy on foreign soil when they line up in the final in Basel, Switzerland at 17:00 BST.\"The opportunity [on Sunday] and what's on offer is the best thing in football,\" said Williamson. \"We wanted to be here until the end and have a chance to win the trophy. We don't carry the weight of it - but we're aware of it because it means the same to us. \"We recognise the opportunity and we'll do everything we can to do it.\"Euro 2025 final: England v SpainSunday, 27 July at 17:00 BSTSt Jakob-Park, BaselWatch on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, follow live text on BBC Sport website and appRedemption for World Cup final defeat?Williamson was not part of England's defeat by Spain in the World Cup final because of an anterior cruciate ligament injury.She said it was an \"awful\" experience to watch the final in Sydney and not being able to help.\"I know how tired you are when you get to that stage, and how much a tournament takes out of you - and to be completely useless, that probably bothered me the most,\" she added.\"But that feels like a really long time ago, which is probably a benefit to the whole squad. \"Anybody would give anything to be a part of their team when they're going through moments like that. It was tough.\"It will be just the second time the same teams have met in back-to-back women's World Cup and European Championship finals, after Germany faced Sweden in 2001 and 2003.They have played each other three times previously at the Euros, with England winning the last two meetings in 2017 and 2022.The two nations also met in this year's Women's Nations League - England won 1-0 at Wembley in February before Spain beat them 2-1 in Barcelona in June.\"We've played each other a lot over the last couple of years. You always have learnings. They will have learned from us,\" said Wiegman. \"Sunday is a new situation so hopefully we can exploit some of the weaknesses they have too. I just know that going into a final is already very, very special.\"Are England the underdogs?Media caption, England not 'clear underdogs' against Spain - WilliamsonSpain have won each of their last 10 matches in all competitions, scoring 38 goals. They last enjoyed a longer winning run between March 2020 and November 2021, when they won 16 games consecutively.The world champions are the highest-ranked side in the competition and have not lost a game at Euro 2025.England are ranked fifth in the world and lost their opening group game against France.They needed a penalty shootout to overcome Sweden in the quarter-finals and scored a last-minute goal in extra time to beat Italy in the semi-final.But Williamson says there is no underdog, despite Spain being many people's pre-tournament favourites.\"We play a game against the world champions who continue to prove themselves over and over in the way they play,\" said Williamson. \"They are fantastic footballing team and they are the best at what they do and we're very much aware of that. We think we're pretty good in areas as well. \"We need to be at our best to beat Spain. I think they need to be at their best to beat us too. There is a lot of respect between the two teams. \"I would be hesitant to say there's an underdog in this scenario. It's not an easy job. We will prepare ourselves as best we can for that challenge.\"Can undefeated Spain create history? Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England lost 1-0 to Spain in the 2023 Women's World Cup finalSpain arrived in Switzerland as the pre-tournament favourites, with Opta predicting they had a 25% chance of winning the title.\"We don't like the idea of being favourites. We know what it takes to be here, what we suffered, we have to be focused,\" Spain captain Irene Paredes said.However, La Roja underlined their credentials as favourites further by storming past Portugal, Belgium and Italy by an aggregate score of 14-3.They saw off a spirited Switzerland side in the quarter-finals before moving past Germany thanks to an extra-time winner as they beat the eight-time European champions for the first time in their history.\"During the whole tournament we have been writing history,\" said Spain boss Montse Tome.\"Getting to the semis and the final for the first time, beating Germany for the first time. We have been accomplishing objectives and that's the reason we're here.\"Spain could become the first European nation to lift the World Cup and the Euros at back-to-back tournaments since Germany won five in a row between 2001 and 2009.\"We are a team who don't see this game as a pressure but as an opportunity to continue writing history, do something big and to let people enjoy it,\" Paredes added.Not only is it a chance for Spain to continue writing history, but winning would allow the players to celebrate properly - without the cloud of controversy that followed their World Cup win hanging over the group.Who are the key players to watch?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lauren James (left) and Alexia Putellas are key players for their teamsLauren James was a doubt this week after coming off at half-time in England's semi-final win against Italy with an ankle injury.But she was in full training on Saturday and Wiegman said all 23 players \"came through\" the session.The Chelsea forward has scored two goals at the tournament and was a standout performer in the group stages.Arsenal winger Chloe Kelly has a goal and an assist in five substitute appearances, while teenager Michelle Agyemang has netted two goals when coming off the bench on three occasions. After being discharged from hospital just days before the Euros started after suffering from viral meningitis, Aitana Bonmati had to be patient to make her mark. But the Barcelona midfielder turned up when it mattered, scoring an extra-time winner against Germany to send Spain to their first Euro final.Fellow Barca midfielder Alexia Putellas, meanwhile, has been in top form since the beginning - scoring three goals and assisting another four, while she has also created more chances (18) than any other player.Apart from Spain's pair of two-time Ballon d'Or winners, striker Esther Gonzalez is the tournament's top scorer with four goals in five games. What individual awards are up for grabs?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Michelle Agyemang has scored two goals as a substitute in Euro 2025Gonzalez is also hoping to win the Golden Boot as the tournament's top-scorer, with her biggest challenger her team-mate Putellas just a goal behind.No England player has netted more than two goals in the tournament.There will also be competition for the Golden Ball, with several Spain players impressing, including Putellas - while England's Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton have been standout players.The Golden Glove for the most clean sheets is tied between Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll and Sweden's Jennifer Falk.Spain have kept three clean sheets as a team but Adriana Nanclares started the 5-0 win over Portugal in the group stage so Coll will need to keep out England if she is to win the award outright.Meanwhile, England's Agyemang is one of the favourites to win the young player of the tournament award, with Spain's Vicky Lopez, Switzerland's Iman Beney and Norway's Signe Gaupset her main competition.",
