  "text": "\"I haven't had that feeling for quite a long time.\"Chelsea captain Reece James marked his latest Premier League injury return by scoring a 95th-minute equaliser against Bournemouth with a pinpoint free-kick.The full-back has missed 21 games with hamstring injuries this season, managing just five Premier League outings.He looked elated after his brilliant free-kick hit the net, punching the air and roaring with delight while England manager Thomas Tuchel watched on from the stands.\"It was lonely and frustrating,\" James told BBC Radio 5 Live about his time away. \"I am really happy to be back helping the team.\"Has the 25-year-old finally turned a corner?James has suffered from knee and repeated hamstring issues over the past few seasons.Since he was made Chelsea captain at the start of last campaign, he has started just eight top-flight games.His previous league appearance had been an eight-minute cameo against Arsenal in November, with his last goal coming against AC Milan in October 2022.On Saturday, the England international returned from his latest two-month setback when he played 45 minutes against Morecambe in the FA Cup.With his game time being managed, he came on in the 56th minute against Bournemouth and generally impressed against tricky winger Antoine Semenyo.James' biggest impact on Tuesday, though, was in front of goal.Talisman Cole Palmer passed free-kick duties to James, who rewarded his team-mate's trust by curling in from 20 yards out.\"Reece can compare with Cole in terms of free-kicks because he is very good,\" said Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca. \"We decided for Reece and he scored and we are all happy, because at least we took a point.\"It was a strike that had \"pace, power and a little bit of swerve\", according to ex-Premier League striker Glenn Murray.\"He deserved it, those moments are difficult for every player,\" added Maresca. \"Now, the target for him is to be fit until the end and he will help us in the way we want to play.\"James, who has won 16 caps for his country, was also asked about a possible return to the national team.The defender has not appeared for England since March 2023, but told TNT Sports that manager Tuchel \"knows my capabilities\".James played some of his best football during Tuchel's spell at Chelsea, starting the 2021 Champions League final under the German.",
