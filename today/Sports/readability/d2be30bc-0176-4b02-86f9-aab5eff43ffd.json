(0:53)ESPN staffMar 9, 2025, 08:20 PM ETWe're getting close to NFL free agency, which begins with the legal negotiation window Monday. Players can officially sign with new teams after 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which is the start of the new league year.There has already been plenty of action this offseason, however. The franchise tag window closed at 4 p.m. ET on Tuesday, and two players (Bengals receiver Tee Higgins and Chiefs guard Trey Smith) were tagged. Teams can also agree to terms on trades, as we saw with the Steelers' deal for DK Metcalf and the Raiders' move for Geno Smith. Plus, a few big names have been released over the past few days, including Jags tight end Evan Engram and Chargers linebacker Joey Bosa.And of course, free agents can re-sign with their current teams (like Eagles linebacker Zack Baun and Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley) and players on existing deals can be extended -- like pass rushers Maxx Crosby and Myles Garrett (who became the highest paid non-QB) -- before free agency opens, too.We're tracking all of the action, including signings, notable trades, cap-saving releases and more. For more on NFL free agency, follow our coverage all week. \"Free Agency Countdown\" will start Monday at noon ET (ESPN2) with the latest news, and \"NFL Live\" will follow with reaction to the biggest deals at 4 p.m. ET (ESPN). coverage: Grading biggest deals | Ranking best free agents Offense free agent tiers | Defense free agent tiers Potential steals | Potential reaches Tag deadline winners, losersFree agency and trade market updates",
