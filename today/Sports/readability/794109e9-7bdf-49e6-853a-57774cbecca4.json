  "text": "Jul 15, 2025 9:15 PM EDTThe Sacramento Kings have had many legendary players over the course of their franchise’s history. Of course, the Kings have only one championship to their name, which came in 1951 when they were still the Rochester Royals. Despite the Kings’ struggles over their franchise’s history, they have produced a quite a few franchise legends and two of them made it onto Bleacher Report’s list of the top 100 players in NBA history. The two players who made bleacher Report’s list are Chris Weber, who was the 90th ranked player, and Oscar Robertson, who was ranked No. 14. For Webber, he dominated the first five seasons of his career with both the Golden State Warriors and Washington Bullets, now the Washington Wizards, but he turned into a superstar after being traded to Sacramento in 1998. In Sacramento, Webber blossomed into a star as he made four All-Star teams and was also a five-time All-NBA selection. Despite his success, the Kings were never able to make it over the hump and into the NBA Finals, mainly due to the dominance of the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs. While Webber found success in Sacramento, Robertson is known as arguably the greatest Kings player in the history of their franchise, though his career was spent went they were still known as the Cincinnati Royals. Robertson got off to a fast start in his career, winning Rookie of the Year and finishing fifth in the MVP race his rookie season. He then went on to win one MVP award during his career with the Kings and was also a 10-time All-Star and 10-time All-NBA selection and he also became the first player in league history to averaged a triple-double throughout the entirety of a season in 1961-62. Of course, Robertson left the Kings for the Milwaukee Bucks to join Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1970 where he won the only championship of his career. While these are the only two players the Kings had representing them on Bleacher Report’s list, they hope that some of their current stars can eventually make it in the future.
