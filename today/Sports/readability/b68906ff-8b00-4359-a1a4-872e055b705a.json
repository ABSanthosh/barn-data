The 2023 car is the most recent that can be used under F1's testing restrictions.The 2025 Ferrari will be unveiled on 19 February, when Hamilton and Leclerc will run it briefly at Fiorano.They then move on to the official pre-season test in Bahrain on 26-28 February.Among other issues, Hamilton will have to familiarise himself with the operating procedures of the Ferrari engine, having previously driven only Mercedes power-units in F1.Modern F1 engines are 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids with sophisticated energy recovery systems and complicated control processes, many of which are operated by the driver in the cockpit.Although the multiple power and performance modes of the various engines are all designed to do similar functions, each manufacturer has different software and operating procedures, with drivers requiring time to become familiar with them.",
