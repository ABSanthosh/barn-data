  "text": "Kevin de Bruyne received an emotional farewell at Etihad Stadium for the final time on Tuesday night - and the moment even brought manager Pep Guardiola to tears, who called it a \"sad day\".The 33-year-old will go down as a Manchester City legend and proclaimed he will \"always be here\" after the announcement that a statue will be built, external in his honour outside the stadium.Captain De Bruyne is set to depart this summer and started his last home game in City's 3-1 victory over Bournemouth, but the Premier League great bowed out in a somewhat abject manner.He had the chance to go out in style but missed a first-half sitter and was then sacrificed in the second half after Mateo Kovacic's sending off - a sad ending for such an illustrious career.De Bruyne said in his post-match speech: \"I wanted to play with creativity, I wanted to play with passion. I wanted to enjoy football and I hope everyone enjoyed it. \"Everybody has pushed me so hard inside and outside the club to be the best version of myself and these guys in front of me have made me better than I was before.\"It's an honour to play with these guys. I've made so many friends for life.\"The decade-long association has produced unprecedented success for City, while the player has etched himself into the club's history books by taking home an incredible 16 winners' medals during that period.Once the full-time whistle was blown, nothing was going to spoil his grand send-off as City players, staff and supporters paid tribute to their midfield maestro.Guardiola said: \"Everybody saw how much the people from Manchester City are connected with him and his family and how much love [they have].\"Titles are nice and everything that he has achieved, but when you leave after 10 years with this much respect and gratitude, there is nothing else better than that.\"I am part of that, the club will take the decision, but it is a sad day and he will be missed, there is no doubt about that.\"Guardiola added: \"When Kevin arrived here, I am pretty sure he was not a Man City fan, I don't know who he supports, but I am pretty sure he is a fan now and will be forever.\"That is because of the connection between all the people and him.\"On a night when 'The Boss' rolled into town, 'The King' waved goodbye for the final time.De Bruyne's face was plastered everywhere you looked on arrival at the stadium and although legendary US singer Bruce Springsteen may have been playing a few yards away at the Co-Op Live arena, this was the hottest ticket of the day.Merchandise stalls had scarves emblazoned with De Bruyne's name, as did the shirts of supporters, while the matchday programme has a mock-up of the player with the crown from the Premier League trophy atop his head.City had announced in the lead-up to kick-off that they had dedicated a mosaic and named a road after De Bruyne at the club's academy.It was also fitting that a playmaker that has created such artistry on the grass canvass has had a huge mural painted of him in Manchester's Northern Quarter.Once chants of \"ohh Kevin De Bruyne\" to Seven Nations Army died down, there was a buzz of anticipation each time he had his foot on the ball, willing him to showcase a goal or assist for one last time on their turf.The big moment could not have been planned any better - the ball laid to him on a plate, in front of an open goal, a couple of yards out, but De Bruyne in slow motion scooped the ball onto the bar.The 33-year-old had his head in his hands, so did the returning Rodri on the bench and City fans all around as the dream finale went awry.\"It's terrible,\" De Bruyne said of the miss. \"There's no excuses. My son is going to be very tough on me today.\"At full-time, a montage of his best moments over the past decade flashed up on the screen with messages from the likes of Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany, Raheem Sterling and Pablo Zabaleta.De Bruyne was given a guard of honour as he returned to the pitch with his wife and kids by his side.Then came the outpouring of emotion.The former Chelsea man struggled to hold it together during his speech in the middle of the park, as did a tearful Guardiola watching on from the sidelines.\"We want you to stay, Kevin de Bruyne, we want you to stay,\" was the chant that rung out from supporters but there appears to be no turning back, as he led his team-mates on a lap of appreciation before making an exit for one last time.Former City defender Micah Richards said: \"He lets his football do the talking. He's such a shy character but I have been meeting him over the years and seeing how humble he is and how great a player he is, it is just great to see.\"He has deserved his send-off. Everyone who's played with him speaks highly of him, and to do what he's one in the Premier League is just sensational.\"Guardiola holds De Bruyne in such high esteem that he described the Belgian as the \"second best\" passer he has worked with - after the great Lionel Messi.Since his debut in September 2015, De Bruyne has played 283 top-flight games and has provided 119 assists, second in the Premier League's all-time list behind Ryan Giggs' 162, and scored 72 goals.Those 190 goal involvements puts him fourth on the Premier League list during that period behind Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.With 843 chances created during that period, De Bruyne has been, by far, the most prolific creative player in the division, with Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes lagging behind in second with 535.The game against Bournemouth was De Bruyne's 142nd and final home league appearance for City, with only David Silva having played more Premier League games at the Etihad with 160.Asked what City meant to him, De Bruyne said it was \"home\", \"family\" and that his kid \"were Manc\".Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp said on Sky Sports: \"Who is the next De Bruyne in world football? They don't exist. He is like a unicorn, so don't even bother looking for another KDB.\"There is absolutely no doubt he is a genius. For him it is so easy.\"De Bruyne has made it clear he is not abdicating his throne by his own choice, saying he was surprised not to be offered a new contract by the club.While his next move could be to Chicago Fire in the US, attention will soon turn to the difficult task of finding a replacement.BBC Sport understands City are withdrawing their initial interest in Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz, owing to the soaring costs of any deal, but Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White is among the options.City, though, have two players at the club in Phil Foden and Jack Grealish that have played a bit-part role this term and could provide the answer if they can rediscover their form.\"He [De Bruyne] is irreplaceable,\" said Richards. \"I have been disappointed with Phil Foden, but he needs to step up now.\"There is a vacancy available and this is Foden's time.\"De Bruyne added: \"To do what we've done as a club, supporters, teammates we've won everything.\"We made the city, the club bigger and now they're going to take over.\"",
