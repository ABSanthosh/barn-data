(0:17)Philadelphia 76ers forward Paul George is consulting with doctors this week on treatment options for his groin and knee injuries, including a possible procedure, sources told ESPN.A decision is expected early next week as George meets with doctors to finalize the best route, sources said.George, 34, has played through groin, finger and knee ailments this season, battling multiple injuries over the past month. According to sources, he took painkilling injections for five consecutive games before the NBA All-Star break in February.George, who signed a four-year, $212 million max deal with the 76ers in July after five seasons with the LA Clippers, is averaging 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists in 41 games.During the preseason, George suffered a hyperextension of his left knee that forced him to miss the first five games of the regular season. He then hyperextended the same knee in November, which cost him three games. In January, he injured his left pinkie finger, and he most recently has been sidelined with left groin soreness that has forced him to miss Philadelphia's past four games.George announced late last month that he was stepping away from his podcast -- \"Podcast P with Paul George\" -- to focus on his health and turning around the 76ers' season.\"I haven't been the healthiest, so it's just been putting a ton of work towards getting my body as healthy as possible, and to keep focus of obviously being here and trying to turn things around here and the full focus is trying to get this team together,\" George said of the decision to pause his podcast.Philadelphia on Feb. 28 ruled out 2022-23 league MVP Joel Embiid for the rest of the season, and now George is likely headed down the same route.Philadelphia's first-round pick in this year's NBA draft is top-six protected; otherwise, the selection goes to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The 76ers (22-43) have hovered around having the sixth- or seventh-worst record in the league in recent weeks.",
