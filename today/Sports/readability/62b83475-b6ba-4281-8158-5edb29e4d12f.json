Prior to ESPN, he worked for various newspapers in Texas, most recently at The Dallas Morning News where he covered college sports. He provides daily coverage of the Bengals for ESPN.com, while making appearances on SportsCenter, ESPN's NFL shows and ESPN Radio programs. A native of Grapevine, Texas, he graduated from the University of North Texas with a bachelor's degree in journalism. He is an adjunct journalism professor at Southern Methodist University and a member of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA).CINCINNATI -- For the second straight year, Bengals star defensive end Trey Hendrickson sought permission to seek a trade.This time his request was granted. Cincinnati's front office is allowing Hendrickson to seek out a new team.Hendrickson expressed gratitude for the ability to find a new club despite having one year left on his current contract, telling ESPN's Adam Schefter: \"It's been an honor and a privilege to represent Cincinnati over the last four years. I love this city and organization. I appreciate the privilege of now being allowed to explore my options.\"Hendrickson, 30, is coming off his best season. In 2024, he led the NFL with 17.5 sacks and was selected as a first-team All-Pro. Hendrickson and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase were the franchise's first All-Pro selections since 2015. Hendrickson also reached the Pro Bowl for the fourth straight year.Two years ago, Hendrickson signed a one-year extension to the original four-year, $60 million deal he signed with the Bengals in 2021. In 2025, he is set to earn $15.8 million in base salary, along with a $200,000 roster bonus, and represent a cap hit of $18.7 million.Since signing with the Bengals, Hendrickson has been one of the NFL's best pass rushers. He ranks third in pressure rate during that span, according to ESPN Research, and is third in total sacks (57), trailing fellow division rivals Myles Garrett (60) and T.J. Watt (58.5). However, his average annual salary ranks 11th among all edge rushers.Hendrickson was one of three players seeking a long-term deal from the Bengals this offseason.Chase is seeking to become the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history, a sentiment echoed by de facto general manager Duke Tobin, who said at the scouting combine that the Bengals plan to make that happen. Wide receiver Tee Higgins is also seeking a new contract following his fifth season in the league.Higgins has also been given the franchise tag for the second straight year. However, the team has indicated it still wants to sign the 2020 second-round pick to a long-term contract.Hendrickson's granted request also comes one day after Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby agreed to terms on a three-year extension that pays him $35.5 million annually, which is the current record for a non-quarterback. Crosby ranks seventh in total sacks since 2021.Hendrickson foreshadowed a potential trade scenario when speaking on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" in February during Super Bowl week.\"If it's something that helps the Bengals win the Super Bowl, if they get picks or anything like that, I want to help win a Super Bowl for Cincinnati,\" Hendrickson said on Feb. 5. \"Whether I'm there or not.\"",
