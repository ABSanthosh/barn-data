  "text": "There are few more famous comeback wins in Manchester United's history than their 1999 Champions League triumph.That night at the Nou Camp, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær struck in injury time to overturn Bayern Munich's early 1-0 lead and win European club football's most coveted prize.While Thursday's night's dramatic and unexpected comeback victory against Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals is not of the same magnitude as that famous night 26 years ago, it motivated Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim to experience such moments himself.\"I was watching again the 1999 documentary to have some inspiration for these moments,\" Amorim revealed to TNT Sports after the 5-4 win against 10-man Lyon, during which United scored three goals in the final six minutes of extra time to seal a 7-6 aggregate win.\"It was a great night - 4-2 with one more player you think it's over, but here it is never over. I felt here everything is possible.\"United are 14th in the Premier League but despite the disappointing season they are just three games away from a European trophy and with it direct access to the Champions League next season.It had looked like United would make comfortable progress after goals from Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot in a commanding first-half display had them in control.But they proceeded to throw away the two-goal advantage as Corentin Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico struck to level the tie and take the game to extra time.Even though Lyon had Tolisso sent off in the final minute of normal time, Rayan Cherki put the French side ahead before Alexandre Lacazette's penalty looked to have sent them through, prompting some United fans to leave and beat the traffic.But then came the incredible fightback as Bruno Fernandes' penalty and Kobbie Mainoo's cool finish levelled matters, before Old Trafford erupted when Harry Maguire headed in the winner with seconds remaining.\"The sounds of the stadium was the best ever,\" Amorim added. \"Some people collect shirts, scarves, but I want to keep that sound, it's the best sound in the world.\"I feel for the people who had to leave at 4-2 because of the traffic, they will be gutted.\"We know we are underperforming and deserve all the critics, but we have time to make something special of this season.\"Maguire agreed with his manager that the Old Trafford atmosphere was something that helped the players stage one of the most memorable comebacks.\"To go down 4-2 in extra time to 10 men is not good enough, we opened ourselves too much,\" he said. \"But we dug in and showed great spirit, that's what this stadium does.\"Maguire's goal was the first 120th-minute winning goal scored in Europa League history and the first in a major European tie since Atletico Madrid beat Liverpool at Anfield in March 2020This was only the second 5-4 win in United's history, along with their 5-4 victory over Arsenal in the top flight in February 1958.This is the first game in major European football history to see five goals scored after extra time.Fernandes has scored 14 penalty goals in major European competitions (three for Sporting, 11 for United) - only Robert Lewandowski (20), Cristiano Ronaldo (20) and Lionel Messi (18) have scored more.",
