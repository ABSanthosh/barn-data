  "text": "Tennessee football coach Josh Heupel spent Father’s Day as a dad recruiting, just as he did for much of his childhood as a son.Heupel said he used to skip school to travel with his dad on recruiting trips, an annual tradition that often frustrated his mother. But it was easier on Father’s Day.This past holiday, Heupel hosted recruits who were taking official visits to UT’s campus. He arrived at home just in time to help his wife, Dawn, prepare a Father’s Day dinner alongside daughter Hannah and son Jace.“I helped out on the grill a bit. I wasn’t the main chef, but I was the sous chef,” Heupel said. “But it was a great night hanging out with the kids. Even though time may be short, it’s about being present when you’re with them.”It’s that lifelong father-son experience in football that led Heupel to volunteer his time and wisdom to the All Pro Dad Experience on June 18 at Neyland Stadium.A sellout crowd of 1,200 fathers and sons packed the field, participated in football activities and heard Heupel’s advice during the nonprofit organization’s event.“It’s an organization started by (Pro Football Hall of Fame coach) Tony Dungy specifically targeting ways to make a difference in families and help dads be the best versions of themselves,” Heupel said. “It gives dads a shared experience with their kids and helps kids be their best, too.”Josh Heupel learned how to be a coaching dad from his fatherHeupel didn’t have to dig deep for examples of how football shaped his fatherhood and childhood. His dad, Ken Heupel, was a longtime high school and college football coach, including 19 years at Northern State University, a Division II school in Aberdeen, South Dakota. Ken retired in 2005.Josh's mother, Cindy Heupel, died in 2024.As a kid, Josh rode alongside his dad on the team bus, attended team meetings and watched \"NFL Films\" with players while scarfing down burgers on Friday nights.Josh’s son, Jace, is heading into his freshman year of high school and he has spent his childhood going through the same routine, including the past four years with the Vols.UT fans recognize Jace because they see him catching passes from his dad on the field before each Vols football game.Jace also attends some practices and team meetings, and works in the equipment room and hangs out with players in the locker room.“By hanging out with our (players) and seeing them work hard, it allows him to dream big and learn how to be a great teammate,” Josh Heupel said. “Spending time with my dad gave me the vision that you have to incorporate your family in everything you do, and that’s true whether you’re in the game of football or any busy career.“Any sacrifice you make in doing that is always worth it.”Adam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.
