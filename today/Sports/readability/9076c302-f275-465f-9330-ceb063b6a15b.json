  "text": "NFL Nation, ESPNDec 24, 2024, 07:00 AM ETWeek 17 of the 2024 NFL season is here, so we're almost at the finish line. It's crunch time for many teams looking to break into the playoffs by claiming a spot in the wild-card race. So which teams are trending upward?The No. 1 team in last week's Power Rankings, the Philadelphia Eagles, lost a heartbreaker, which brought movement atop of the list. Plus, with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Texans, Denver Broncos and Arizona Cardinals losing, the middle pack shuffled.In addition to our rankings, we asked our NFL Nation reporters to pick the rookie of the year for each team. From standout quarterbacks to dynamic defenders, which first-year players stood out from the rest?Let's start with a familiar team reclaiming the No. 1 spot.Our power panel of more than 80 writers, editors and TV personalities evaluates how NFL teams stack up against one another, ranking them from 1 to 32.Previous rankings: Preseason | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 | Week 5 | Week 6 | Week 7 | Week 8 | Week 9 | Week 10 | Week 11 | Week 12 | Week 13 | Week 14 | Week 15 | Week 16Jump to a team: ARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND JAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF SEA | TB | TEN | WSH1. Kansas City Chiefs (14-1)Week 16 result: Beat the Texans 27-19 Week 16 ranking: 2Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Xavier WorthyWorthy is the Chiefs' leading wideout with 51 catches, 559 yards and 5 touchdowns. He also has 94 yards and 3 touchdowns as a runner. He was quarterback Patrick Mahomes' receiver of choice in Saturday's win over the Texans, with 11 targets, 7 receptions, 65 yards and the Chiefs' only receiving touchdown. He has grown over the course of the season in his ability to win on short, intermediate and deeper routes. -- Adam Teicher2. Detroit Lions (13-2)Week 16 result: Beat the Bears 34-17 Week 16 ranking: 3Rookie of the year: Cornerback Terrion ArnoldArnold has been a pivotal player in Detroit's first 13-win team with 52 total tackles and nine passes defended. Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn says Arnold has \"ice water in his veins\" and has high expectations for him going forward. \"We're putting a lot of pressure on this player by the way that we play, but there's no other way that he would want it,\" Glenn said Dec. 12. \"So, I'm glad we've got him for the simple fact that he's going to be one of the top corners in this league as his years progress.\" -- Eric Woodyard3. Philadelphia Eagles (12-3)Week 16 result: Lost to the Commanders 36-33 Week 16 ranking: 1Rookie of the year: Cornerback Quinyon MitchellMitchell, the Eagles' first-round pick, is in contention for Rookie Defensive Player of the Year. He is tied for eighth with 10 passes defensed despite being targeted just 61 times. Quarterbacks are completing 56% of their throws in his direction while averaging 6.4 yards per target. A key figure for the league's No. 2 passing defense, Mitchell has allowed one touchdown in 906 snaps. The only thing that's missing from his résumé is interceptions (zero). -- Tim McManus4. Buffalo Bills (12-3)Week 16 result: Beat the Patriots 24-21 Week 16 ranking: 4Rookie of the year: Running back Ray DavisWide receiver Keon Coleman is a strong candidate, but Davis gets the nod because of his complete season despite splitting carries with James Cook, who is having one of the top scoring seasons in franchise history. The fourth-round pick has 92 carries for 369 yards and three touchdowns, as well as 14 receptions for 184 yards and two receiving touchdowns. \"He runs the ball very hard,\" quarterback Josh Allen said. \"He packs a punch, but he's very decisive in his running, and I think that makes him very good for this team.\" -- Alaina Getzenberg5. Minnesota Vikings (13-2)Week 16 result: Beat the Seahawks 27-24 Week 16 ranking: 5Rookie of the year: Kicker Will ReichardReichard, a sixth-round pick, has had an impressive year despite missing four games because of a quadriceps injury. He has made 19 of 22 field goal attempts and all 35 of his extra points. Two of the three misses came in a game he tried to push through after suffering the injury. Reichard was particularly impressive in Week 16, drilling field goals of 52 and 48 yards on a rainy afternoon at Seattle's Lumen Field. -- Kevin Seifert6. Baltimore Ravens (10-5)Week 16 result: Beat the Steelers 34-17 Week 16 ranking: 8Rookie of the year: Offensive tackle Roger RosengartenRosengarten is the starting right tackle for an offense that ranks first in total yards (423.7) and third in scoring (29.3). A second-round pick out of Washington, he has excelled opening lanes for running back Derrick Henry, ranking second among all tackles with an 83.8% run block win rate. \"Nothing really phases him,\" coach John Harbaugh said. \"He's a very confident guy. At the same time, I don't think he thinks he's ever going to arrive. He's very tenacious, and it's paying off.\" -- Jamison Hensleyplay1:43Mark Andrews to McAfee: Lamar is playing better than everRavens tight end Mark Andrews joins \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and shares his excitement about Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry's play and the team's positive momentum.7. Green Bay Packers (11-4)Week 16 result: Beat the Saints 34-0 Week 16 ranking: 6Rookie of the year: Linebacker Edgerrin CooperCooper, a second-round pick, has won the NFC Defensive Player of the Week award twice. Not defensive rookie of the week, defensive player of the week. Despite missing three games because of a hamstring injury, he's the only rookie in the NFL this season with three-plus sacks, an interception, a fumble recovery and a forced fumble. \"There's literally nothing he's physically not able to do,\" defensive end Kingsley Enagbare said of Cooper. \"The sky's the limit for him. He's going to be a hell of a player one day -- or continue to be a hell of a player.\" -- Rob Demovsky8. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-5)Week 16 result: Lost to the Ravens 34-17 Week 16 ranking: 7Rookie of the year: Center Zach FrazierWith an interception and two fumble recoveries (including one for a touchdown), inside linebacker Payton Wilson also has a strong case for this title. But Frazier, who ranks third among all centers in run block win rate (73.7%), has been a difference-maker at a position that has struggled to find continuity since the retirement of Maurkice Pouncey in 2021. Though the Steelers' run game has slowed recently, it still ranks 11th in the league (126 yards per game), and Frazier is a big reason. -- Brooke Pryor9. Washington Commanders (10-5)Week 16 result: Beat the Eagles 36-33 Week 16 ranking: 10Rookie of the year: Quarterback Jayden DanielsThe No. 2 pick will likely be the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year, so there's no doubt he's also that for Washington. Daniels is a key reason the Commanders have won 10 games for the first time since 2012. He has thrown for 3,303 yards and 22 touchdowns and is tied for first with 11 in the fourth quarter. He also owns the NFL's fourth-highest QBR at 71.9, trailing only Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson and top-rated Josh Allen. Daniels also has rushed for 737 yards and six touchdowns. -- John Keim10. Houston Texans (9-6)Week 16 result: Lost to the Chiefs 27-19 Week 16 ranking: 9Rookie of the year: Cornerback Kamari LassiterLassiter has locked down at his position, allowing the lowest completion percentage among cornerbacks with at least 200 coverage snaps (43.8%). He has played a huge role in the Texans having the sixth-best pass defense (200.5 passing yards per game). He also holds up long enough in coverage to let the Texans' pass rush, led by Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr.'s combined 22.5 sacks, to get home to the quarterback. -- DJ Bien-Aime11. Los Angeles Chargers (9-6)Week 16 result: Beat the Broncos 34-27 Week 16 ranking: 12Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Ladd McConkeyRight tackle Joe Alt and cornerback Tarheeb Still have strong cases, but McConkey has been the Chargers' most important offensive player not named Justin Herbert. McConkey and Herbert have already become one of the league's best quarterback-receiver pairings. Out of 34 QB-receiver combos with at least 75 targets this season, the two rank in the top five of QBR, completion percentage and yards per attempt. McConkey leads the Chargers in receptions (69), targets (94) and yards (960). -- Kris Rhim12. Los Angeles Rams (9-6)Week 16 result: Beat the Jets 19-9 Week 16 ranking: 13Rookie of the year: Outside linebacker Jared VerseThe outside linebacker has 66 quarterback pressures this season, which ranks first among rookies (17 more pressures than the Dolphins' Chop Robinson, who ranks No. 2). The Rams drafted Verse with their first Round 1 pick since 2016, and he has been a difference-maker for a defense that lost star defensive tackle Aaron Donald this offseason. -- Sarah Barshop13. Denver Broncos (9-6)Week 16 result: Lost to the Chargers 34-27 Week 16 ranking: 11Rookie of the year: Quarterback Bo NixThe salary-cap-strapped Broncos have had appearances from six of their seven draft picks this season, but Nix has started from the first snap. He's tied for 10th in the league in touchdown passes (22), including 12 in the past six games. The 24-year-old has been repeatedly lauded by his teammates for his work ethic, composure and leadership. Nix is coach Sean Payton's first rookie starter at quarterback in his long tenure as a head coach. Payton believes Nix is the long-term solution at the position for a team that has sought one since Peyton Manning retired after the 2015 season. -- Jeff Legwold14. Atlanta Falcons (8-7)Week 16 result: Beat the Giants 34-7 Week 16 ranking: 17Rookie of the year: Quarterback Michael Penix Jr.The No. 8 pick got his first start Sunday and performed well. Overall, between that and garbage-time snaps, Penix is 21-of-32 for 240 yards with no touchdowns and an interception that wasn't his fault. Other than Penix, the Falcons have not gotten as much as they'd hoped from their 2024 draft class. Second-rounder Ruke Orhorhoro has played in just six games because of injury, and third-round pick Bralen Trice tore an ACL in the preseason. Linebacker JD Bertrand, running back Jase McClellan and wide receiver Casey Washington have all been injured, too. -- Marc Raimondiplay2:08Adam Schefter breaks down Kirk Cousins' Falcons futureAdam Schefter lays out the decision ahead for the Falcons after benching Kirk Cousins.15. Cincinnati Bengals (7-8)Week 16 result: Beat the Browns 24-6 Week 16 ranking: 18Rookie of the year: Right tackle Amarius MimsDating back to offseason workouts, Mims has proven he has the talent to be a starting tackle for years to come. In his most extensive action dating back to high school, he has handled the workload well and shored up the right side of pass protection for quarterback Joe Burrow. Even though Mims' 83.5% pass block win rate ranks 57th of 67 qualifying tackles, he has allowed just four sacks, per ESPN Research. -- Ben Baby16. Seattle Seahawks (8-7)Week 16 result: Lost to the Vikings 27-24 Week 16 ranking: 15Rookie of the year: Linebacker Tyrice KnightDefensive tackle Byron Murphy II is having a better season than his underwhelming stats suggest, but Knight's production gives him the nod. The fourth-round pick went from fill-in to full-time starter in Week 11. Along with Ernest Jones IV, he has helped solidify an inside linebacker corps that was remade on the fly. Knight ranks fourth on the team with 72 tackles, including three for loss and a sack. -- Brady Henderson17. Miami Dolphins (7-8)Week 16 result: Beat the 49ers 29-17 Week 16 ranking: 20Rookie of the year: Outside linebacker Chop RobinsonNo disrespect to receiver Malik Washington or even offensive lineman Patrick Paul, but Robinson has been one of the Dolphins' best defensive players overall. He became a starter in Week 5 and leads all rookies with six sacks -- closing in on Jaelan Phillips' franchise rookie record of 8.5. Since Week 5, Robinson has the league's third-highest pressure rate (15.2%) and the fifth-highest pass rush win rate (21.7%). Some fans questioned general manager Chris Grier taking a pass rusher in the first round with both Phillips and Bradley Chubb on the roster, but Robinson, the No. 21 overall pick, looks like one of the best value selections. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques18. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-7)Week 16 result: Lost to the Cowboys 26-24 Week 16 ranking: 14Rookie of the year: Running back Bucky IrvingDespite not even technically being the No. 1 running back on his own team -- and being hampered by a toe, hip and back injuries -- Irving's 1,240 scrimmage yards are the most of any Bucs player and the most of any rookie. The fourth-rounder ranks 19th in scrimmage yards and 16th among all running backs. Irving has shown an exceptional ability to slip tackles. His forced missed tackle rate of 36.8% is the highest among all players with at least 50 touches. -- Jenna Laine19. Dallas Cowboys (7-8)Week 16 result: Beat the Buccaneers 26-24 Week 16 ranking: 21Rookie of the year: Center Cooper BeebeBeebe, the Cowboys' third-round pick, has started every game he has played, missing one because of a concussion. He had never played center in a game before this season, but he has handled the responsibility well with minimal issues snapping the ball. He has been solid with his calls, though he might need to be more authoritative, which should come with more experience. A full offseason program will make him stronger, and he moves well enough to give the Cowboys options in the run game. -- Todd Archer20. Arizona Cardinals (7-8)Week 16 result: Lost to the Panthers 36-30 Week 16 ranking: 16Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr.While cornerback Max Melton made a strong push for the team's rookie of the year, Harrison has had more of an impact without putting up gaudy numbers. The No. 4 pick has 51 catches for 726 yards and seven touchdowns. His presence has changed how defenses approach Arizona, opening up the field for other offensive players, thus impacting the team more than what shows up in the box score. -- Josh Weinfuss21. Indianapolis Colts (7-8)Week 16 result: Beat the Titans 38-30 Week 16 ranking: 22Rookie of the year: Defensive end Laiatu LatuLatu has been quieter in recent weeks after creating significant disruption earlier in the season. He still ranks second on his team with 41 quarterback pressures despite being fourth in snap counts among the Colts' defensive linemen. Latu is also third among all rookies in pressures. He has only four sacks, but he has had several near misses, and the Colts think he'll eventually convert those into takedowns. And when Latu has managed to get sacks, he has made them count with two strip sacks. -- Stephen Holder22. San Francisco 49ers (6-9)Week 16 result: Lost to the Dolphins 29-17 Week 16 ranking: 19Rookie of the year: Offensive lineman Dominick PuniPuni has been an instant success on an otherwise struggling offensive line. Through 16 games, he's tied for 12th in pass block win rate (93.7%) and ninth in run block win rate (73.9%) among all guards. The Niners have plenty of other holes to fill on their offensive line in the offseason, but they can take some solace in the fact that Puni has consistently performed since claiming the starting job in training camp. -- Nick Wagoner23. New Orleans Saints (5-10)Week 16 result: Lost to the Packers 34-0 Week 16 ranking: 23Rookie of the year: Left tackle Taliese FuagaThe Saints put Fuaga at starting left tackle early in the preseason, and he has been one of only two players to take almost every offensive snap (along with right tackle Trevor Penning). Fuaga has been one of the most consistently reliable and available players in a season full of injuries at every position. -- Katherine Terrell24. Carolina Panthers (4-11)Week 16 result: Beat the Cardinals 36-30 Week 16 ranking: 28Rookie of the year: Inside linebacker Trevin WallaceSo much of the Panthers' rookie class has been impacted by injuries, including Wallace, who is on injured reserve and out for the rest of the season because of a shoulder injury. Before his injury, the third-rounder had started eight out of 13 games, replacing veteran Shaq Thompson after he was lost for the season in Week 2. Wallace is still sixth on the team in tackles (64) and showed promise of being a fixture inside for years to come. -- David Newton25. Chicago Bears (4-11)Week 16 result: Lost to the Lions 34-17 Week 16 ranking: 24Rookie of the year: Quarterback Caleb WilliamsThe No. 1 pick has been a bright spot in a disappointing season for the Bears. Williams became the first rookie in franchise history to throw for 3,000 yards and is on pace to finish with the third-most passing yards (3,707) in a season by a Bears quarterback. While it hasn't always looked pretty amid a nine-game losing streak, he has raised a very low bar for quarterback play in Chicago and generated optimism for the future. -- Courtney Cronin26. New York Jets (4-11)Week 16 result: Lost to the Rams 19-9 Week 16 ranking: 26Rookie of the year: Left tackle Olu FashanuIt's a relatively small body of work (seven starts, 503 snaps), but Fashanu -- a first-round pick -- has demonstrated the skills necessary to be a long-term starting left tackle. He has the foot speed and awareness to develop into a top pass protector. Right now, his issue is consistency. He ranks 41st among qualified tackles in pass block win rate (87.6%). He also has to clean up his technique (seven holding penalties). Fashanu's status for the next two weeks is up in the air, as he suffered a foot injury Sunday. -- Rich Ciminiplay1:59Rodgers says he'd be open to mentoring a rookie QB next year on JetsAaron Rodgers joins Pat McAfee to discuss the possibility of mentoring a rookie quarterback next season with the Jets.27. New England Patriots (3-12)Week 16 result: Lost to the Bills 24-21 Week 16 ranking: 27Rookie of the year: Quarterback Drake MayeMaye is the obvious choice because of how well he has played ... and the lack of impact from most of the rest of the Patriots' rookie class. Maye has completed 67.6% of passes for 2,159 yards with 14 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while adding 48 rushes for 389 yards. He has thrown at least one touchdown in each of the past seven games, tying Jim Plunkett's record for a New England rookie quarterback (1971). -- Mike Reiss28. Cleveland Browns (3-12)Week 16 result: Lost to the Bengals 24-6 Week 16 ranking: 25Rookie of the year: Defensive tackle Mike Hall Jr.The Browns haven't received many contributions from their rookie class, but Hall has been a bright spot amid a disappointing season. His playing time has increased in recent weeks because of injuries to veterans, and he recorded his first career sack against the Bengals. He has played in only six games because of suspension and injuries, but he has recorded an 11.9% pressure rate, which would rank 15th if he had enough snaps to qualify. As Cleveland looks to retool its roster in 2025, Hall is a building block. -- Daniel Oyefusi29. Tennessee Titans (3-12)Week 16 result: Lost to the Colts 38-30 Week 16 ranking: 29Rookie of the year: Cornerback Jarvis Brownlee Jr.Brownlee has only one interception, but he is consistently around the ball with eight passes defended. The fifth-round pick snatched a starting role when veteran free agent additions Chidobe Awuzie and L'Jarius Sneed went down with injuries. Brownlee gladly took on assignments against two of the best receivers in the game when he helped keep Justin Jefferson and Ja'Marr Chase under 100 receiving yards each. \"He was going up against well-respected receivers that a lot of people don't challenge,\" defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson said. \"He was press, being physical, rerouting and stayed connected at the top of the routes.\" -- Turron Davenport30. Jacksonville Jaguars (3-12)Week 16 result: Lost to the Raiders 19-14 Week 16 ranking: 30Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr.Not only has he set franchise rookie records for catches (73), receiving yards (1,088) and receiving touchdowns (nine), but Thomas also leads all rookie pass catchers in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns and yards per catch (14.9). Offensive coordinator Press Taylor said this week that Thomas' football IQ is so high he learned all three receiver spots and can operate from a high level at each. He has had two games with 100 receiving yards and a touchdown this season, which is tied with Allen Hurns for most by a rookie in team history. -- Michael DiRocco31. Las Vegas Raiders (3-12)Week 16 result: Beat the Jaguars 19-14 Week 16 ranking: 31Rookie of the year: Tight end Brock BowersFrom \"Brocktimus Prime\" to the \"Brocket Man,\" no nickname leveled upon Bowers yet by Raiders radio announcer Jason Horowitz has quite captured the rookie's impact upon the team. His 101 catches are tied for second in the NFL and already a league record for most catches in a season by a rookie tight end. He is five catches away from breaking Puka Nacua's year-old record for most receptions by any rookie and needs just 10 yards to break Mike Ditka's record (1,077) for most receiving yards in a season by a first-year tight end. Bowers is in line to become the fourth rookie tight end in league history named first-team All-Pro. -- Paul Gutierrez32. New York Giants (2-13)Week 16 result: Lost to the Falcons 34-7 Week 16 ranking: 32Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Malik NabersNabers set the team's rookie receptions record Sunday, passing two pretty good players in Odell Beckham Jr. and Saquon Barkley with his 92nd catch of the season. \"Kudos to me but ... we didn't win,\" Nabers said afterward. He's doing damage in a difficult situation as the Giants and their offense stumble to the finish line. Nabers is now at 97 catches for 969 yards with two games remaining. So he's almost certainly going to top 100 catches and 1,000 yards, albeit while leading the league in targets (155) and averaging just 10 yards per catch. -- Jordan Raanan",

Bowers is in line to become the fourth rookie tight end in league history named first-team All-Pro. \u003cem\u003e-- Paul Gutierrez\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyg.png?w=110\u0026amp;h=110\u0026amp;transparent=true\" width=\"31\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e32. \u003ca data-clubhouse-guid=\"378600ea-2397-8364-8399-b7c1606a49a7\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\"\u003eNew York Giants\u003c/a\u003e (2-13)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 16 result:\u003c/strong\u003e Lost to the Falcons \u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401671729/giants-falcons\"\u003e34-7\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 16 ranking:\u003c/strong\u003e 32\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/nba/misc/sw_ye_40.png\" width=\"17\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRookie of the year:\u003c/strong\u003e Wide receiver \u003ca data-player-guid=\"44a2174b-1d11-3acf-8e75-fe0c13db47a6\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4595348/malik-nabers\"\u003eMalik Nabers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNabers set the team\u0026#39;s rookie receptions record Sunday, passing two pretty good players in \u003ca data-player-guid=\"5d48f58b-0d2b-a3bc-6230-ed9284c7158a\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr\"\u003eOdell Beckham Jr\u003c/a\u003e. and \u003ca data-player-guid=\"94486c18-dd3e-6081-a3fe-4a26b71ddcdc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\"\u003eSaquon Barkley\u003c/a\u003e with his 92nd catch of the season. \u0026#34;Kudos to me but ... we didn\u0026#39;t win,\u0026#34; Nabers said afterward. He\u0026#39;s doing damage in a difficult situation as the Giants and their offense stumble to the finish line. Nabers is now at 97 catches for 969 yards with two games remaining.
