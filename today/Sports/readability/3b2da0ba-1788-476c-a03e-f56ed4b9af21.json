  "text": "As the White Stripes hit Seven Nation Army pumped out over the Etihad Stadium speakers at full-time on Friday night, Manchester City supporters sang the name of hero Kevin de Bruyne to that very tune.The midfielder is bidding an emotional farewell after 10 trophy-laden years at the club, and the Belgian soaked up the acclaim by taking the long route around the pitch before heading down the tunnel.The 33-year-old will be disappearing for good when his City contract expires in the summer, but here he was able to enjoy another deserved moment in the limelight - his penultimate game at the Etihad.De Bruyne struck the only goal in the 1-0 Premier League victory against in-form Wolves, which may ensure City play Champions League football next season.The midfielder said last month he was surprised not to be offered a new contract - and wanted to make a point about his abilities after the game.\"I don't know about the future unfortunately,\" a serious-looking De Bruyne told Sky Sports. \"I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don't do what I do these last four or five weeks.\"A lot of team-mates have spoken to me, they are sad also that I have to go. It goes like this in life, but the way I am performing is the way I should be.\"I just try to play as well as I can. I have one game left here. I try to do my job as always and I did that. I am proud of what I am doing.\"De Bruyne will undoubtedly go down as one of the Premier League's best midfielders when he departs in the summer.The former Chelsea and Wolfsburg player has stacked his trophy cabinet by winning all there is to win at City - an impressive haul of 16 trophies.A succession of injuries have taken their toll, and De Bruyne's influence on the pitch appears to be waning by not being the pass-master of old.But he showed a glimpse of what he is still capable off by converting a cool, first-time finish from Jeremy Doku's cross.The skipper was afforded a standing ovation when he was replaced by Phil Foden with six minutes to go, and was given a pat on the head by Guardiola after coming off.\"Just thank you,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"His contribution in the game against Crystal Palace when we were 2-0 down and he delivers, and today the goal again.\"I am happy that it is finishing that way, and we have one more game in the Etihad.\"I want the best for Kevin so it cannot be possible to have done these many years without him. He has been an incredible player - but the situation is what it is.\"It's almost impossible to replace this kind of player. It is not just the performance, it is what he means to the heart for our fans for many, many years. The success we have belongs to the players.\"Guardiola added: \"I am pretty sure it is not easy for him but the goal was massively important for us - it lifted our spirits.\"He does not have to prove anything. I know his quality, his level.\"De Bruyne's final home game will come against Bournemouth on 20 May, with away matches to play at Southampton and Fulham.And he can ensure a dream ending if City beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley.\"Maybe he is still good enough to play here,\" said former Manchester City defender Micah Richards.\"Maybe he hasn't the press, but quality - he believes he can still play at the top level. He has said he is playing injury-free now.\"Age catches up though with you, and your body can't do what you want to do. But he keeps the ball and his football intelligence is still there. He is telling the club 'I can still play at this level'.\"I am talking as a fan, and I am a fan of KDB. Something in me just says 'one more year' - he can still do it. Maybe it is just a business decision.\"Does Richards have a point?De Bruyne has scored 30 Premier League goals since turning 30 years old, with Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure the only players to score more for City with 41 apiece.He became the first player since the great Lionel Messi to register 250 goal involvements under Guardiola, with 92 goals and 158 assists in nine seasons.Meanwhile, Wolves will be glad to see the back of De Bruyne as the midfielder has now scored six goals and provided five assists in 11 league games against them.But over the past two seasons, the Belgian has made just 43 Premier League appearances because of a series of injuries.Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said De Bruyne is still \"levels above the elite players in the world\", adding: \"He doesn't think he has finished at the top level. \"He still thinks he can play at the top level of European football. I thought maybe he would go to Saudi Arabia or America, but after hearing him speak, it sounds like he isn't ready for that.\"He is one of the highest-paid players in world football and has been injured a lot. It has been hard to justify giving him a new deal from a business point of view. He is still a star player but he is not going to play every week.\"Let's talk about the statue - for me he is Manchester City's greatest ever player.\"",
