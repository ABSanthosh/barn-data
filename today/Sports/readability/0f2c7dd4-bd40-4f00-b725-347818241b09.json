If preffered lies had been in place, they would have been allowed to lift, clean and replace their balls.After a series of pars towards the end of his first round, five-time major winner McIlroy ended with another dropped shot on his final hole.He hit just four of 14 fairways from the tee, a statistic he must improve if he is to move back into contention.However, McIlroy has shown already this year that he can recover from a big first-round deficit to win one of the sport's biggest prizes - he was seven shots behind Justin Rose after round one at the Masters before coming back to win the Green Jacket.McIlroy's second round set to begin at 18:47 BST on Friday.'I'm here only because I'm captain of the European Ryder Cup team'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Luke Donald captained Europe to Ryder Cup victory in 2023 and will lead the side again at Bethpage Black in SeptemberDonald, who hit the first shot of the tournament at 07:00 local time, is one of several surprising names to be found near the top of the leaderboard.The 47-year-old is ranked 871st in the world and told BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter before the event that success would simply be making the weekend.Birdies on the fourth, eighth, 10th and 14th holes made light of his pre-tournament expectations.Donald, whose best US PGA finish was a tie for third spot in 2006, said afterwards: \"I'm here only because I'm captain of the European Ryder Cup team. I wouldn't be in this field otherwise.\"Bogey-free in a major championship on a course that you wouldn't have thought would be ideal for me is always fun.\"New Zealand's Ryan Fox, who only secured his place by winning the Myrtle Beach Classic on Sunday, finished alongside Donald on four under.Also posting a first-round 67 was American Alex Smalley, who was a late addition to the field after world number 31 Sahith Theegala pulled out because of injury on the eve of the tournament.And there was a special moment for American Eric Cole, who holed his tee shot on the par-three fourth hole on his way to a one-under round of 70.",
