  "text": "England lose top-order wickets after Gill's 269Media caption, Shubman Gill hits highest Test score as India take control of second TestSecond Rothesay Test, Edgbaston (day two of five)India 587: Gill 269, Jadeja 89; Bashir 3-167England 77-3: Brook 30*; Deep 2-36England trail by 510 runsScorecardEngland's top order was blown away after Shubman Gill's mammoth 269 for India to leave the hosts requiring their most unlikely turnaround yet under captain Ben Stokes after two days of the second Test at Edgbaston.Gill's epic helped India pile up 587 and, after five sessions in the field, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley all fell to leave England 77-3 at the close.Duckett and Pope, England's centurions from their comeback win in the first Test, were caught in the slips off consecutive deliveries in seamer Akash Deep's second over.Crawley wafted at Mohammed Siraj to offer another edge on 19 as India, who faced huge questions coming into this Test, took total control. Harry Brook was skittish in making 30 not out - he finished alongside Joe Root who has 18 - and could easily have deepened England's woes.Gill had earlier effortlessly compiled the highest score by an India batter in England and the highest score by an Indian skipper anywhere in the world.After resuming on 114, Gill extended his partnership with Ravindra Jadeja to 203 to steer India away from early danger and when Jadeja fell for 89, he put on 144 with Washington Sundar to drive home the advantage.India were guilty of letting a winning position slip in Leeds but now hold all of the cards as they bid to level the series.England face mammoth task Media caption, Duckett and Pope both out for a duck as England fall to 13-2England have made a habit of pulling off the improbable under Stokes but this was already their toughest task before India's triple strike.They have conceded 500 three times under this regime and won on each occasion.None of those three previous totals were as large as India's here, however. In fact, only once has a team conceded so many and lost - New Zealand, who countered Bangladesh's 595-8 declared to win in 2017.Although the pitch remains largely good for batting, India's bowlers found more movement and zip than England's managed all day.They did not miss Jasprit Bumrah with Deep stepping up to replace the world's leading bowler who is resting.Looking forward, intrigue is added by Stokes' previous insistence that his side will not play for draws.Other teams would already be considering that scenario, especially given they hold a series lead, but not England if Stokes is to stay true to his word.India strike Deep blowSuch is cricket, Duckett followed his 149 last week with a five-ball duck in the Midlands.Where his wish to play every ball outside off stump had helped him in England's chase there, here it resulted in a thick edge to third slip where Gill took a tumbling catch.Dropped catches were a major factor in India's inability to close out a win in Leeds but on this occasion they caught every chance.KL Rahul juggled Pope's edge at first slip before clinging on and first slip Karun Nair snaffled Crawley, who had begun the innings with two crunching drives.While Deep's skiddy nature found seam movement, the 1.1 degrees of swing India found with the new ball was almost double what England had managed.If any England fans expected Brook to be defensive, they would have been disappointed.After being beaten twice by Siraj in his opening deliveries and surviving an umpire's call lbw review to the same bowler, he stepped away to slap the seamer for four and charged him to loft a six.Later he was almost bowled as he stepped to leg again, and in the final over he had to deflect the ball away with his shoulder as he almost played onto his stumps.Gill carries India to huge totalMedia caption, Gill hits three boundaries in a row against EnglandHaving shown the utmost control on day one, Gill increased his intent after his resumption but there was no real increase in jeopardy as India carried on from 310-5.He edged Chris Woakes through the slips in the second over of the day but that was to a delivery that was a front-foot no-ball anyway. Otherwise he was untroubled as he played a series of glorious drives, pulls and cuts.England went through their plans. They tried the bouncer ploy with six fielders on the leg side and Brook bowled five overs of his unattractive medium pace which cost 31.Brook's introduction allowed Gill to go from 200 to 250 in just 37 deliveries, in the process passing Sunil Gavaskar's 221 in 1979 to become the highest scoring Indian in an innings in England.His 200th run had taken India beyond the 471 they made in defeat at Headingley and brought him his first Test double century to go with one in one-day internationals.England struggled to extract anything from the surface. Josh Tongue found a bit of lift to bounce out Jadeja before lunch and Root a hint of turn to bowl Sundar in the afternoon.Gill was finally out pulling Tongue to square leg but, with Brydon Carse struggling with an apparent foot injury and neither Stokes nor Woakes seen with the ball after their first spells, Shoaib Bashir was left to take the final two wickets â€“ Deep caught on the long-on boundary and Prasidh Krishna stumped.'England can't be a one-trick pony' - what they saidMedia caption, 'He's made a lot of history' - analysis of Gill's 'flawless' inningsEx-England captain Michael Vaughan: \"We're having a summer that's quite warm, a dry summer. The theory of England chasing, they have chased well and gone 1-0 up in the series, you've got to look at the bigger picture sometimes.\"Someone like Shoaib Bashir, he's a young 21-year-old off-spinner and he keeps getting asked to bowl on day one with nothing there against some quality players and you can't just be a one-trick pony team where you just think 'well that's the way that we play and that's the way we go about our business'. Will they chase in Australia? I very much doubt it.\"England spin bowling coach Jeetan Patel: \"We decided to bowl and we'll stick by that. On the first day it showed enough for us and we created a lot of opportunities and it didn't go our way.\"People are going to look at any scorecard and make a decision on what they're going to think. I'm not really fussed and I don't think any of us are fussed about what's said outside of the group.\"",
