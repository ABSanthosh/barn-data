There was also Motie’s catch and a sensational one-handed grab at slip by Buttler, who gave up the gloves and dropped down to number three as he finally took the field in England’s white-ball rebuild.Salt, who spent six years of his youth living in Barbados, ignited England’s chase by hitting a six and four fours in the fourth over, bowled by Shamar Joseph, which cost 24.He impressively mixed belligerent strokes with classy drives and deft touches. When he reached three figures he roared and charged towards the dressing room in celebration.As pleasing for England was the performance of Bethell, who did not panic when taking only five runs from his first eight balls.He was born in Barbados, only moved to England as a 14-year-old and had a large group of family and friends supporting him in the stands. By the end the left-hander, who could make a Test debut in New Zealand later this month, was elegantly driving seamer Romario Shepherd over extra cover for six.Buttler left the field smiling so good was Motie's catch at third man to dismiss him. On his return, there was plenty more for the England captain to cheer.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bethell's family still live in Barbados. He moved to England as aged 14 for a cricket scholarshipBowlers let good start slipEngland also did so much right for most of their bowling innings.Mahmood had opener Brandon King caught at extra cover in the second over and in his next Evin Lewis picked out deep square leg and Shimron Hetmyer nicked behind in consecutive balls, leaving the hosts 18-3 before a 35-minute rain interruption.After the resumption, West Indies skipper Rovman Powell struck two sixes before hitting Adil Rashid’s second ball to long-on and Buttler's catch dismissed Sherfane Rutherford.Even when Andre Russell belted four sixes in a typically-powerful 30 from 17, England held firm. Russell hit Liam Livingstone to deep cover and Nicholas Pooran departed by skewing Jamie Overton to extra cover for 38 in the next over.England's missteps came late and were familiar. Again, as they often do across formats, they struggled to wrap up an innings, leaving room for improvement in the rest of the series.Motie, who played with more class than his batting position suggests, came out swinging - striking his first two balls for six and continuing to take 31 from his first nine balls.When the left-hander finally picked out deep mid-wicket at the end of penultimate over, giving Mahmood his fourth wicket, England were on the back foot.Salt ensured that was only temporary.'The place I'm happiest' - reactionPlayer of the match, England opener Phil Salt: \"This is probably the place I'm happiest. I enjoy batting here. I've grown up on these surfaces.\"Bethell is a huge talent. He's a 21-year-old lad but if you didn't know how old he was, you'd think he'd played 100 games already.\"West Indies captain Rovman Powell: \"It didn't really come off. Credit has to be given to the boys. We still managed to score 180.\"We have highlighted the way we want to play. In the bad times we have to keep backing ourselves.\"England captain Jos Buttler: \"An absolutely fantastic performance, I'm delighted for the guys.\"Salt has been outstanding and obviously he likes playing against West Indies. In the last 12-18 months, he's taken his game to new heights and I'm sure he can go to other levels.\"",
