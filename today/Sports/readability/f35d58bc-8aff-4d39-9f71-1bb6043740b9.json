  "text": "'It's a long, long time since we played like that' - are Man City back?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Manchester City have scored 13 goals in their three group stage games at this Club World CupThe Club World Cup may have had a lukewarm reception in some parts during the group stages, but Manchester City did their best to kindle interest with a statement victory over Juventus on Thursday.City's sizzling performance in the sweltering heat of Orlando ensured the 5-2 hammering of their Italian opponents made it a flawless record in Group G, allowing them to finish top of the standings.Pep Guardiola's men dominated the contest from start to finish, brushing off a downpour during the first half to lay down a marker in this tournament.The Spaniard has maintained this competition is the start of the new season rather than the continuation of the previous disappointing one and was suitably impressed by what he saw from his players.\"I liked the way we did it,\" Guardiola told Dazn. \"It has been a long, long time since we had a performance like this on and off the ball. The players were committed and we are happy to beat a top side.\"This is just one game, but I think the players felt again what it was like to be a good team. The belief always comes from your performances, not your past.\"City 'shook the tournament' with performanceFor the first time in eight seasons, City finished last term without a major trophy and ended third in the Premier League after having won an unprecedented four titles in a row.But on Thursday, with 76% possession, 24 shots to five and 738 passes to 219, City took apart the 36-time Serie A champions with a performance that will make the remaining teams sit up and take notice.City needed to win to come top and made no mistake, avoiding the half of the draw which contains Paris-St Germain and Bayern Munich.They may come up against Real Madrid in the last 16 if Xabi Alonso's side are beaten by Salzburg later on.\"I think City have shook the tournament tonight,\" said the club's former goalkeeper Shay Given. \"People will step up and think 'wow these [players] are the real deal again.\"I think they are going to bounce back and bounce back strong.\"Guardiola added: \"We were so aggressive without the ball. Ederson made incredible long balls to Erling [Haaland]. The most important thing today is we can feel it again.\"The players felt we can compete in that way. Last season it couldn't happen for one reason: we didn't have players. Since day one we've made a step up in the rhythm and training is unbelievable.\"This is the only way to survive - win or lose. Years ago, nobody could imagine Man City at the Club World Cup. We are facing new teams and it is an honour. We want to stay here.\"'One of the best in the world' - Rodri returnsImage source, BBC SportJuve will have taken a psychological knock even before kick-off, seeing the name of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri on the team sheet - it was the 29-year-old's first start since sustaining a serious knee injury against Arsenal nine months ago.The Spaniard managed 65 minutes and showed why he is so integral to this City team, displaying his assuredness in the middle of the park with a metronomic performance, completing a total of 67 passes.By the time he left the pitch, only defender Ruben Dias (84) had more touches on the ball than Rodri's 79, highlighting the importance of controlling the game.\"Everyone knows how important is Rodri,\" said Guardiola. \"He is one of the best players in the world. I am happy he had a good 60 minutes and he can help us a lot. \"Last season we couldn't do it for the injuries. This season we can have players fit and try to perform similar to today.\"Guardiola said a lengthy injury list derailed last season but against Juve he had an almost entirely fit squad to select from, barring the injured Claudio Echeverri.Jeremy Doku, Savinho and Phil Foden were all on the scoresheet as City racked up 13 goals in their three group stage games.\"The forward play and the goals Man City score is fantastic,\" said Given. \"When they won the title four times in a row we thought these guys were robots.\"Even Pep mentions 'we have got our mojo back'. We have got the Man City back, which we all thought was automatic.\"It shows us that they are just human beings.\"Guardiola's admiration for HaalandThe match also saw Haaland notch a landmark strike, with the 300th top level goal for club and country.The 24-year-old spent a spell on the sidelines last season through injury, but has now netted five goals in his past six games.In total, he has scored 258 times for the clubs he has played for - plus 42 for Norway.\"Congratulations on 300 goals,\" said Guardiola, who has won all 11 games as manager in the competition. \"At 24 years old, it is a good run.\"His manager was an incredible footballer - he scored 11 goals in 11 years. Imagine that situation so I admire him a lot and happy for him.\"There's no doubt that Haaland's goals and Rodri's steady influence in midfield are both crucial to City's success - but who is the most vital cog in Guardiola's side?Despite Haaland's recent impressive goalscoring run, he actually started Thursday's game on the bench.It goes to show just how potent City, aided with Â£100m worth of new signings prior to the tournament, are becoming again.Who would actually make it into Guardiola's first-choice XI?
