  "text": "The draft lottery is in the books. After a miserable 24-58 season and weeks of wondering whether the Philadelphia 76ers will keep their top 6 protected pick, the lottery gave the Sixers the No. 3 pick in the 2025 NBA draft on June 25.With that selection, the Sixers can go in a couple of different directions. They can look at Rutgers stars Ace Bailey or Dylan Harper or look at Baylor star VJ Edgecombe, Texas scorer Tre Johnson, or Duke's Kon Knueppel or Khaman Maluach.A post-lottery mock draft put together by For The Win has the Sixers selecting Edgecombe with the No. 3 overall pick:At the start of the NCAA season, he showed a lot of promise as a defensive player, though that slowed down a bit as his freshman campaign progressed. However, while at Baylor, he also showed promise as a scorer. The Big 12 Freshman of the Year joined (Cooper) Flagg as the only first-year collegiate players with at least 30 dunks and 3-pointers recorded, per Bart Torvik.For a team to draft Edgecombe this high, they will hope that his jumper eventually becomes more consistent once he has found his groove in the NBA.Edgecombe averaged 15.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 3.2 assists during his lone season in college with the Bears. He shot 43.6% from the floor and 34% from deep so the jump shot is certainly a work in progress, but he has elite NBA athleticism and has the ability to put the ball on the floor and finish up and over anybody. He would be an interesting fit on the Sixers should they go this route. Facebook Twitter Email",
