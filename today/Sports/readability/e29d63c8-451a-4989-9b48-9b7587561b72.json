  "text": "Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.Image source, Getty ImagesDean Henderson (Crystal Palace): It was a very scrappy game against Ipswich - he faced 15 shots, with eight of them on target, and did well to keep a clean sheet in a 1-0 win. He is a contender for an England starting position. I know that might be a bit wild to say, but he has been excellent for Palace during their upturn in form.Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest): Nottingham Forest were superb in their 1-0 victory against Manchester City - and both Aina and Murillo have been great all season. They shut down a City team that really needed to win.Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa): It was just great to see him back playing against Brentford and enjoying his football. He has had a lot of injury mishaps but has never quit and never shirked a challenge. He did well as Villa won 1-0 to stay in the hunt for top four.Murillo (Nottingham Forest): He has been really good all year. You can see why they put so much emphasis on tying him down to a long-term contract. Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth): For me he is one of the best left-backs in world football already. He is exceptional with the ball and without it, runs all day and has loads of room to grow. It is not surprising that Liverpool have been linked to him.Declan Rice (Arsenal): People gave him stick for celebrating his equaliser against Manchester United. When he doesn't score people say he doesn't score enough - but when he does he gets stick for celebrating! He is growing into a really talented 'number eight'. Especially as Arsenal don't have a number nine, he runs into great pockets and got beyond the attackers for his goal.Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): Scored the only goal against West Ham in a must-win match for his team in the Champions League race. It can be hard for players with a massive game like the Carabao Cup final coming up on Sunday - no player wants to get injured before that. But he was one of the few that didn't shirk a tackle, and still played this game at full intensity.Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd): I have been critical of Fernandes over the years. He is the type of person that got away with it when the team were poor under Erik ten Hag. Since the new manager has come in, he has shown a completely new level of character. If Manchester United want to get to where they aspire to be, then they need this guy. They cannot get rid of him. It was also unbelievable technique for the free-kick.Mohamed Salah (Liverpool): Again, he wasn't great on the day against Southampton, but despite not being great, he scored two goals to help extend Liverpool's lead at the top of the league.Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa): Scored a good goal in Villa's win over Brentford. He celebrated against his old team, which he should do - a good weekend for him!Ismaila Sarr (Crystal Palace): Showed a moment of class to go through and score the winner against Ipswich. Let's be honest, this week was an awful one for teams - there was no standout match. A lot of scrappy performances and it looked like the players need an international break.Eddie Howe (Newcastle): It is another massive week for Newcastle - Howe could have easily chosen a different team against West Ham and rested everybody so they were ready for the cup final.Instead he went for it and made sure he got the job done - despite having lost Anthony Gordon and Lewis Hall to injury - and they are now level on points with fifth-placed Man City.He deserves credit for instilling that 'win every game' mentality.Do you agree with Troy's selections?

When he doesn\u0026#39;t score people say he doesn\u0026#39;t score enough - but when he does he gets stick for celebrating! He is growing into a really talented \u0026#39;number eight\u0026#39;.

It can be hard for players with a massive game like the Carabao Cup final coming up on Sunday - no player wants to get injured before that. But he was one of the few that didn\u0026#39;t shirk a tackle, and still played this game at full intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBruno Fernandes (Man Utd):\u003c/b\u003e I have been critical of Fernandes over the years. He is the type of person that got away with it when the team were poor under Erik ten Hag. Since the new manager has come in, he has shown a completely new level of character. If Manchester United want to get to where they aspire to be, then they need this guy. They cannot get rid of him. It was also unbelievable technique for the free-kick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-component=\"image-block\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Forwards banner\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/a6df/live/72361f30-00a8-11ef-8369-47dc4454b972.jpg 976w\" width=\"3840\" height=\"354.8514851485148\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-component=\"text-block\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMohamed Salah (Liverpool): \u003c/b\u003eAgain, he wasn\u0026#39;t great on the day against Southampton, but despite not being great, he scored two goals to help extend Liverpool\u0026#39;s lead at the top of the league.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): \u003c/b\u003eScored a good goal in Villa\u0026#39;s win over Brentford.
