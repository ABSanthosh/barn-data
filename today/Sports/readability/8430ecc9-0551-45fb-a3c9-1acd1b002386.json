  "text": "Texas A\u0026M's 2026 recruiting class gained its ninth commitment in the cycle, as four-star running back Jonathan Hatton chose the Aggies over the Oklahoma Sooners on Saturday afternoon during his visit to College Station. Head coach Mike Elko and running back coach Trooper Taylor deserve credit for pulling off one of the more significant additions of the offseason.Amid a busy recruiting weekend, Hatton's announcement took center stage, as the talented back is the first running back to join the Aggies' 2026 cycle, and after a brief interview with Rivals insider Sam Spiegelman, Hatton sounds like a player who has found his future his permanent collegiate home.“There’s no other direction for them but up”While some may disagree, Texas A\u0026M's football future is much better despite finishing 1-4 after starting 7-1 and 5-0 in SEC play last season. Any future improvement starts with recruiting elite talent. With OC Collin Klein calling plays, the running back position is almost as important as a quarterback.Hatton is an elite prospect with the speed, power, footwork, and cutting ability to thwart defenders at the second level, leading to his career-high in yards (1,229) and 20 touchdowns on the ground. He averaged nearly 10 yards per carry during his 2024 junior season.According to 247Sports Composite rankings, Hatton is currently positioned as the 75th-ranked prospect in the cycle, the 5th-ranked running back, and the 10th-ranked prospect in Texas.Contact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A\u0026M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.
