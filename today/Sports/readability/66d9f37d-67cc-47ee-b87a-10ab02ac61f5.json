  "text": "England forward Marcus Rashford has been warned there is \"no way back for him\" at Manchester United after his professionalism was questioned by manager Ruben Amorim.Rashford, 27, has not played for United since 12 December and on Sunday Amorim said he would rather have 63-year-old goalkeeper coach Jorge Vital in his squad rather than \"a player who doesn't give the maximum every day\".Former United defender Rio Ferdinand, a six-time Premier League title winner, says Rashford will have to leave Old Trafford.\"If I was the player the manager said that about, my heart, my pride, my ego - it's embarrassment,\" said Ferdinand on his Rio Presents YouTube channel., external\"For someone to question your application, to question you giving 100 per cent for the team, saying you're lacking effort and taking shortcuts, that's a damning comment. There's no way back for Marcus after that.\"If he did come back that means other players can take their foot off the gas and have a way back into the team and take shortcuts.\"Premier League title winner Chris Sutton said Rashford needs to improve his attitude.\"He is too big for his boots,\" said Sutton on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. \"It's quite basic what Amorim said and for whatever reason, Rashford is playing up and that's totally unacceptable.\"We all know Marcus Rashford was a wonderful player, probably still is. What Amorim has done is his last resort, and is well within his rights to do. He is not asking for anything extraordinary, just asking for Rashford to apply himself every day.\"He has done it before, but for whatever reason he's not doing it now.\"Rashford has been with United since the age of seven, made more than 400 appearances, won the Europa League, two FA Cups and two EFL Cups.Amorim became United manager in November, replacing Erik ten Hag, and the England striker scored in Amorim's first game in charge, a 1-1 away draw at Ipswich on 24 November.Rashford also scored twice in a 4-0 win over Everton a week later, but was left out of the squad for United's 2-1 victory at Manchester City on 15 December and subsequently told journalist Henry Winter he was \"ready for a new challenge\".Ferdinand felt Rashford would have made a public statement if Amorim's latest comments were incorrect.\"For me, if it isn't true, I'm coming out all guns blazing. I'm holding a press conference and saying 'I'm not having anyone say that about me',\" said Ferdinand.\"You only do that if you are 100 per cent sure that nobody can say you're taking shortcuts. We're in an era where you have the ability to really communicate with the fans directly so the story is not getting twisted.\"I would love to sit across the table from Marcus and look into his eyes and see if he could say that. If you can't, you have to look at yourself.\"Rashford has been linked with a move during the January transfer window and former United first-team coach Rene Meulensteen says the forward should leave.\"If I was Rashford, I would make every means work to see if I could get that transfer over the line, no matter how,\" said Meulensteen on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"It would be best for all parties and would be good for Rashford to rediscover himself in a new league.\"It's never a good thing to highlight personal issues with a player in public. It does nobody any favours. Not the players, not the manager and not the club.\"Rashford has played 60 times for England, including against winners Italy in the final of the European Championship in 2021.He scored 30 goals in all competitions for Manchester United in 2022-23, but Ferdinand says Rashford will need to prove he can find that form again.\"When is the penny going to drop, that it's nobody else's fault, the only person that can change is me, not a manager, or someone telling me I have to play a certain way,\" added Ferdinand.\"Then go into training every day with a spring in your step because you're a lucky guy and don't think anyone owes you anything. Go and earn the right to play and earn plaudits.\"Sutton says Rashford is in danger of losing the peak years of his career and added: \"If he does not move, unless he really gets back in favour and knuckles down, he could be a player that rots for a while and that's no good for anyone.\"24 November: Marcus Rashford scores the first goal for Manchester United under Ruben Amorim, in a 1-1 draw against Ipswich Town1 December: Scores twice in a 4-0 win over Everton12 December: Is substituted after 56 minutes of the Europa League tie with Viktoria Plzen.
