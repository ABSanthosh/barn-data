  "text": "The Carolina Panthers might not be done with the reconstruction of their defense.Darin Gantt of Panthers.com covered the team's recent defensive overhaul in this week's \"Ask The Old Guy,\" his regular mailbag series. And when asked about possible additions to the secondary, Gantt throws out a few interesting names and thoughts:If they're going to be out shopping for more help, the good news is there are multiple qualified guys at the spot they're thinnest at (safety). Guys including Julian Blackmon (who visited in March), known commodity Justin Simmons (who was an All-Pro in Denver for Ejiro Evero), and several more are still sitting there on the market. They spent the spring looking at young options there, but could stand to be more experienced and deeper.As Gantt notes, Blackmon met with the Panthers earlier this offseason. The 26-year-old has spent each of his five NFL campaigns as a member of the Indianapolis Colts, amassing 300 combined tackles and 10 interceptions since 2020.Carolina, according to multiple reports, has also expressed in Simmons—who spent the 2022 season under Evero. That year saw the two-time Pro Bowler and four-time second-team All-Pro notch a league-leading six interceptions along with a career-high three forced fumbles.The team's safety room currently features free-agent signee Tre'von Moehrig, 2025 fourth-round pick Lathan Ransom, Demani Richardson, Nick Scott and a trio of undrafted rookies (Isaac Gifford, Jack Henderson and Trevian Thomas).Follow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.
