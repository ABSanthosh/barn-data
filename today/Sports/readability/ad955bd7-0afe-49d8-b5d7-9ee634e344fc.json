A person who is employed by Burrow arrived at the Anderson Township home Monday night to find a shattered bedroom window and the home in disarray. The person called their mother, and then 911 was contacted, according to the report.Deputies reached out to neighbors in an attempt to piece together surveillance footage.\"Our investigators are exploring every avenue,\" public information officer Kyla Woods said.The homes of Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce were broken into in October. In the NBA, Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis had his home broken into Nov. 2, and Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley's home was burglarized on Sept. 15 while he was at a Minnesota Vikings game.Portis had offered a $40,000 reward for information.The NFL and NBA issued security alerts to players after those break-ins, urging them to take additional precautions to secure their homes.In league memos previously obtained by The Associated Press, the NFL said homes of professional athletes across multiple sports have become \"increasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups.\" The NBA revealed that the FBI has connected some burglaries to \"transnational South American Theft Groups\" that are \"reportedly well-organized, sophisticated rings that incorporate advanced techniques and technologies, including pre-surveillance, drones, and signal jamming devices.\"Some of the burglary groups have conducted extensive surveillance on targets, including attempted home deliveries and posing as grounds maintenance or joggers in the neighborhood, according to officials.",
