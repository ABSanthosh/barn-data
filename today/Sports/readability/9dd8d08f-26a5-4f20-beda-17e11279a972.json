  "text": "For the third year in a row, the Pittsburgh Steelers will have a new starting quarterback. Aaron Rodgers informed the team he plans to sign ahead of mandatory minicamp and is the presumed starter for 2025.There have been multiple starting quarterbacks in Pittsburgh since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 NFL season. The Steelers' all-time passing leader had been the team's starter since his rookie year in 2004.Following his retirement, the Steelers immediately turned to the draft and selected Kenny Pickett in Round 1 of the 2022 NFL Draft. Pickett lasted two seasons in Pittsburgh before the getting traded him to the Philadelphia Eagles in a pick swap.To fill his shoes, the Steelers signed both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields to one-year contracts ahead of the 2024 NFL season. Both started games in 2024 as the Steelers went 10-7 and lost in the wild-card round of the playoffs.None of those players are on the team as Rodgers arrives in town to lead the Steelers' offense featuring offseason acquisition DK Metcalf at wide receiver.So where are Wilson, Fields and Pickett playing in 2025? Here's what to know:Who is Russell Wilson playing for?In 2025, Wilson will be playing for the New York Giants. He's the most experienced veteran option at the position in a quarterback room with fellow free-agent signee Jameis Winston, 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart and Tommy DeVito.Wilson spent the first decade of his career in Seattle (2012-2021) and made the Pro Bowl nine times in that span. Since then, he's been in a few different places, first in Denver for two seasons then in Pittsburgh.Wilson started the final 11 regular-season games for the Steelers in 2024 and went 6-5. He completed 63.7% of his passes for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns and five interceptions.Where is Justin Fields playing in 2025?Fields will be playing for the New York Jets — Rodgers' former team — in 2025. He signed a two-year contract in free agency that includes $30 million in guaranteed money.The Chicago Bears selected Fields at No. 11 overall in the 2021 NFL Draft. He spent three seasons there and went 10-28 as a starter. With the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Chicago selected Caleb Williams, deciding to move on from Fields and trading him to Pittsburgh for what became a sixth-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.In 2024, Fields started the first five games of the regular season for Pittsburgh with Wilson out with an injury. He went 4-2 in those starts and completed 65.8% of his passes for 1,106 yards, five touchdowns and one interception. He also had 62 carries for 289 yards and five touchdowns on the ground.Who is Kenny Pickett playing for?Pickett's year in Philadelphia netted him a Super Bowl ring as a backup on the Eagles' title-winning squad. His stay in the state of Pennsylvania has come to an end, though, as the Eagles traded him to the Cleveland Browns in March for quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson.He has a chance to start for the Browns in a wide-open quarterback competition heading into 2025. He's competing alongside veteran Joe Flacco, and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders.All the NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter.
