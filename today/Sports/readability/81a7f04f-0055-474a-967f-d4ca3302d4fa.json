Florida beat then-No. 1 Tennessee 73-43 on Jan. 7.The Gators are the fifth team in AP poll history to have a home win and road win over AP No. 1 opponents in the same season, according to ESPN Research.\"I'm hard-pressed to believe that there's going to be another team in the conference that's going to come in here and get a win,\" Florida coach Todd Golden said. \"I thought for the last 36 minutes of the game, we were about as good as we could be in an environment like this.\"Florida shot 13-for-33 from 3-point range, while Auburn shot 32% from long distance, finishing 7-for-22.The Gators trailed by six with 5:58 left in the first half before going on a 14-2 run and taking control of the game.

We didn't prepare like it. And as a result, we got beat.\"Tigers leading scorer Johni Broome, a fifth-year senior and preseason Associated Press All-American who is considered a contender for national player of the year, had 18 points and 11 rebounds as Auburn (21-2, 9-1) had its nine-game conference winning streak halted.Miles Kelly scored 22 points, Tahaad Pettiford added 14 and Chaney Johnson 13 for the Tigers.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
