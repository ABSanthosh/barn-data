  "text": "Most fans would be disappointed at working at 8am the day after their beloved club had won a first trophy in 56 years - but most fans aren't Dan Burn.Two days after his first England call-up, the 32-year-old boyhood Newcastle supporter scored the opening goal as the Magpies beat Liverpool 2-1 at Wembley to win the Carabao Cup.He was central to their celebrations. Magpies boss Eddie Howe came into the news conference room afterwards reeking of beer, saying he had been soaked by Joelinton and the other Magpies players.But talk soon turned to Burn, the local lad from Blyth, who was 29 before he joined his boyhood club. He will report for England duty on Monday morning for the first time in his career.The defender's thumping header from Kieran Trippier's corner - from about 12 yards out - to give his side the lead just before half-time was fantastic.It was Newcastle's first cup final goal since 1976. Their second would come in the second half through Alexander Isak, before Federico Chiesa netted a consolation late on for Liverpool.\"What a few days for Dan,\" said Howe. \"His performance today was colossal at the back.\"We were working on those corners tirelessly for two weeks. He's delivered one from long range. Incredible header. So fitting it's him.\"Burn told Sky Sports: \"I've had worse weeks. I don't want to go to sleep because I feel like I'm dreaming and it's all going to be a lie.\"I don't get many so I saved it for a big occasion. I feel strange, I feel numb at the minute.\"He added: \"I'll be first there tomorrow [at England training] at 8 o'clock.\"Liverpool boss Arne Slot was asked afterwards why 6ft 7in Burn had been left so free - and his answer was enlightening.\"We have five players zonally close to our goal,\" he said. \"If the ball comes there we have our five strongest players to attack the ball.\"Normally a player runs to the zone. Normally, and I think he's an exception, I've never seen in my life a player from that far away heading a ball with so much force into the far corner. Ninety-nine out of 100 times that will not lead to a goal.\"Credit to him, he's one of the few players that can score a goal from that distance with his head.\"Newcastle fans had felt cursed after failing to win a trophy since the 1969 Inter-City Fairs Cup - or a domestic one since the 1955 FA Cup.Thirty different English league clubs have won a major trophy since then.They lost the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup finals, and then the 2023 Carabao Cup final to Manchester United.\"The curse stuff for me never existed,\" Howe said.\"With such a long wait for a trophy I'm sure everyone will never forget it. There are different ways to win trophies - today was the best way to win it. \"We played the best team in the Premier League by a long way and we were the better team.\"Speaking about what he learned from their 2-0 Wembley defeat two years ago, he said: \"The first time we got to Wembley was very emotional.\"You could sense that in the players and the crowd. I don't think it helped our performance.\"This time we tried to take away distractions and make it similar to a Premier League build-up.\"Newcastle - who are sixth in the Premier League - were deserved winners, although ended up with a nervy finale.\"It was tough when Liverpool scored,\" said Howe. \"I was thinking about extra time. We always make it difficult for ourselves, so it was never going to be 2-0.\"Of their celebrations, he said: \"I encourage them not to be professional tonight and not worry about tomorrow too much.\"Howe became the first English manager to win a major trophy in this country since Harry Redknapp lifted the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth.Newcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes has become a firm fans' favourite since his 2022 move from Lyon when he became one of the first signings under Howe and the Saudi ownership.The supporters sang and chanted the Brazil midfielder's name throughout the game \"It's all for these fans,\" he said. \"They deserve everything. When I first came here I said I wanted to put my name in history.\"We can now say we are the champions again. \"I don't have any words. It's the best day of my life. For them [the fans] it's like the World Cup. People have grown up and not seen us as champions. \"My first year as captain of this club and it's one of the best days. This is unbelievable.\"This is my second home. We are making history. Some day when I leave this club I want the fans to sing my name the way they do to Alan Shearer. He texted me before the game. I'm so emotional today.\"",
