It's considered a four-to-five-week injury, and while Levis has played through injuries in the past, this one will be a week-to-week situation.The Titans said Trevor Siemian was elevated from the practice squad to Sunday's game-day roster and will revert back to the practice squad after the game.Levis was able to start in the team's Week 6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts after the bye. But he said the injury restricted him on some of his throws -- specifically, a pass that was intercepted by Colts safety Julian Blackmon.Levis was limited in Wednesday's practice but was upgraded to a full participant Thursday. Rudolph and Levis shared snaps in Friday's practice. The Titans listed Levis as questionable after he was limited again Friday.Rudolph, a seven-year veteran, came in for Levis against the Dolphins and led the team to a 31-12 win. He finished with 85 passing yards. It was the Titans' only win this season and the first time the team scored 30-plus points since Jan. 2, 2022, when it beat Miami 34-3.The Titans on Saturday also placed wide receiver Treylon Burks on injured reserve and signed defensive lineman Abdullah Anderson to the active roster from the practice squad.NFL reporter Paul Kuharsky was first to report the Rudolph news.",
