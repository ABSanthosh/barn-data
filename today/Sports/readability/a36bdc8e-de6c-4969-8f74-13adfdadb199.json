He was the Ravens beat writer for the Baltimore Sun from 2000-2011.OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- The Baltimore Ravens suspended wide receiver Diontae Johnson for one game for conduct detrimental to the team, the team announced Wednesday.\"Diontae's suspension stems from refusing to enter our game against the Philadelphia Eagles,\" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement.DeCosta called the disciplinary action a \"difficult decision.\"Johnson will miss the Ravens' Dec. 15 game at the New York Giants. Baltimore is currently on a bye.The Ravens had been vague about Johnson's standing with the team after he suited up but did not play a snap in Sunday's 24-19 loss to the Eagles. It was even more curious that Johnson never entered the game because starting wide receiver Rashod Bateman was sidelined in the second half with a knee injury. Johnson could be seen standing by a heater on the sideline for most of the game.Johnson, 28, has played only 39 snaps for Baltimore since being acquired from the Carolina Panthers on Oct. 29. He has a total of one catch for six yards for the Ravens after being the leading receiver for the Panthers through seven games with them this season.This decreased production could significantly impact him heading into free agency this offseason.On Monday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh was noncommittal on whether Johnson would remain with the team.In late October, the Panthers parted with Johnson for very little in return after he led Carolina in receptions (30), receiving yards (357) and touchdown catches (3). The Ravens sent a fifth-round pick to Carolina for Johnson and a sixth-round selection. It was considered a low-risk move for Baltimore because the Panthers picked up most of Johnson's remaining salary, leaving Baltimore to pay about $625,000.If the Ravens cut Johnson, they would not get a potential compensatory pick in the 2026 draft if he signed elsewhere in free agency.Baltimore's top three wide receivers are Zay Flowers, Bateman and Nelson Agholor. The Ravens rank third in the NFL in passing, averaging 243.3 yards.After Sunday's game, quarterback Lamar Jackson said he spoke to Johnson about staying locked in after not playing.\"We want him out there,\" Jackson said. \"He's a great receiver. We didn't get him from the Panthers for nothing.\"A third-round pick in 2019 by the Steelers, Johnson has totaled 422 catches for 4,726 yards and 28 touchdowns for Pittsburgh, Carolina and Baltimore.",
