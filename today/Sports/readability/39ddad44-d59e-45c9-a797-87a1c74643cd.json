  "text": "No ball? No problem. How Forest are breaking the possession obsessionImage source, Getty Images\"If God had wanted us to play football in the clouds, he'd have put grass up there.\"The legendary Brian Clough always had an interesting way of looking at things, and his view of long-ball football was no different.He might well have been appreciative of passing the ball to feet, but the former Nottingham Forest boss would no doubt be enjoying the novel approach the Reds are taking to secure a return to European football this season.On Monday they secured a hugely impressive 2-1 win at Tottenham, doing so having seen just 30% of the ball.That has been the theme for almost all of their games this season, as they sit bottom of the Premier League when it comes to average possession statistics.But the side that was battling against relegation last term currently sits third in the table and is firmly in the hunt for finishing in the Champions League places.\"We have a clear way to play and when we found ourselves in our identity,\" Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Match of the Day.\"We had goals [against Tottenham] but also they created chances in the second half and we had to hold on to what we had.\"We've been able this season to compete well and fight for every ball.\"Media caption, Forest had clear intention to bounce back - SantoHas a Premier League side ever been so successful with so little possession?Should Nottingham Forest finish in the top four with their current average possession statistics, they will become the first team to do so with such a low figure.Leicester City memorably won the Premier League against the odds in 2015-16 and did so with average possession statistics of 42.4%But Everton, with 48.5% in 2004-05, are the only other side to finish in the top four with less than 50% possession on average.So far this season Forest have seen just 39.3% possession per game.It may be at odds with the style of teams around them - and even across the English game more broadly - but Forest's football is firmly on course to ensure their fans will be able to enjoy a European adventure next season.A solid defence and a clean-sheet expert goalkeeperPossession, of course, isn't everything.Southampton have been relegated from the Premier League and are still in danger of equalling the lowest-ever points total in the top-flight, yet they have gone down with better possession statistics than almost half the rest of the league.All of this isn't to say Forest's football is unattractive.They are instead masters of winning the ball high up the pitch and then quickly turning that into attacking opportunities through their impressive ball carriers, such as Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi.\"That's one of their main characteristics,\" said Nuno. \"They have the talent to give us these steps forward up the pitch.\"They are also clinical with the chances they get, as shown against Tottenham as they scored two goals from their three efforts on target. And once they get ahead they rarely let teams back in.They have scored first more than any other team in the Premier League (24 times) and haven't failed to win from a 2-0 lead since October 2023.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Matz Sels has kept more clean sheets in the Premier League than any other goalkeeper, with 13\"You cannot ignore when you are in front the priority is to contain and block the game,\" said Nuno.\"We help each other in every situation, give balance, help each other, clear things off the line.\"They are also ahead of 12 other Premier League teams in many of the key defensive metrics, making the most clearances and headed clearances, while they rank highly for most interceptions (eight), tackles (seven) and saves (seven).Only champions-elect Liverpool and second-placed Arsenal can boast a better defence than Forest's, which has conceded just 39 goals in 33 games, while in Matz Sels they have the goalkeeper who is leading the way in the fight for the Golden Glove this season.The Belgian has kept 13 clean sheets so far this season in the Premier League and was only denied a 14th by Richarlison's late header, after stopping the striker with a brilliant save a few minutes earlier.\"You might be critical of other teams for sinking deep, but Forest actually want to do that and say 'we'll back ourselves',\" former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports.\"I don't think you should be praising Tottenham too much for having so many shots or being on the ball, Nottingham Forest allow you to do that.\"More on this story",
