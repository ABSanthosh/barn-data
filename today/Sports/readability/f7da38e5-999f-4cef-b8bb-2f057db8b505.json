  "text": "Associated PressJul 20, 2025, 04:48 PM ETCLEVELAND -- President Donald Trump is threatening to hold up a new stadium deal for Washington's NFL team if it does not restore its old name of the Redskins, which is considered offensive to Native Americans.Trump also said Sunday that he wants Cleveland's baseball team to revert to its former name, the Indians, saying there was a \"big clamoring for this\" as well.The Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians have had their current names since their respective seasons in 2022, and both have said that they don't plan to change them back.Trump said that the Commanders would be \"much more valuable\" if they restored their old name.\"I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,\" Trump said on his social media site.His latest interest in changing the names reflects his broader effort to roll back changes that followed a national debate on cultural sensitivity and racial justice. Washington announced it would drop its former name and logo in 2020 during a broader reckoning with systemic racism and police brutality.The Commanders and the District of Columbia government announced a deal earlier this year to build a new home for the football team at the site of the old RFK Stadium, the place the franchise called home for more than three decades.Trump's ability to hold up the deal remains to be seen. President Joe Biden signed a bill in January that transferred the land from the federal government to the District of Columbia.The provision was part of a short-term spending bill passed by Congress in December. Though D.C. residents elect a mayor, a city council and commissioners to run day-to-day operations, Congress maintains control of the city's budget.Josh Harris, whose group bought the Commanders from former owner Dan Snyder in 2023, said earlier this year that the name was here to stay. Not long after taking over, Harris quieted speculation about going back to the former name, saying that would not happen. The team did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Trump's social media posts Sunday.The Washington team started in Boston as the Redskins in 1933 before moving to the nation's capital four years later.Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti indicated before Sunday's game against the Athletics that there weren't any plans to revisit the name change.\"We understand there are different perspectives on the decision we made a few years ago, but obviously, it's a decision we made. We've got the opportunity to build a brand as the Guardians over the last four years and are excited about the future that's in front of us,\" he said.Cleveland announced in December 2020 that it would drop its Indians nickname. It announced the switch to Guardians in July 2021. In 2018, the team phased out \"Chief Wahoo\" as its primary logo.The name changes had their share of supporters and critics as part of the national discussions about logos and names considered racist.Trump posted Sunday afternoon that \"The Owner of the Cleveland Baseball Team, Matt Dolan, who is very political, has lost three Elections in a row because of that ridiculous name change. What he doesn't understand is that if he changed the name back to the Cleveland Indians, he might actually win an Election. Indians are being treated very unfairly. MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN (MIGA)!\"Matt Dolan, the son of late owner Larry Dolan, no longer has a role with the Guardians. He ran the team's charity endeavors until 2016.Matt Dolan was a candidate in the Ohio U.S. Senate elections in 2022 and 2024, but lost.Washington and Cleveland share another thing in common: David Blitzer is a member of Harris' ownership group with the Commanders and holds a minority stake in the Guardians.",
