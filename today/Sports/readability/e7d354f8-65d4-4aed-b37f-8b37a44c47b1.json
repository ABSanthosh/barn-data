  "text": "Why the intense Dodgers-Padres rivalry is 'great for baseball' (2:31)Frank Isola and Michael Wilbon discuss the ever-increasing rivalry between the Dodgers and the Padres, and Wilbon says that right now, it's bigger than the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry. (2:31)Associated PressJun 20, 2025, 07:09 PM ETLOS ANGELES -- San Diego Padres closer Robert Suarez was suspended for three games and fined an undisclosed amount Friday for intentionally hitting Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers with a pitch during the NL West rivals' contentious meeting Thursday night.Suarez will appeal the suspension, keeping him eligible to play for San Diego on Friday night against Kansas City.Padres manager Mike Shildt and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts also received one-game suspensions and undisclosed fines for their roles in the brouhaha that occurred in both halves of the ninth inning during the Padres' 5-3 victory at Dodger Stadium.\"I support it,\" Roberts said about the league's disciplinary decision. \"I think that obviously I never want to make the game about the managers. It shouldn't be. It should be about the players and winning, so last night, both managers are protecting their teams, and it just unfortunately got to the point that we became the focus, and that's not the way it should be.\"Both managers were ejected in the top of the ninth after they ran onto the field and bumped into each other during a vociferous argument that almost got even more physical before their players and assistant coaches intervened.Shildt believed Dodgers reliever Jack Little intentionally hit Fernando Tatís Jr. in the right hand with a pitch, igniting the latest bench-clearing incident between local rivals with several years of bad-tempered history.\"Circumstances were really challenging this past series, and at the end of the day I don't regret standing up for a guy that I love in Tati, and a team that I love and a city that I love,\" Shildt said. \"In that regard, I have no regrets how it got to that point. Again, we can all have our comments and thoughts and theories. But as far as my actions, it's not something you want to do every night or needs to be done, hopefully ever again. But appropriate actions for the circumstances were taken, and I don't regret it at all.\"Shildt and Roberts will serve their suspensions Friday. Bench coach Danny Lehmann will manage the Dodgers against the Washington Nationals, and Padres bench coach Brian Esposito will run San Diego's dugout vs. the Royals.In the bottom of the ninth, Ohtani was hit on the back of his right shoulder by Suarez's pitch, putting the tying run on base during the Dodgers' three-run rally. Ohtani's teammates appeared to be preparing to storm the field for the second time before Ohtani waved them back. The three-time MVP then walked to the Padres' dugout for some light banter, defusing the tension.Suarez on Friday insisted he hadn't retaliated for Tatís.\"I was never trying to get anyone into trouble or hit anybody,\" Suarez said through an interpreter. \"Unfortunately it happened. I got ejected and I couldn't finish out the game, but we won as a team, and we were able to salvage that game. ... [The Dodgers are] entitled to their opinion. They can say whatever they want. That was not the case. I was out there to try to save the game.\"Ohtani threw a bullpen session as scheduled Friday despite getting hit by Suarez on his pitching shoulder. Ohtani's second mound start for the Dodgers is still expected to happen Sunday, Roberts said.Tatís was in the Padres' lineup as usual Friday. Manny Machado said afterward that the Dodgers should \"pray\" Tatís had escaped serious injury, encouraging them to \"put out a candle.\"",
