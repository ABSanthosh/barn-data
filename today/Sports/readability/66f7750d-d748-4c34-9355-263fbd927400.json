  "text": "Lamar Jackson won his second NFL MVP award last season. He has been even better this season. Much better, amazingly enough.We’ve seen split MVPs before and that would probably be the most appropriate ending to the Jackson/Josh Allen MVP race. Allen has been tremendous for the Buffalo Bills, doing everything for an offense that won the AFC East. But Jackson can point to many stats ​— including a passer rating that is challenging the all-time single-season NFL record — and say he has been better than Allen and better than his own first two MVP seasons as well.Jackson’s brilliance was on display again on Wednesday. The Ravens took a step toward winning the AFC North title as they dominated the Houston Texans 31-2. It wasn’t Jackson carrying the team on his back, which we’ve seen plenty through his career, but he didn’t do anything to hurt his MVP case. Jackson had two passing touchdowns and another one rushing. After that performance, Jackson’s passer rating is at 121.6, not far from Aaron Rodgers’ NFL record of 122.5. Jackson also broke Michael Vick’s record for rushing yards by a quarterback, and he will shatter the record considering he’s just 27.The MVP narrative and the betting odds have been in Allen’s favor for the past few weeks. And if Allen wins, he’s deserving. It wouldn’t be quite Joel Embiid winning NBA MVP a couple years ago because voters were tired of giving it to Nikola Jokic every year. But perhaps some Jackson voter fatigue will factor in. Even though Allen has a great case, there’s no good reason to deny Jackson his third MVP. It’ll be a difficult vote.Ravens start the blowout earlyJackson has help like he never has through his Ravens career. Derrick Henry ensures that Jackson isn’t on his own in the Baltimore offense.Henry set the tone right away at Houston. Henry had 86 yards and a touchdown in the first quarter alone. Every time he touched the ball the Texans defense seemed to part to let him through to the secondary. Henry has been excellent for the Ravens all season, and a big part of why they might be very dangerous in the playoffs.The Ravens gave away two points on a safety when Henry was tackled in the end zone, but the rest of the half was controlled by them. Jackson had a drive in which he escaped the rush to hit tight end Mark Andrews for a 67-yard gain and then finished the drive with another magic trick, moving around to avoid the pass rush for what seemed like a minute before finding Isaiah Likely in the end zone for the touchdown. Jackson completed just six passes in the first half, in part because the Ravens were in no trouble and Henry was running so well, but he had 147 yards on those six passes.The Ravens led 17-2 at halftime, the first 17-2 halftime score in NFL history according to the Netflix broadcast. Jackson said he would skip the Ravens’ halftime to watch Beyonce perform at halftime, but he stayed in the locker room. He probably could have gone out and caught at least a couple of songs. It’s not like the Ravens had much to worry about. Especially after Jackson had a 48-yard touchdown run to start the scoring in the second half.Jackson makes his MVP caseJackson is the best running quarterback the NFL has ever seen and has the record to prove it. Jackson is also one game from being the fourth quarterback to post a passer rating of 120 in a season. It will be very hard to deny a player with that unfathomable combination of skills an MVP award.Allen is a similar dual threat, of course. He has 26 touchdown passes to only six interceptions, with 514 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground. He’s elevated his play despite the Bills trading his No. 1 receiver, Stefon Diggs, in the offseason.Both quarterbacks are similar in that they can pass or run at a dominant level. For a while it seemed like one of Allen’s edges in voters’ eyes would be that he won a division title and Jackson didn’t, but the Ravens have stormed back and are the new favorite to win the AFC North. The Ravens will win the division with a win next week or a Steelers loss.Statistically, Jackson leads Allen in rushing yards, passing yards, passer rating and passing touchdowns. Allen leads in rushing touchdowns, and some advanced stats like EPA (expected points added) per play prefer Allen. Jackson probably has more help. Allen’s team has the better record. It’s one of the more interesting MVP debates in a while.The truth is, Jackson’s legacy changes some with a third MVP but a Super Bowl would do way more for it. The Ravens have taken some bad losses this season. But over the past few weeks they look more and more like a contender. Blowing out the Texans on Christmas should be a message to the rest of the AFC, and perhaps MVP voters as well.LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER40 updatesWed, December 25, 2024 at 7:38 PM ESTLamar Jackson breaks Michael Vick's recordLamar Jackson is now the NFL's all-time quarterback leader in rushing yards.
