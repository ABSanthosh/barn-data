(0:57)Jordan RaananMar 26, 2025, 06:52 PM ETCloseJordan Raanan covers the New York Giants for ESPN and can be heard hosting on ESPN Radio. Raanan joined ESPN in 2016.EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Russell Wilson is coming to the New York Giants with the expectation that he will be the starting quarterback. It's no different than the approach he has taken every year of his illustrious career, which includes a Super Bowl victory and multiple Pro Bowls.Wilson officially signed with the Giants on Wednesday, less than a week after the team added veteran quarterback Jameis Winston as a free agent. New York also re-signed Tommy DeVito earlier this offseason.None of that has altered Wilson's mentality.\"Yeah, I expect to be the starter and come in here and be ready to rock and roll every day,\" Wilson said during an introductory news conference via video when asked how the situation was laid out by the Giants. \"I think this team's really looking for somebody to lead them in every way.\"Wilson, 36, started 11 games last season for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He has been a starter every year of his career, even as a rookie third-round pick by the Seattle Seahawks in 2012.But at this point of his career, he had to wait until the second tier of free agency to find the right spot. Wilson had interest in returning to the Steelers and also visited with the Cleveland Browns.He agreed to terms with the Giants on Tuesday night after being stuck in a quarterback waiting game that seemed to revolve around Aaron Rodgers. The Giants and Steelers were among the teams interested in Rodgers. Pittsburgh is still waiting for an answer from Rodgers, who visited last week.\"Aaron Rodgers is a tremendous football player,\" Wilson said. \"He's done some amazing things in this league. I've been fortunate to be able to do some great things, too. And really what I'm focused on is right now and what we can do here. That's been my focus since I've signed and everything else. And also, too, along the way is finding a place that continues to believe in you.\"One caveat for Wilson is that the Giants are still believed to be in the market for a quarterback in this year's draft. They have the No. 3 pick and Colorado's Shedeur Sanders could be in serious consideration.Even if the Giants don't pick Sanders, they could grab a quarterback with a later pick, either by moving into the back end of the first round or on Day 2 of the draft. Owner John Mara said earlier this year that finding a quarterback of the future was the organization's \"No. 1 issue\" this offseason. That hasn't been addressed, considering Wilson and Winston are not signed long term and both are well into their respective careers.At the start of Wilson's professional journey, he won the starting job over a newly signed Matt Flynn in Seattle. Wilson was asked Wednesday how he would manage a similar situation in which a rookie could be added to the quarterback room.\"If we draft a quarterback, we will make sure that he does everything he can to be ready to go and be prepared with his mentality,\" Wilson said. \"But for me, it's about the process of winning. I'm focused on winning, what I can do as a quarterback of the New York Giants to help us win and to do everything that we can to lead.\"As the Giants searched for a veteran quarterback this offseason, part of the allure seemed to be that they could help a young quarterback obtained through the draft as a mentor of sorts. This could be a role that Wilson and Winston are asked to play if the Giants elect to add to the quarterback room in the draft. Wilson's approach won't change regardless.\"Yeah, I think the first thing is you always handle yourself first. You always get yourself prepared at the highest level and control what you can control,\" he said. \"And part of that is doing everything I can to be my best every day. And then from there, from leading in that sense, everybody else grows with you from that. They learn from you, they see how you work, they see your practice habits, they see your mental habits and how you go about it. Your approach every day. And so I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to lead, not just the quarterback room, but really the locker room in every way.\"Wilson noted the players in the Giants locker room as a key factor in his decision to sign. He downplayed any notion that he and his wife, pop star Ciara, chose New York because of all that comes with being under the bright lights in the big city.The Super Bowl-winning quarterback said his decision was \"about football.\" The Giants' situation offered an opportunity to start and an intriguing roster.Among the many players that Wilson mentioned was wide receiver Malik Nabers. The prospect of playing with the second-year receiver seemed to energize him.\"He's an explosive athlete,\" Wilson said of Nabers, who had 109 catches and 1,204 yards as a rookie. \"Just his ability to make plays. I love Malik, man.\"",
