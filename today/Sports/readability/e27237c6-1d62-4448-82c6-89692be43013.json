  "text": "Shaun Murphy compiled only the sixth maximum 147 break in the history of the Masters on his way to a win that set up a final against world champion Kyren Wilson.Murphy achieved the feat in his 6-3 semi-final win over Mark Allen on Saturday.He will now face Wilson, who emerged as an impressive 6-3 winner in a meeting with world number one Judd Trump, who had defeated him at the same stage of the UK Championship in November.Wilson, who is second in the rankings, enjoyed breaks of 61, 89, 60, 76, 88 and 85 before getting over the winning line with a superb century.Earlier on Saturday, Murphy's maximum came as he established a 4-2 lead over Northern Ireland's Allen in the best-of-11 encounter.\"I can't believe it. It was an incredible moment, one of the best of my snooker career,\" Murphy told BBC Sport\"I have wanted to make a 147 in one of the BBC events since I was a child. I had a great opportunity the other day and totally messed it up. I had great support from the crowd, who were absolutely amazing.\"He is only the fifth player to record a 147 break - clearing all 15 reds with 15 blacks, followed by all the colours - at the Masters since the event was first staged in 1975.Kirk Stevens recorded the first in 1984, while Ding Junhui (twice), Marco Fu and Allen have also achieved snooker perfection.Nicknamed 'the Magician', Murphy had been unable to conjure up a 147 in his quarter-final win against Neil Robertson.But he made no mistake this time, displaying immaculate cue-ball control throughout.It prompted joyous scenes as the fans inside Alexandra Palace erupted, with Murphy being warmly congratulated by Allen.\"The 147 was such a buzz to be part of even though I was on the wrong end of it this year,\" Allen added.World number seven Murphy has now made nine 147 breaks during his career, with Ronnie O'Sullivan (15), John Higgins (13) and Stephen Hendry (11) the only players to have recorded more.His effort against Allen - the 210th 147 in professional snooker history - puts him on course to claim the £15,000 prize awarded for the tournament's highest break.Murphy, 42, who won the tournament in 2015, had trailed 2-0, with world number four Allen dominating the early tactical exchanges.However, the momentum shifted in a more open third frame, and Murphy then levelled with a run of 83 on the way to reeling off four consecutive frames, culminating with the 147.A timely half-century briefly helped Allen reduce the arrears, but when he missed a red while attempting a plant, Murphy was able to knock in a 72 to go 5-3 ahead.He secured his victory - and place in Sunday's final - after winning a safety battle on the green in the ninth frame.Wilson and Trump were facing each other for the fourth time this term, with the 2024 Crucible winner having already tasted success in the finals of the Xi'an Grand Prix and Northern Ireland Open.But the manner of Trump's triumphs over Barry Hawkins and Ding Junhui in the earlier rounds here, plus his comfortable victory over Wilson in York in November, had cast him as the slight favourite.And when he fought back from 2-0 down to 2-2 and then edged ahead after Wilson conceded over 40 points in fouls in the fifth frame, a classic encounter looked set to develop.The match then swayed back towards the 2018 finalist, with Trump, who had surpassed O'Sullivan's record for the most prize money earned in a season by reaching the last four, suddenly making uncharacteristic errors under increasing pressure.That was highlighted as Wilson scored 355 points to Trump's 15 as he reeled off four successive frames to advance into Sunday's final.\"I've had an amazing season but I am not happy to leave it there and I want to add more to it,\" Wilson told BBC Sport.\"Without sounding cocky, you feel like the man because it does not get any better than being world champion. He'd have gone into that in his own mind as a big favourite but I always fancy it. You all start from scratch.\"",
