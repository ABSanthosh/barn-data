  "text": "Scotland's Gary Anderson failed to reach the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix in Leicester after a surprise 3-0 defeat by Mike de Decker.Belgium's De Decker, who is through to a first major quarter-final after averaging 96, won the opening three legs to claim the first set at a canter.Anderson then claimed his first leg but De Decker held his throw twice before taking the second set with a clinical 120 finis.De Decker then produced an impressive 160 checkout to edge towards victory in the third set before holding his throw to close out the match.Speaking to Sky Sports, De Decker said: \"It's massive. I always had a problem bringing my floor game to the stage but it's clicking this week and I hope I can keep this up.\"I'm just trying my best every single game. I'm not keen on all the attention and I'm just doing my thing.\"De Decker will face England's James Wade, who saw off Welshman Gerwyn Price 3-0.Wade closed out the first set with a double 10 before Price appeared to engineer a way back into the match at the start of the second - only to miss all three attempts at tops.That allowed Wade a chance to capitalise - taking the first two legs and, while Price hit back to reduce the deficit, the Englishman won the set.Price continued to struggle on the doubles in the third set but Wade remained ruthless as he claimed victory to progress into Friday's quarter-finals. Elsewhere, England's Joe Cullen came from behind to edge a thriller with Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney 3-2.Cullen trailed 2-1 before setting up a deciding set by taking the fourth with an impressive 79 finish, which included two double 18s. The Englishman went 2-0 up in the final set before sealing victory with his fifth match dart to set-up a last-eight meeting with Dimitri Van den Bergh.Belgium's Van den Bergh lost the opening set to England's Dave Chisnall but recovered to progress with a 3-1 victory after his sixth match dart at double top.",
