  "text": "There was a shakeup in the NFL Draft order after Week 17.The New York Giants played their way out of the top overall pick with a surprising victory Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts, an outcome that benefitted the New England Patriots, who can clinch the top pick with a loss on Sunday. The Cleveland Browns are in the top spot for the time being after their loss Saturday, but both New England and Tennessee can still move ahead of them.Here are some of the ramifications of that Giants victory, which eliminated the Colts from the postseason race, per Yahoo Sports' Frank Schwab:There can be a reasonable argument to be made that the first pick isn't worth it anyway. Miami's Cam Ward and [Shedeur] Sanders are the top quarterback draft prospects, and there's skepticism about them both. Neither is a sure franchise quarterback. But the Giants were at least going to have their pick of the two if they secured No. 1. Now, they'll likely need to wait and see what falls to them, or if anyone leaps over them in a trade to get Ward or Sanders.The Raiders' victory against the New Orleans Saints also benefitted the Patriots. Las Vegas and New York could use a new quarterback, and both Miami star Cam Ward and Colorado star Shedeur Sanders are available and expected to go early in the draft. It would've been an easy move for the Giants and Raiders to scoop either quarterback had they lost on Sunday. Now it's unclear if either player will still be around by the time they are on the clock.Here's a look at the current NFL Draft order with Week 18 underway.*already played in Week 181.
