Swiatek played with more pace and intensity to sweep past the Russian, who looked undercooked after her late call-up.\"I was hitting the ball really well and picking the right shots to play faster,\" said Swiatek.Why reaching semi-finals is 'unimaginable' for KrejcikovaDespite her status as the Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova arrived at the end-of-season tournament - where the leading eight WTA players of the year compete for the singles title - as the rank outsider.She finished 12th in the seasonal race but qualified on the basis of winning one of the sport's four major titles. On the eve of the tournament, there were doubts about her fitness after she pulled out of the Ningbo Open quarter-finals with a back injury.However, she has found her best form at the right time to reach the last four of the WTA Finals for the first time.After letting a lead slip in a three-set defeat by Swiatek, Krejcikova has recovered with back-to-back wins against Jessica Pegula and Gauff.\"The Wimbledon victory is the highest point of my career and being here and reaching the semi-finals is something unimaginable,\" said Krejcikova, who saved 11 of 12 break points against Gauff.\"I was fighting for every ball. I knew it would be difficult because Coco is on a roll and one of the best players this season. \"The big prize - the semi-final - was on the table and I just tried to enjoy myself.\"More on this story",
