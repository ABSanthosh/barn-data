  "text": "McIlroy leads Masters as he chases career Grand SlamMedia caption, Watch: McIlroy in 'awesome position' going into final Masters roundMasters third-round leaderboard-12 R McIlroy (NI); -10 B DeChambeau (US); -8 C Conners (Can); -6 P Reed (US), L Aberg (Swe); -5 J Day (Aus), S Scheffler (US), S Lowry (Ire), J Rose (Eng)Selected others: -4 Z Johnson (US), X Schauffele (US); -3 C Morikawa (US), V Hovland (Nor); -2 T Hatton (Eng); -1 J Spieth (US); Level J Rahm (Spa); +1 A Rai (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng); +2 M Fitzpatrick (Eng); +3 D Willett (Eng)Full leaderboardRory McIlroy moved closer to finally winning the Masters with a commanding third-round performance which leaves him two shots clear going into Sunday's finale.The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland carded a six-under 66 - featuring two eagles - to head a star-stacked leaderboard with a score of 12 under after 54 holes.McIlroy's advantage looked destined to be bigger but the complexion of the task ahead changed when Bryson DeChambeau narrowed the gap with three birdies in his final four holes - including a 50-foot putt from the fringe of the 18th green.The American maverick, who beat McIlroy to last year's US Open title in a dramatic finish, set up a tantalising Masters Sunday with a three-under 69 to close on 10 under.McIlroy has already landed four majors - the US Open, The Open and two US PGA Championships, the last of which was in 2014 - but has fallen short at Augusta National on several occasions.The most infamous instance came in 2011. Then, aged 21, he blew a four-shot lead as he took 80 shots on a haunting final day and finished in a tie for 15th.Now, after a display which showed his ever-increasing maturity, the world number two holds another golden opportunity to become only the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam of winning all four majors.Canada's Corey Conners is eight under after a 70, while 2018 champion Patrick Reed and last year's runner-up Ludvig Aberg are six under.English veteran Justin Rose, who led at the halfway stage, dropped off the pace and is five under after a 75.The former world number one is alongside defending champion Scottie Scheffler, Ireland's 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry and Australia's Jason Day.Steely focus moves McIlroy closer to historyMedia caption, Best shots from Masters day threeAs Augusta founding father Bobby Jones famously said, the toughest distance in golf is the five inches between a player's ears. Controlling the mind has been a key part of McIlroy's work this week as he tries to finally land the Green Jacket on his 17th appearance at this pristine plot of land in Georgia – and his 11th attempt to complete the career Grand Slam.Consulting renowned sports psychologist Bob Rotella has been helping provide perception and patience. That enabled McIlroy to compartmentalise the two late double bogeys which ruined his opening round and bounce back with a six-under 66 on Friday which thrust him into contention.Before starting his third round in the penultimate group, McIlroy talked about following the same principle on Saturday. The pair discussed \"letting the score come\" to McIlroy, who was hellbent on not trying to \"force the issue\" as he chased down Rose.The scores not only came to McIlroy - they sprinted towards him from the start.Wearing a solemn and focused expression throughout, McIlroy refused to get carried away with the highs of his round, or too disheartened by stickier patches.\"You have to try to ride that momentum as much as you can but then also temper it with a little bit of rationale and logic,\" he said.\"It's a fine dance. I certainly don't want to be a robot out there, but at the same time I don't want to be too animated, either.\"How McIlroy took command before DeChambeau closed inMedia caption, McIlroy makes incredible start with eagle on secondMcIlroy opened with a birdie after a monster 371-yard drive on the first, then magnificently chipped in for an eagle on the par-five second to quickly move into the outright lead.The dream start continued with birdies on three and five as McIlroy became the first player to start a Masters round with six successive threes.A minor blip came when McIlroy pushed his tee shot on the seventh into the pine trees on the right, but his lucid thinking was evident again as he punched out to left of the green.Confidence flowing, he showed a piece of real quality - beautifully-judging a tricky chip on a devilish green – to set up a par-saving putt.The quality of McIlroy's touch was emphasised minutes later by Rose – from a similar angle - splashing out of the bunker and running 27 feet past the pin to the fringe of the green.As McIlroy knows too well, Augusta has the propensity to bite back quickly. He dropped a shot on the long eighth and, after scrambling to save par on the ninth, the rocky patch resulted in a three-putt bogey on the 10th.In contrast, Conners birdied the same three holes. The level-headed Canadian moved alongside DeChambeau and a shot behind McIlroy.Now it felt like a true test of McIlroy's resilience.Saving par on 11 from eight feet steadied him and a par followed on the treacherous 12th before a welcome birdie on the 13th.With Conners missing a birdie putt on 14 providing more encouragement, McIlroy turned on the style again.An outstanding second shot to eight feet on the par-five 15th led to another eagle – the first time he had ever converted two in the same round at a major – before rounding off with three pars.Media caption, McIlroy extends Masters lead with eagle on 15McIlroy, though, watched what could have been a more comfortable advantage disappear thanks to DeChambeau's defiance.The big-hitting American has changed tack at Augusta National, softening the hubristic approach he showed in 2020 - when he claimed it was effectively a \"par 67\" which he could drive through - and now treating the course with more respect.However, he lacked feel with his irons for large parts on Saturday, only to find his touch at the right time with a strong finish.Backed by a supportive Augusta crowd which has warmed to his unique approach to the game, DeChambeau looks the likeliest to deny McIlroy.The pair will go out in the last group at 19:30 BST on Sunday.\"It's always important in a major championship to try and be in the final group or close to the final group,\" said DeChambeau.\"It was definitely fun knowing that it was Rory and knowing that we could have a good matchup.\"We're not the only players out there. There's still a lot of great players. But it's going to be a fun test.\"Media caption, DeChambeau holes 'impossible' putt on 18thRose and Scheffler left behind on 'Moving Day'The penultimate round of a major is known as 'Moving Day' and an electric start saw Rose, DeChambeau and McIlroy each hold a slice of the early lead.Rose, bidding to become the oldest first-time champion since Mark O'Meara in 1998, was unable to get going as his rivals rallied.The 44-year-old former world number one was one over at the turn before fading further on the second nine.It was also a day where Scheffler - the tournament favourite alongside McIlroy - got left behind.The current world number one could not find top gear as he shot a level-par 72.\"At times I felt good. At times I felt bad. I just couldn't really get anything going,\" the 28-year-old American said. \"I ended up with even, which felt like I had to scramble a lot actually.\"Follow all the action of the final round with live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app from 18:00 BST.
