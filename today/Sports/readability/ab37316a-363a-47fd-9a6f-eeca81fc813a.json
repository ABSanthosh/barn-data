  "text": "Memphis has raised $201 million toward a $226 million goal for renovations to Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium, athletic director Ed Scott said June 17.Scott, speaking alongside Tigers' coaches at an event at Owners Box in Lakeland, said the department is still on track to finish the project before the 2026 football season.\"We're really excited about that,\" he said.The project will continue throughout the 2025 season and means the Tigers will play their home slate in front of a reduced capacity stadium like they did in 2024. Construction has been ongoing since summer 2024.Officials initially estimated it would cost $220 million to renovate the stadium. The city agreed to allocate $120 million in state money to the project, while FedEx founder Fred Smith and his family donated $50 million. The university had to raise the additional $50 million.As part of that deal, the city also transferred ownership of the stadium to the university. The stadium will host a concert for the first time in more than 25 years when Chris Brown performs in October.\"We own an asset now, a real estate asset that plays seven to nine football games a year,\" Scott said. \"We have to make money in other ways. But if we can bring concerts to the community, the TDZ tax also helps benefit the city. So for me, it's a win-win. It allows us to do something great for the city, bring in more money, but it allows us also to bring in more money for us to be able to pay for the stadium.\"Scott also said the university has raised more than $7 million toward a new soccer stadium that will be called Liza Wellford Fletcher Stadium. That's the amount officials said they needed to initially raise when the project was announced last year.\"I want to say this in front of everybody,\" Scott said. \"I want to say this to (women's soccer coach) Brooks Monaghan, I want to say it to all of our fans and everyone from Memphis, that project is real and we are going to build that stadium. And our women's soccer program, our men's soccer program and our track and field student athletes deserve that first-class facility.\"Reach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on X @thejonahdylan.
