  "text": "The sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrating bare chested with arms outstretched, his red shirt hoisted on a corner flag at King Power Stadium, will become an iconic image of Liverpool's march to the Premier League title.Amid the wild elation that followed his late winner at relegated Leicester City, it left Liverpool's big questions still hanging in the air.Will Alexander-Arnold leave his home city club behind in pursuit of new glory with Real Madrid in Spain? Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?Questions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.Speculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. He said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"Liverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"An air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.Liverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury.It took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool.The scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid.Could there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation?Could the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move?There is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district.He has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.It may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.When he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.Alexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.It left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.After the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.Will it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?For now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.Slot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"As for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.",
