  "text": "With six defeats in their past 10 games, a loss to their biggest rivals and closer to the relegation zone than the top four, things are going from bad to worse for Tottenham Hotspur.Wednesday's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal at Emirates Stadium leaves Spurs 13th with 24 points, 14 off Newcastle in fourth but just eight above 18th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.There would be a brief moment of cheer for Tottenham fans in the game when Son Heung-min fired them ahead in the 25th minute, but that was to be the last time they managed a shot on target as Arsenal scored twice in four minutes to win.\"We were nowhere near the levels we needed to be at today,\" Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said after the game.\"The fact we went out in the first half in such a big game and were so passive, it was unacceptable. And we paid a price for it.\"Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer believes Tottenham's form will be a worry for the club's supporters.\"Without doubt the Tottenham fans have to be concerned,\" he said on Match of the Day. \"I know they have injuries but you can't go up against your rivals and your manager come out at the end of the game and say that the team were nowhere near their levels. \"That is unacceptable.\"Tottenham have lost 11 games in the Premier League this season; their joint-most at this stage of a single campaign in the competition (also 11 in 1997-98, 2003-04 and 2008-09).The only sides who have lost more in the league this season than Tottenham are the three teams currently in the relegation zone - Wolves, Leicester and Southampton.Since beating Aston Villa 4-1 on 3 November, Tottenham have lost eight, drawn four and only won five of their 17 games in all competitions, although three of those victories have been against Manchester City (4-0 away), Manchester United (4-3 home) and Liverpool (1-0 home).Tottenham have failed to win in their past five games in the Premier League; their last joint-longest winless streak was 6 November to 7 December 2023.Spurs have lost 18 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season - only Fulham (19) have lost more.Tottenham have won just one of their past nine Premier League matches (drawn two, lost six), with that victory coming at bottom side Southampton (5-0). Indeed, since the start of this run only Leicester (four) and Southampton (one) have earned fewer points in the Premier League than Spurs (five).Spurs have not finished outside the top 10 in the Premier League since 2007-08 when they came 11th, but did win the League Cup.After Tottenham lost to Arsenal in the first north London derby of the season back in September, Postecoglou defiantly declared he \"always wins a trophy\" in his second season.They were comments aimed at allaying fans' fears of a trophyless season, but instead they have been used to - as Postecoglou has said himself - mock him after a bad result.Silverware does remain on the cards with Tottenham in the Europa League and holding a 1-0 first-leg advantage over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup.But Postecoglou knows results must improve soon.He added: \"Of course the defeats hurt me. Not acceptable. Too many losses this year. Too many games getting away from us. \"It needs to stop.\"Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown feels pressure is mounting on Postecoglou, saying his style of play is at times proving costly as they continue to play a high-pressing game.\"Tottenham took so many risks and Arsenal took advantage - the game was so open,\" Keown said on TNT Sports.\"Manchester United will probably go above Spurs. A difficult moment for them and the manager is skating on thin ice.\"Former Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon added: \"One win in nine - it's not good enough at all.\"This puts a lot of unrest in that [Tottenham] camp. If they weren't in the Carabao Cup semi-finals there would be big problems.\"Son said the players also need to stand up and be counted.\"It's up to the players as well,\" the striker said. You have to listen to what we want to do. I think we were not disciplined enough.\"We have to do better in every aspect. When you look at table it's not good enough.\"Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand criticised Tottenham's defending, saying: \"It's like watching an academy under-18s game when the kids are working it out for themselves.\"I would be screaming at my goalkeeper, my defenders. Play over the press, not into the press.\"Allowances do have to be made for Tottenham's injury list - they went into the north London derby with nine players ruled out.Their defence in particular has taken a hit with goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, Destiny Udogie, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven and Ben Davies all sidelined.But despite that, Spurs fans will feel they still have enough in the squad to be battling further up the table.Former Tottenham and Liverpool striker Peter Crouch said on TNT Sports: \"We all know the injury problems, but the two 18-year-olds [Lucas Bergvall and Archie Gray] were the best players. \"If I'm a more experienced player I feel embarrassed. I look at Son, he has had a disappointing season.\"They need players back - that team out there is not good enough in the league. I don't see them catching the top teams.\"Ferdinand believes Postecoglou needs to become more flexible with his approach to games.\"Maybe he has to be more adaptable with his tactics,\" he added.\"I understand and respect Ange's principles but, with the injuries, surely you have to adapt them. Adaptability would be sensible at this time.\"Next up for Tottenham is a trip to David Moyes' Everton on Sunday (14:00 GMT), a match Postecoglou knows is hugely important.\"No other way of looking at it,\" he said. \"If you give up now, there's no point. Right now we have a big game against Everton this weekend. That's our focus.\"",
