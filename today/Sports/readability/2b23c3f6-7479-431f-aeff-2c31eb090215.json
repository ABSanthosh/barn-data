He suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 2 of the 2023 season against the Pittsburgh Steelers, forcing him to miss the first six games of the 2024 season before he returned in Week 7 and scored a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals.But Chubb failed to regain his Pro Bowl form before his season ended prematurely because of a broken foot in Week 15.In eight games, he ran for 332 yards and recorded career lows in yards per attempt (3.3) and percentage of carries that gained at least 10 yards (4.9%).Houston hopes Chubb can recapture his pre-injury production and form a one-two combo with Mixon, who totaled 1,016 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns en route to earning a Pro Bowl selection in 2024.Chubb's expected signing in Houston was first reported by NFL Network.",
