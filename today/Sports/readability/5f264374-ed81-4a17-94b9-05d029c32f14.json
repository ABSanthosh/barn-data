But the Bills' offense was able to take advantage of his second.The Bills took a 14-7 lead early in the second quarter on a 1-yard Josh Allen rushing touchdown on a tush push play.— NFL (@NFL) January 20, 2025 Allen now has his seventh rushing touchdown of the season when utilizing the push sneak. Allen and Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts are the only players with more than one such rushing touchdown this season (Hurts has 10).The score came after safety Damar Hamlin sacked Jackson and he fumbled the ball. Defensive end Von Miller recovered the ball and ran it back 34 yards. The Bills' offense scored four plays later.Earlier in the half, it took just one drive for the Bills' offense to respond to an early score by the Ravens and tie the divisional round matchup at 7-7.The Bills' defense gave up a touchdown on the Ravens' opening possession, but when the Bills' offense got the ball, the unit went downfield with precision. The team ran the ball on all but two plays, including the 1-yard rushing touchdown by rookie running back Ray Davis to make it a 7-7 game. It was his only snap of the drive and the first postseason touchdown of his career.— NFL (@NFL) January 19, 2025 The drive got going on a 34-yard pass from Allen to wide receiver Khalil Shakir on third-and-8 from the Buffalo 32-yard line.On the following Baltimore possession, safety Taylor Rapp picked off Jackson, giving the Bills the ball at their own 43-yard line.— NFL (@NFL) January 20, 2025",
