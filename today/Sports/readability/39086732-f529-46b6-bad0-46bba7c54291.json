  "text": "Bill Belichick is over the Lombardi Trophy.Instead, the longtime New England Patriots head coach wants it renamed to honor the quarterback with whom he won six trophies.Belichick, now the head coach at North Carolina, proposed the idea of renaming the iconic Super Bowl trophy after Tom Brady on the “Let’s Go!” podcast this week. Brady won seven Super Bowl rings throughout his career, six of which were with Belichick in New England.“Maybe they should name it the Brady trophy,” Belichick said. “He won seven of them.”The Super Bowl trophy is named after former Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, who led the team to wins in the first two Super Bowls. Lombardi died from cancer in 1970, and the league changed the trophy’s name to honor him moving forward.While there’s no doubting Brady’s success in the big game — he led one of the best dynasties in NFL history, is a five-time Super Bowl MVP and won more Super Bowl rings than anyone else before he retired for good and joined Fox as an analyst — Belichick’s argument is that the head coach has little to do with the team’s success.\"Players win games. You can't win games without good players,” Belichick said on the podcast. \"I don't care who the coach is, it's impossible. You can't win without good players. You know, I found that out when I had [Lawrence] Taylor and [Carl] Banks and Harry Carson, Pepper Johnson, Jim Burt, Everson Walls, all those guys [when I was an assistant with] the Giants. And same thing when we got good at Cleveland and then at New England. I mean, it's [Tom] Brady, it's [Willie] McGinest, it's [Mike] Vrabel, it's [Tedy] Bruschi, it's Corey Dillon, it's Randy Moss, Troy Brown, Lawyer Milloy, Ty Law, Rodney Harrison. Those are guys that won the games, man. I didn't make any tackles. I didn't make any kicks. That was [Adam] Vinatieri that made that kick in four inches of snow.\"You got to have good players and as a coach, you want to give your players a chance to win. You want to put them in a position where if they go out there and play well, they'll have a chance to win. That's what Coach [Bill] Parcells taught me, is there's always a way to win. You just got to figure out what it is, and you have to give the players a chance.\"Brady is sure to have some awards named after him eventually. After the career he had, it’d be shocking if that never happened. But if the Super Bowl trophy is going to be renamed in his honor, it for sure won’t be done in time for Super Bowl LIX next month.",
