Several key players are set to hit free agency next week, including linebacker Zack Baun, defensive linemen Josh Sweat and Milton Williams and guard Mekhi Becton.With a number of star players locked into lucrative long-term deals, general manager Howie Roseman spoke last month about the need to rely on players on their rookie contracts in some areas.\"As the cap gets tighter, as all our expensive players start becoming expensive, you have to go with young players,\" Roseman said.The Eagles positioned themselves well for the transition at cornerback by selecting Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean with their first two picks last April. Both had standout rookie campaigns for a unit that finished No. 1 in overall defense and against the pass in 2024.One question ahead for defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is whether to move DeJean outside or keep him in the slot, where he made a number of big plays last season, highlighted by his pick-six against Patrick Mahomes in Super Bowl LIX.Slay, 34, played the past five seasons in Philadelphia and put together one of the better runs at cornerback in Eagles history. He served as a captain multiple times and is credited with helping shepherd the young defensive backs, including Mitchell. Last season, he appeared in 14 games and had 13 passes defended, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery and 49 tackles.He began his career with the Detroit Lions, who selected him in the second round of the 2013 draft.He has been named to the Pro Bowl six times -- three with the Lions and three during his time in Philadelphia. He was a first-team All-Pro with the Lions in 2017 when he led the NFL with eight interceptions and 26 passes defended.He has 28 interceptions in 12 seasons.",
