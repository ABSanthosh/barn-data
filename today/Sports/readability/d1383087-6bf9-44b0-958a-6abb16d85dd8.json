  "text": "The Cowboys drafted USC right tackle Tyron Smith, a physical marvel, in 2011. Though they clearly took him at a spot in the NFL draft where they were going to move him to left tackle, then-head coach Jason Garrett, in his first full season at the helm, allowed veteran Doug Free to stay at left tackle and season Smith on the right side for a year.Tyler Guyton was not so fortunate. Drafted in Mike McCarthy's lame-duck and eventually final season, the Oklahoma right tackle was moved to the left side. The veteran tackle in place, Terence Steele, had been playing on the left side and with no other options, Guyton was given a clear path to the left tackle slot. It didn't go well.Guyton won the job, but had one of the worst tackle performances in the NFL last season, ranking 57th of 58 qualified tackles in Pro Football Focus grading. During the second half of the season, he was in an out of the lineup, benched both for injuries and performance. He'll look to prove he's better equipped to handle the NFL grind this offseason, as the new Cowboys coaching staff decided the best approach would be reassurance, not more pressure.RundownPosition: Offensive GuardAge: 24Height: 6-foot-7Weight: 322 poundsHometown: Manor, TXHigh School: Manor HighCollege: TCU, Oklahoma (Film Study Video)Draft: 2024 First-round pick (No. 29 Overall)Acquired: 2024 DraftContract: Four-year contract (2024), $13.1 million2025 Base Salary: $1.4 millionCareer Earnings: $7.2 million (per Over The Cap)ProfileInstead of going out and signing a veteran swing tackle who could challenge Guyton to start the year, the Cowboys instead chose to not only stand pat, but allow the only veteran depth they had last year, Chuma Edoga, go unsigned. Behind Guyton, the only competition currenly is third-year pro Asim Richards.The Cowboys could certainly change direction once training camp reveals Guyton's potential for 2025. Several veterans remain on the open market, and no one would blame new head coach Brian Schottenheimer, OC Klayton Adams and OL coach Conor Riley for having short fuses.Another potential outcome is that Guyton is returned to the right side, to challenge Terence Steele for the starting right tackle job, returning to more familiar territory. There are numerous outcomes which could occur, but perhaps the most likely is that, with a full season under his belt, and a new staff to implement better teaching sessions than he received under Mike Solari. The 2025 Cowboys are focused on improving line play, and no position on the line has a longer landing strip than Guyton at left tackle.FollowÂ Cowboys Wire on FacebookÂ to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!
