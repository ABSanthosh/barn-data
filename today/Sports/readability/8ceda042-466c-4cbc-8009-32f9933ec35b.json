  "text": "\"The mood is buzzing, the music is bouncing and everyone is happy.\"Those were the words of Crystal Palace striker Eddie Nketiah after he scored his first Premier League goal for the club in the 4-1 win over Aston Villa at Selhurst Park on Tuesday.Palace have turned a corner after a slow start to the season, winning just one of their first 10 league games, and are now on a run of just three losses in 15 matches. They sit 12th in the Premier League table, but are just eight points off Manchester City in fifth, having played a game more.\"We know that we can perform very well and this is what we showed today,\" said manager Oliver Glasner.The thrashing of Villa felt like a key moment with a number of milestones for players in the Crystal Palace squad. England midfielder Adam Wharton started his first league game since October after injury, France striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored again, England playmaker Eberechi Eze looked back to his free-flowing self and striker Nketiah scored his first goal for Palace in the Premier League since signing from Arsenal in the summer.Senegal forward Ismaila Sarr, meanwhile, scored two goals on his 27th birthday. The Eagles have the chance to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals if they beat London rivals Millwall on Saturday and are now chasing a second successive top-half finish. \"I think we all get the reward and the players get the reward for their hard work,\" Glasner said. \"We expected it and I mentioned it quite often that the start [of the season] would be quite bumpy. Pre-season not going in the perfect way, many players arriving late. The most important thing is that we stayed together and worked hard. \"I think now we can see the progress and development of individual players, of the system and the players know how we have to play and what we have to do.\"One thing is theory and the other thing is transform it on to the pitch and that's one thing that they are doing really well in the last few weeks and months.\"Glasner was quick to point out, however, that just 10 days ago he was sitting in the same spot disappointed after a 2-1 home defeat by Everton. \"It is always to work on your football and work on the group and stay together,\" he said about his targets. \"This is what we are doing regardless of what the results are.\"England head coach Thomas Tuchel was in attendance for the game and will have been delighted by the performance of midfielder Wharton. The 21-year-old, who signed for the Eagles in February last year, was so impressive in his first season that he was included in the England squad that reached the final of Euro 2024, after just three months of Premier League football. Wharton had a hand in three of the Palace goals on Tuesday and his first-time forward passing shone throughout the match. \"We know the tactics that the gaffer has given us and if we stick to the plan, we know we have a great chance in every game we play.\" Wharton said. Glasner said Wharton \"adjusted so quickly to the pace of the Premier League again after being out a few months''.The performance could not have come at a better time, with Tuchel set to name his first England squad next month. A player who will be delighted with Wharton's return to the team and forward passing is Mateta. The Frenchman has scored eight Premier League goals in 2025 - the joint-most of any player in the competition alongside Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. Mateta, who scored 16 league goals last season, has 12 this campaign and is arguably the most improved player since Glasner arrived. He is the focal point of the attack and his much-improved hold-up play allows the likes of Eze and Sarr to make runs off of him. With a top-10 finish in their sights and a potential FA Cup run, things are looking positive at Selhurst Park",
