  "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers are continuing to make roster moves this offseason in anticipation of the 2025 campaign.The Pittsburgh Steelers are continuing to make roster moves this offseason in anticipation of the 2025 campaign.On Wednesday, the Steelers announced they've added to the offensive line possibilities this offseason with the signing of former Ole Miss Rebels, Buffalo Bills and Houston Texans guard, Nick Broeker.Broeker was placed on waivers by the Texans on May 9 of this offseason. The Springfiled, Illinois, native was drafted out of Ole Miss by the Buffalo Bills with the 230th overall pick in the seventh round of the 2023 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, $3.94 million deal in Buffalo that offseason, but failed to make the final 53-man roster.He was claimed off waivers by the Texans in August of 2023 and appeared in 12 games across two seasons in Houston before being waived again this offseason.The Steelers will throw him into the mix along the offensive line along with Aiden Williams, Spencer Anderson, Calvin Anderson, Dylan Cook, Troy Foutanu, Broderick Jones and Gareth Waitman.Broeker played all 12 games for Mississippi in his true freshman year then started all 10 games at left tackle in 2020 and 13 games in 2021.As a senior in 2022, he switched from tackle to guard, showing some versatility. He was announced as the winner of the Kent Hull Trophy that year, showcasing him as the best college offensive lineman in Mississippi.The Steelers are hoping to bounce back from an early exit in last year's playoffs, where they lost to the division rival Baltimore Ravens, 28-14, in the Wild Card round, finishing off a five-game losing streak to end the season.",
