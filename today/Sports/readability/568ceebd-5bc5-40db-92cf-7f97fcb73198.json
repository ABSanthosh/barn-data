  "text": "Christian Kist hit a nine-darter but lost his PDC World Championship first-round match to Madars Razma.The Dutchman became the first player to seal a perfect leg in the tournament since Michael Smith did so on the way to beating Michael van Gerwen in the 2023 final.Kist, the 2012 BDO world champion at Lakeside, collects £60,000 for the feat, with the same amount being awarded by sponsors to a charity and to one spectator inside Alexandra Palace in London.The 38-year-old's brilliant finish sealed the opening set, but his Latvian opponent bounced back to win 3-2.Darts is one of the few sports that can measure perfection; snooker has the 147 maximum break, golf has the hole-in-one, darts has the nine-dart finish.Kist scored two maximum 180s to leave a 141 checkout which he completed with a double 12, to the delight of more than 3,000 spectators.Two-time semi-finalist Nathan Aspinall dug in to overcome American Leonard Gates 3-1.The English 12th seed, who has been troubled by wrist and back injuries, could next play Andrew Gilding in the third round - which begins on 27 December - should Gilding beat the winner of Martin Lukeman's match against qualifier Nitin Kumar.Aspinall faces a tough task to reach the last four again, with 2018 champion Rob Cross and 2024 runner-up Luke Littler both in his side of the draw.Kist - who was knocked out of last year's tournament by teenager Littler - will still earn a bigger cheque than he would have got for a routine run to the quarter-finals.His nine-darter was the 15th in the history of the championship and first since the greatest leg in darts history when Smith struck, moments after Van Gerwen just missed his attempt.Darts fan Kris, a railway worker from Sutton in south London, was the random spectator picked out to receive £60,000, with Prostate Cancer UK getting the same sum from tournament sponsors Paddy Power.\"I'm speechless to be honest. I didn't expect it to happen to me,\" Kris said.\"This was a birthday present so it makes it even better. My grandad got me tickets. It was just a normal day - I came here after work.\"Kist said: \"Hitting the double 12 felt amazing. It was a lovely moment for everyone and I hope Kris enjoys the money. Maybe I will go on vacation next month.\"Earlier, Jim Williams was favourite against Paolo Nebrida but lost 3-2 in an epic lasting more than an hour.The Filipino took a surprise 2-1 lead and Williams only went ahead for the first time in the opening leg of the deciding set. The Welshman looked on course for victory but missed five match darts.UK Open semi-finalist Ricky Evans set up a second-round match against Dave Chisnall, checking out on 109 to edge past Gordon Mathers 3-2.First roundPaolo Nebrida 3-2 Jim WilliamsMadars Razma 3-1 Christian KistRicky Evans 3-2 Gordon MathersSecond roundNathan Aspinall 3-1 Leonard GatesAll times GMTAfternoon Session (12:30)First roundChris Landman v Lok Yin LeeCallan Rydz v Romeo GrbavacMartin Lukeman v Nitin KumarSecond roundGabriel Clemens v Robert OwenEvening Session (19:00)First roundNick Kenny v Stowe BuntzMensur Suljovic v Matt CampbellScott Williams v Niko SpringerSecond roundMichael Smith v Kevin Doets",
