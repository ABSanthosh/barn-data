  "text": "The latest drama in the Dolphins' Jalen Ramsey situation came from receiver Tyreek Hill earlier today. At Fanatics Fest, Hill said he's going to get Ramsey back in a Dolphins' jersey.\"I'm going to hangout with Ramsey today, so I'm going to get him back. Full-court press, I'm getting him, Ramsey, back in a Dolphins jersey,\" Hill said. \"I don't care what they say - tampering, whatever - we need Ramsey. He's a dog. He's one of the best corners in the league, man. Great leader, great teammate too, though. That's what he doesn't get a lot of credit for. We just need him on the Dolphins man.\"Ramsey and Dolphins mutually agreed to find a trade partner early in the offseason. However, Ramsey remains a Dolphin with less than a month until training camp begins.This week, multiple reports and hints came out of where Ramsey landing spot could be. Ramsey followed multiple Steelers' players on Instagram, potentially indicating him ending up in Pittsburgh.Adam Schefter reported yesterday that Ramsey has interest in playing for a West Coast team, either the Chargers, 49ers or the Rams.The Rams have been heavy in the Ramsey conversation since the beginning, with the cornerback playing four years with the Rams and winning a Super Bowl. Many believed a reunion would be the perfect landing spot for Ramsey.However, Sean McVay said it would take a lot of work to figure out a way to bring Ramsey back to the Rams.There seems to be a lot of uncertainty as to where Ramsey will be playing in 2025. According to Schefter, it'll be on the West Coast. But, Hill is going to do his best to keep Ramsey in Miami for now.",
