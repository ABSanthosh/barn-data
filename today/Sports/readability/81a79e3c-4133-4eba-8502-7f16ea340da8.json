Five of their seven wins have been by one score, and they haven't had a strong run like the Lions or Ravens have had, but steady defensive play and clutch offensive moments have Kansas City once again in the driver's seat in the AFC as the season reaches its midway point. The first-half success has also come alongside Patrick Mahomes' worst statistical season. Entering Week 9, he's in the middle of the pack in passing yards (1,651) and touchdown passes (8) and tied for the league lead in interceptions this season (9).Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield enters Week 9 tied for the league lead in picks as well, but he's also leading the NFL in touchdown passes with 21 for an explosive Bucs passing game. The trouble for Tampa Bay is that it'll be without its top two receivers â€” Chris Godwin is out until at least the start of the playoffs with a dislocated ankle, and Mike Evans is projected to be on the shelf until Week 12 with a hamstring injury.Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium | Kansas City, Mo.TV Channel: ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 (ManningCast)Streaming: ESPN+, FuboLive4 updatesMon, November 4, 2024 at 7:29 PM ESTChiefs look to be taken higherScott Stapp in the house at Arrowhead Stadium ðŸŽ¸... with Chiefs center Creed Humphrey.Mon, November 4, 2024 at 7:24 PM ESTBucs running back Rachaad White is playing in his hometown Kansas City for the first time in his three NFL seasons.White, 25, has rushed for 256 yards on 67 carries with 28 receptions for 236 yards and three TDs this season.Mon, November 4, 2024 at 7:20 PM ESTDeAndre Hopkins arriving for 1st Chiefs home gameTonight's Monday night matchup will be DeAndre Hopkins' second game with the Chiefs.
