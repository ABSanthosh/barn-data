(4:41)ESPN News ServicesOct 10, 2024, 10:47 PM ETNEW YORK -- Napheesa Collier's turnaround jumper with 8.8 seconds left in overtime lifted the Minnesota Lynx to a 95-93 win over the New York Liberty in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals on Thursday night.With the score tied, Collier faked in the lane and scored. New York had a chance to tie it but Breanna Stewart's layup at the buzzer was off.Courtney Williams had 23 points, Kayla McBride 22 and Collier 21 for Minnesota, which trailed by 18 in the first half.

After Stewart's first shot was blocked with a second left and went out of bounds, Ionescu inbounded the ball to her under the basket and she was fouled. The officials reviewed the play to see if the foul occurred before the buzzer sounded and deemed that it did, awarding Stewart two free throws with 0.8 seconds left.She hit the first of two free throws with the second one rolling off the rim.

Minnesota is making its first appearance in the championship round since 2017, when the team won its fourth title in a seven-year span.The Liberty had lost two of the three regular-season meetings to Minnesota and the Commissioner's Cup championship, but both teams have said that those games didn't really matter.The Lynx were able to hold Jones in check in all three of the wins with the Liberty's star center scoring in single digits each time.
