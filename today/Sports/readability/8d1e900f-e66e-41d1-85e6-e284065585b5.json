  "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder (and the Seattle Supersonics before them) have 51 jersey numbers worn by the players who have suited up for the franchise since its founding at the start of the 1967-68 season. To commemorate the players who wore those numbers, Thunder Wire is covering the entire history of jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team.And while those Supersonics jerseys may not remain part of the franchise history should a new team be established in Seattle as was the case with the return of the Charlotte Hornets, they are part of the Thunder's history today.For this article, we continue with the 24th jersey number in the series, jersey No. 22, with 20 players in total having donned the jersey in the history of the franchise.The 20th of those players did so in the Oklahoma City Thunder era, guard alum Cason Wallace. After ending his college career at Kentucky, Wallace was picked up with the 10th overall selection of the 2023 NBA draft by the Dallas Mavericks.The Dallas, Texas native would play the first 2 seasons of his pro career with OKC, however, after being dealt there a few weeks after the draft. He remains with the team at the time of writing.During his time suiting up for the Thunder, Wallace wore only jersey No. 22 and put up 7.5 points, 2.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.3 steals per game.All stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.
