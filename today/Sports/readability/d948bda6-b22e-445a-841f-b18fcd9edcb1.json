  "text": "Lucy Bronze scored the penalty that mattered and her feelings after England's win over Sweden summed up the Lionesses' performance - and the penalty shootout - perfectly.It was both \"overwhelming and underwhelming,\" a shootout fraught with nervy moments but lacking in quality.One goalkeeper saving four penalties. The other keeping out two. Three players missing the target. A keeper blasting one over the crossbar.After England dramatically restored their hopes when a Euro 2025 exit looked a near-certainty, a \"stressful\" shootout victory over the Swedes earned them a spot in the semi-finals.\"I think it was just a rollercoaster, both overwhelming and underwhelming,\" Bronze told BBC Sport. \"It was just a crazy game\".Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton echoed Bronze's thoughts, saying it made for \"stressful watching, stressful playing\".She told BBC Sport: \"Every time I saved one I was thinking 'please just put it in so we have a bit of a cushion'. Their keeper then just went and saved the next one and I was thinking 'oh goodness, here we go.'\"Sweden 0-1 England (penalty one)England won the toss, benefitting from a shootout in front of their own fans and took the first penalty.Up stepped Alessia Russo, the Lionesses' trusty goal threat. Jennifer Falk dived the right way, but her powerful effort never looked like being stopped.\"Russo has left nothing on the pitch so to strike that as sweetly as she did - Falk went the right way, nowhere near it,\" former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis said on BBC One.Sweden 0-1 England (penalty two)Hampton stood on the line, her nose bloodied from a collision in the final moments of extra time.Filippa Angeldahl took the first kick for Sweden and sent it towards the right but Hampton got her hands to it.\"She's done her homework,\" reacted Brown-Finnis. Hampton knew exactly where to go.Sweden 0-1 England (penalty three)England couldn't make the most of their advantage.Lauren James tried to place her effort in the bottom left corner but Falk palmed it away.Sweden 1-1 England (penalty four)Sweden issued the perfect response. \"Emphatic, beautifully struck,\" said Brown-Finnis.Julia Zigiotti Olme showed no nerves and left Hampton with no chance. Her well-struck spot-kick went into the top corner and Sweden levelled.Sweden 1-1 England (penalty five)Were emotions not already running high enough, England fans were soon made even more anxious.Beth Mead went for the same place as James and faced the same result - Falk saved. \"It's a cushty height for the goalkeeper,\" said Brown-Finnis.Sweden 1-1 England (penalty six)From a moment of agony to sudden hope.Magdalena Eriksson had the chance to put Sweden in front. Instead, her effort bounced off the far post.Sweden 1-1 England (penalty seven)By this point, Falk was beginning to look like Sweden's saviour.Alex Greenwood sent her penalty down the middle. Falk dived, the ball hit her and it bounced back out.Three of the Lionesses' four penalties saved.Sweden 2-1 England (penalty eight)Nathalie Bjorn put Sweden on the verge of victory, beating her Chelsea team-mate Hampton.England had to score their next.Sweden 2-2 England (penalty nine)Who better than the player who had netted the winning kick in each of England's other two shootouts under Wiegman to deliver when needed?Chloe Kelly produced her trademark run-up, with a hop and a skip before firing past Falk.\"What a night she is having,\" said BBC commentator Robyn Cowen.Kelly had delivered the assist for England's first goal, then the vital cross which led to their second. Now, she'd kept their hopes of a shootout victory alive.Sweden 2-2 England (penalty 10)Stepping up to take Sweden's fifth penalty, to put them into the semi-finals, was none other than keeper Falk.She had already saved three, taking one as well was \"just being greedy,\" said Brown-Finnis.The Sweden goalkeeper could not produce another moment of jubilation for the her supporters and skied her kick over the bar.Sweden 2-2 England (penalty 11)Surely, after yet another miss, England would respond?Not this time. Grace Clinton's weak effort rolled to the left which Falk easily saved.By this point, it looked like the shootout might never end. \"I can't believe how many penalties we've missed,\" said Brown-Finnis.Sweden 2-2 England (penalty 12)Sweden once again had the opportunity to win the match. Sofia Jakobsson placed the ball on the spot with just four of the 12 penalties before her having been scored.She also went to the left, but Hampton tipped it onto the post with her outstretched hand.\"These are cats with nine lives, the Lionesses,\" Brown-Finnis said.Sweden 2-3 England (penalty 13)England's most decorated player stepped up for the big moment.Bronze had no intention of wasting her chance and delivered the perfect penalty, thrashing it down the middle as Falk dived to the right.The Lionesses have talked throughout this tournament about producing \"proper English\" performances - and Bronze's penalty was an \"old school Stuart Pearce type\" of kick, said Brown-Finnis.She added: \"Full of passion, full of heart, no nonsense penalty right into the roof of the net. Great strike, great player, great time.\"Sweden 2-3 England (Smilla Holmberg misses, England win)Sweden had to score to keep their hopes alive. The job fell to 18-year-old Smilla Holmberg to try to level.Holmberg didn't even hit the target. She sent her strike soaring over the crossbar. The English players ran off in celebration.The Lionesses were through.England's record goalscorer Ellen White, who was part of the team that won Euro 2022, said the shootout made for \"terrifying watching\".She said: \"I think you've got to give full credit to Falk as well and the way she saved a lot of those penalties for Sweden. I'd never say a bad word about a player who's missed a penalty.\"England displayed \"character\" in an \"amazing\" show of resilience to turn it around from 2-0 down, added former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley.\"Honestly that was incredible, such tension,\" she said. \"The way the game went, the substitutions, the doubt, the gameplan. So much drama.\"The saves from Hampton and the authority from Bronze. What a fantastic game and what character England showed. Such self-belief to bring them back into the game.\"It was only a game in the last eight, but Brown-Finnis said the \"magnificent finish\" was \"worthy of any final\".Former England captain Steph Houghton added that she thinks the Lionesses have what it takes to get to the final.\"Ultimately, a massive, massive win for England to come back and take it to penalties,\" she added. \"Hannah Hampton had a great game.\"Maverick: After all these years we have finally found a team who where so diabolical at taking penalties that we managed to win one. Other than that massive praise to Lucy Bronze who was and absolute star tonight her performance was outstanding in every way a ture leader.NB22: \"This must have been the greatest penalty shootout ever - and worst penalty shootout ever at the same time.\"Frankie: \"Bronze was immense all game and Kelly's introduction was the turning point\"Sweden could and probably should have had it sewn up by half time\"Surprised Bronze didn't take one of the first 5 pens though she did have strapping on her leg\"Her penalty reminded me of Stuart Pearce's all those years ago\"Kyle: \"The penalty shootout was a comedy of errors for the most part. There were a couple of good penalties, but they were mostly dreadful- underpowered and too near the keepers.\"Both teams look like they could do with a lot of practice in that area.\"Anyway, onward and upward.\"",
