Or will another champion emerge?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler are the two best players in the worldAugusta National. The Green Jacket. Amen Corner. The manicured fairways. The blooming azaleas. Unmistakeably, the Masters.Golf's first men's major of the year is upon us, with the world's finest players making their annual pilgrimage to one of sport's most iconic venues.A 95-man field - including 18 former Masters champions - are aiming to sink the victory-clinching putt come Sunday.Defending champion Scottie Scheffler and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy are the favourites, while five-time winner Tiger Woods is missing as he recovers from surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon.The first tee shot will be hit at 12:40 BST on Thursday - after the ceremonial drives from legendary champions Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson.Here are the main talking points going into the 89th edition of the Masters...Will McIlroy finally land the elusive Green Jacket?McIlroy believes he has never \"been in better form\" coming into the Masters as he looks to finally land the only major title that has eluded him.The 35-year-old Northern Irishman is aiming to become only the sixth man to complete the full collection of Masters, US PGA Championship, the Open Championship and US Open titles.It will be his 11th attempt to follow Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods into the history books.McIlroy, who has seven top-10 finishes in his previous 16 Masters appearances, has already claimed two tournament wins this season at Pebble Beach and TPC Sawgrass.He also believes the experience of golfing \"heartbreak\"- most notably when he capitulated at last year's US Open - can help him getting over the line at Augusta.\"It's going through those times, especially in the last few years I've had chances to win some of the biggest golf tournaments in the world and it hasn't quite happened,\" he said.\"But life moves on. You dust yourself off and you go again.\"Why Scheffler is still the man to beatDespite his impressive form, McIlroy is only the second favourite to slip into the Green Jacket on Sunday.Scheffler, the dominant world number one and defending champion, is still the man to beat, even though his start to the season has been slower.Hampered initially by a hand injury sustained when trying to roll out ravioli with a wine glass on Christmas Day, the 28-year-old American now feels like he is peaking at the right time with a major taking place in each of the next four months.Scheffler finished joint runner-up in Houston two weeks ago after climbing the leaderboard with a seven-under-par 63 in the final round.If he wins again at Augusta National, he will become just the fourth player after Jack Nicklaus (1965-66), Sir Nick Faldo (1989-1990) and Tiger Woods (2001-2002) to win successive titles.Former champion Rahm leads LIV challengeWhile a duel between McIlroy and Scheffler down the stretch on Sunday would be a tantalising prospect for many viewers, they know golf rarely pans out as a two-horse race between the pre-tournament frontrunners.The toughness of the terrain - and pressure of the occasion - means the Masters can throw up surprises. Having said that, the champion almost always knits together a blend of experience, recent form, distance off the tee and a crisp short game.Spanish superstar Jon Rahm has all of those qualities, plus the knowledge of what it takes to win the Green Jacket.Rahm might ply his trade on the 54-hole LIV Golf circuit nowadays, but the 30-year-old remains a ferocious competitor who will have few problems in going the distance if his game is there.Lying third in LIV's individual standings suggests it is, while he hopes not practising at Augusta National before his ninth appearance could turn out to be a lucky omen.\"Out of those nine, seven I came early to practice, this being the second time that I haven't come early,\" he said.\"The other time was 2023 where I ended up winning. If I win this year, then I definitely won't come again early.\"Who are the other leading contenders?Xander Schauffele may not have played much this year because of a rib injury, but it still would be difficult to count out a player who won two majors last year.The American has also clocked up four top-10 finishes in his previous six Masters.Collin Morikawa, ranked one place below Schauffele at fourth in the world, also enjoys Augusta.The US Ryder Cup player has secured three top-10s in his past three starts, while he leads the PGA Tour this season in terms of strokes gained from tee to green.Twelve months ago, Sweden's Ludvig Aberg finished second behind Scheffler - falling short of becoming the third man in history to win on his debut.Aberg, 25, holed four birdies in his final six holes to win the Genesis Invitational in February, but has missed the cut at his past two events.Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, another former champion, Russell Henley of the United States, Norway's Viktor Hovland and American 2023 Open champion Brian Harman all arrive with PGA Tour titles under their belts this year.And who else is spearheading the LIV challenge? Chile's Joaquin Niemann is the leading golfer on the Saudi-backed breakaway tour this season, while American pair Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka - both multiple major winners - can never be discounted.McIlroy leads the players from Great Britain and Northern Ireland trying to secure a rare victory at Augusta.Only Danny Willett - who memorably earned a shock win in 2017 and returning on the back of his lifetime invite - has won since Nick Faldo's second success back in 1996.England's Tommy Fleetwood will be encouraged by his joint third last year, while his compatriot Matt Fitzpatrick is a proven major winner - but without experienced caddie Billy Foster on his bag after their split.Two more Englishmen - Aaron Rai and Laurie Canter - are making their Masters debuts after rising through the rankings.Scotland's Robert MacIntyre is making his first start in three years but made the cut in his first two attempts and arrives with five top-15 returns in 2025.German veteran Bernhard Langer, a two-time champion in 1985 and 1993, will play for the final time, while Argentina's Angel Cabrera controversially returns for the first time in six years following his release from prison.Will the course look different after Hurricane Helene?When the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them.In September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake.Augusta was badly affected. Thousands of trees were felled by 80-100mph winds, wrecking homes and lives in the process.The golf course did not escape, meaning some of the famed holes have a slightly different look.\"Our golf course and grounds are in magnificent condition,\" said Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley.\"We've celebrated the natural beauty of this property for many years, but it is a commitment of our entire Augusta National staff that we will never take for granted. \"As we are here, only six months after Hurricane Helene swept through our community, that sentiment has never meant more than it does at this moment.\"How to follow The Masters on the BBCBBC Sport will have live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra across all four days.There will also be live text commentary, in-play clips, video highlights, reaction and analysis on the BBC Sport website and app.You can find all of the coverage details and timings here.",
