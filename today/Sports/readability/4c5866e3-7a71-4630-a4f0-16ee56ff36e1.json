Up next is free agent IDL Neville Gallimore.With offseason programs now behind us, we will be getting a jump start on our training camp preview by going player-by-player through the Indianapolis Colts' 91-man roster.Going alphabetically, up next is free agent defensive tackle Neville Gallimore.Neville Gallimore's profileHeight: 6-2Weight: 307Age: 28NFL experience: 5 seasonsCollege: OklahomaNo. 922024 Snap count totalsDefense: 308Special teams: 392024 PFF gradesDefense: 49.9Special teams: 58.92024 Season ReviewA third-round pick in 2020 by Dallas, Gallimore played his first four NFL seasons with the Cowboys before joining the LA Rams for the 2024 season.Gallimore flashed his playmaking abilities during the 2024 postseason with the LA Rams. In those two games, Gallimore recorded three sacks and five run-stops while being on the field for only 45 combined snaps.In total, he finished the regular season with six pressures, 22 tackles, and four run stops. According to PFF's metrics, more of Gallimore's snaps came against the run.Compared league-wide to his position group in 2024, Gallimore ranked 51st out of 120 defensive tackles in PFF's pass rush productivity metric. Against the run, he was 133rd in run-stop rate.\"You do what's asked of you, and sometimes you've got to be a jack of all trades,\" Gallimore said in his introductory press conference. \"And I feel like what I brought in the playoffs, I'm looking to expand on that, to bring that coming out through the start of the season, and to carry it forward. I was given an opportunity to contribute and make impactful plays, and that's what I'm looking forward to doing here.\"Looking ahead to the 2025 seasonWe know that DeForest Buckner and Grover Stewart will again be leading the way at defensive tackle, but at a position where four or five players see regular snaps, sound depth is crucial, and it's an area where the Colts have to improve this season.Gallimore will be competing with rookie Tim Smith, third-year player Adetomiwa Adebawore, and Eric Johnson for those rotational snaps behind Buckner and Stewart. As the veteran of that group with far and away the most experience, that likely gives him an upper hand in this competition.Also of note, Gallimore has played up and down the defensive front in his career, and that ability to plug multiple gaps will be a key element in Lou Anarumo's defense, where we expect to see more movement up front.Gallimore signed a one-year deal worth $1.17 million to join the Colts. From a contract perspective, he is not a roster lock with a dead cap hit if released of only $400,000. Facebook Twitter Email",
