  "text": "Arsenal needed something special to book their place in the Women's Champions League semi-finals - and how they produced it.The 3-0 second-leg win over Real Madrid on Wednesday, which sealed a 3-2 victory on aggregate, was arguably the most significant result under manager Renee Slegers so far. Six months ago when she replaced Jonas Eidevall, then as interim boss, Arsenal's season looked set to be one of huge disappointment.Now they find themselves among the elite, preparing to face record eight-time European champions Lyon - coached by former Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro - for a place in the final.\"It's important for the club and the players,\" said Slegers. \"They are part of Arsenal because they want to go far in tournaments, win things and be on the biggest stage. \"So it's important for us. I'm very happy with the result and we're going into the semi-finals.\"Alessia Russo was the star on a magical night at Emirates Stadium as she scored twice and had a further two goals ruled out for offside.England team-mate Chloe Kelly grabbed two assists, with Spain forward Mariona Caldentey joining Russo on the scoresheet during a ruthless second-half display which saw the Gunners score three times in 13 minutes.It was only the second time a club has overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit in the quarter-finals of the competition, with Arsenal having done so against Torres in 2004, losing 2-0 away before a 4-1 home success.\"Without a doubt, that Arsenal team ran all over Real Madrid,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"In those 13 minutes, where they scored three goals, they were absolutely relentless and that's what you have to be at this level. They were outstanding.\"Fans were on their feet at full-time, singing and waving scarves as the players walked around the pitch receiving their deserved plaudits.It had been a complete performance from the Gunners - a total turnaround from their placid display in Spain a week before when they lost 2-0.They pressed with intensity, tested Real Madrid's defence with Kelly's teasing balls and could rely on Russo's sharpness in front of goal. \"It was electric - a masterful gameplan from Renee Slegers and well executed by the Arsenal players,\" said ex-England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on 5 Live. \"They had to go for it.\"They had so many opportunities in the first half and managed to capitalise in the second half and that's what counts. Real Madrid had nothing left.\"Arsenal have had their fair share of success stories at Emirates Stadium. But in a rollercoaster campaign, this was a wonderful high, and a result that will stand out as they booked an eighth semi-final appearance in the competition. Slegers' first victory in charge as interim manager, a day after Eidevall resigned, was in this competition when Arsenal overcame Valerenga 4-1. It felt a stretch then to consider them as European semi-finalists but now, having booked their spot in the last four, Slegers admitted this was \"probably the clearest\" example of their character to fight back.\"We have done really good things before, coming back from setbacks and good performances against top teams,\" she added. \"But this is definitely one of the clearest ones where you play an opponent away, the game looks like it does, the result is what it is, then you have to put this performance and result in.\"Having come so close to a first Arsenal hat-trick, Russo could have been forgiven for feeling frustrated at full-time.Two video assistant referee (VAR) interventions meant she had two goals chalked off for offside, either side of a wasted opportunity when one-on-one with visiting goalkeeper Misa Rodriguez.But the England forward celebrated at the final whistle and said the thought of being in the last four had \"not sunk in yet\".\"It was just amazing - the result, the fans, playing at the Emirates... it just doesn't get old,\" Russo told BBC Sport.\"When we went to Madrid we were disappointed, but we knew we had the belief and we knew what we needed to do. There was disappointment and it turned into fire quite quickly.\"Her contribution, alongside that of team-mate Kelly, played a key role in Arsenal's courageous comeback and Houghton said it showed Russo's \"maturity\".She is now the joint-top scorer in the Champions League with six goals and has 17 in all competitions for her best goalscoring season to date.\"She got a lot of criticism at the beginning of the season and was probably doing too much work for the team - not being selfish enough as a striker,\" added Houghton.\"She showed a real maturity about her display [against Real Madrid]. Almost everything she touched went in the back of the net. \"She's got the goals that have sent Arsenal into a semi-final of the Champions League.\"",
