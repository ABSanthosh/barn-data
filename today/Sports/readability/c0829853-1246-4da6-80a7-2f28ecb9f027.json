  "description": "The third round of the John Deere Classic unfolded on Saturday, setting the stage for what could be a dramatic finish in Sunday’s final round, with several players still firmly in contention. Brian Campbell, Emiliano Grillo, David Lipsky, and Max Homa are all tied for second at 14-under, just one shot back. Four players pulled out before the event even began, and since then, Andrew Putnam, Nicholas Lindheim, and Stephan Jaeger have all withdrawn mid-tournament.",

  "text": "The third round of the John Deere Classic unfolded on Saturday, setting the stage for what could be a dramatic finish in Sunday’s final round, with several players still firmly in contention.Last year’s tournament winner, Davis Thompson, surged to the top of the leaderboard at 15-under par after posting a 4-under round. Brian Campbell, Emiliano Grillo, David Lipsky, and Max Homa are all tied for second at 14-under, just one shot back.A recurring theme throughout the tournament, however, has been a wave of unexpected withdrawals. Four players pulled out before the event even began, and since then, Andrew Putnam, Nicholas Lindheim, and Stephan Jaeger have all withdrawn mid-tournament.Now, another surprise exit has emerged: 20-year-old rising star Aldrich Potgieter — who captured his first PGA Tour victory last week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic — has withdrawn following his third round.Potgieter entered Saturday in contention, but after a disappointing 5-over round dropped him to 4-under for the tournament, he made the decision to withdraw — despite still being in the running for a sizable payday.The 20-year-old rising star from South Africa has quickly made a name for himself on the PGA Tour. In just 20 career appearances, he’s already recorded two top-five finishes, three top-10s, and one runner-up performance — in addition to capturing his first career win just last week.Aldrich Potgieter reacts to making his putt on the 15th green in a playoff during the final round of the Rocket Mortgage Classic golf tournament.© Aaron Doster-Imagn ImagesFans weren’t particularly pleased with the withdrawal, pointing to his poor third-round performance as the likely reason behind the sudden decision to step away.\"76 at tpc deere run will do that to you,\" a fan said. Another fan posted, \"NOOO.\"Someone else said, \"Maybe mention that on your leaderboard then.
