  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Thomas Tuchel praised goalscoring debutant Myles Lewis-Skelly's performanceEngland started the Thomas Tuchel era with a 2-0 victory over Albania in World Cup qualifying.Teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly scored on his senior international debut before captain Harry Kane netted his 70th England goal to seal the win.BBC Sport takes a look at some of the talking points from the game.What changed and what didn't?Image source, OptaImage caption, This average positions graphic shows how high England played against a defensive opponent (England are black and Albania are purple)Before the game Tuchel created plenty of headlines when he said England looked like they had played with fear at Euro 2024 under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.He also suggested he wanted them to play Premier League-style physical football.Known for his tactical flexibility, nobody was quite certain what formation Tuchel would opt for - but he sent England out in a 4-2-3-1.While Tuchel's teams are normally known for their intensity and pressing, it was hard for England to show either against a team who set up as defensively as Albania, especially in the first half.And the German is also still in the early stages of his reign - having only met his players four days ago for the first time since officially taking over in January.\"Thomas Tuchel's had the squad for three days - you can't expect to see a different England team,\" said former Three Lions midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"We won the football match. Once we got ahead there was no urgency. \"We want to be entertained. There is a certain element of control which is good in tournament football.\"At the minute we're not in a tournament, we want to be entertained.\"England had 74% of the ball and 12 shots to Albania's three - with the hosts recording all six efforts on target in the game.In the opening 45 minutes they completed 437 passes, the most on Opta's records of any England first half.The visitors did try to play more after the break, but England's backline were only tested a few times by substitute Armando Broja. The result itself was routine - new England manager or not. The Three Lions are unbeaten in 38 home qualifiers for World Cups or Euros since November 2007, with 34 wins. \"It was a difficult game from a spectating perspective,\" said former England defender Matt Upson on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"Once we got into the rhythm, it was very much an England game at Wembley against inferior opposition where they struggled to break them down.\"We are all wanting to see how Thomas Tuchel's plan is going to happen.\"There are so many questions, but ultimately they have to manage the game itself and England did that well.\"Upson added that Tuchel probably learned to \"understand what it feels like and looks like tactically\" to play against a team in a low block like Albania's.Lewis-Skelly continues rapid riseJust a few months ago, Arsenal left-back Lewis-Skelly, 18, would barely have been on England's radar. He had not played a senior professional game until after the September international break.But he has broken into Arsenal's first team, scored against Manchester City and been sent off twice (although one was overturned) in 26 games - and now firmly established himself as a Gunners regular.\"It doesn't get much better,\" said former Arsenal centre-back Upson.\"The opportunity has fallen to him, the timing has been great. The amount of injuries Arsenal had got him in the team.\"Those doors have opened, but he has had to grab those opportunities. He looks to be a top player.\"Tuchel gave him a chance for England and he took it with both hands.In a prime example of the modern full-back role, Lewis-Skelly was front-footed, cutting into central midfield and popping up in the box.And he got the opening goal when he appeared in the Albania area to score through Thomas Strakosha's legs from Jude Bellingham's fantastic through ball.That made him the third-youngest England goalscorer ever - and youngest to net on his debut.Image source, OptaImage caption, Myles Lewis-Skelly had more touches in Albania's half than his own\"In the second half he played as a number eight or a number 10,\" said Tuchel. \"His very best position is where he plays for Arsenal in the double six. \"We tried to play a bit more conventional today as it's easier to learn because we have many players from many different clubs, but he understands very quickly.\"Lewis-Skelly left the pitch to an ovation in the final minute.England tried three different left-backs in their final three Nations League games - Lewis Hall, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Rico Lewis - but Lewis-Skelly will hope to make the position his own.Upson said: \"He was absolutely superb. To manage and handle that occasion in the manner he did with the very limited senior football he has had... really speaks volumes about how good a player he is and how far he can go. It was a brilliant evening for him.\"When you look at the competition for that position, Lewis Hall is probably the closest. You can see a little battle between the two of them for the left-back slot. That was a big moment for Lewis-Skelly tonight to try to cement himself in Thomas Tuchel's mind for that role.\"Ex-Everton player Osman added: \"He was dead relaxed, but he wasn't tested defensively.\"To secure the position he will have to show he can stand up defensively.\"Burn at centre of things to end dream weekImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Dan Burn went close to his second Wembley headed goal in a weekCentre-back Burn is at the other end of the spectrum when it comes to England debuts.This was the 32-year-old's first appearance for England at any age level. In fact he was the oldest Three Lions debutant since Kevin Davies in 2010.It came in what is undoubtedly the best week of the 6ft 7in defender's career.On Sunday, also at Wembley, he headed his boyhood club Newcastle ahead against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final as they won 2-1 to lift a first trophy in 56 years.The following day he joined up with England.He was given an immediate debut by Tuchel - and did well.Burn became the first England debutant to make 100 or more passes on Opta's record - and ended up completing 135 from 137.He made more clearances (seven), won more tackles (two) and won more aerial duels (four) than any other Three Lions player.Plus he managed to hit both crossbars, turning a clearance against his own woodwork before later heading Declan Rice's corner on to the bar.Upson said: \"He was excellent in the first half, looked very good but didn't have much to deal with defensively. He showed his threat from set-pieces.\"However, there were a few moments where he was caught out, especially when Broja came on.Marc Guehi, who was one of England's best players at Euro 2024, watched on from the bench with Ezri Konsa starting alongside Burn.\"There were a couple of moments in the second half where Burn got hurt in behind, got a bit tight and spun,\" said Upson. \"His partnership with Konsa was excellent.\"Konsa's performance was very assured and showed he's really developed in the last six months. Playing in the Champions League with Aston Villa has brought him on to the next level. \"Burn has moments of impact but I thought Konsa is probably best placed to keep his spot.\"But who didn't catch the eye?England wingers Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford both failed to set the game alight.Manchester United forward Rashford, on loan at Villa, was given his first England chance in a year after rediscovering his form under Unai Emery.He showed a few good touches, especially early on, but failed to create much.Manchester City's Foden had a similar experience on the right-hand side. They were both replaced, along with Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones, in the 74th minute.\"Both of our wingers that started were not as impactful as they can be or as they are in club football,\" said Tuchel.\"At the moment I'm not so sure why we struggled to bring the ball quicker to them.\"They trained very well, they were decisive in training which is why they deserved it. They were very good in the last weeks in their clubs. \"We will keep encouraging them and give them a structure so they can show their potential.\"Upson said: \"Foden wants to come inside. He's not the type of out-and-out winger which Tuchel wants to play.\"He wants a fast-paced aggressive style - to go at teams. Foden is more of a footballer who likes to come to feet and open things up that way. \"Rashford showed willingness and he has that speed but didn't quite find the end product tonight. \"He was looking not to lose the ball instead of taking a risk. It's an area that will be tinkered with in games to come.\"Some things stay the same - Kane scoresImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Kane is now 17 goals clear of Wayne Rooney's previous England goalscoring recordCaptain Kane is England's all-time leading scorer by some way - and he netted his 70th international goal on Friday.It came after a fine bit of control to take down Rice's cross before he passed the ball into the bottom corner.Kane is the first England player to score on his first appearance under three different managers - Roy Hodgson, Gareth Southgate and Tuchel.\"Typical Kane,\" said Upson. \"He didn't get much action for quite long periods but a couple of his passes were superb. He drops deeps and clips those balls over the top. \"His finish was really high level. The first touch and movement and to find that bottom corner was excellent. Very much a Kane-type performance. \"He would probably want to be involved in the game a bit more in the build-up. But Albania sat in so didn't allow him a lot of opportunities to get the ball.\"The 31-year-old continued his fine association with Tuchel too, having bagged 44 goals in 45 games under the German at Bayern Munich.Mauricio Pochettino is now the only manager Kane has scored more goals under.",
