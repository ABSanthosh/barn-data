He was the Ravens beat writer for the Baltimore Sun from 2000-2011.OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- The Baltimore Ravens reached a contract agreement with left tackle Ronnie Stanley on Saturday, securing their top free agent and quarterback Lamar Jackson's blind side for the near future.Stanley's three-year deal is worth $60 million, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. His average of $20 million per year is tied for eighth among left tackles.The deal was reached two days before the start of the negotiation period in free agency. Stanley, a two-time Pro Bowl player, was expected to draw strong interest in the open market.The Ravens have now brought back four offensive line starters from last season's No. 1-ranked offense. Left guard Patrick Mekari is an unrestricted free agent.Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta and coach John Harbaugh expressed optimism about re-signing Stanley at the NFL scouting combine last month.Last season, Stanley talked about how much he valued playing in Baltimore and blocking for Jackson and running back Derrick Henry.Stanley, 30, has been Baltimore's starting left tackle since 2016.He is coming off his best season since a career-altering left ankle injury in 2020. When protecting Jackson's blind side last season, Stanley ranked 12th in pass block win rate among tackles (92.5%), played in every game for the first time in his career and continued to be a respected leader.It was a solid bounce-back year for Stanley, who took a 50% pay cut last offseason to remain with the Ravens. Stanley said he took a $7.5 million salary reduction because he didn't want to leave Baltimore after a down season in 2023.Durability has been a major issue for Stanley. Since signing a five-year, $98.75 million deal midway through the 2020 season, he has missed 36 games over the past five seasons because of ankle, shoulder and knee injuries.Stanley, the No. 6 overall pick in 2016, produced his best season in 2019 when he became the Ravens' first All-Pro left tackle since Hall of Famer Jonathan Ogden. In 104 starts, Stanley has allowed 28 sacks, including five last season.",
