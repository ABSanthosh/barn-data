  "text": "It's time for dessert (and not just the pumpkin pie and cheesecake) as the Miami Dolphins are in Green Bay to take on the Packers in this year's NFL Thanksgiving Night game. For as cold as it'll feel in Green Bay on Thursday, the 8-3 Packers head into the holiday as one of the league's hottest teams, having won six of their past seven games. The only loss in that span was to the Lions, who at 11-1 have staked their claim as the league's best team. Not bad for the Packers, who've dealt with injuries to starting quarterback Jordan Love in his second year at the helm after Aaron Rodgers moved to New York.The Dolphins, meanwhile, have also been on a run — one that has coincided with the return of QB Tua Tagovailoa. Miami is 4-3 in games he's started this season and has won three straight, with the offense looking like it did last season as he's settled in. Tagovailoa has thrown for 605 yards and seven touchdowns with no interceptions over the Dolphins' past two games, and he'll need to be sharp again if the 5-6 Dolphins want to stay connected in the the AFC wild-card picture.As for the weather, temperatures will be in the upper 20s at kickoff and throughout the night. With winds around 15 miles per hour and gusts nearing 25 mph, the feels-like temps will be in the mid-teens. The last time this Dolphins group played in frosty conditions they posted a dud in a 26-7 playoff loss in Kansas City this past January in sub-zero temperatures.How to watch Dolphins vs. Packers on Thanksgiving nightTime: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: Lambeau Field | Green Bay, Wis.TV channel: NBCStreaming: Peacock, FuboLive3 updatesThu, November 28, 2024 at 7:08 PM CSTThu, November 28, 2024 at 6:51 PM CSTPackers inactives: No Jaire Alexander or Romeo DoubsPackers inactives include cornerback Jaire Alexander (knee) and wide receiver Romeo Doubs (concussion).CB Jaire Alexander LB Edgerrin Cooper OL Jacob Monk WR Romeo DoubsThu, November 28, 2024 at 6:48 PM CSTDolphins inactives are in",
