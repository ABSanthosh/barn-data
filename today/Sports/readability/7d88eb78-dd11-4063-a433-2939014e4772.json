  "text": "England attacking midfielder Fran Kirby has announced her retirement from international football with immediate effect before the European Championships.In an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, Kirby says she is leaving the international scene with her \"head held high\".The Brighton player, who scored 19 goals in 77 caps for the Lionesses, has been a key figure for England for more than a decade.Kirby was named in Sarina Wiegman's squad for the Uefa Nations League matches against Portugal and Spain but was informed she would not be selected for the Euros starting on 2 July.In her first interview after announcing her retirement, Kirby said: \"It is something I have been thinking about for over a year. I knew this was going to be my last major tournament.\"The plan was to retire after the Euros but after speaking to Sarina I'm not going to make the squad.\"It was like a dagger to my heart but also a weight off my shoulders all at the same time. It was emotional for both of us but we both respected what each person was saying.\"Speaking after England's 2-1 defeat by Spain, Wiegman said she \"loved\" working with Kirby, calling her \"an amazing player and an incredible person too\".\"She did everything to make the squad,\" added Wiegman. \"She has always been ready to play and to perform, helping others and doing whatever I asked her to do.\"I said to her she most likely would not make the squad, even though things could change quickly.\"The news comes just days after goalkeeper Mary Earps also retired from international football before England attempt to defend their Euros title.Kirby, 31, is understood to have informed her England team-mates of the decision after Tuesday's defeat by Spain in Barcelona.Her last England appearance was as a second-half substitute in the 6-0 win over Portugal. She was not named in the matchday squad against Spain.The former Chelsea player, who is a two-time PFA Women's Footballer of the Year winner, is one of the most recognisable female players in the country.Kirby won seven Women's Super League (WSL) titles and five Women's FA Cup trophies at Chelsea, but she is best remembered for playing a key role in England's historic Euro 2022 triumph.She started all six of England's games in the tournament, scoring twice, as Wiegman's side lifted the trophy with victory over Germany at Wembley.\"When I woke up in the morning after telling Sarina, I didn't feel any regret,\" added Kirby. \"That's when I knew I'd made the right decision.\"I've been on this team for a long time, it's not going to be a shock that it was coming to an end.\"You get to a certain age and there are some really good youngsters that are coming through.\"Kirby, who started her career at Reading, scored seven goals in 17 WSL appearances this season as Brighton finished fifth.\"I've put everything into this and feel like I have had a good domestic year,\" she said.\"I've fought hard to be in the Euros squad but unfortunately that's not enough.\"Kirby has battled with injury issues and illness throughout her career, struggling with fatigue in the build-up to Euro 2022 and missing the 2023 World Cup with a knee injury that required surgery.\"Everyone knows the injuries that I've had and I've been protecting my body,\" she said.\"This is part of that. But I feel like I've got so much to give in football. I'm already looking forward to the domestic season.\"After being in the England team since I was 21, it's time to close that chapter of my life. I didn't ever want this day to come, but I cannot tell you how proud I am it happened.It's been the biggest honour to represent my country, one that I had only dreamt about as a young girl.I've played with some incredible players, worked with some incredible managers, played in some amazing tournaments and have irreplaceable memories.My journey has been full of ups and downs, setbacks and achievements. Enough has been said and written about those, but regardless of whatever was thrown at me, I want you all to know that every time I put on that England badge I gave it 100%.Every single call-up, I accepted my role and did whatever was needed for the team. I wanted England to win. I've always been there to help England win.My mum had a dream of me representing my country and I'm so proud I was able to do that and play in front of you all.I will never, ever forget the noise when my name is read out at a stadium. I was first selected when I was playing in WSL 2, I played a part in the game-changing World Cup, winning bronze in 2015, creating memories of a lifetime.Starting in every game and winning the Euros in 2022 was a dream come true, to be part of change in women's football was one of the best experiences I could ever have imagined.Thank you to all of you for embracing me as a young girl from Reading who had a dream. I hope you all know that wearing that badge was the greatest honour.To every young girl that suffers setbacks, just remember you can. You can. Forever a Lioness, Fran.",
