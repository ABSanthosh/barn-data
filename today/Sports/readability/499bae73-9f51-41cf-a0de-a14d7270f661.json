  "text": "Bukayo Saka again showed his worth as one of the world's best attackers as he inspired Arsenal to a 3-0 Champions League victory against Monaco.The England forward produced a poacher's finish either side of half-time, before setting up a third goal for Kai Havertz as Mikel Arteta's men all-but mathematically clinched their place in the knockout stages.While Arsenal may have dropped off the pace in the Premier League title race with a six-point gap to leaders Liverpool, Saka is on course to enjoy one of the best seasons of his career, having scored nine goals and provided 12 assists in 21 games in all competitions.Last season he scored 20 times and assisted 14 in 47 games in all competitions.The question is, how good can Saka become?Saka's development since making his European debut - in the Europa League - as a 17-year-old in 2018 has been extraordinary.Now 23, he has played in seven Champions League games at the Emirates Stadium, scoring seven times and providing four assists.Since the start of last season, only Harry Kane (18), Vinicius Jr (16) and Antoine Griezmann (13) have been involved in more Champions League goals than Saka (8 goals and six assists).In that same period he has both scored and assisted in a single Champions League game on five occasions, more than any other player.This season, Mohamed Salah is the only Premier League player with more goal involvements (28) than Saka (21) in all competitions.In the Premier League, the Gunners forward has 96 goal involvements (52 goals and 44 assists). As long as he reaches 100 before the end of April, he will become the fourth youngest player ever to reach the milestone, behind Michael Owen (22y 57d), Wayne Rooney (22y 122d) and Robbie Fowler (22y 166d).Speaking to TNT Sports after Wednesday's victory, Arsenal boss Arteta praised the role Saka plays for his team.\"He looks really mature,\" he said. \"What he has already done in the game at his age is incredible. Very humble, a great guy to have around and an incredible talent.\"He's a special person. In his role, his leadership is increasing. With the young kids he is amazing, with the seniors he is amazing. He is loved by everybody and he makes the difference on the pitch.\"Saka's connection with Arsenal's young players was clear when he ran straight to Myles Lewis-Skelly to thank the 18-year-old full-back for his contribution to the opening goal against Monaco.Not even Arsenal legend Thierry Henry, who coached Saka while working at the club's academy, expected him to become this good.\"He's my favourite player, he's been there for so long and he's so nice. I never thought he would reach the levels we are seeing,\" Henry said on BBC Football Focus.\"He's a starter for Arsenal, he's a starter for England. I remember when he started he was playing wing-back and the evolution of his game is outstanding because he used to be so lively, to now scoring goals and assists.\"The scary thing for opposition fans is Saka looks like he could get even better.\"Every decision he makes is the right decision,\" Karen Carney said on TNT Sports.\"For someone that young to be that good - it's scary how good he will be in three or four years.\"When asked how he would attempt to stop Saka, former Manchester City and QPR defender Nedum Onuoha joked on Match of the Day: \"I would not even bother.\"His impact is tremendous, he's developing and he's always a big threat.\"Watch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",
