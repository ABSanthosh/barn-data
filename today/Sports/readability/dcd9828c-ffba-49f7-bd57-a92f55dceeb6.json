  "text": "Some believe that Murray is a top10 quarterback in the NFL.Opinions about Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray vary widely. Many think he is too short and that, while talented, he simply hasn't done enough and don't believe he can do enough to be a truly successful quarterback. Head coach Jonathan Gannon is a huge fan of his starting quarterback.In rankings of the top 10 quarterbacks in the league from ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, based on votes by coaches, scouts and executives, Murray is not in the top 10 of his position, but there are those who do believe he is.Of course, Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes is at the top, followed by the common three of Josh Allen , Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson.Murray did not make the top 10 and did not appear as one of the two who received honorable mention, but he was the first quarterback listed as one who also received votes in the top 10, joining Brock Purdy, Dak Prescott, Aaron Rodgers, Bo Nix and Tua Tagovailoa.2025 is a big season for Murray. We have seen his MVP ceiling from his play in 2020 and 2021. Since then, his play has been inconsistent, sometimes playing at an elite level and other times very league average. The roster appears set for him to lead the Cardinals to the postseason. Can he turn back the clock to 2021 and find himself in the top 10 in 2026 when Fowler does this series again?It is certainly possible. There is also the possibility that the Cardinals move on from him next year.Get more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.
