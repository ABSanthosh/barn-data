  "text": "When Oklahoma softball coach Patty Gasso told reporters Sophia Bordi had left the team for \"personal reasons\" last week, Sooners fans wondered what exactly happened.Bordi, a freshman who reclassified to join the Sooners a year early and should have still been a senior in high school, released a statement on social media on Tuesday clarifying her situation.\"With all of the articles and rumors coming out, I thought I would address this situation myself,” she wrote. “I appreciate Coach Gasso for keeping my information private. I made the decision myself to step away from school and softball for the rest of the season because I needed to take time to work on my personal/mental health.Bordi was originally the No. 5-ranked pitcher in her recruiting class before joining the Sooners a year early. She redshirted and spent a bulk of the winter and spring learning the college game. The New Jersey native said she felt compelled to remark about her status based on internet rumor.\"This was something that I felt needed to be dealt with back home with my family’s support, and also so I wasn’t a distraction to the team in the middle of the season. I appreciate everyone’s concerns but wish that information wasn’t being falsely spread the way it was.\"Oklahoma begins its hopeful run for a fifth straight national championship on Friday. The Sooners, the No. 2 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, host the Norman Regional against Boston from Love Field at 5 p.m.Bordi will be watching.“With that being said, the season is still going and my girls are still working,\" Bordi wrote. \"I’m always watching and cheering them on, no matter what.
