    "description": "Paul Skenes allowed three hits over six efficient innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Detroit Tigers 3-0 on Monday night. Skenes (5-8), who last week became the first pitcher to start the All-Star game in each of the first two years of his career, struck out six, walked one and a hit batter to pick up his first victory since late May. The 23-year-old lowered his ERA to a major league-best 1.91 as Pittsburgh responded from a weekend sweep at home by the lowly Chicago White Sox by keeping the team that entered Monday with the best record in the majors in check.",
