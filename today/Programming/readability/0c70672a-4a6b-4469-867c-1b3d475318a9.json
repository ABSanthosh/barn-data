Offering both depth and simplicity, GA4 Dataform gives you the power to go beyond default settings, build your own data models, and find new ways to engage with customers.How do I integrate GA4 Dataform with BigQuery?GA4 Dataform is a Google Cloud Dataform project that provides SQL data models for transforming raw GA4 BigQuery exports. The code is essentially a starter pack to help you build models on top of the GA4 raw data exports for data-driven marketing insights. The features available now include:1: Building a unique user_key and ga_session_key.2: Providing as output a digestible session table, user_transaction_daily table, event table, and more.3: Gclid widening by mapping the GA4 GCLID to the Google Ads Data Transfer click-view GCLID (Optional setting)4: Event level last-click attribution.Ready to get started? Deployment is simple—explore GA4 Dataform on GitHub to learn how.FeedXFeedX, the ultimate A/B testing platform for shopping feeds.What if you could eliminate the guesswork and manual testing from your Google Ads shopping campaigns? FeedX is an open-source experimentation framework helping advertisers run A/B testing for shopping feed modifications—so they can see the result of specific tweaks against observed performance changes.Online advertisers who want to scale optimizations across their inventories need to know their strategy will have a positive impact on performance. But without a clear feedback signal, it's hard to know whether creative changes are making the results better or worse.FeedX solves this problem by allowing advertisers to test any changes using a reliable Python A/B testing framework. FeedX is a Python package, containing all of its logic and mechanics, as well as a set of Colab notebooks which show you how to use the package to design and analyze experiments.How FeedX worksFeedX uses industry best practices to ensure the experiment is as robust and sensitive as possible. With a crossover design, it adjusts for pre-experiment performance with CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data), and trims outlier items if necessary. Here’s an overview of the flow:1: The advertiser starts with an item they would like to test, for example, optimizing a title or description. To ensure reliable results, the test should include at least 1000 items, and the FeedX design notebook will alert you if the sample size is too low.2: The feed items are randomly split into two groups, a control group and a treatment group.3: The advertiser creates a supplemental feed, containing only the optimizations for treatment items, and starts the experiment by uploading this supplemental feed to the Merchant Center.4: Optionally, crossover experiments can be run where the advertiser swaps these groups so the treatment group becomes the control group.5: At the end of the experiment, the performance of all items is analyzed and compared between the control and treatment groups. The result is a reliable metrics report, backed by a confidence interval and statistical significance.Forget the guesswork. Ready to revolutionize shopping ads with data? Take a deep dive into how FeedX works on GitHub.This is the second post of our two-part series on bridging the gap between marketing and development.
