Some vague sense that people would write too much if given the space. Or link too much. Or edit too much. Or be too emphatic. It's worse than Disneyfied -- at least at Disneyland you get actors, and color and rides, and bland food with tons of sugar and fat. But there is some fun and nutrition. In the social web, it's just memes and slogans. Not even much room for a metaphor. There's so much more to say about being human.# In the last days of Trump's first term, I had a nice little web app that told you how much time remained in his term. It was a one-line change to make it work again, which, sigh, is necessary now. # There's a great scene in No Country For Old Men, where a character is facing imminent death, but he's arguing with the character who will kill him, who asks if all your great ideas led to this (his death) how good were the ideas (paraphrasing).# Along those lines.. If Twitter was such a great idea but it led to the death of democracy (for now at least) maybe it wasn't such a great idea. Maybe when we try to reboot we should try something realllly different.# As they say -- Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.# PS: This started as a thread on Bluesky.# Sad news: Longtime friend Pam McQuesten passed away on January 1 after a brief illness. # I knew Pam in Silicon Valley, as we were starting up Living Videotext in 1983. Our office was on Elwell Court in Palo Alto, just off 101, near the golf course and airport. Pam was managing editor of BYTE, the class act of tech pubs in the early personal computer business, then editor of Popular Computing, the magazine for the people (ie users of computers). When she was at BYTE, her office was on the same floor as ours. # The tech industry was rough even then, all the young egos, people who were sure they could do everything, not much collaboration, lots of betrayal. She was one of the few people I could talk with on a personal level, with trust and intelligence. We talked about the future of the technology we were creating, and what we wanted from all this. She was a mentor, like a big sister, best friend, someone I trusted and loved. A very rare friendship. # BTW, her name in the 80s, before her marriage to Paul McQuesten, was Pam Clark.# Our paths crossed again a few years ago on Facebook. I invited her to join a private group I have with friends I love and trust, to share the life I had at my \"pond house\" in the Catskills. # I wanted to post a brief remembrance here in case any of Pam's friends are tuned in, so they can be part of the celebration of her life. # Pam McQuesten in 2010 via Flickr. # Random observations posted on Bluesky in the early morning hours.# 5:09AM: \"Biden had one job to do, and he didn’t do it.\"# 5:17AM: \"The NYT had one job to do, and they didn’t do it.\"# 5:21AM: \"The NYT is the saddest excuse for the leading news org of the most significant democracy in human history.
