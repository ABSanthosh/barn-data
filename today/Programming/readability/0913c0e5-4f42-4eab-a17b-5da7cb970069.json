  "description": "In today's episode, we delve into the testing tango and the art of Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA), a practice that is essential when writing tests in order to structure them in a way that is coherent to other developers who may come across them. We discuss how to go about Arranging variables, how to use those variables (or Act), and then Asserting those specific behaviors. You’ll learn about the importance of having only one assertion per test and the benefits of leaving blank spaces or new lines for future reference.",
