Lekko is a startup democratizing the practice of dynamic configuration. Their motivating idea is to empower engineers to focus on software releases, and business teams and other stakeholders to shape deployment. Konrad Niemiec is the Founder and CEO at Lekko. He previously worked at Uber where an internal tool called Flipr enabled dynamic configuration management, and which today serves as a key design inspiration for Lekko. Konrad joins the show with Sean Falconer to talk about his company and the technology they’re developing. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by 10K Media. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from information visualization to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is Head of Marketing and Developer Relations at Skyflow and host of the podcast Partially Redacted, a podcast about privacy and security engineering.
