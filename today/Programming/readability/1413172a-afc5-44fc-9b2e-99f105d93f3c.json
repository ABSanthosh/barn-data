  "text": "Our sustainability strategy is anchored by three components that inform the ways we help to drive change across the many communities in which we operate. Goals and commitments Since 2020, we have maintained net zero GHG emissions in our global operations. We have publicly committed to achieving net zero emissions across our value chain and becoming water positive in 2030.In support of these goals and our vision for a transition to a zero-carbon economy and a healthier planet for all, we have identified additional objectives and commitments. Restore 200% of the water we consume in high water stress regions and 100% of the water we consume in medium water stress regions. Continue to match 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy. Reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% in 2031 from a 2021 baseline. Enable at least two-thirds of our suppliers to set science-aligned emissions reduction targets by 2026. Not exceed our 2021 baseline Scope 3 emissions by the end of 2031. Positively impact the communities and environment where we operate, and expect supply chain partners to uphold high human rights and environmental standards. Highlights Striving for net zero value chain emissions The Net Zero Supplier Engagement Program enables us to set expectations with key suppliers for committing to emissions reduction targets and to support them in meeting those targets. By the end of 2023, 28% of our suppliers, based on their contribution to Meta’s emissions, have set science-aligned emissions reduction targets Becoming water positive We are committed to becoming water positive in 2030. To achieve this goal, Meta will restore 200% of the water we consume in high water stress areas, and 100% of the water we consume in medium water stress areas. In 2023, 18 operational water restoration projects returned more than 1.5 billion gallons of water to high and medium water stress regions. Matching 100% of our electricity use with renewable energy Our portfolio of more than 11,700 megawatts (MW) of contracted renewable energy makes Meta one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally, and the corporate buyer with the largest operating renewable energy portfolio in the U.S. for the second year running with more than 6,700 MW online. Operating a responsible supply chain Meta is part of a complex value chain that impacts lives and communities around the globe. In 2023, we expanded the reach of our process chemicals program to additional hardware suppliers to inform their capacity-building needs, corrective actions and improvement plans to further protect worker safety. Setting the standard for data center sustainability Data centers are part of the global infrastructure that brings our technologies and services to life. Meta designs and operates some of the most sustainable data centers in the industry, but they still account for the highest percentage of our energy and water use.  We approach data center sustainability from the ground up—from design and construction to operations by prioritizing energy efficiency, renewable energy, water stewardship and responsibly managing the end of life of our equipment. We are in the business of building better realities—and not just virtual ones Resources",
