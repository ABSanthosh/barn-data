  "text": "The place for learning and teaching computer science your way JetBrains Academy LiveStreamOnline Coding Workshop for the C++ Basics Course Join us on Tuesday, October 22, 2024, at 3:00 pm UTC (check other timezones) for our free online workshop for the C++ Basics course. If you’ve wanted to learn C++ or have any questions about this language, you’ve come to the right place! C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language used to build everything from operating systems to web browsers and video games.  In this beginner-friendly online workshop, led by the course authors, we’ll offer a sneak peek into the C++ Basics course, designed for beginners eager to learn C and C++. In this course, learners explore fundamental concepts of these languages and immediately apply them by developing a simple 2D arcade game. You can find more details about the course here. During the livestream, we’ll work through several problems from the course, including a task focused on implementing game logic and a few exercises highlighting the differences between C and C++ memory management styles. How to get started To participate in the workshop, we recommend starting the course in your IDE. If you don’t have IDE installed, don’t worry. Instructions on how to do this and how to start a course can be found on the course page. The course is free for everyone, and as an academic student, you can get a free license for any JetBrains IDE. Q\u0026A session At the end, we’ll hold a Q\u0026A session where you can ask any questions you might have about the course and learning C++. You can leave your questions on our Discord server now, and we’ll cover them during the livestream. Meet the hosts of the workshop Evgeniy Moiseenko, Research engineer at JetBrains and a co-author of the C++ Basics course Evgeniy is a research engineer at JetBrains and a co-author of the C++ Basics course. His interests include programming language theory and its applications in program verification.
