Marketplace News NewsletterBusy Plugin Developers Newsletter – Q2 2025 ⭐️ Community highlights Speak at JetBrains Plugin Developer Conf 2025 – Submit a Talk Plugin Developer Conf returns on November 5, 2025, and we’re looking for speakers to join the lineup! This free, one-day online event brings together the JetBrains plugin developer community to share insights on building and managing plugins. Last year’s online conference welcomed over 2,500 online attendees and featured sessions from eleven expert speakers. If you have lessons, tips, or stories about plugin development, maintenance, or overcoming challenges, submit your talk proposal by July 15, 2025.

This includes contact information, identification documents, and banking details. Vendors who haven’t completed this process may face suspension.Read the full blog post to ensure you’re meeting the latest requirements. JetBrains Marketplace Reflects PyCharm Changes With the release of PyCharm 2025.1, PyCharm is now a single, unified product offering core features for free and a Pro subscription for advanced tools. In response to this change, JetBrains Marketplace has updated the way PyCharm category is displayed: the “PyCharm Community” has been removed from product filters and dropdowns, and “PyCharm Professional” has been renamed to “PyCharm.” Plugin compatibility labels have also been revised to clearly distinguish between plugins compatible with the full PyCharm IDE and those specific to the Community edition. ⭐️ Plugin development tooling updates IntelliJ Plugin Verifier 1.388 The IntelliJ Plugin Verifier checks binary compatibility between IntelliJ-based IDE builds and plugins. Version 1.388 introduces several structural improvements and new features, including better handling of content module dependencies, support for Fleet products that follow IntelliJ versioning, and enhanced TeamCity recipe functionality. It also includes updates to ByteBuddy and Gradle, and fixes an issue with missing plugin-declared dependencies. Check out the changelog for full details. IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.6.0 The IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is a plugin for the Gradle build system to help configure your environment for building, testing, verifying, and publishing plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs.  Version 2.6.0 brings new helper methods to simplify resolving plugin dependencies from JetBrains Marketplace, adds support for CSS and XML test frameworks, and improves task output and warnings for Plugin Verifier runs. It also deprecates Aqua (QA) as a target platform and includes a range of internal fixes and dependency resolution improvements. You can find the full changelog here. ⭐️ Useful resources Livestream Recording: Plugin Verifier and API Compatibility Maintenance In a recent session, IntelliJ Platform Developer Advocate Róbert Novotný walked through the Plugin Verifier, one of the most important tools for maintaining plugin compatibility across JetBrains IDEs. The session focused on spotting breaking API changes, avoiding internal APIs, and verifying plugin behavior across IDE versions. Watch the recording or check out the key takeaways in our blog post. Integration Tests Blog Series: GitHub Actions and Setting Up Continuous Integration Following the enthusiastic response to our Plugin Testing: Performance, UI, and Functional Testing session at JetBrains Plugin Developer Conf 2024, we launched a blog series that takes a deeper dive into plugin testing strategies. The fourth installment shows how to automate your integration tests using GitHub Actions, helping you catch issues early and run tests across different environments. New Project Wizard API This new article provides a comprehensive overview of the New Project Wizard API in the IntelliJ Platform, which powers project and module creation dialogs. It explains the architecture behind language and framework project generators, how to build and chain wizard steps, manage shared data, and create responsive UIs with property graphs. The guide also covers advanced features like branching logic, persistent defaults, and support for custom build systems — offering practical insights for anyone implementing project wizards.
