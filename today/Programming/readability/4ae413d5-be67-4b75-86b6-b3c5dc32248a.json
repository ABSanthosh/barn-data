  "link": "http://www.developertea.com",
  "description": "This episode provides a tactical question to elicit useful feedback by taking responsibility for seeking it out and framing the request in a way that encourages advice rather than judgment. Understand that your manager giving you feedback is your responsibility, which means you should actively seek it out rather than waiting. Discover how a simple question can shift the dynamic with your manager to get better feedback, focusing on advice for the future rather than dwelling on past behaviours. Learn the tactical question to ask your manager: \"What do you think will hold me back from growing?\" or a modified version like, \"What do you think will hold me back from getting X promotion?\". Explore why framing your feedback request as seeking advice is more effective because managers generally enjoy giving advice and it focuses on future improvement. Understand that the intent is not to analyze past behavior but to identify potential roadblocks to future success and growth.ðŸ“® Join the DiscordIf you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting https://developertea.com/discord today!.",
