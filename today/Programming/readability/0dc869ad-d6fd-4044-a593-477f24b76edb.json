One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to lift the hood even if I don't understand what I'm looking at. # I'm using the term \"RSS-based podcasts\" in place of \"podcasts\" to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other \"podcasts,\" are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their \"podcasts\" to RSS and everyone's happy. Like \"organic cheeseburgers.\" :-)# For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you.

I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress.
