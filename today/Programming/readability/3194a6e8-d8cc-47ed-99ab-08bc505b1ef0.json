I remember my father rolling around on the floor when the ball went through Buckner's legs. My father never rolled around on the floor, before or since. But I liked seeing him let go just that once. Another with my father. When the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan he said they were wearing wigs. He knew that because no man would actually have hair like that. I was 8 or 9 years old and remember telling him I didn't think he got that right. I remember exactly where I was when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. At the Newport Folk Festival and about 500 people were watching a tiny TV on top of a VW bus. Somehow everyone could see. It was outdoors and it was silent, everyone was in awe. One that's only peripherally about TV. I remember every time I went to see a game at Shea Stadium as a kid I was blown away by the color, because most of the Mets games I saw were on TV, in black and white. Here's one from adulthood. Watching young Barack Obama give his victory speech on election night in 2008 in my house in Berkeley with a group of friends, with tears running down all our faces.",
