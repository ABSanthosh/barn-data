Did you know: A-Frame was recently selected for our GitHub Accelerator program earlier this year. Home Assistant: Take control of your home‚Äîyour way Home Assistant is an open source platform for home automation that gives you complete control over your smart devices, with a strong emphasis on privacy and local management. Manage everything from lighting to climate control seamlessly‚Äîall from a single hub, without relying on the cloud. Setup and configure your own dashboards, cherry-picking from hundreds of community-built themes, cards, and other integrations. What @adamdiel‚Äòs dashboard looks like. Allegedly ‡≤†_‡≤† Wondering how to integrate your IoT devices or create custom automations? Bring your questions to @balloob, @missyquarry, and @frenck to find out! Did you know: Home Assistant started as a weekend project, just celebrated it‚Äôs 11th birthday,¬† and has evolved into a platform used by millions? ü§Ø Homebrew: The essential package manager for macOS and Linux Homebrew is an open source package manager that fills in the gaps on macOS (or Linux), making it easy to install software and tools that aren‚Äôt included by default. With simple commands, you can manage everything from essential packages to macOS apps, all neatly organized and easily customizable through straightforward scripts. Join leaders and maintainers @mikemcquaid and @p-linnane ¬†at the Homebrew booth and brew up the perfect development setup with some expert advice! Kubernetes: Your goto platform for container orchestration Kubernetes is an open source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, simplifying the complexity of managing clusters across multiple environments. Curious about managing multi-cluster environments or optimizing your Kubernetes deployments? @mrbobbytables (no relation!) will be there to answer your questions and more. And don‚Äôt forget to ask: ‚ÄúIs it Kuber- ‚Äònetes‚Äô ¬†or Kuber-‚Äòneat-ees‚Äô?‚Äù Let‚Äôs settle this once and for all!
