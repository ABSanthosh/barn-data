  "text": "Or, how scripting revolutionized my workflowPhoto by Stephen Dawson on UnsplashImagine a time when factories were full of life, with gears turning and machines working together. It was a big change, like what’s happening today with computers. In the world of creating and managing software, we’re moving from doing things by hand to letting computers do the work. I’ve seen this change happen, and I can tell you, writing little programs, or “scripts,” is what’s making this change possible.Just like factories changed how things were made, these little programs are changing the way we handle software. They’re like a magic trick that turns long, boring tasks into quick and easy ones. In this article, I’m going to show you how these little programs fit into the bigger picture, how they make things better and faster, and the headaches they can take away.We’re going to go on a trip together. I’ll show you how things used to be done, talk about the different kinds of little programs and tools we use now, and share some of the tricks I’ve learned. I’ll tell you stories about times when these little programs really made a difference, give you tips, and show you some examples. So, buckle up, and let’s jump into this world where making and managing software is not just a job, but something really special.",
