  "text": "I set up Google Analytics on my site in 2010, and since then use it to track page views to my site. I only care about page views, which I find useful to figure out which pages get the most traffic. It’s interesting data, and sometimes rather useful. But Google collects much more information than just page views, and it’s tracking is more intrusive than I would like. But I had other things I’d rather spend to spend my time on, so doing anything about it never made it high enough up my todo list. But last month I finally did something, having come across some information that did I thought did what I wanted. Essentially I want things set up so that I don’t need to bother with a cookie banner because I only track things that are trackable when someone says “deny all”. Based on some google documentation, I changed my google analytics fragment to: \u003cscript async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-6D51F4BDVF\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \u003cscript\u003e window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('consent', 'default', { 'ad_user_data': 'denied', 'ad_personalization': 'denied', 'ad_storage': 'denied', 'analytics_storage': 'denied', 'wait_for_update': 500, }); gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'G-6D51F4BDVF'); \u003c/script\u003e As I understand the documentation, this should turn off the most problematic tracking, but still send a page view event. I took a look at it the following day, and everything seemed to be ok, but now, a couple of weeks later, page views reported by Google Analytics have dropped drastically. Not to zero, but to near zero. I’ve spent a bit of time trying to figure out what’s happening. I used google tag assistant and it indicates the page view events are being sent correctly. But that doesn’t explain why I’m not seeing the page views in my Google data. I’m not sure what to do next. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, after all I’d rather work on writing and editing. I did consider other services to do the tracking, but it looks we’re talking about $100s a month - and it’s just not worth that much to me. There are open source setups I could try an configure on my server, but again that’s effort I don’t really want to go into. Maybe I just live without analytics data.",
