  "description": "See the canonical version of this blog post at the Microsoft Open Source Blog! Ten years ago, Microsoft released the source for MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0 to the Computer History Museum, and then later republished them for reference purposes. This code holds an important place in history and is a fascinating read of an operating system that was written entirely in 8086 assembly code nearly 45 years ago. Today, in partnership with IBM and in the spirit of open innovation, we're releasing the source code to MS-DOS 4.00 under the MIT license. There's a somewhat complex and fascinating history behind the 4.0 versions of DOS, as Microsoft partnered with IBM for portions of the code but also created a branch of DOS called Multitasking DOS that did not see a wide release. https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS A young English researcher named Connor \"Starfrost\" Hyde recently corresponded with former Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie about some of the software in his collection. Amongst the floppies, Ray found unreleased beta binaries of DOS 4.0 that he was sent while he was at Lotus. Starfrost reached out to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO) to explore releasing DOS 4 source, as he is working on documenting the relationship between DOS 4, MT-DOS, and what would eventually become OS/2. Some later versions of these Multitasking DOS binaries can be found around the internet, but these new Ozzie beta binaries appear to be much earlier, unreleased, and also include the ibmbio.com source.  Scott Hanselman, with the help of internet archivist and enthusiast Jeff Sponaugle, has imaged these original disks and carefully scanned the original printed documents from this \"Ozzie Drop\". Microsoft, along with our friends at IBM, think this is a fascinating piece of operating system history worth sharing.  Jeff Wilcox and OSPO went to the Microsoft Archives, and while they were unable to find the full source code for MT-DOS, they did find MS DOS 4.00, which we're releasing today, alongside these additional beta binaries, PDFs of the documentation, and disk images. We will continue to explore the archives and may update this release if more is discovered.  Thank you to Ray Ozzie, Starfrost, Jeff Sponaugle, Larry Osterman, our friends at the IBM OSPO, as well as the makers of such digital archeology software including, but not limited to Greaseweazle, Fluxengine, Aaru Data Preservation Suite, and the HxC Floppy Emulator. Above all, thank you to the original authors of this code, some of whom still work at Microsoft and IBM today! If you'd like to run this software yourself and explore, we have successfully run it directly on an original IBM PC XT, a newer Pentium, and within the open source PCem and 86box emulators.  © 2021 Scott Hanselman.

It was junk, sent by an unknown third party who is not using FeedBlitz to send their emails or manage their RSS feeds. FeedBlitz hasn’t been hacked; we just didn’t send you that email or generate that link. And if you got this link in an email, since we did not send you that email, we can’t unsubscribe you from it. If you’re here and want to stop spam like the email that brought you to this page, or hate hackers tricking you with phishing links at malware sites, we think that’s great and we sympathize. We want that too! But we’re sorry; we can’t help you. We didn’t send that email or make that link. Bottom line: If you’re here, the email you’re looking at isn’t a genuine FeedBlitz email, or the link isn’t a genuine FeedBlitz link. So: How did you get here? But there’s a FeedBlitz link in the email, in the feed, on that web site! Yes. Yes, there is. The spammers who are trying to trick you do not use FeedBlitz. But they are using a bit of FeedBlitz to camouflage their links. This makes you think that the email (or link) came from FeedBlitz, a reputable email service. But … just because there is a link to FeedBlitz in the email, or on that site, it doesn’t mean it’s ours. It isn’t. You got here because we really, really hate spammers and hackers. We don’t like them trying to trick people. And we really don’t like them trying to trick people by pretending to be us. Remember that bit of FeedBlitz they were trying to hide behind? We are now using that against them, and helping you by not letting you click through to whatever junk site is trying to fleece you, infect you, or do whatever no good it’s up to. Which explains why you are safely here, and not on some icky web site trying to harm you. So … What? FeedBlitz didn’t send you the email or generate the link, that got you here. FeedBlitz hasn’t been hacked, either. We can’t unsubscribe you, because we didn’t send the email to you, if that’s how you got here. Bad people have tried to trick you by abusing a feature we make available to genuine web site owners. And you’re here because we hate spammers and have stopped them. Next Steps? Delete the email. Update your anti-virus software. If you’re a FeedBlitz client or subscriber then you should not see this message from an email that actually was sent by us, or a feed managed by us.
