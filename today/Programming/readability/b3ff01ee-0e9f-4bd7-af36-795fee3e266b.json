  "description": "Compute optimization in a cloud environment is a common challenge because of the need to balance performance, cost, and resource availability. The growing use of GPUs for workloads, including AI, is also increasing the complexity and importance of optimization given the relatively high cost of GPU cloud computation.

Jerzy Grzywinski is a Senior Director of Software Engineering and leads FinOps at Capital One. Brent Segner is a distinguished engineer at Capital One and is focused on performance engineering and cloud cost optimization. Jerzy and Brent joined the show with Sean Falconer to talk about methods to measure compute efficiency, horizontal versus vertical scaling, how to think about adopting new instance types, the effect of different languages on compute efficiency, and much more.
