  "description": "This episode discusses how to reframe areas of growth identified in performance reviews with your manager, turning potential weaknesses into strategic strengths. It emphasizes focusing on excelling in your existing strengths rather than spreading efforts thinly across all areas of improvement. Understand why it's misguided to immediately convert a list of growth areas into a to-do list and the importance of collaborating with your manager on this. Learn to identify the growth areas you are interested in and determine what has kept you from excelling in them, such as time, opportunity, or self-confidence. Discover why focusing on becoming extraordinarily good in your already strong areas can lead to unique opportunities for you and your company. Explore how to strategically discuss your growth areas with your manager, focusing on a limited set of areas for improvement and suggesting compromises or delegation for others. Challenge the conventional wisdom of balancing skills and instead consider how to become a top performer (top 2%) in your areas of strength. Realise that a team composed of individuals excelling at different things, will probably be more effective than a team of well-rounded individuals.ðŸ“® Ask a QuestionIf you enjoyed this episode and would like me to discuss a question that you have on the show, drop it over at: developertea.com.ðŸ“® Join the DiscordIf you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting https://developertea.com/discord today!ðŸ§¡ Leave a ReviewIf you're enjoying the show and want to support the content head over to iTunes and leave a review!",
