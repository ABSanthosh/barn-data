  "text": "ByteDance is a global technology company operating a wide range of content platforms around the world, and is best known for creating TikTok. The company operates at a massive scale, which naturally presents challenges in ensuring performance and stability across its data centers. It has over a million servers running containerized applications, and this required the company to find a networking solution that could handle high throughput while maintaining stability. eBPF is a technology for dynamically and safely reprogramming the Linux kernel. ByteDance leveraged eBPF to successfully implement a decentralized networking solution that improved efficiency, scalability, and performance. Chen Tang is an engineer at ByteDance, where he worked on redesigning the company’s container networking stack using eBPF. In this episode, Chen joins the show with Kevin Ball to talk about eBPF, the problems it solves, and how it was used at ByteDance. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
