  "text": "Over the past few years, we’ve seen the number of nonprofits leveraging GitHub grow—and grow. Technology is increasingly becoming a critical part of nonprofit’s strategies to drive forward their missions, accelerate human progress, and take big strides toward the Sustainable Development Goals. And we’re here to make this process easier and more accessible for all—from local grassroots organizations to global nonprofits. Welcome to GitHub for Nonprofits. This new portal makes the sign up process seamless, with exclusive discounts automatically applied to your account.** Verified nonprofits are eligible for free access to the GitHub Team plan or 25% off the GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan.** This includes nonprofit organizations that are 501(c)(3) or equivalent and are non-governmental, non-academic, non-commercial, non-political in nature, and have no religious affiliation. Wondering how GitHub could practically help your nonprofit? Here are a few ways they’ll help you drive your mission forward: Manage your projects. Investing in GitHub is not just about adopting a tool; it’s about leveraging technology to reach goals in a collaborative way. Increase visibility and widen impact. By hosting projects on GitHub, nonprofits can increase their visibility and reach a wider audience. Whether it’s sharing code libraries, publishing research, or showcasing success stories, GitHub provides nonprofits with a platform to amplify their impact and attract support from donors, funders, volunteers, and partners. Connect with the open source community. GitHub is home to the largest open source communities on the planet. By hosting your projects on GitHub, you can tap into this incredible pool of talent and expertise. Need help with a tricky problem? Want to attract volunteers to your cause? GitHub has you covered. This seamless way of signing up may be new, but the adoption of GitHub by nonprofit organizations is tried and true. We have customers around the world using GitHub for good, and they have the results to show it: “GitHub provides us with a platform to amplify the critical needs of forcibly displaced persons and attract support from donors, volunteers, and partners, while also tapping into skills and resources of an incredible developer community.” – Seema Iyer, USA for UNHCR “As a nonprofit, when we want to develop something new, we have to figure out a way to do that with limited resources and a small team. GitHub is a big part of our productivity every single day and we’ve recently leveraged different features to develop an algorithm to bring a new level of impact reporting to our donors. This has helped us unlock new efforts that we wouldn’t have been able to do otherwise and has enabled our team to start imagining new opportunities for the future.” – Christa Stelzmuller, charity: water “With GitHub, we unite developers worldwide, turning open source technology into a force for good—fighting poverty, one line of code at a time.” – Sandino Scheidegger, Switzerland for Social Income Join GitHub for Nonprofits, where technology meets purpose, and together, let’s create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
