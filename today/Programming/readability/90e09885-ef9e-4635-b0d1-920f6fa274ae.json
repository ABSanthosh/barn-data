  "text": "GitHub is the worldâ€™s leading AI-powered platform for developers who share their code, work together, and build amazing things. But out of the more than 100 million developers that call GitHub home, there are a few exceptional talents and technical experts who go above and beyond in helping others in the developer space â€“ the GitHub Stars.Â  GitHub empowers the most influential developers and gives them a platform to showcase their work, reach more people, lead by example, and help others improve their skills. As a driving force in the community, the GitHub Stars educate and influence others through creating content, speaking, and sharing their knowledge about software development.Â  We at JetBrains are excited to recognize technical leaders from the largest open source community who inspire us, educate the people around them, and share their passion for coding.Â  For many years, JetBrains has supported developers, students, teachers, and communities worldwide with various community programs. We are proud to have our own Developer Recognition Program, which supports and encourages developers to advocate for technology and innovation. More than 1,200 experts received complimentary All Products Packs through this initiative, including Google Developer Experts, Microsoft MVPs, Java Champions, Docker Captains, Nx Champions, and others.Â  Starting today, we are happy to provide GitHub Stars with free access to all JetBrains desktop products, such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, dotUltimate, WebStorm, GoLand, etc. Are you an active GitHub Star? Youâ€™re welcome to apply for a complimentary All Products Pack license to take advantage of all JetBrains IDEs right away! As long as you are able to confirm your status as a recognized GitHub Star, you can continue using JetBrains IDEs free of charge. Two weeks before your subscription expires, you will get an email reminder to apply for the license extension. If you have any questions, email us at community-support@jetbrains.com. We will be glad to help.Â  Welcome onboard!Â  The JetBrains team Subscribe to JetBrains Blog updates Discover more",
