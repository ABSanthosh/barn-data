  "text": "David A. Patterson is a pioneering computer scientist known for his contributions to computer architecture, particularly as a co-developer of Reduced Instruction Set Computing, or RISC, which revolutionized processor design. He has co-authored multiple books, including the highly influential Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. David is a UC Berkeley Pardee professor emeritus, a Google distinguished engineer since 2016, the RIOS Laboratory Director, and the RISC-V International Vice-Chair. He received the 2017 Turing Award together with John L. Hennessy “for pioneering a systematic, quantitative approach to the design and evaluation of computer architectures with enduring impact on the microprocessor industry.” In this episode he joins Kevin Ball to talk about his life and career. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.

You scramble to troubleshoot, but the complexity of your microservices environment makes it nearly impossible to pinpoint the problem quickly. That’s why Chronosphere is on a mission to help you take back control with Differential Diagnosis, a new distributed tracing feature that takes the guesswork out of troubleshooting. With just one click, DDx automatically analyzes all spans and dimensions related to a service, pinpointing the most likely cause of the issue. Don’t let troubleshooting drag you into the early hours of the morning. Just “DDx it” and resolve issues faster. See why Chronosphere was named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms at chronosphere.io/sed. Understanding the details of infrastructure tools matter, and there is no better way to understand that than looking directly at the code. Open source codebases give everyone the ability to inspect, audit, and contribute to the software they use, enhancing trust and transparency. Bitwarden is a trusted open source and end-to-end encrypted security solution that empowers businesses and individuals to securely manage and share information online. Made by developers like you, Bitwarden offers open source solutions for virtually every credential management use case, from secrets management to password management and passwordless.
