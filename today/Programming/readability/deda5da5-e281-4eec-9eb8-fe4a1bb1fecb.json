As always, we bring you the most interesting tutorials on Java, Kotlin, and other technologies, along with the latest news you don’t want to miss. We’re also excited to introduce a brand-new AI section, which we reserve for the most fascinating content on the topic. And this month, we’re honored to feature Angie Jones as the author for our Featured Content section – so you know it’s going to be a great read!A lot of exciting things are happening, so without further ado, let’s go!  Featured Content Angie Jones is the Global Vice President of Developer Relations at Block, Inc. An award-winning educator and international keynote speaker, Angie shares her extensive knowledge with software companies and conference audiences worldwide.A master inventor, Angie is recognized for her innovative, out-of-the-box thinking, which has led to 27 patented inventions in virtual worlds, collaboration software, social networking, smarter planet initiatives, and software development processes. As a Java Champion, I make it a point to stay up to date on what’s happening in the JVM ecosystem and, more importantly, share it with my fellow Java developers. To my delight, we’re seeing the Java ecosystem embrace AI integration more than ever, thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP offers a standardized way to connect AI models with various tools and data sources, which means we can now employ AI agents like Goose within our local environments. JetBrains MCP Server I was pleased to see that JetBrains created an MCP Server plugin that integrates with MCP-enabled AI agents like Goose and Claude Desktop. This combination allows developers to enhance their JetBrains IDEs with AI capabilities, enabling tasks like code analysis and automated refactoring directly within the development environment. For example, I used Goose within IntelliJ IDEA. and right from the IDE’s terminal, I asked it to upgrade my project from Java 14 to Java 21 and modernize my codebase using the latest Java features: “Hey Goose, using the JetBrains extension, upgrade this project to use the latest Java LTS version and refactor the codebase to use newer Java features where beneficial.” Within two minutes, I had a fully upgraded project with shiny new features such as string templates, pattern matching for switch and instanceof, sealed classes, records, text blocks, and switch expressions! This alone blew me away, but I also loved that I could see how these new features worked within my own project, making them much easier to learn and apply. Official MCP Java SDK MCP is an open ecosystem. This means anyone can create an MCP server or even their own AI agent. There were already MCP SDKs for Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python, and as of mid-February (Valentine’s Day, to be exact ❤️), there’s now an official MCP Java SDK! There are more than 1,300 MCP servers that provide access to tons of APIs, but if there’s an API that you want to add to the ecosystem, you can now build it yourself with the MCP Java SDK. Spring AI with MCP For those utilizing the Spring framework, you simply must check out Spring AI’s integration with MCP. Spring AI is incorporating MCP to make it easier for Spring Boot applications to interact with AI agents and external tools. For a visual demonstration of how MCP simplifies AI integration, check out this cool video by my dear friend and Spring expert, Josh Long. More to explore! I have to tell you, I’m having an absolute blast incorporating AI into my workflows. I’m feeling more productive, efficient, and creative than ever! I have my eye on two other MCP servers I want to try: JavaFX MCP Server – allows you to create drawings using a JavaFX canvas directly from your AI agent. Whether it’s automating UI prototyping or generating visualizations, this opens up some exciting possibilities. JDBC MCP Server – a database connector that allows AI agents to interact with any JDBC-compatible database, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, and more. This enables natural language querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. If you haven’t played around with MCP and AI agents yet, now’s the perfect time.  Java News Java News Roundup 1, 2, 3, 4 – Get the latest news from the Java community.  Join the Celebration of 30 Years of Java – Join a virtual event on March 13, hosted by Azul, to celebrate 30 years of Java.  JDK 24 and JDK 25: What We Know So Far – Michael Redlich summarizes the new features in JDK 24 and hints at what’s coming in JDK 25.
