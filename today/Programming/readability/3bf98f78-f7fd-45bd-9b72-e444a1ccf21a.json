  "text": "Come and join 150M developers on GitHub that can now code with Copilot for free in VS Code. Share: GitHub has a long history of offering free products and services to developers. Starting with free open source and public collaboration, we added free private repos, free minutes for GitHub Actions and GitHub Codespaces, and free package and release storage. Today, we are adding GitHub Copilot to the mix by launching GitHub Copilot Free. Now automatically integrated into VS Code, all of you have access to 2,000 code completions and 50 chat messages per month, simply by signing in with your personal GitHub account. Or by creating a new one. And just last week, we passed the mark of 150M developers on GitHub. ðŸŽ‰ Copilot Free gives you the choice between Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3.5 Sonnet or OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model. You can ask a coding question, explain existing code, or have it find a bug. You can execute edits across multiple files. And you can access Copilotâ€™s third-party agents or build your own extension. Did you know that Copilot Chat is now directly available from the GitHub dashboard and it works with Copilot Free, so you can start using it today? We couldnâ€™t be more excited to make Copilot available to the 150M developers on GitHub. Happy coding! P.S. Students, educators, and open source maintainers: your free access to unlimited Copilot Pro accounts continues, unaffected! ðŸ˜‰ Written by Fascinated by software development since his childhood in Germany, Thomas Dohmke has built a career building tools developers love and accelerating innovations that are changing software development. Currently, Thomas is Chief Executive Officer of GitHub, where he has overseen the launch of the world's first at-scale AI developer tool, GitHub Copilot -- and now, GitHub Copilot X. Before his time at GitHub, Thomas previously co-founded HockeyApp and led the company as CEO through its acquisition by Microsoft in 2014, and holds a PhD in mechanical engineering from University of Glasgow, UK.
