  "text": "In April, we experienced three incidents that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services. April 11 03:05 UTC (lasting 39 minutes) On April 11, 2025, from 03:05 UTC to 03:44 UTC, approximately 75% of Codespaces users faced create and start failures. These were caused by manual configuration changes to an internal dependency that escaped our test coverage. Our monitors and detection mechanism triggered, which helped us triage, revert the changes, and restore service health. We are working on building additional gates, safer mechanisms for testing, and rolling out such configuration changes. We expect no further disruptions.  April 23 07:00 UTC (lasting 20 minutes) On April 23, 2025, between 07:00 UTC and 07:20 UTC, multiple GitHub services experienced degradation caused by resource contention on database hosts. The resulting error rates, which ranged from 2–5% of total requests, led to intermittent service disruption for users. The issue was triggered by an interaction between query load and ongoing schema change that led to connection saturation. The incident recovered after the schema migration was completed. Our prior investments in monitoring and improved playbooks helped us effectively organize our first responder teams, leading to faster triaging of the incident. We have also identified a regression in our schema change tooling that led to increased resource utilization during schema and reverted to a previous stable version.  To prevent similar issues in the future, we are reviewing the capacity of the database, improving monitoring and alerting systems, and implementing safeguards to reduce time to detection and mitigation.  April 23 19:13 UTC (lasting 42 minutes) On April 23, 2025, between 19:13:50 UTC and 22:11:00 UTC, GitHub’s Migration service experienced elevated failures caused by a configuration change that removed access for repository migration workers. During this time, 837 migrations across 57 organizations were affected. Impacted migrations required a retry after the log message “Git source migration failed. Error message: An error occurred. Please contact support for further assistance.” was displayed. Once access was restored, normal operations resumed without further interruption. As a result of this incident, we have implemented enhanced test coverage and refined monitoring thresholds to help prevent similar disruptions in the future. Please follow our status page for real-time updates on status changes and post-incident recaps. To learn more about what we’re working on, check out the GitHub Engineering Blog.
