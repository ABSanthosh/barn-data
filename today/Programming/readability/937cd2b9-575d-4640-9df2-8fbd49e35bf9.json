  "description": "For the last eighteen months I’ve been writing a book about being a dad. Two weeks ago I finished the first draft! The book is inspired by my blog posts about parenting, but most of it is brand new and I think it might be very good. It’s about childbirth, covid, careers, old friends, new friends, kid friends, chess, pianos, screens, AI, marriage, and much more. Now that I’ve finished a draft I’m looking for an agent and a publisher. I’ve never done this before so I’d appreciate help and advice! Please get in touch if: You’ve published a book or know someone who has You are a literary agent or you know someone who is You’d be up for giving feedback on a first draft You have some words of encouragement You have any thoughts or ideas of any sort about anything If you want to find out when the book is ready, subscribe to my newsletter. If you have friends who you think would enjoy the book, tell them about it and make them subscribe too. Thanks!",
