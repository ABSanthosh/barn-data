  "description": "I have been blogging here for the last 20 years. Every Tuesday and Thursday, quite consistently, for two decades. But last year, without planning it, I got tired and stopped. Not sure why. It didn't correspond with any life events. Nothing interesting or notable happened. I just stopped. I did find joy on TikTok and amassed a small group of like-minded followers there. I enjoy my YouTube as well, and my weekly podcast is going strong with nearly 900 (!) episodes of interviews with cool people. I've also recently started posting on Mastodon (a fediverse (federated universe)) Twitter alternative that uses the ActivityPub web standard. I see that Mark Downie has been looking at ActivityPub as well for DasBlog (the blog engine that powers this blog) so I need to spend sometime with Mark soon. Being consistent is a hard thing, and I think I did a good job. I gave many talks over many years about Personal Productivity but I always mentioned doing what \"feeds your spirit.\" For a minute here the blog took a backseat, and that's OK. I filled that (spare) time with family time, personal projects, writing more code, 3d printing, games, taekwondo, and a ton of other things. Going forward I will continue to write and share across a number of platforms, but it will continue to start here as it's super important to Own Your Words. Keep taking snapshots and backups of your keystrokes as you never know when your chosen platform might change or go away entirely. I'm still here. I hope you are too! I will see you soon.
