  "text": "Vijaya Kaza is the Chief Security Officer and Head of Engineering for Trust and Safety at Airbnb. She leads teams responsible for developing the technology (Platforms, tools and AI models), to safeguard the Airbnb community, as well as for securing Airbnb’s infrastructure and information assets. She is also the executive co-sponsor of Airbnb Tech’s Diversity Council.Here’s Vijaya’s story of how she got to Airbnb, in her own words.Straight shot to science and engineeringI grew up in a modest, multi-generational family in India with 30 to 40 family members under one roof on any given day. As the oldest child in that house, I was expected to excel academically and set an example for the other children to follow.In our culture back then, being “good at school” was synonymous with shining in science and math. As luck would have it, I had a strong affinity for those subjects and enjoyed studying and diving deep into them. I followed a natural path that combined math and science, studying engineering in college, and got a bachelor’s and two master’s in electrical engineering. This foundation paved the way for my future work in technology.Stumbling into cybersecurityAfter college, I landed my first job as a Software Engineer at Cisco. However, my entry into the security field was accidental. I simply followed a manager I liked who was moving into a new security business unit, fell in love with Security and never looked back after that! There was no grand plan or calculated career strategy.After 17 years at Cisco leading product development for a $1B security product portfolio, I headed to FireEye, another well-known name in the Cybersecurity space. There I had the responsibility for helping the company transition from on-prem to a cloud/SaaS business model, and growing the revenue of their cloud security portfolio. That role gave me the experience of working on different areas of security, as well as leading both Product Management and Engineering in a General Manager capacity.Next, I led Product Development at Lookout, a startup in San Francisco focused on mobile security. At the time, it was a consumer security company pivoting to building for enterprise customers. I didn’t know it then, but that glimpse of consumer security was a great primer for my eventual role at Airbnb.Cybersecurity is an ever-changing domain with constant innovation and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working and learning in such a dynamic space. Each major technological transformation — from cloud to mobile to AI — brings novel security challenges to solve for businesses and end users.An unexpected opportunity at AirbnbWhen I was initially approached for the Chief Security Officer (CSO) role at Airbnb, I was taken aback. I had always worked in the field doing engineering and product development work, so I wasn’t sure about this role. But after meeting Ari Balogh, Airbnb’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for an informal coffee chat, we really hit it off and I was thoroughly impressed by his vision to transform the engineering and technology organization within the company. Ari shared his philosophy of focusing on the craft of engineering and that really resonated with me. The prospect of molding Airbnb’s engineering culture was very enticing.Turns out Airbnb was also looking for someone to lead engineering for its Trust and Safety organization. Given my background with a blend of engineering and security domain expertise, I ended up taking on both of these roles. This unique opportunity allowed me to go back to my roots leading engineering teams while taking advantage of my security experience in the capacity of a CSO.When I joined the company in 2019, I was struck by Airbnb’s dedication and effort to deliver a positive user experience. Our attention and design focus that go into helping guests and hosts have a seamless experience is unlike anything I’ve experienced before.Why Airbnb?I joined Airbnb because of the opportunity to have an outsized impact — Airbnb’s almost 6,000 employees serve millions of people worldwide. Our mission-driven approach, powered by our founders’ unmatched passion and commitment to doing good through initiatives like Airbnb.org really resonated with me. I’ve been continuously impressed by the caliber of talented, caring people here who are united by Airbnb’s vision. It’s rare to find a company that so effectively combines technical excellence with social consciousness.Two teams, one missionWhile both the Trust and Safety and Security teams share the common mission of safeguarding users and the platform, the actual techniques, threats, and focus areas are completely different. Trust is at the core of our business and we’re deeply focused on providing our guests and hosts peace of mind as they live, work, travel and host on Airbnb. We build technology to help lower safety and privacy risks for our community.For example, our innovative reservation screening technology aims to help reduce the risk of disruptive parties on Airbnb globally by taking steps to identify higher-risk reservations and potentially prevent these bookings from being made.On the cybersecurity front, we focus on securing Airbnb’s assets, our data, our employees, and our infrastructure. We implement robust security controls and threat detection capabilities to safeguard Airbnb’s internal resources.Embracing the improv mindsetOutside of work, I’ve pursued some hobbies that have surprisingly imparted invaluable leadership lessons. A few years ago, I decided to try improv comedy, something that’s entirely outside my wheelhouse. I had never done anything close to theater or acting in my entire life. What started as a fun experiment quickly became a passion project and I progressed through the levels and eventually performed live in front of an audience with friends and family in attendance.It may seem unrelated at first, but the very nature of improv is profoundly relevant for leadership. You’re constantly put on the spot and need to think on your feet, responding to new questions and scenarios in the moment. Improv trains this vital skill of processing information in real time and formulating a coherent, compelling reaction.Keep a steady headOver any career, including mine, there are inevitable professional setbacks, disappointments, and annoyances along the way. The key is to not make much of these short-term hurdles; it’s how you respond that matters most. The less you agonize over the bumps in the road, the better. Maintain your focus, keep one foot in front of the other, and persist forward undeterred. I learned these lessons early, having taken on leadership roles from a young age as the eldest child in a large household. My advice is to keep a steady head, maintain perspective, and plow forward with conviction.We’re currently expanding the Airbnb team and hiring for several roles. Check out our open positions here.",
