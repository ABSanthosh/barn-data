MarketplaceIntroducing  Perpetual Licenses on JetBrains Marketplace JetBrains Marketplace provides various licensing models for paid plugins to suit different user preferences. Now, we are introducing a new option that may change how your users purchase your plugins – perpetual licensing. Licensing options on JetBrains Marketplace The current licensing schemes available on JetBrains Marketplace include: Annual/monthly subscription without a fallback license: Users can access your plugin only with an active subscription. This model is ideal for ensuring continuous revenue as users need to maintain their subscriptions to keep using the plugin. Annual/monthly subscription with a fallback license: Users receive lifetime access to a specific version of your plugin. Updates and new features are only available with an active subscription. This model strikes a balance between providing long-term value to users and encouraging them to renew their subscriptions. The licensing type (with or without fallback) and billing period (annual/monthly) can be selected under the Sales tab, in the Sales Info section of the plugin page. In addition to the options described above, we are now introducing a perpetual license option. This new license type allows users to make a one-time payment for lifetime access to your plugin, including all future updates. It can be an appealing choice for users who prefer a single upfront payment rather than recurring charges. How to implement perpetual licenses Now that you can opt for perpetual licensing for your new plugin, the perpetual license will be available as an option when you publish a new plugin on JetBrains Marketplace. Alternatively, if you prefer to switch your existing plugin to a perpetual licensing model, you can do so by contacting the JetBrains Marketplace team at marketplace@jetbrains.com. In this scenario, all current customers will automatically receive the perpetual license for free, while new customers will need to purchase it. Note that a plugin can currently have only one paid license option: either recurring or perpetual. Choosing the best licensing model for your plugin The introduction of the perpetual license gives you more flexibility in how you monetize your plugin. However, it’s essential to consider the implications carefully. Revenue stability: While a one-time payment model may attract more users initially, it can lead to less predictable revenue in the long run compared to a subscription model. User satisfaction: Perpetual licenses can increase customer satisfaction, as users appreciate the simplicity and long-term value of a single payment. If you have any questions or need guidance on transitioning to the perpetual license model, feel free to reach out to the Marketplace Support team at marketplace@jetbrains.com.
