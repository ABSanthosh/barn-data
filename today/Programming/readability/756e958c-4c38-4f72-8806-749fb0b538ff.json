It’s built on top of React and is designed to streamline web application development using server-side rendering and static site generation. The framework’s handling of both frontend and backend tasks, along with features like API routes and file-based routing, have made it an increasingly popular choice in the web dev community. Next.js 15 just released in October of 2024 and introduces significant upgrades, including enhanced integration of Turbopack and support for React 19. Jimmy Lai is a Software Engineering Manager at Next.js and Tim Neutkens is the Tech Lead for Next.js and Turbopack. They join the show to talk about Next.js and what’s new in version 15. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space. Sponsors This episode of Software Engineering Daily is brought to you by Leanware. Struggling with development teams that say “yes” to everything but deliver on nothing? Leanware offers a refreshing approach. They’re a Colombia-based team delivering top-tier software development with full transparency and world-class engineering standards. They’ve honed their craft over nearly five years, sticking to technologies where they have senior expertise. This means no compromises on quality, ever. Their C-level executives are always accessible, ensuring seamless communication and a genuine partnership. Plus, being in a similar time zone to the U.S. makes collaboration effortless. Don’t settle for less. Partner with Leanware for software development done reliably. Visit leanware.co or see the show notes to get started – that’s leanware.co Leanware—redefining software development with exceptional quality, and realistic expectations. This episode of Software Engineering Daily is brought to you by Jellyfish, the software engineering intelligence platform powered by a patented allocations model and boasting the industry’s largest customer dataset. You know, one of the biggest shifts in the past year or so is the adoption of genAI coding tools like GitHub Copilot. And engineering leaders are trying to figure out if their teams are actually using it, how much they’re using it, and how it’s affecting the business. Are they shipping more? Is more roadmap work being done? How do you know beyond anecdotes and surveys? That’s why Jellyfish introduced the Copilot dashboard in 2024 in partnership with GitHub…and since then they’ve analyzed data from more than 4200 developers at more than 200 companies. Want to know an interesting finding? Developers are shipping 20.9% more with Copilot.",
