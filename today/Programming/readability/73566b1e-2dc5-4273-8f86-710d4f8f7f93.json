It’s already my second edition of Kotlin Roundup, and I can’t wait to share the latest from the Kotlin ecosystem. Kotlin highlights 🎉 Kotlin is the fifth-fastest-growing language on GitHub I was recently reading this year’s Octoverse report, and I was blown away by the news. Kotlin is one of the top five fastest-growing languages on GitHub! This wouldn’t be possible without your help. To all the developers, contributors, and advocates, thank you for your passion, dedication, and belief in Kotlin. Ktor 3.0 comes with new features and improved performance In case you missed it, we released Ktor 3.0, which is packed with awesome upgrades! It now uses Kotlin 2.0 and the new kotlinx-io library for next-level performance and better integration with other Kotlin tools. Oh, and did I mention it also includes support for server-sent events (SSE), the ability to serve static resources straight from ZIP archives, and WebAssembly support for the Ktor client? Time to supercharge your projects! 🚀 We’ve also prepared a migration guide from the 2.2.x version to 3.0.x to make the transition easier. Explore 3.0 in detail The Kotlin 2.1.0-RC2 release Big news: Kotlin 2.1.0 is just around the corner – so close, you can almost touch it! But if you’re too excited to wait, Kotlin 2.1.0-RC2 is here to give you an early taste of what’s coming. 🌟 You can preview shiny new language features, try out the Kotlin/Wasm incremental compilation, and enjoy an improved K2 kapt implementation. We’ve also updated LLVM from version 11.1.0 to 16.0.0 for Kotlin/Native. Plus, there are some nice Compose compiler improvements. Take a closer look Kotlin 2.1 livestream with the Language Evolution team Ready to see Kotlin 2.1 in action? Join us live on November 28 as the Language Evolution team takes you through exciting new features like non-local break and continue, enhanced function overload resolution, and multidollar interpolation. Have some questions? Bring ‘em on! My good friends Alejandro, Mikhail, and Anton will answer whatever you’ve got to ask, and they’ll also give you a sneak peek at what’s coming next.
