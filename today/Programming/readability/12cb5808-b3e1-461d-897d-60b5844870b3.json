  "text": "Essential productivity kit for .NET and game developers .NET Tools RiderUpcoming Changes to JetBrains .NET Tools We’re making some changes to our .NET tools, and we want to give you an overview of what’s happening and the reasons behind the changes. Some features you might be using are being discontinued or transformed, while others are getting significant refinements. We believe that these changes will allow us to build better tools for everyone.  What’s driving these changes Over the past year, we’ve been listening closely to our community through user surveys and interviews, as well as analyzing detailed usage statistics across our .NET tools. This data has given us valuable insights into how developers actually use our tools and where we should focus our development efforts. The picture that emerged was clear: while we’ve built many powerful features over the years, some are underutilized, while others have tremendous potential that we haven’t fully realized. This led us to make some strategic decisions about streamlining our offerings to deliver more value where it matters most. Changes in the 2025.2 release Streamlining dotCover The standalone dotCover tool will also receive significant streamlining to improve performance and reduce complexity. We’ve modernized the command-line runner, consolidating commands under a unified dotcover cover interface and transitioning from XML-based configuration files to simpler plain-text argument files.  We’ve also removed some rarely-used filtering options (method and class filters, file path filters, and in-source comment filters) and discontinued support for legacy application types, including IIS Express, WCF, WinRT, and external .NET processes. These changes significantly reduce overhead and allow our team to concentrate on the core coverage scenarios that matter most to modern .NET development workflows. End of code coverage for Mono and Unity projects in Rider Rider 2025.2 will no longer provide coverage analysis for Mono and Unity projects via dotCover. Analyzing the low usage numbers, we realized that it significantly increases the technical debt for the team, which is now focused on performance improvements and branch coverage.  We plan to restore coverage analysis for Unity projects once Unity migrates to CoreCLR (expected after Unity 7 LTS). The list of available target application types in the cover application dialog will be reduced to .NET, .NET Core, Windows Service, and IIS. TeamCity extension for Visual Studio We’ll be discontinuing the TeamCity extension for Visual Studio as part of our efforts to streamline tooling and focus on the most impactful developer experiences. While we understand this may affect some workflows, this decision enables us to concentrate on delivering better performance and more sustainable tool ecosystems. Changes coming in 2025.3 To make sure our development efforts deliver the most value, we’re adjusting how some features are maintained and delivered in Rider, based on actual usage patterns and technical considerations.  Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA) in Rider DPA is evolving. In Rider 2025.3, it will cease to be available as a separate tool, and instead, its analytical capabilities will be further integrated into the Monitoring tool. With this change, we aim to provide you with a powerful performance analysis experience while keeping your workflow simple. The DPA capabilities inside the Monitoring tool will be available under the dotUltimate license, alongside the already-integrated dotTrace and dotMemory profilers. We’re here to help We recognize some of these changes might affect established workflows. Our Support team is ready to help you find the best solutions for your specific needs. If these changes significantly impact your work or if you have suggestions for how we can better serve your development needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out. What’s your vision for dotUltimate? These changes will help us free up significant development capacity and direct it towards improvements that matter most to our users. You can expect to see continued performance enhancements, stability improvements, and feature refinements that make development more productive and enjoyable. As always, your feedback shapes our roadmap. Tell us about your vision for the dotUltimate set of tools! Is there anything missing from your toolbox that we could provide? Perhaps, you’d like to see some other JetBrains products be covered by this subscription? Share your ideas in the comments, on our issue trackers, and on our social media pages.
