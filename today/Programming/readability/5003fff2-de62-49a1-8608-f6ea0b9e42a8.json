Date: May 15, 2025 Time: 3:00–4:00 pm UTC REGISTER FOR THE LIVESTREAM Session abstract Discover all of the powerful UI tooling in IntelliJ IDEA that you never knew was there. It’s simple to use and incredibly powerful. More than just checkout, commit, push, and pull, you can easily rebase and merge branches, cherry-pick commits, view deep history, perform a hard or soft reset, and manage merge conflicts with ease. You’ll never want to touch the Git command line again once you see how powerful and user-friendly IntelliJ IDEA’s built-in Git tooling is. Asking questions Justin will try to answer all of your questions during the session. If we run out of time, we’ll publish answers to any remaining questions in a follow-up blog post. Your speaker and host Speaker Justin Clareburt Justin Clareburt has been an IntelliJ IDEA power user and evangelist for over 20 years, with a reputation as the world’s leading expert in keyboard shortcuts. While working for Google, he built features for Android Studio (IntelliJ-based), and as a Program Manager for Microsoft Visual Studio, he built the IntelliJ platform keyboard mapping scheme and still maintains the tooling for the ReSharper, IntelliJ IDEA, Emacs, and Sublime keyboard profiles. Justin is primarily focused on helping build and promote developer tooling to improve the lives of developers as they strive for quality and efficiency. Host Mala Gupta A Java Champion and JUG leader, Mala has authored multiple books with Manning, Packt, and O’Reilly Publications. She has more than two decades of experience in the software industry and is a regular speaker at industry conferences around the world. She is a vocal supporter of Java certification as a path to career advancement. Happy developing! Subscribe to IntelliJ IDEA Blog updates Discover more",
