  "text": "It's even worse than it appears.. I needed an updated bio for a conference in October.# I'm trying to make a linkblog with a WordPress RSS feed.# Using soldiers as a political prop. Trump gave a political speech, lying about protests in front of a group of people dressed as American soldiers. They all appeared to be enjoying the president’s tough talk about the role he wants the military to play in policing the cities. MSNBC should not broadcast this.# Would one of the browser vendors work with me on doing something nice with displaying feeds in XML form? I don't support obfuscating what a feed is, that just adds confusion. When I lift the hood of a car I want to see an engine not a drawing of something that sort of looks like a car, but not really, and looks nothing like an engine.# I was wondering if Saturday's military parade in Washington was going to be the rollout of the Trump junta, and if that meant the president would appear in military garb, perhaps subdued so next year's parade they can add more features. So I asked ChatGPT to help. # President Trump is reviewing the military parade in on a stage in front of the White House in Washington DC. To honor the troops, he’s dressed in a faux military uniform with medals, and a cap that says Make America Great Again. Fighter jets are flying overhead.# When I tried the first time, last night, it got halfway through the drawing then quit, saying it violated their content guidelines. So I went to meta.ai, which also does drawing, and it was willing to do it, and even animated it. I uploaded the result to my AI group on Facebook. It should be visible to everyone, without an invitation. # I then tried again with ChatGPT and it was willing to do the same task it wasn't willing to do last night. # Generalissimo Trump, imagined.# Yesterday I introduced a new feed for great art, 24 times a day. Every hour on the hour.# Today, a version of that feed provides one work of art each day, at midnight, Eastern.# art.feediverse.org# artdaily.feediverse.org# Why I did this feed. I'm crafting a new information product, and I want to include a random work of art but not every hour, once a day is enough. I thought it was worth a detour to make the feed that I wanted. # The first work of art in the feed on its inaugural issue was The Countess from Hans Holbein the Younger, 1526. It was chosen at random from a collection of 42,473 works of art. #",
