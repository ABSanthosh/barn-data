  "text": "IntelliJ IDEA – the IDE for Professional Development in Java and Kotlin Early Access ProgramIntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 Beta: EAP Closure and Our New Approach to Release Updates The Beta version of IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 is now available, marking the end of our Early Access Program for this release cycle. Download IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 Beta Thank you to everyone who used the EAP builds, shared feedback, and helped shape this release. As we mentioned in the EAP opening post, we have moved away from weekly update blog posts to avoid overwhelming you with news about small, incremental changes and focus on what truly matters in each release. Even without weekly highlights, we continued to receive valuable input and saw steady engagement throughout the eight weeks of the EAP, and we really appreciate your involvement. Our new approach to sharing release updates Alongside our work on the product, we’ve also been rethinking how we communicate what’s new in each release in a more structured and thoughtful format. Now is a good time to give you a preview of this new approach and revisit some of the product priorities we outlined at the beginning of the EAP. Starting with 2025.2, we’re splitting communications into two distinct, but equally important, parts: The What’s New page will now provide a focused overview of the most impactful updates.In this release, the highlights include early support for emerging technologies like Java 25, Maven 4, and JSpecify, enhanced Spring development support with the new Spring Debugger and Spring Modulith, an improved AI-assisted development experience, and more. What’s Fixed is a new dedicated blog post where we highlight meaningful quality improvements that make your daily work smoother.For 2025.2, it includes updates to Spring + Kotlin support, functionality for working with WSL, remote development, Junie and AI Assistant, Maven execution, overall performance, and more These are just some of the highlights. We’ll share the full list of features and fixes in the final release materials.  As always, the release notes will give you a comprehensive list of the changes. We’re also preparing a special 2025.2 Release Highlights livestream with our Developer Advocates, where they’ll walk through the key new features and show how they work in real-world scenarios. Keep an eye out – we’ll share the date soon!  Getting ready for the 2025.2 release With the Beta now out, we’re focusing on final polishing and stability improvements. As always, all changes are tracked in the release notes. Stay tuned for the full rollout of our new update format, including the detailed What’s New and What’s Fixed posts, plus the livestream with the team. We encourage you to try out IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 Beta and let us know what you think by dropping a line in the comments or contacting us on X or LinkedIn. If you run into any issues, please report them in our issue tracker. Thanks again for being part of the IntelliJ IDEA community, and happy developing!
