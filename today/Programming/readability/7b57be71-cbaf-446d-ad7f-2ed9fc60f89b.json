Comments Please leave a comment, positive, negative or just something weird. Sam Schutte Sam is the founder and CEO of Unstoppable Software, Inc.

He also guided Unstoppable's unique approach to agile software development, called Value-Driven Development. Using these approaches, it is not uncommon for Unstoppable's customers to see ROI upwards of 800% on their custom system investment.
