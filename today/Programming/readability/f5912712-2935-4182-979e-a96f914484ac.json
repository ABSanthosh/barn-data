  "text": "1. It’s Freedom of Creativity Many people think you need A’s in math to program. That’s a misconception. Programming is more about logic and creativity. For example, you and your friends jokingly come up with an excellent smartphone game. You can wait for some company over the ocean to release it or make it yourself. You decide how this game will work and what the rules, interface, and functions will be. With programming skills comes the opportunity to create a product from scratch or implement an idea – an application, a website, a program – the way you need it. 2. It Pays Off A simple truth: the more skills you have, your services are more expensive. For example, each paper writer who can design simple HTML-pages, accountants, or managers who can automate Excel or Access with the help of code cost more than their colleagues with only a basic set of skills. Large companies are increasing and are looking for new ways to optimize. Hiring a team of developers and paying each $2,000 to $3,000 monthly is expensive. Hiring a person who will write articles, layout, and even think of ways to improve the mobile version of the site is a profitable solution. Such specialists have a better chance of getting into a significant company. For example, in The New York Times, more than half of the journalists already know how to program. When the publication changed its strategy and emphasized the development of the web and mobile version – trained in programming the employees who are responsible for digital content.

It’s Getting Closer Asking a developer to write a program in Ruby because you read yesterday that it is a new and cool language is a bad idea. To be able to do joint projects, understand how to set tasks, make changes, and what language to use when talking to programmers, you need at least some understanding of the code yourself. Even the heads of companies and owners of startups help learn how to program. For example, personally conduct an interview and adequately assess the candidate’s level to find a good specialist on the market. 4. It Saves Time How many times have you sighed when you have to do a chore? For example, you’re a journalist writing for a popular science publication. You need to research which countries most often get struck by lightning and figure out what those regions have in common. This will take more than a day. Programming will speed up this process: you will spend 30-40 minutes on code to help you quickly analyze the data and make a report. 5. It Develops Beneficial Habits Programming is a painstaking process. You can’t read a textbook at your leisure, watch a YouTube video or attend a few lectures. You have to sit down and start learning the language, digging into the code, and practicing all the time. For example, to write Python, you must practice 2-3 hours daily for a few months. It’s disciplined and helps you think structurally and strategically. 6. It’s Good For Your Health There’s a popular rumor that programmers are better thinkers even in old age. Jokes are jokes, but there’s some truth to them. For example, in 2014, scientists from the University of Passau analyzed brain scans of people while they were doing programming. The results showed that the same brain parts that work when learning foreign languages are active. And this reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.",
