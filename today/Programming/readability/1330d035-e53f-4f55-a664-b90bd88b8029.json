With a focus on topics that will be important over the next 18 months, this event from the team behind InfoQ and QCon delivers insights from practitioners building and scaling modern software systems so your team can execute with confidence. \"If you’re a senior developer, architect, or team lead, you know the landscape is evolving fast. So, where do you turn for actionable insights and not just buzzwords? InfoQ Dev Summit Boston on June 9-10: This event is different - no hidden product pitches, no fluff, just deep technical talks from practitioners who are building and scaling real systems. If you want to stay ahead, learn from your peers, and bring back concrete strategies to your team, this is where you need to be\". —Eder Ignatowicz, InfoQ Dev Summit Boston 2025 Chair, Senior Principal Software Engineer \u0026 Architect @RedHat. More Than Just Talks: A High-Impact Learning \u0026 Networking Experience At InfoQ Dev Summit Boston, the real value extends beyond the sessions. It’s about direct access to leading engineers, exchanging lessons with peers who’ve faced similar challenges, and engaging in meaningful discussions that don’t happen online. Whether it’s deep-dive speaker Q\u0026As, spontaneous hallway conversations, or focused breakout discussions, attendees leave with practical knowledge and professional connections that drive impact long after the event. If you’re looking for a space to go beyond surface-level discussions and engage with a community of senior engineers solving real-world software challenges, this is the summit to attend. Seven Talks You Can't Miss 1. Scaling AI in the Real World: Patterns That Actually Work - Phil Calçado, Founder \u0026 CEO @Outropy,  with 20+ years experience in software development, previously pioneered microservices architecture @SoundCloud, and scaled systems @DigitalOcean \u0026 @SeatGeek Phil shares hard-won lessons from scaling an AI assistant from prototype to 10,000 users, outperforming bigger players like Salesforce and Slack AI. This talk reveals what traditional patterns still work for AI systems - and which ones break under the pressure of stateful, stochastic architectures. Walk away with architectural insights that are immediately useful for teams shipping real AI products. 2. Empathy Driven Platforms: You Build It, Let’s Run It Together – Erin Doyle, Founding Engineer @Quotient and instructor @Egghead | 20+ years across full stack development in web and mobile, and platform engineering The promise of DevOps—\"you build it, you run it\"— was meant to streamline ownership. However, as systems grow more complex, developers are increasingly burdened with operational overhead that impacts productivity and morale. In this talk, Erin shares how platform teams can reduce this burden by building with empathy, prioritizing psychological safety, intuitive tooling, and collaborative design. Learn practical ways to create self-service platforms that developers actually want to use while supporting their growth and autonomy. 3. Theme Systems at Scale: How To Build Highly Customizable Software – Guilherme Carreiro, Staff Engineer @Shopify, championing the evolution of Liquid, with 14+ years in software development,  previously led DMN tooling team @Red Hat Liquid themes power thousands of Shopify storefronts with both speed and flexibility. Guilherme shares how to build secure, human-friendly DSLs, support visual editors for non-technical users, and enhance developer tooling via VS Code and language servers. If you're building platforms for diverse users, this talk offers battle-tested lessons for scalable, customizable architecture. 4. Systems Thinking for Scaling Responsible Multi-Agent Architectures – Nimisha Asthagiri, Principal Data \u0026 AI @Thoughtworks, previously Chief Architect @edX As multi-agent systems become core to enterprise AI, scaling them responsibly is critical. Nimisha shares patterns for building modular, self-regulating agent networks and introduces oversight techniques to prevent unintended behaviors. With system-wide feedback loops and governance baked into design, attendees will leave better equipped to scale AI systems ethically and efficiently. 5. Thinking Like a Detective: Solving Cloud Infrastructure Mysteries – Brendan McLoughlin, Frontend Architect @CarGurus, former Ember Data Maintainer, and previously Open Web Consultant @Bocoup When cloud services fail silently, debugging requires more than just code knowledge. Brendan takes a detective’s approach to cloud troubleshooting, showing how to investigate CDNs, WAFs, load balancers, and more. Attendees will gain practical techniques for mapping request paths, building better runbooks, and interpreting subtle failure clues to solve complex infrastructure issues. 6. AI-Enabled Delivery: Leveraging ChOP \u0026 LLMs for Learning and Certification – Wes Reisz, Technical Principal @Equal Experts, ex-Thoughtworker \u0026 ex-VMWare, 16-time QCon chair, and creator/Co-host of \"The InfoQ Podcast\" How do you build a meaningful, AI-powered certification experience from conference content? Wes Reisz shares how he and the InfoQ/QCon team combined Chat-Oriented Programming (ChOP), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and expert intuition to create the InfoQ Certified Architect in Emerging Technologies program. This session explores real-world patterns for integrating LLMs with human guidance, lessons from prompt engineering, and how to design systems that go beyond automation to enhance human learning. 7. Building an Internal Developer Portal That Empowers Developers – Travis Gosselin, Distinguished Engineer of Developer Experience @SPS Commerce, with 20+ years of experience Internal Developer Portals promise better productivity, but successfully implementing one requires more than just tools. Travis walks through SPS Commerce’s approach to building a developer portal with real impact - from making a compelling business case to driving adoption and measuring outcomes. Whether starting from scratch or iterating on an existing platform, you’ll leave with actionable guidance for creating a developer portal that truly empowers your team. Why These Topics Matter Now Engineering teams are under pressure to scale AI responsibly, optimize platform engineering, and improve developer experience while maintaining velocity. InfoQ Dev Summit Boston focuses on execution over hype, ensuring you leave with: Field-tested solutions: Talks from engineers actively solving these challenges in production environments. Peer-driven insights: Direct conversations with practitioners who’ve faced the same problems you’re tackling. Actionable takeaways: Practical strategies your team can apply immediately. A high-value network: Meaningful connections with senior developers, architects, and technical decision-makers. If you want to stay ahead of the curve and bring tangible insights back to your team, this is the event to attend! Early bird pricing ends April 15, 2025. Register now to save your seat. Our next summit is InfoQ Dev Summit Munich 2025, which returns October 15-16, 2025, with more practitioner-led insights on tackling today's critical software development challenges.
