  "text": "We’re working on improving our API offering. In order to do that, a few changes are coming: We need to revoke access for some of you with inactive apps. We’ve reached out directly to those who will be affected via email and we’re working to mitigate impact where we can. We need to do this for two reasons: Recently, we haven’t been able to provide developers with the level of support that you deserve. That includes being able to help you when things go wrong and supporting you when you build amazing things. More pressingly, we haven’t been able to sustain the level of oversight needed to make sure our bad actors aren’t abusing our API. After analyzing trends in abusive API calls, we’ve determined that change is necessary in order to protect the artists and fans that use SoundCloud’s services. Developers have been and will continue to be an important part of the SoundCloud ecosystem. Rest assured, this isn’t the final state of our API access – just a temporary reset so that we can implement additional security mechanisms. We’ll also be using this opportunity to redesign our API program so that there’s more internal support and better optimization for individual developers. In the meantime, we’re working hard to reopen the doors as soon as possible for developers that want to use our API. Be sure to keep an eye on this blog and the SoundCloud Developer Twitter Account for updates to come.",
