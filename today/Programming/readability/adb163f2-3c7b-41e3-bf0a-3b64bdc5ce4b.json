  "text": "IntelliJ IDEA – the IDE for Professional Development in Java and Kotlin Early Access ProgramIntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 Beta Is Out!  IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 Beta is now available! This means we’re in the final stretch before the major release, and you can try out all the new features and improvements right now. You can download this version from our website, update directly from within the IDE, use the free Toolbox App, or install it via snap packages for Ubuntu. Download IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 Beta There are still several updates and enhancements that haven’t been covered in the 2025.1 EAP blog posts, some of which are highlighted below. User experience  Native OS file dialogs on Windows  IntelliJ IDEA now defaults to using native Windows file dialogs instead of the custom implementation. This gives you a more familiar experience when opening or saving files. If you prefer the previous behavior, you can restore it in Advanced Settings | User Interface.  Version control systems  Commit details in the diff view You can now see commit details directly in the diff view. The diff dialog now displays the commit message, author, date and time, and full commit hash, giving you a clearer view of a file’s history and helping you understand modifications faster. Option to run tools for pre-commit checks  You can now launch any tool to perform a pre-commit check alongside inspections and formatting. Custom checks can be configured as run configurations in the Run Configuration dialog. This helps you catch potential issues early and ensures your code meets project standards before it’s committed. Automatic fetch when adding or modifying a Git remote IntelliJ IDEA now automatically fetches changes when you add or update a Git remote, ensuring you always have the latest branch list and commit history without needing to fetch them manually. Newly fetched branches will immediately appear in the Git branch tree. You’ll be able to start working with them right away, and your repository will always be up to date. Option to disable running Git commit hooks A new option allows you to instruct the IDE not to run Git commit hooks. Previously, Git hooks would execute automatically during commit operations, which might not have been desirable in all situations. With this update, you can now configure the IDE to skip these hooks, giving you more control over your commit process. Discontinuation of the modal commit interface The modal commit interface has been deactivated in IntelliJ IDEA. A few key reasons are behind this change:  Performance and overall experience – The modal commit option introduces lag and performance issues, adding to our technical debt in ways we can’t effectively address. Remote development – The current implementation of modal commits limits our ability to focus on a seamless remote development experience, which is becoming essential. Non-modal commit – We introduced a non-modal commit interface a few years ago, and it’s now the default for the vast majority of users. We know it’s not perfect, but we’re continually improving it. With the existing customization options, we believe it can be a solid option. While the non-modal commit workflow will now be the only built-in option, the modal commit experience will still be available through a separate plugin. The plugin won’t be actively maintained long-term, but we’ll review community pull requests to support it if there’s continued interest. If you’re looking to customize your commit workflow to make it similar to the modal commit one, we’ve gathered and documented several useful configuration options available in the IDE. Frameworks and technologies  Git-ready Ubuntu image for easier Dev Container setup Setting up Dev Containers is now more seamless. When you clone a repository without a Dev Container configuration, the IDE now offers a wizard with an optimized Ubuntu-based container that has Git pre-installed. This update eliminates common issues like Git being missing, reducing setup time so you can focus on coding. Enhanced user experience with generated HTTP requests  IntelliJ IDEA now opens HTTP requests generated from code in the right editor split, which means you no longer need to review them in a separate tab that was automatically opened. That’s it for now. Stay tuned for more updates coming soon! For a complete list of changes in this build, check out the release notes. Now is the perfect time to explore the new features and share your feedback before the final release. Try out the IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 Beta and let us know your thoughts in the comments or on X. If you run into any issues, please report them in our issue tracker. Happy developing! Subscribe to IntelliJ IDEA Blog updates Discover more",
