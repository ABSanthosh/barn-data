  "text": "The IDE that empowers PHP developers News ReleasesSupport for .env Files: Now Built into PhpStorm .env files are widely used to configure applications by storing configuration settings, environment variables, and sensitive information. This eliminates the need to hardcode these values into the application code. Previously, developers using PhpStorm had to manually install the .env Files Support plugin, originally created by Adel Faizrakhmanov, to unlock dedicated features for working with these files. Wanting to ensure that PhpStorm users have everything they need for web development already built into the IDE, we reached out to Adel about transferring ownership of his .env Files Support plugin to JetBrains for bundling – and he graciously supported this idea. Starting with PhpStorm 2024.3.2, this plugin is included out of the box, with JetBrains taking over its development while keeping it open source.  Download PhpStorm “I’m pleased that it has been bundled with the IDE. I hope JetBrains implements some features I didn’t have time to, like nested variables.” Adel Faizrakhmanov Software Developer What’s inside? Сode completion for the environment variable keys defined in the .env file, Dockerfile, or docker-compose.yml file. Syntax highlighting and validation inspections in .env files. Navigation between environment variable declarations and usages. You may also like Adel is widely known for the Laravel Idea plugin, which offers extensive support for Laravel development, including Laravel code generation, Eloquent completion, Laravel navigation, as well as autocompletion for Laravel routes, request fields, and validation rules. “.env Files Support was the first plugin I developed. Its sudden popularity inspired me to pay more attention to IntelliJ Platform plugin development, and now I’m working full time on Laravel Idea and other plugins.” Adel Faizrakhmanov Software Developer If you’re a Laravel developer and haven’t tried this plugin yet, give it a shot! Conclusion PhpStorm continues to refine and expand its features to support PHP developers better. By bundling .env file support into the core IDE, JetBrains has removed yet another barrier to productivity. If you haven’t updated PhpStorm yet, now’s the time to do it!  Download PhpStorm Subscribe to PhpStorm Blog updates Discover more",
