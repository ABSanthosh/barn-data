This year, they released N64: Recompiled, which is a tool to statically recompile N64 binaries into C code that can be compiled for any platform. The advance promises to usher in a revolution in N64 native ports for PC. To demonstrate the tool’s capability, it was used to produce a working copy of The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask on PC.
