  "description": "A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples. When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho. Websockets have replaced long polling. Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy). SQL is fast and the tools are much better. The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging. But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't. Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant.",
