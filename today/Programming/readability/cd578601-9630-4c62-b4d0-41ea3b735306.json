  "text": "IntelliJ IDEA – the IDE for Professional Development in Java and Kotlin LivestreamsNew Livestream – Gatherers: The API Your Stream Was Missing Join us for a new IntelliJ IDEA Livestream episode with José Paumard, where we’ll explore the Stream Gatherer API in JDK 24 and how to use it effectively in your applications. Date: March 13, 2025 Time: 3:00–4:00 pm UTC REGISTER FOR THE LIVESTREAM Session abstract JDK 24 is bringing a new enhancement to the Stream API, called the Stream Gatherer API. Stream Gatherers are a great addition to the Stream API, bringing new possibilities and helping to solve complex problems. This presentation shows you how Gatherers work on live examples, how you can create them, and what use cases they are most suitable for. Understanding Gatherers requires a good understanding of the Stream API. At the end of this presentation, you will be able to create your own Gatherers and understand when you should use them in your application. Asking questions José will try to answer all of your questions during the session. If we run out of time, we’ll publish answers to any remaining questions in a follow-up blog post. Your speaker and host Speaker José Paumard José works as Java Developer Advocate at Oracle and is a Java Champion alumni member and JavaOne Rockstar. He has a PhD in applied mathematics and computer science and was an assistant professor at the University Sorbonne Paris Nord for 25 years.
