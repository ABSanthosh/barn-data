  "text": "The Agile Alliance has officially joined the Project Management Institute (PMI), forming the PMI Agile Alliance as of December 31, 2024. The partnership aims to enhance global project management by integrating Agile principles with PMI's resources and reach. While many celebrate the expanded opportunities for collaboration, professional development, and innovation, critics express concerns about the potential dilution of Agile values and the loss of independence for Agile Alliance. According to the announcements, this partnership is expected to have a significant impact on the project management and Agile communities. It represents a step towards integrating traditional project management approaches with Agile methodologies, potentially reshaping how projects are managed and delivered across various industries.  There has been a lot of commentary in the agile community in particular; while some see this partnership as an opportunity for growth and integration in the project management field, others express concerns about the future direction of Agile practices and principles. The rationale for the partnership is presented as: Evolving Project Management Landscape: The partnership recognizes that modern project delivery requires fluency across various delivery practices Global Reach: PMI Agile Alliance will benefit from PMI's worldwide presence and resources Expanding Agile Influence: The collaboration aims to broaden the understanding of Agile and agility beyond the tech industry and software development Enhancing Project Success: By combining PMI's structured approach with Agile Alliance's adaptive principles, the partnership seeks to empower professionals to achieve greater project success Financial considerations are not mentioned in the press releases, but Mike Cohn, one of the original founders of the Agile Alliance, has stated that the decline in revenues from conferences post-COVID is considered a key factor.  According to Teresa Foster, Managing Director of the Agile Alliance, key aspects of the partnership are:  Agile Alliance will now operate as PMI Agile Alliance Teresa and her team will transfer to PMI PMI Agile Alliance will maintain its existing membership structure and elected Board The core mission, values, and principles of Agile Alliance will be preserved PMI members will gain enhanced access to expanded agile thought leadership, tools, and resources, enhancing their agile mindset. This partnership is expected to have a significant impact on the project management and Agile communities. It represents a step towards integrating traditional project management approaches with Agile methodologies, potentially reshaping how projects are managed and delivered across various industries.  Jim Highsmith, another of the Agile Manifesto signatories and a founder of the Agile Alliance, sees the partnership as a step towards Bridging the Divide: Integrating Agile and Project Management. Concerns raised about the partnership include:  Fear of Dilution: there is concern that the merger might dilute Agile principles or lead to a return to more traditional project management approaches   Loss of Independence: There are worries about the Agile Alliance losing its independent voice and becoming subsumed under PMI's structure. Relevance Concerns: Some argue that Agile Alliance was already struggling to remain relevant, and this move might not address underlying issues Cultural Clash: There's apprehension about potential conflicts between PMI's structured approach and Agile's adaptive principles According to Dave Westgarth, there is irony in Agilists reacting to the merger with the same fear and resistance that traditional project managers once showed towards Agile.
