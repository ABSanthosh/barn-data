If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves just one. This is not \"fancy law stuff\". This is \"4th grade civics stuff\" -- separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we don't teach civics enough in America...). It is actually *not* more complicated than that.
