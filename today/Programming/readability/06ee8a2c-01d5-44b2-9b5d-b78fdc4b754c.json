  "description": "Pete Warden, CEO of Useful Sensors and a founding member of the TensorFlow team at Google, discusses TinyML, the technology enabling machine learning on low-power, small-footprint devices. This innovation opens up applications such as voice-controlled devices, offline translation tools, and smarter embedded systems, which are crucial for privacy and efficiency. SE Radio host Kanchan Shringi speaks with Warden about challenges like model compression, deployment constraints, and privacy concerns. They also explore applications in agriculture, healthcare, and consumer electronics, and close with some practical advice from Pete for newcomers to TinyML development. Brought to you by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Software magazine.",
