A busy writer's guide to creating human knowledge after the introduction of functional AI? # I like that Michelle Obama spoke to men in her speech, but it could have been done in a way that enters the male brain easier. I know there shouldn't have to be an easy way in, because child-bearing isn't easy, but we need more men's votes to win this election. Pragmatically, bending over backwards, with love and acceptance, not blame and threats, makes it more likely they'll listen. All of us who need health care need to be heard and believed, and most important -- helped. Anyway, to the men reading this who are planning on voting for Trump, think about the women you care about, and how you would feel if they needed help to survive and because you voted for Trump, that help didn't arrive in time. Would you forgive yourself for voting not to restore equal care for women if it caused the death of a friend or family member you care about? It really is that serious. # I started to read Ben Thompson's email newsletter Stratechery this morning, it was about Trump on Joe Rogan's podcast, which I didn't want to listen to. I was surprised to see it begins with the story of podcasting, which has my name in it, which was gratifying. A lot of people will read that. I'm including a screen shot of the beginning because his newsletter is not something you can read without a subscription]. As with John Naughton, we disagree when podcasting got its name, I say it was in Sept 2004, they repeat the mistake on the Wikipedia site that says it was coined earlier by a columnist for the Guardian. I'd like to get this right someday. Podcasting was a four year slog with lots of trial and error, and passionate belief that it would eventually catch on, and hard work. This is the power of journalism, not only can they ignore our work, but when it's successful they can give themselves credit. (BTW, the enclosure element was part of RSS 2.0 in 2002, not 2003.)#",
