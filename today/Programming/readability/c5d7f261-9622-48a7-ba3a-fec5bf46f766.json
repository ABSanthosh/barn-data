The Carbon Engine is a tool developed internally at video game publisher and distributor Limited Run Games. It allows a variety of emulators to interface with modern video game hardware, and it supports emulation of SNES, Genesis, PlayStation, Gameboy Advance, and other consoles. Dimitris Giannakis is the Lead Developer of the Carbon Engine. He is known for his many contributions in the hacking, emulation, and game development space, and for his highly popular YouTube channel, Modern Vintage Gamer, or MVG. Dimitris joins the podcast with Joe Nash to talk how he got started in game development, building emulators from scratch, scoping an emulation project, homebrew vs. official SDKs, the Carbon Engine, and more. Joe Nash is a developer, educator, and award-winning community builder, who has worked at companies including GitHub, Twilio, Unity, and PayPal. Joe got his start in software development by creating mods and running servers for Garry’s Mod, and game development remains his favorite way to experience and explore new technologies and concepts.",
