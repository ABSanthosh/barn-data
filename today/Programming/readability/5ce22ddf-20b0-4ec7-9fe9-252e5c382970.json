  "text": "AWS recently announced a new integration between AWS Amplify Hosting and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), enabling users to deploy static websites from S3 quickly. This integration streamlines the hosting process, allowing developers to deploy static sites stored in S3 and deliver content over AWS's global content delivery network (CDN) with just a few clicks according to the company. AWS Amplify Hosting, a fully managed hosting solution for static sites, now offers users an efficient method to publish websites using S3. The integration leverages Amazon CloudFront as the underlying CDN to provide fast, reliable access to website content worldwide. Amplify Hosting handles custom domain setup, SSL configuration, URL redirects, and deployment through a globally available CDN, ensuring optimal performance and security for hosted sites. Setting up a static website using this new integration begins with an S3 bucket. Users can configure their S3 bucket to store website content, then link it with Amplify Hosting through the S3 console. From there, a new \"Create Amplify app\" option in the Static Website Hosting section guides users directly to Amplify, where they can configure app details like the application name and branch name. Once saved, Amplify instantly deploys the site, making it accessible on the web in seconds. Subsequent updates to the site content in S3 can be quickly published by selecting the \"Deploy updates\" button in the Amplify console, keeping the process seamless and efficient. (Source: AWS News blog post) This integration benefits developers by simplifying deployments, enabling rapid updates, and eliminating the need for complex configuration. For developers looking for programmatic deployment, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) offers an alternative way to deploy updates by specifying parameters like APP_ID and BRANCH_NAME. Alternatively, according to the respondent on a Reddit thread, users could opt for Cloudflare: If your webpage is static, you might consider using Cloudflare - it would probably be cheaper than the AWS solution. Or using S3 and GitLab CI, according to a tweet by DrInTech: Hello everyone! I just completed a project to host a static portfolio website, leveraging a highly accessible and secure architecture. And the best part? It costs only about $0.014 per month! Lastly, Amplify Hosting integration with Amazon S3 is available in AWS Regions where Amplify Hosting is available and pricing details for S3 and hosting on the respective pricing pages.
