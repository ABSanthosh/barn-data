  "text": "QCon AI New York (December 16-17, 2025), from the team behind InfoQ and QCon, has announced its Program Committee to shape talks focused on practical AI implementation for senior software engineering teams. The committee comprises senior practitioners with extensive experience in scaling AI in enterprise environments. The 2025 Program Committee includes: Adi Polak – director of advocacy and developer experience engineering at Confluent, and author on scaling machine learning. Adi brings expertise in data-intensive AI applications and the infrastructure challenges of production ML systems. Randy Shoup – SVP of engineering at Thrive Market, with previous leadership roles at eBay, Google, and Stitch Fix. Shoup's background in building scalable, resilient systems will inform content on enterprise-grade AI architecture. Jake Mannix – technical fellow for AI \u0026 relevance at Walmart Global Tech, with experience at LinkedIn and Twitter. Mannix contributes expertise in applying AI at scale within large enterprise contexts. Wes Reisz – QCon AI New York 2025 chair, technical principal at Equal Experts, and 16-time QCon chair. QCon AI will focus on practical strategies for software engineers and teams looking to implement and scale artificial intelligence within enterprise environments. Many teams are challenged by transitioning AI from promising proof-of-concepts (PoCs) to robust, value-driving production systems. QCon AI is specifically designed to help senior software engineers, architects, and team leaders navigate these issues and scale artificial intelligence within enterprise environments. The conference program will feature practitioner-led strategies and case studies from companies successfully scaling AI, with sessions covering: Strategic AI integration using proven architectural patterns Building production-grade enterprise AI systems for scale and resilience Connecting Dev, MLOps, Platform, and Data practices to accelerate team velocity Navigating compliance, security, cost, and technical debt constraints in AI projects Using AI for design, validation, and strategic decision-making Showing clear business impact and return on investment from AI initiatives \"QCon AI is specifically designed to help software engineers navigate these issues in AI adoption and integration, focusing on the applied use of AI in delivering software to production.\" Reisz explained. \"The goal is to help teams not only embrace these changes but ship better software.\" Early bird registration is available.
