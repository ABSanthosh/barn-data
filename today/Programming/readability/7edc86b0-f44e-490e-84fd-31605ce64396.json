  "text": "GitHub knows that it‚Äôs critical for students to be able to easily learn new skills, test out new workflows, and gain credentials. But students often have to do so on a limited budget while they focus on their studies. That‚Äôs why we launched the Student Developer Pack 10 years ago to make sure that the world‚Äôs future developers could collaborate, experiment and meaningfully utilize industry standard products and tools offered by GitHub and our education partners. Today we are adding to that growing list of offers with the GitHub Foundations certification exam at no cost to all verified students! Now students will have the opportunity to test out their acumen on using GitHub for version control, collaboration, workflow automation and GitHub‚Äôs core features, with a credential to back it up. GitHub Foundations Certification The GitHub Foundations certification program is designed to introduce learners new to the GitHub platform fundamental concepts and products of GitHub. You will learn how to use git and explore some of GitHub‚Äôs core features, such as repository management, commits, branching, merging, and project management. You will also discover how to contribute to open source projects on GitHub and effectively use markdown. You can check out the full curriculum here to explore more topics covered in this pathway. If you‚Äôre a student or have one in your life, here‚Äôs how you get started. Step 1: Get Verified If you‚Äôre a student aged 13+ and enrolled in a degree or diploma-granting course of study, the GitHub Student Developer Pack is for you. üëç Get verified as a student on GitHub by going here to fill out an application. When you apply, you will need to demonstrate current enrollment. The application process is individually tailored and the application interface and emails will guide you on the best next steps toward approval. For more information about the application process and how to move through the application, visit our FAQ‚Äôs. Step 2: Prepare for your exam The GitHub Foundations exam focuses on the foundational topics and concepts of collaborating, contributing, and working on GitHub. This exam covers collaboration, GitHub products, Git basics, and working within GitHub repositories. If you‚Äôd like to review these topics before taking the exam, head over to the GitHub Foundations Experience where we‚Äôve gathered resources like study guides, prep courses, FAQs and more to help you get started.

There‚Äôs no need to schedule a specific time or use video recording software during the exam. The non-proctored exam is available 24/7, allowing you to take it whenever it is most convenient for you. You will have 60 days to take the exam after registering.
