  "text": "DevEco News As the year winds down, we’re taking a moment to reflect on what shaped the developer landscape in 2024. Drawing insights from over 23,000 developers worldwide, this year’s JetBrains State of Developer Ecosystem highlights significant trends shaping the development world. The prominence of AI in software is growing, with four out of five companies embracing third-party AI tools in their development workflows and 18% of developers incorporating AI capabilities into their products. TypeScript, Rust, and Python are on the rise, according to the newly introduced JetBrains Language Promise Index, with Python dominating AI and ML fields but plenty of other languages remaining lucrative. Read about these and other key findings touching on topics like developer experience, emerging technologies, and more. Artificial intelligence: The new normal in software development AI continues to dominate discussions in tech, and for good reason. Our survey reveals just how deeply it has permeated the developer workflow: Policy shifts around AI: Nearly 80% of companies either allow third-party AI tools or have no formal restrictions, signaling a growing comfort with AI integration. AI-enhanced software: 18% of developers are already integrating AI capabilities into their products, showcasing its steady infiltration into the apps we all use. The JetBrains Language Promise Index For the first time, we’re introducing the JetBrains Language Promise Index, which ranks languages based on growth, stability, and adoption willingness. The inaugural results spotlight three standout performers: TypeScript, Rust, and Python are the clear leaders, reflecting their versatility and appeal across domains. Python dominates in AI and ML: Its long-standing popularity continues in data-intensive fields. C++ in AI: Surprisingly, a significant number of C++ developers report active involvement in AI and ML projects, highlighting its relevance in performance-critical applications. Developer experience, emerging tech, and most lucrative languages This year, we also explored topics gaining more and more traction in the community, such as developer experience (DX) and technologies like virtual reality (VR): DX on the rise: With its close ties to software delivery effectiveness, DX is becoming a focal point in the industry. VR in coding: 8% of developers have experimented with coding in VR, and nearly 50% are eager to give it a try. Highest-paying programming languages: Developers working with Scala, Go, Kotlin, and Rust top the earnings charts, followed by C++, Shell, Java, and Python. Desktop development prevails: Contrary to popular belief, desktop development is more widespread than mobile development. Why this report matters For the past eight years, the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report has offered a unique lens into the tech industry’s evolution, helping developers and organizations alike navigate its complexities. This year, we’ve expanded our focus to include emerging trends like AI integration, DX, and salary insights, offering a comprehensive snapshot of the development world in 2024.
