We investigated and fixed the vulnerabilities they reported and thanked them with cash rewards. Before 2014, and concurrently with the private bounty program, we ran a public “Hall of Fame” program where we accepted vulnerability reports via email and thanked reporters with credit on our website. Since the day we launched it, we’ve aimed to take the security bug bounty program public—to allow anyone, not just a few invited hackers, to report vulnerabilities to us for a cash reward. We want to find and fix as many vulnerabilities in our products as possible, to protect our customers and the data they entrust to us. We also want to learn from and support the broader security community. We’re happy to announce that we’re doing that today. The Basecamp security bug bounty program is now open to the public on HackerOne. Our security team is ready to take vulnerability reports for Basecamp 3 and HEY. Bounties range from $100 to $10,000. We pay more for more severe vulnerabilities, more creative exploits, and more insightful reports. Here are some of the high-criticality reports we’ve fielded via the security bug bounty: Jouko Pynnönen reported a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in HEY that lead to account takeover via email. We awarded $5,000 for this report.Hazim Aslam reported HTTP desynchronization vulnerabilities in our on-premises applications that allowed an attacker to intercept customer requests. We awarded  $11,437 in total for these reports.hudmi reported that the AppCache web API (since deprecated and removed from web browsers) could be used to capture direct upload requests in Basecamp 3. We awarded $1,000.gammarex reported an ImageMagick misconfiguration that allowed remote code execution on Basecamp 3’s servers. We awarded $5,000. Check out the full program policy on HackerOne. For information on what to expect when you report a vulnerability, see our security response policy. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to [email protected].",
