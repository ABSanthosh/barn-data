  "description": "Joseph Finney is a mechanical engineer by day and a software developer by night. He talks to Scott about how being an indie developer has improved his life, taught him a ton, in how he put applications in the Apple App store, the Google play store, and the Microsoft store. Some of the apps are big and complicated come up and some of the apps are applets, but all of them serve a purpose and solve a specific problem. Joeseph lives experimenting with different ways to solve common problems and have a passion for designing software which makes computers more natural to use.https://joefinapps.com",
