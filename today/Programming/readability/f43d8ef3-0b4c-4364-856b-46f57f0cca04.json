This version also introduces visual and performance enhancements to the Project tool window’s Logical view, several useful improvements to the UI, and numerous platform updates. DOWNLOAD MPS 2025.1 What’s new Let’s check out all the new features waiting for you in the latest release. Project view performance As a result of fixing MPS-38299 and MPS-37938, navigation in the logical project view has been substantially improved. Optionally create languages without a generator The New Project wizard now allows users to create a language without an empty generator. This covers the cases where a generator will not be needed in the project and prevents users from needing to manually delete the generator. Enhanced transactional property cell The CellModel_TransactionalProperty editor cell now supports the same properties as ordinary CellModel_Property cells, like readOnly and empty text, which encourages broader usage of the transactional property cell. Build language as generation target Based on a request from one of our users, we smoothed the build language so that it can now be used as a target for generation. This opens the possibility for anyone to extend the build language in MPS or to create alternatives. A simple test language has been provided as an example to provide guidelines.
