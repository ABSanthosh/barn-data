  "text": "The Summer I Turned Pretty will end… this summer. The third and final, 11-episode season of Prime Video‘s YA series will premiere Wednesday, July 16. (A specific release pattern was not made immediately available, because that’d be too easy.) A farewell poster (below) has also been released, and on Wednesday, the streamer unveiled a new trailer for the final episodes, which continues the show’s tradition of using Taylor Swift songs to illustrate the Conrad/Belly/Jeremiah love triangle. This time, it’s “Daylight” and “Red (Taylor’s Version).” You can watch it above. The series, based on creator/showrunner Jenny Han’s book trilogy, revolves around the love triangle between 16-year-old Isabel “Belly” Conklin (played by Lola Tung) and the Fisher brothers, broody Conrad (Christopher Briney) and easygoing Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), with whom Belly has grown up. The upcoming season will chronicle the events of Han’s third (and final) book, We’ll Always Have Summer. In the Season 2 finale, which dropped August 18, 2023, Belly released Conrad from her heart and began a relationship with Jeremiah. Reflecting on Belly decision, star Lola Tung told TVLine, “I think that her choice made sense for her in the moment. She’s been through a lot with both of them, and I think she’s realized that, at that time, Conrad has not shown her that he will ever be willing to fight for that relationship as much as she will. “Here’s Jeremiah, ready to fight for her, continuing to fight for her, just proving, I think, constantly how much he loves her and cares about her, even in watching her be with Conrad for so long,” Tung continued, adding that Jeremiah “is the person that she is falling in love with” at the moment. In Season 3, “it’s the end of her junior year of college, and Belly’s looking forward to another summer in Cousins with her soulmate, Jeremiah,” reads the official synopsis. “Her future seems set, until some core-shaking events bring her first love Conrad back into her life. Now on the brink of adulthood, Belly finds herself at a crossroads and must decide which brother has her heart. Summer will never be the same…” As for whether fans can expect the final season to follow the last book and end with [spoiler], “there are going to be surprises,” Han told Entertainment Weekly. “There are the things that they know and then there are things they think they know, and then there’s going to be, hopefully, things that surprise them.” The 20 Best Teen TV Dramas of All Time",
