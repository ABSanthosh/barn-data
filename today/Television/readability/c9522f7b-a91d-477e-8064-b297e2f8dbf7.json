  "text": "One of our favorite TV imports is coming back. (Tariff-free! We think.) Paramount+ has renewed the Australian rom-com Colin From Accounts for a third season, TVLine has learned. Patrick Brammall and Harriet Dyer will return to write, executive-produce and star in the new season. Brammall and Dyer star as Gordon and Ashley, who find a romantic spark while they care for an injured dog they name Colin (From Accounts). Emma Harvie co-stars as Ashley’s friend Megan, with Genevieve Hegney and Michael Logo as Gordon’s co-workers Chiara and Brett, and Helen Thomson as Ashley’s ridiculously nosy mother Lynelle. (Read here why we think Colin is worth watching.) Season 2, which debuted in September, ended on a cliffhanger, with Gordon impulsively proposing to Ashley at Megan’s wedding — and Ashley turning him down flat. “We’re VERY excited to bring you Season 3 of our show,” Brammall and Dyer said in a statement. “To be honest, with the way we ended Season 2, it would have been weird not to make a third, so here we are. We promise we won’t leave you hanging like that again. Probably.” Happy to hear Colin is coming back? What are you hoping to see in Season 3?
