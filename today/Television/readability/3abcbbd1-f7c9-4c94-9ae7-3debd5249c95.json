  "text": "Just six episodes into its freshman run, St. Denis Medical‘s strong vital signs earned it a quick Season 2 renewal. But before the NBC comedy’s hospital staff can make it to a completely new season, they’ll have to survive a finale that, as star Allison Tolman puts it, sends things “off the rails” at the titular medical center. “The finale of this season is the most ‘oh no’ [that nurse Alex feels],” Tolman recently told TVLine at the SCAD TVfest in Atlanta. “And it’s warranted. A lot of times, when Alex is worked up about something, it’s like, ‘Girl, calm down.’ But in the finale, things really have gone off the rails, and her high alert is warranted.” Tolman, whose full interview with us can be viewed in the video above, couldn’t share much more about what transpires at the end of Season 1. We suspect, though, that the hospital’s financial situation — a season-long issue for the underfunded St. Denis — might play a significant role as the inaugural season winds down, as co-showrunner Eric Ledgin hinted. “It’s not that they’re about to go under. It’s more that they can’t have any nice things,” Ledgin tells us. “They never have enough to go any further, and Joyce’s hope is so far outsized compared to what they actually have. That’s a tension we play with a lot in the first season, and all I’ll say is we won’t necessarily be playing that same tension in the second season.” And while we’re on the subject of tension: There’s been a little of that — of the will-they-won’t-they variety, to be more specific — between nurses Serena and Matt, no? “There’s a long way to go, in Season 1, even,” admitted Kahyun Kim, who plays Serena on the sitcom, adding that more “complex feelings” are in store for the colleagues as Season 1 continues. Ledgin was ever-so-slightly more forthcoming about the Serena-Matt situation, promising that “something will happen” between the pair in upcoming episodes. “There will be movement. There won’t be nothing,” Ledgin teased, before adding with a laugh, “Is that vague enough?” St. Denis Medical airs Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC.",
