  "text": "Daredevil: Born Again is the latest streaming series to aim for yearly releases. Season 1 of the Disney+/Marvel Television series debuted on March 4 of this year, and drew to a “very, very, very violent” close this past Tuesday night. (Read our full recap.) Timed to the Season 1 finale, showrunner Dario Scardapane shared on Instagram his appreciation for the “cast, crew and studio for their confidence and indulgence,” before announcing: “Season 2 March 2026.” A March 2026 release date (and thus April finale) for Season 2 would help the New York City-based MCU series dodge potential continuity conflicts with Spider-Man: Brand New Day, which will again star Tom Holland as the MCU’s webslinger and is due out July 31, 2026. After all, Daredevil: Born Again — SPOILER ALERT! — ended its first, nine-episode season with Mayor Wilson Fisk (played by franchise vet Vincent D’Onofrio) announced to the city his Safer Streets plan, which involves an 8 pm curfew, zero tolerance for vigilantes, and the declaration of martial law. If Born Again Season 2 were to come out after Spider-Man: Brand New Day, it’d run the risk of feeling incongruous if its mild-mannered Peter Parker is fwipping! his way through a regular ol’ New York City, while the metropolis last seen on TV was being patrolled by AVTF grunts, under martial law. But if Born Again sticks to its March 2026 plan, Season 2 could continue and eventually put to bed Fisk’s grand plan, restoring the Big Apple to its Peter Tingle-friendly shine. However it shakes out, it doesn’t sound like Mayor Fisk will govern Peter Parker’s city — even though Daredevil: Born Again headliner Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock once helped Holland’s hero with a legal matter, in Spider-Man: No Way Home. As D’Onofrio recently claimed during a podcast hit, Daredevil’s Literally Big Bad cannot easily be featured in film projects. “It’s a very hard thing to do, for Marvel to use my character” wherever it wants, “because of ownership and stuff,” he said. Specifically, “Right now, I’m only usable for television series,” he added. Meaning, “Not even a one-off Fisk movie” would be possible, “or anything like that. It’s all caught up in rights and stuff.” And there is no indication that said rights issues will ever be untangled. “I don’t know when that would work out, or if it ever would work out at all,” D’Onofrio said.
