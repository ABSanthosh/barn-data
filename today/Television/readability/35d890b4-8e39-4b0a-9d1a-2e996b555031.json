  "text": "“You know, your luck’s gonna run out one day,” Outer Banks‘ Kiara tells JJ in the Season 4 finale. And by the end of the episode, it has. The most impulsive Pogue meets his end in Episode 10 at the hands of his biological father, Chandler Groff. But let’s back up a little bit and recap how JJ’s tragic outcome came about, shall we? At the start of the supersized episode, JJ reassures Kiara that although he’s had “a bit of a wobble” in the last few days, he’s fully back. And that’s good, because the group has to walk to Essaouira, Morocco, in order to figure out their next moves. They have low points (Sarah’s pregnancy-induced nausea leads to an ill-fated trip to steal food) and high ones (Cleo boost some clothes off a line, which helps the kids blend in a little better). They end up getting split up from Rafe, who buys a cell phone and a knife and then tracks Groff to his hotel. After a lot of beating-up and escaping from Dahlia’s gang, they’re on the road to the Blue Crown together. But Rafe dumps Groff — into a well — and leaves him there, going on to pursue the treasure solo. Eventually the Pogues come across Groff in the well; he plays on JJ’s sympathies and asks to be let out. JJ tells him he’s never been a father in any sense of the word, then tosses him some water and leaves him there to rot. However! Groff climbs his way out of the pit and hitches a ride on a passing truck, which will prove important later. The Pogues arrive at the area where the Blue Crown allegedly is hidden; Dahlia and her men get there around the same time. Cleo gets shot (in the arm), a sandstorm pops up, and the resulting chaos means there’s only one person who’s got the agility and insanity to climb to the top of a towering monument and grab for the crown: JJ. And he finds it! When he’s back on the ground, he whoops and hugs Kiara. “We’re getting back our home!” he shouts. Not so soon. As Kie and JJ look for the others, they run into Groff, who grabs Kiara and holds his knife to her throat. He demands the crown, which JJ easily trades for his girlfriend’s safety. “I have everything I ever wanted, things that you’ll never have,” JJ tells his piece-o’-garbage biodad, hugging a shaken Kiara while Groff salivates over his latest possession. Then Groff steps in close to JJ, says “It’s a shame, you and me. You should’ve given me the rope” to get out of the well… and then stabs JJ in the gut. Groff runs away. JJ bleeds copiously and falls into Kiara’s arms. He knows he’s going. She knows he’s going. It’s awful. “Take care of the others, OK?” he says as she cries and tries to stanch the bleeding. “I love you, Kie.” She replies that she loves him, too, and then he’s gone. Later, as the emotionally wrecked Pogues sit around a fire, Rafe reminds them that Groff is likely headed for Lisbon, and that they should go after the man who killed their friend. “He’s not wrong,” Kiara says. They discuss what JJ would do if the same thing had happened to any of them. “We all know what JJ would do: He’d get even,” John B. says. “Revenge,” Kiara agrees, her furious face the last thing we see before the screen goes to black. Now it’s your turn. What did you think of the episode? How about the season as a whole? Sound off in the comments!",
