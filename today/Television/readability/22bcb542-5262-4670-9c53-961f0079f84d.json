  "text": "This time, Johnny Knoxville can leave the stunts to somebody else: The Jackass star is set to host Fox‘s upcoming revival of Fear Factor, which is set to premiere in the 2025-2026 season. “Johnny Knoxville is the champion of fearless entertainment,” president of Fox Television Network Michael Thorn said in a statement. “His wild sense of humor, unmatched ability to push boundaries and take on the extreme makes him the perfect fit to lead this bold new reinvention of Fear Factor.“ Officially titled Fear Factor: The Next Chapter, the stunt-based game show will take place in “an unforgiving, remote location,” where “a group of strangers will live together under one roof and face mind-blowing stunts, harrowing challenges and a twisted game of social strategy where trust is fleeting — and fear is a weapon,” reads its official description. “Only one contestant will conquer all their fears and walk away with the massive grand prize.” Knoxville is an actor and filmmaker best known for starring in and producing the Jackass TV series and the franchise’s subsequent films. He was most recently seen in Apple TV+’s comedy The Studio (created by Seth Rogan) and Samir Oliveros’ The Luckiest Man In America. His other TV credits include ABC’s The Prank Panel, Hulu’s Reboot, History of the World: Part Two, Agent Elvis and Ridiculousness. The original Fear Factor was hosted by Joe Rogan and aired from 2001 to 2006 on NBC. It was later revived by the same network in 2011, and again in 2017 by MTV. What do you think of Knoxville as the new host of Fear Factor? And will you be watching? Let us know in the comments!",
