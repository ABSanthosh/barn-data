Yes, the long-running series will return for a 12th season, but it will do so without Tom Sandoval, Ariana Madix, Tom Schwartz, Katie Maloney, and DJ James Kennedy. According to a press release issued today, the series will attempt a hard reset with a brand-new cast. (Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images) The boss herself commented on the news this afternoon. “The last 12 years of filming have been an extraordinary run full of laughter, tears, and everything in between,” said Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum and VPR namesake Lisa Vanderpump. “I can’t thank enough those who have shared their lives. How I love you all,” she continued. “In the restaurant business, one shift always gives way to another. Cheers to the next generation of ‘Vanderpump Rules.’” The newcomers are described as a group of “close-knit SUR-vers who are as complicatedly involved with one another as their iconic predecessors.” (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) “What a thrill it is to build on the legacy of this series by doing it all over again,” added executive producer Alex Baskin. “With profound appreciation for the original group and their iconic run, we can’t wait for the audience to see a dynamic new group of co-workers and friends make their way through life together.” The news is likely to be met with a mixed reaction from the Vanderpump faithful. After years of stagnation, the show saw an unexpected resurgence in popularity in its tenth season after the world learned that series regular Tom Sandoval had cheated on longtime girlfriend Ariana Madix. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Unfortunately, the show proved unable to capitalize on that success in the short term. Vanderpump Rules Season 11 saw declining ratings throughout, as producers continued to return to the well of the “Scandoval.” Eventually, that particular drama dried up, and viewers lost interest. The cast seems to have taken the news in stride, with Lala Kent posting a sentimental Instagram carousel in which she congratulated herself on “rocking this bitch until the wheels fell off.” (Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for Brent Shapiro Foundation) Maloney, for her part, said on her Instagram Story that she “wouldn’t change a thing” after the “mixed bag” experience. Kent and Scheana Shay have both made appearances on the VPR spinoff The Valley, but it’s unclear if they intend to join that cast full-time in light of today’s news. As for Vanderpump Rules, well, over the years, the show has made several attempts to add new cast members, and most of them have been unsuccessful. In the past, the show has been one of the most successful in Bravo’s extensive roster, so you can bet that Andy Cohen and company are hoping it can return to its former glory. Frankly, we have our doubts. Over to you, TV fanatics! Are you interested in a Vanderpump reboot, or is it time to put this show out to pasture? Hit the comments section below to share your thoughts!
