  "text": "Drama erupted inside the Big Brother house this week and while we’re certainly living for it, our boy Jimmy most definitely is not. Two powers were activated this week causing HOH Jimmy to nominate a fourth and fifth houseguest for eviction. After BB20 winner Kaycee Clark was called in to compete in the veto comp, winning safety for Keanu, Kelley then used her power in order to secure herself the week’s second veto. When all of the dust settled, original nominee Adrian was joined by new noms Amy and Will. So who won the BB Blockbuster and who was evicted from the house? Let’s break down the night’s events, shall we? THE STRATEGY | While Jimmy has solid allies in the house, everyone seems to agree that putting Will on the block was (and I’m quoting) a “bitch-ass move.” (I mean, the guy’s HOH has been all mess.) The Burger Boys know they must keep Adrian, but Rachel is looking to protect her ally, Amy. Two of the younger 20-somethings who are apparently named :::checks notes::: Lauren and Katherine want Amy gone, mostly because that would be an indirect shot at Rachel. Vince and Kelley don’t disagree. Morgan and Mickey (who, to me, are one of the more interesting duos in the house, especially if you’ve been following their live feed strategy sessions), want to keep Will in the house in order to pull him closer. Rachel goes to bat for Amy, telling everyone that Adrian will give them all a run for their money in future comps and votes. Then, the BB13 winner does what she does best: Intimidate the newbies. Or at least Morgan, who really, really doesn’t want to anger the self-imposed BB queen. But it’s aaaall going to come down to the BB Blockbuster. THE BLOCKBUSTER | In the “Puzzling Prints” comp, the nominees must complete a puzzle of a fingerprint. Adrian throws a bulk of his pieces right onto his board and makes quick work of the border. From there, the San Antonio carpenter is just too speedy to catch. Adrian finishes his puzzle and smashes his buzzer, thereby officially saving himself from the block. THE VOTE | Without sparing a single moment, the color-coordinated cast learns they’ll be deciding between Amy and Will. But as the camera zooms in close on Amy and Rachel’s loooong hug, it seems the women already know which way the cookie’s gonna crumble. And when the votes come in, even Rachel votes out her bestie, and Amy is evicted 13-0. On her way out the door, she yells to her fellow houseguests, “Get Jimmy out! He’s a snake and a liar!” Did the right person go home? Who were you rooting for? Light up the comments with your thoughts!",
