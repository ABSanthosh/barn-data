  "text": "The long-gestating Legally Blonde prequel series has found its lead, and we’re very impressed. Far too often, casting goes awry with offshoots of beloved franchises, but you can tell that Reese Witherspoon and execs went to the ends of the earth to find the right fit. Reese took to Instagram to share a video introducing us to Lexi Minetree. (MGM/Screenshot) “After watching so many incredible auditions for the new Elle prequel series on Prime Video, we finally found our Elle,” Reese said. “And today, I got to break the news myself! Meet Lexi Minetree,” she continued. The video is cute, showcasing the two women in a warm embrace. Check it out below. It must be difficult for Reese to pass the mantle of Elle over to a new person. But since she went out of her way to ensure the casting was right, we believe this will be a rare spinoff done right. Production Can Commence Now Elle Has Been Cast Details about the project have largely been shrouded in secrecy, but Lexi has racked up quite the small screen resume and is very reminiscent of the Elle Reese played for two movies. Lexi has had appearances on Law \u0026 Order: Special Victims Unit and The Murdaugh Murders, among other things, so she’s no stranger to the small screen. (MGM/Screenshot) Prime Video confirmed Elle had snagged a series order in May 2024, and it’s been relatively quiet since so many observers likely believed the show would not come to pass. Sometimes, new entries in beloved franchises are announced, and everything goes quiet because the creatives or network no longer believe the project will be worthy of the brand name. Thankfully, viewers will experience Elle’s younger years, which is a worthy next step. Legally Blonde strutted into theaters in 2001 and became a cultural phenomenon. A sequel, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White \u0026 Blonde, followed in 2003. (MGM/Screenshot) Despite over twenty years of hope for a third movie, the franchise seemed to continue as a series of musicals. However, things changed in 2020 when the writers for a movie were announced, and the project seems to be moving along despite the series also happening. A Legally Blonde Sequel and Prequel Sounds About Right There’s room in this world for a sequel and a prequel, and given that people are still clamoring for more, there’s probably a lot of life in this franchise. Reese is an executive producer on the series, which means she’ll have input on many aspects, which is a big win. (MGM/Screenshot) Although Elle’s premiere date has not been announced, if the cameras are rolling, we’d guess it will be sometime in 2026. What are your thoughts on the casting news? Are you digging the resemblance? Hit the comments below.",
