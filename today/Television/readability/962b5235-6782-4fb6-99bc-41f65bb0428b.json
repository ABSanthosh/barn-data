  "text": "Superman \u0026 Lois reunited viewers with three familiar faces on Monday, including someone we didn’t think we’d be seeing for quite some time. With General Lane’s super-powered ticker now inside of him, Clark made his triumphant return to the land of the living, giving us one of the series’ most beautiful moments to date. We wish we could bottle up the joyous feeling of that group hug between Lois, Clark, Jordan and Jonathan. We’d drink it. We’d shower with it. We’d wear it in a vial around our necks like Angelina and Billy Bob. You get the idea. It was that good. Unfortunately, Clark quickly discovered that his 60-year-old human heart isn’t quite as strong as his original Kryptonian model, a lesson he learned the hard way during an ill-fated flying lesson with Jonathan. His attempt to hide this from Lois for about five minutes, but she was too busy with wedding planning to do much about it That brings us to our next set of reunions: Kyle and Chrissy are back! And just like everything else about that relationship, their wedding day didn’t go even remotely according to plan. A visit from her intimidating mother-in-law? Check. Losing their venue at the last minute, forcing Lois to volunteer the farm? Double check. Them deciding to slow things down and cancel the ceremony, but still throw the best party that Smallville’s seen in years? Triple check. But even though vows weren’t officially swapped, we aren’t worried about the future of the Cushing-Beppo crew. There’s a lot of love in that blended family, glimpses of which we saw multiple times during the episode, especially when Chrissy turned to Sarah for support mid-panic. The feel-good hour ended with Lois and Clark enjoying some long-overdue alone time, blissfully unaware of the “Superman Lives!” news alerts popping up on their phones. (You know, it’s too bad Lois didn’t wait a beat before publishing her “Death of Superman” article. She could have saved the Smallville Gazette one heck of a retraction.) OK, party people, let’s talk: Did you enjoy Kyle and Chrissy’s non-wedding? Did you also tear up when Clark reunited with Lois and the boys? And can you believe we only have six episodes of this show left?! Drop your thoughts in a comment below.",
