If you want to get the most bang for you buck, you can sign up for BET Plus for 50% off through Prime Video. Here’s everything you need to know for claiming the limited-time deal. Courtesy of BET+Get BET Plus on Prime VideoOn Sale 50% off Get BET Plus for $5.49/Month on Prime Video The best deal for streaming BET Plus is Amazon‘s $5.49/month offer from Prime Video. This deal is good until Wednesday, Oct. 16 — so you’ll want to act fast. The streamer is offering a similar deal directly on its website, but we recommend signing up through Prime Video so you can bundle multiple streamers in one place, making navigating between each easy and intuitive. The Prime Video deal is the best way to watch BET Plus for free-ish since you can watch three full months for just $5.49/month, after which your plan will automatically renew at its regular $10.99/month price. You can, however, cancel before the third billing cycle to avoid paying full price. Keep in mind, the BET Plus channel price is added to your $14.99/month Prime membership — sign up below! How to Sign Up for BET Plus on Prime Video If you decide to capitalize on the limited-time deal, Prime Video subscribers can easily add BET Plus by visiting the streamer’s Amazon page. If you don’t yet have a Prime Video account, you’ll need to sign up for the service which costs $14.99/month. Here are step-by-step instructions for signing up for Prime Video with the BET Plus add-on: Go to the Prime Video + BET Plus page Click “Get Started” Enter payment information Start streaming BET Plus on Prime Video! Does BET Plus Have a Free Trial? There is typically a seven-day BET Plus free trial when you sign up for a new subscription, but that offer looks to be on hold while the aforementioned deal is active. So, the sweetest deal going on now is the Amazon Prime Video limited-time offer that gets you three months of BET Plus for 50% off. And keep in mind, you can cancel any time to avoid being billed the regular price of $10.99/month. With this current deal, we recommend forgoing the BET Plus free trial for now. What to Watch on BET Plus BET Plus offers a library of original content including All the Queen’s Men, The Black Hamptons, Caught Up, Kingdom Business, The Ms. Pat Show, Zatima and more. You can also stream tons of Tyler Perry titles including Assisted Living, House of Payne and Sistas. For just $2/month, there’s plenty to enjoy on the platform. (If you sign up for a service through our links, TVLine may earn a commission.)",
