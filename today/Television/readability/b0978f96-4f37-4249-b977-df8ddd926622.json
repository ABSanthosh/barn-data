  "text": "Chelsie, Makensy, Cam and Rubina have survived Ainsley’s antics, the junk food binge that was Jankie World, and countless weepy Angela monologues — and yet, one of them has still fallen short of the Big Brother 26 finale. The CBS reality competition is winding down its current season, but one last (and pivotal!) eviction episode remained on Thursday night, which revealed the three houseguests that will head to Sunday’s big conclusion. But first… filler! Lots and lots of filler. Filler in the form of the final Power of Veto competition, which Makensy won over Cam. Filler in the form of a trip to the jury house, where Kimo narrated his downfall, and the jurors enjoyed seeing themselves become BB Comics. Filler in the form of Season 25 winner Jag Bains, who returned to give us his thoughts on the season so far. In his opinion, Makensy’s choice to nominate Leah was the worst move of the season (fair!), while Chelsie is his pick to win it all, provided the jury isn’t too bitter to award her the victory. (Also fair!) Big Brother: All 26 Seasons, Ranked Then, after we were subjected to footage of Cam’s sandwich-making attempt, it was time to get down to business. With Makensy having won the Power of Veto, it was a no-brainer that she’d take herself off the block, making her the sole vote to evict either Cam or replacement nominee Rubina. Both nominees pleaded their case to Makensy, and, to no one’s surprise, they both promised to take her to the Final Two if they should win the last Head of Household competition. And though it would have been a fun twist for Makensy to cut Cam before Rubina, we’ve unfortunately reached the “expect the extremely expected” portion of every Big Brother season, when the same two people win the last stretch of competitions and hardly any jaw-dropping moves are made. Thus, citing her desire to stay loyal to her allies — uh, Leah might have some thoughts about that one — Makensy voted to evict Rubina. With that, Cam, Chelsie and Makensy became the Season 26 finalists, who are now awaiting the start of the final, three-part HOH competition. Plus, we finally learned who will replace Will Kirby as moderator of the finale’s jury roundtable: Season 24 winner Taylor Hale got the gig! What do you think of this Final 3, Big Brother fans? And who are you hoping wins the whole shebang on Sunday? Hit the comments!",
