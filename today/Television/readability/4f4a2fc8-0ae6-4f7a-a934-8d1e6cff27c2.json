  "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 4, Episode 7 of The Bear. Richie’s ex-wife Tiff is getting married on The Bear, and you know what that means: It’s time for another chaotic Berzatto family reunion! (And another top-secret cameo from a big star.) Season 4’s seventh episode is a supersized one, clocking in at a full hour and nine minutes (most episodes run under 40 minutes), and that allows us to spend time with Carmy and the crew as they celebrate Tiff’s big day. As the episode opens, a nervous Richie is dry-heaving in the alley, and Tiff thanks Carmy for coming at the reception, since he’s clearly anxious about seeing Claire. John Mulaney is back as Stevie, helping the Faks sell Pete on a shaky art investment, and Natalie is dreading seeing her hated rival Francie Fak: “That bitch knows what the f–k happened.” Then Francie marches up… and hey, it’s Oscar winner Brie Larson! Francie instantly annoys Nat by kissing Pete hello, and the two women start yelling at each other immediately. Oh, and Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Carmy’s mom Donna, looming like a disaster waiting to happen. Plus, Sarah Paulson returns as cousin Michelle, saying an awkward hello to Donna before having an intimate cuddle with Tiff in bed, as Tiff opens up about her mom not coming to the wedding. Tiff’s husband Frank, played by Josh Hartnett, is a little worried: “There are a lot of Berzattos here.” But Stevie and Claire try to reassure him, with Stevie admitting he likes the chaos: “If they didn’t bring it, I’d be a little heartbroken.” Nat and Francie are still screaming in each other’s faces — and did Ted Fak just imply that the two of them hooked up once?! Carmy’s mom finally walks up to him, telling him: “You look grown-up.” Richie comes over to grab Carmy, leaving Sydney alone to chat with Donna, who’s newly sober: “I’m trying to be healthier. No fun!” Meanwhile, Frank needs Richie’s help: Richie and Tiff’s daughter Eva is hiding under a table and refuses to come out. Frank worries that he scared her off by proposing a stepfather-daughter dance, but Richie says it might just be the stress of the wedding: “It makes people act goofy.” Carmy later runs into his mom’s semi boyfriend Lee, played by Bob Odenkirk, and he’s not exactly warm to him: “Who the f–k invited you?” Lee says he and Donna aren’t together, but she’s doing better these days, and they chew nicotine gum together, with Lee revealing that he saw Carmy at his brother Mikey’s funeral. Lee says he and Mikey actually became close, and Carmy can’t believe it. Mikey talked about Carmy all the time, Lee says: “He told me he was proud of you.” Meanwhile, Donna and Sydney chat, with Sydney admitting she doesn’t mind the chaos of Carmy’s kitchen: “Sometimes I like the noise.” She raves about Carmy’s cooking, telling his mom how she went to his New York restaurant just to eat his food: “Hands down, the best meal of my life.” Donna says “sometimes your work family is closer to you than your family family” — but Sydney feels like your work family can just be your family family, actually. Eva is still under the table, and Frank is panicking. He wants to be a great stepdad, and Eva is always raving about her dad Richie. But Richie counters that when Eva sees him, all she can do is talk about how great Frank is. (Claire later asks him if that’s true, and Richie scoffs, “F–k no.” But it made Frank feel better, at least.) Francie tells Ted he doesn’t think he and his new girlfriend Kelly are going to work out (“Her shoes were really bad”), and Stevie tells Sydney about the days Carmy was crashing on his couch while he worked as a chef in New York. It was inspiring to see him pursue his passion, Stevie says… even if he came home smelling like “pledge week at a Sicilian fraternity.” Richie, Frank and Claire join Eva underneath the table, and Carmy sees Richie’s legs sticking out and joins them — not knowing that Claire is there, too. Soon, the whole party is under the table, with Nat and Francie joining (and silently bickering), along with the Faks, Sydney and Tiff. To reassure Eva, they all go around and admit something they’re scared of: For Claire, it’s bees, and for Sydney, it’s failing and messing stuff up. Claire prods Carmy to chime in, and he asks: “What’s the opposite of chaos?” (Oh, and he’s scared of math, too.) Eva admits she’s afraid of dancing, and they all agree it’s very scary. Frank tells her she doesn’t have to dance, and they all take a group selfie underneath the table. Sydney ignores a text from that other chef Adam Shapiro (“We doing this? You disappeared”), and Natalie finally buries the hatchet with Francie, with them admitting they miss each other and agreeing not to f–k each other over again. Ted decides to tell Kelly he loves her — and she loves him, too! — and Richie tells Uncle Jimmy a story about film director William Friedkin visiting a Zen garden in Kyoto with rocks and sand. Richie thinks the rocks are like people connected by the sand, and he used to think he was a rock, but now “I think I’m the sand, man.” Plus, Carmy and Claire chat, and he admits he’s overwhelmed by all the family here. She says these things are tough on her, too: “I just do a better job of hiding it.” Then he blurts out that he put his hand on a burner after he heard about Mikey’s death, adding that “I’m trying to tell people things.” Progress! Uncle Jimmy takes Tiff for a spin on the dance floor, and she thanks him for sticking with her after the divorce: “My family’s such a mess… The Berzattos are a family to me.” Natalie and Pete dance, too, and so do Sydney and Richie. Carmy finally asks Claire to dance, and she laughs: “That’s not gonna burn you alive?” He assures her it won’t, and they sway together on the dance floor, putting their foreheads together. All this dancing convinces Eva to give it a try, and she and Frank share a sweet dance together. Sydney admits to Richie she’s been nervous about making a certain choice, but “I think there’s only one.” Then Richie dances with Tiff, and he hugs her close as she tears up. When Richie gets home that night, Ted texts him the selfie he took of all of them underneath the table, adding the caption: “THE BEARS.” What was your favorite part of The Bear’s big wedding?

Frank worries that he scared her off by proposing a stepfather-daughter dance, but Richie says it might just be the stress of the wedding: “It makes people act goofy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"692\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"The Bear Season 4 Wedding Richie Eva\" srcset=\"https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg 1243w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=200,135 200w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=768,519 768w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=1024,692 1024w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=148,100 148w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=600,405 600w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=277,187 277w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=1000,676 1000w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=370,250 370w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=244,165 244w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=1160,784 1160w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=444,300 444w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=141,95 141w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=59,40 59w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=50,34 50w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=1200,811 1200w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=41,28 41w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=249,168 249w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=499,337 499w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=999,675 999w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=296,200 296w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=592,400 592w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=1184,800 1184w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=37,25 37w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=222,150 222w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=888,600 888w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=110,74 110w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=285,193 285w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=320,216 320w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=640,433 640w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-richie-eva.jpg?resize=800,541 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCarmy later runs into his mom’s semi boyfriend Lee, played by Bob Odenkirk, and he’s not exactly warm to him: “Who the f–k invited you?” Lee says he and Donna aren’t together, but she’s doing better these days, and they chew nicotine gum together, with Lee revealing that he saw Carmy at his brother Mikey’s funeral. Lee says he and Mikey actually became close, and Carmy can’t believe it. Mikey talked about Carmy all the time, Lee says: “He told me he was proud of you.” Meanwhile, Donna and Sydney chat, with Sydney admitting she doesn’t mind the chaos of Carmy’s kitchen: “Sometimes I like the noise.” She raves about Carmy’s cooking, telling his mom how she went to his New York restaurant just to eat his food: “Hands down, the best meal of my life.” Donna says “sometimes your work family is closer to you than your family family” — but Sydney feels like your work family can just \u003cem\u003ebe\u003c/em\u003e your family family, actually.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEva is still under the table, and Frank is panicking. He wants to be a great stepdad, and Eva is always raving about her dad Richie. But Richie counters that when Eva sees him, all she can do is talk about how great Frank is. (Claire later asks him if that’s true, and Richie scoffs, “F–k no.” But it made Frank feel better, at least.) Francie tells Ted he doesn’t think he and his new girlfriend Kelly are going to work out (“Her shoes were really bad”), and Stevie tells Sydney about the days Carmy was crashing on his couch while he worked as a chef in New York. It was inspiring to see him pursue his passion, Stevie says… even if he came home smelling like “pledge week at a Sicilian fraternity.”  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"693\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"The Bear Season 4 Wedding John Mulaney\" srcset=\"https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg 1241w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=200,135 200w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=1024,693 1024w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=148,100 148w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=600,406 600w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=276,187 276w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=1000,677 1000w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=369,250 369w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=244,165 244w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=1160,785 1160w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=443,300 443w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=140,95 140w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=59,40 59w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=50,34 50w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=1200,812 1200w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=41,28 41w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=248,168 248w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=498,337 498w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=997,675 997w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=295,200 295w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=591,400 591w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=1182,800 1182w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=37,25 37w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=222,150 222w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=886,600 886w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=110,74 110w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=285,193 285w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=320,217 320w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=640,433 640w, https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-bear-season-4-wedding-john-mulaney.jpg?resize=800,541 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRichie, Frank and Claire join Eva underneath the table, and Carmy sees Richie’s legs sticking out and joins them — not knowing that Claire is there, too. Soon, the whole party is under the table, with Nat and Francie joining (and silently bickering), along with the Faks, Sydney and Tiff. To reassure Eva, they all go around and admit something they’re scared of: For Claire, it’s bees, and for Sydney, it’s failing and messing stuff up. Claire prods Carmy to chime in, and he asks: “What’s the opposite of chaos?” (Oh, and he’s scared of math, too.) Eva admits she’s afraid of dancing, and they all agree it’s very scary. Frank tells her she doesn’t have to dance, and they all take a group selfie underneath the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSydney ignores a text from that other chef Adam Shapiro (“We doing this? You disappeared”), and Natalie finally buries the hatchet with Francie, with them admitting they miss each other and agreeing not to f–k each other over again. Ted decides to tell Kelly he loves her — and she loves him, too! — and Richie tells Uncle Jimmy a story about film director William Friedkin visiting a Zen garden in Kyoto with rocks and sand. Richie thinks the rocks are like people connected by the sand, and he used to think he was a rock, but now “I think I’m the sand, man.” Plus, Carmy and Claire chat, and he admits he’s overwhelmed by all the family here. She says these things are tough on her, too: “I just do a better job of hiding it.” Then he blurts out that he put his hand on a burner after he heard about Mikey’s death, adding that “I’m trying to tell people things.” Progress! \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jimmy takes Tiff for a spin on the dance floor, and she thanks him for sticking with her after the divorce: “My family’s such a mess… The Berzattos are a family to me.” Natalie and Pete dance, too, and so do Sydney and Richie. Carmy finally asks Claire to dance, and she laughs: “That’s not gonna burn you alive?” He assures her it won’t, and they sway together on the dance floor, putting their foreheads together. All this dancing convinces Eva to give it a try, and she and Frank share a sweet dance together. Sydney admits to Richie she’s been nervous about making a certain choice, but “I think there’s only one.” Then Richie dances with Tiff, and he hugs her close as she tears up. When Richie gets home that night, Ted texts him the selfie he took of all of them underneath the table, adding the caption: “THE BEARS.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was your favorite part of \u003cem\u003eThe Bear’\u003c/em\u003es big wedding?
