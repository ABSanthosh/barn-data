  "text": "Warning: The following contains spoilers for Ghosts Season 4, Episode 3. Proceed at your own risk! Man, the dirt is surprisingly popular! During Ghosts’ annual Halloween episode, Puritan spirit Patience put Sam on trial for witchcraft after learning that she had conjured the dead during a past All Hallows’ Eve. Bored and with nothing to do since Jay cancelled Halloween, the other ghosts agreed to the trial as a means of entertainment. But little did they know that Patience was serious about dishing out punishment after they found Sam guilty of being a witch. When they discovered a statue with a striking resemblance to Sam, they assumed that Patience had turned her to stone. (Long story short: It was just another relic from Hetty’s living days, and MIA Sam was actually helping the Farnsbys move a table they’d purchased at Jay and Sam’s yard sale.) The bigger shock came when Patience announced that there were too many temptations in the house (like reality TV) for the pious, so she was returning to the dirt… and to the others! “I would say this is probably not the last that we’ve seen of Patience is my bet,” co-showrunner Joe Port tells TVLine. As for her potential co-habitants in the dirt, co-showrunner Joe Wiseman assures us that Patience isn’t lying about the others to mess with our beloved ghosts. “I think it would be a strange thing for her to make up,” Wiseman says. But will the others be bad news for the Woodstone B\u0026B gang? Or are they not quite as off-kilter as Patience, who was already pretty intense and stringent before she died? “They haven’t necessarily been there as long as she has,” Port suggests. “She definitely spent a long time alone, we think. She was a little off to begin with, as you said, and then her time away was definitely not helpful on that front.” Wiseman acknowledges that introducing new ghosts like Patience and “the others,” while also trying not to crowd the property with an unbelievable amount of spirits, is about finding “balance.” “We don’t have, like, a hard-and-fast rule. It’s just sort of like a felt thing. But it is a big property, and it is fun to meet new ghosts,” Wiseman shares. “Part of the challenge in the [writers’] room that we face is what ghosts can be on the property that we don’t know about yet and/or how do we bring ghosts from the outside?” “We’ve had poltergeists, who are attached to a person, we’ve had car ghosts. We have a few other ideas that we’re sort of bouncing around that could be fun,” Wiseman continues. “But you don’t want to do it too often because it starts to strain credulity a little bit. But at the same, that’s part of the nice thing about being able to do 22 [episodes] like we are this season. It gives you a little bit more breathing room. If we did want to do some of that other stuff, it’s not going to be on top of each other.” And with a whole underground space now, the possibilities have certainly expanded for new ghosts. The dirt has “added another whole other dimension of what could be on the property,” Wiseman says. Ghosts fans, what did you think of the show’s latest Halloween installment?
