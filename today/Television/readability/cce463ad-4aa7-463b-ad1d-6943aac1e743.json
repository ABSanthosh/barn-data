  "text": "Ellen Pompeo has been front and center on Grey’s Anatomy for over two decades, so seeing her with a delicious new role to sink her teeth into is thrilling. The beloved actress and producer is set to star in Hulu’s upcoming limited series, Good American Family. The series is told from “multiple points of view,” the streaming service teases, “to explore issues of perspective, bias, and trauma.” (Hulu/Screenshot) Good American Family is inspired by the “disturbing stories surrounding a Midwestern couple who adopts a girl with a rare form of dwarfism.” “But as they begin to raise her alongside their three biological children, mystery emerges around her age and background, and they slowly start to suspect she may not be who she says she is,” the logline continues. (Hulu/Screenshot) The series charts the family as they try to “defend their family from the daughter they’ve grown to believe is a threat.” But the youngster “fights her own battle to confront her past and what her future holds, in a showdown that ultimately plays out in the tabloids and courtroom.” The Curious Case of Natalie Grace Introduced Viewers to the Story Of course, you’ve already heard of Natalia Grace, the young girl who was the center of headlines and ID Discovery’s three-season docuseries The Curious Case of Natalia Grace. Viewers have been immersed in Natalia’s story for many years, and there are questions about whether the Hulu series will do the story justice. (Hulu/Screenshot) Even after watching every episode of the docuseries, there are many unanswered questions, making it evident that much more happened behind the scenes than observers are privy to. Given that the series is only “inspired” by the events, many aspects will likely be changed to heighten the suspense. The drama isn’t here to inform viewers but to entertain them. And we must admit, the first trailer was entertaining. (Hulu/Screenshot) Ellen has been busy with Grey’s Anatomy for so long that she’s struggled to branch out to other projects, but she’s on her A-game in the first footage of Good American Family. Many people will have a preconceived perception of Kristine Barnett because of the headlines and her decision to avoid the cameras for The Curious Case of Natalia Grace. Ellen Pompeo Has a Compelling New Role on Good American Family We see Ellen play many different layers of Kristine, which will be intriguing. Mark Duplass faces an uphill battle because Michael Barnett was prominent throughout the docuseries. (Hulu/Screenshot) For those blissfully unaware of the story, Good American Family will likely grab your attention and not let go. Still, I’d implore anyone thinking of watching to watch the docuseries first. Good American Family premieres March 19 on Hulu with a two-episode premiere. Episodes will then unspool weekly until its April 30 series finale. Check out the trailer below. What are your thoughts on the first look at Good American Family? Are you excited about Ellen’s new role? Hit the comments below.",
