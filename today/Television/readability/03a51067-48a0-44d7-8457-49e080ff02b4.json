Gotta love that tightly wound Sarah Franklin.  After spending far too many episodes so far up Olympia’s backside that she could check the senior attorney for teeth cavities, Kira came along and threw Sarah into a whirlwind crush.  Normally, a side character probably wouldn’t have made such an impact on the story, except most of her scenes on Matlock are with the titular character herself.  ( Photo: Sonja Flemming/CBS ) I think it’s safe to say that almost every viewer was ready for Sarah to loosen her grip on just about anything she could get her hands on. That, in no small part, is thanks to the introduction of Kira.  Username or Email AddressPassword It May Be Cliched And An Overused Trope, But Sometimes, Opposites Really Do Attract.  Coming in with all the flair and confidence of a woman who knows what she wants, Piper Curda’s Kira Yu made her debut in Matlock Season 1 Episode 5.  As soon as Sarah laid eyes on Kira, it was like watching a heart-shaped balloon fill to the brim with every bit of Sarah’s obvious loneliness.  (CBS/Screenshot) It feels cliched to say she “came in like a wrecking ball,” but I genuinely can’t think of a more accurate way to describe the encounter.  So, being the hopeless romantic who seems to be buried under Sarah’s suits, the character made a detailed spreadsheet with her plans to “woo” Kira into liking her.   As everyone knows, the key to lasting love is a detailed strategy that marks every pivotal moment. Spontaneity be damned.  Thankfully, the Matlock writers had other plans with the whole “opposites attract” formula. However, it may have worked a little too well and could be setting audiences up for more heartbreak in the series.  The Matlock Writers Have Proven That They Are Not Afraid To Rip Right Into Any And Every Character’s Relationship  (Sonja Flemming/CBS) As we learned over the episodes leading up to the winter break, no one’s relationship on Matlock was safe.  First, Billy and Claudia went to splits-ville. Then there was Julian (Jason Ritter), who came clean to Olympia (Skye P. Marshall) about the affair he had years ago just as they were finally ready to patch things up and rediscover their love.  There aren’t many relationships left for the writers to play with. Plus, the hands behind the series are not going to touch Matty and Edwin’s lifelong marriage.  They could, but the possibilities are too emotionally charged to contemplate. If you catch my drift, there’s really only one thing that will split up a couple in their seventies.  That just leaves Kira and Sarah’s budding romance, and unless Kira is sticking around for a while, we probably shouldn’t get too attached.  If There Is One Thing Every Matlock Fan Knows Now, It’s To Expect The Unexpected  (Sonja Flemming/CBS) However, one of the best parts of Matlock is that it constantly exceeds the audience’s expectations. It would be like the writers making me eat my own words, and I am here for it.  Besides, I’m pretty sure Jacobson Moore only has room for one heartbroken character at a time, and that role is currently being filled by the lovable Billy, played by David Del Rio.  Personally, I think we have only scratched the surface of what’s to come with Sarah and Kira. They haven’t even been on an official first date apart from the office holiday party where they shared their first kiss.  Can you imagine if they reach the point of meeting each other’s parents? I think Sarah’s (Leah Lewis) stress would actually become visible to the naked eye with question marks floating around her head.  (Sonja Flemming/CBS) Either way, those two are too cute for the Matlock writers not to have plenty planned before the relationship’s possible end.
