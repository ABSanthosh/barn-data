What will Mel and Jack’s future look like after Marely’s proposal? What will be Brie’s response to Mike? And what the heck happened to Charmaine? Let’s hit all the highlights. (Courtesy of Netflix) During Virgin River Season 6 Episode 10, Jack and Mel finally tie the knot, and the long-awaited event is cause for a real celebration (once the runaway couple returns to the altar after a “breather,” that is). But the reception wasn’t without its fair share of drama for some others. And the cliffhangers left us on the edge of our seats! Lark Steals Brady’s Money and Vanishes (Courtesy of Netflix) Brady, one-third of the series’ biggest love triangle, realized that sometimes the chickens come home to roost no matter what you do. Before the wedding, he and Brie have a heated and passionate exchange where they talk about how they slept together and essentially cheated on their spouses. They expressed some guilt, but more so, Brady admitted that he would always love Brie and that he couldn’t stop loving her. It was a raw and honest moment for the two, with fans of the ship hanging onto every word with bated breath. The problem is that Lark was listening to the conversation as well. And despite Brady forgiving her for initially scamming him under the direction of her baby daddy, she was hurt when she realized that Brady would never love her as much as he loves Brie, and maybe he was settling for her. (Courtesy of Netflix) An oblivious Brady didn’t realize that Lark had turned cold toward him throughout the wedding and reception. He also didn’t realize that giving Lark’s daughter, Hazel, his phone to play games on would backfire on him. A hurt Lark went back on her word and accessed Brady’s bank account, emptying it and absconding with all of his money. She left town with Hazel, presumably never to be heard from again. Brady is broke, heartbroken, and single! Mike Knows About Brie \u0026 Brady’s Hookup … But Proposes Anyway (Craig Minielly/Netflix) Meanwhile, Brie and Mike faced some drama of their own at the reception. Brie, still reeling from her conversation with Brady, was wracked with guilt over her infidelity and having a hard time being with Mike and still lying to him. She confided in Mel and Kaia, and Mel let her know that if she couldn’t choose between either man, the nice and kind thing to do would be to let them both go. Brie seemed resigned to this and may have considered implementing that advice when she spent time with Mike. As the two share a moment alone at the reception, Mike is so wrapped up in the day’s merriment that he confesses his love for Brie and proposes to her with a twist tie. Brie finally confesses to him that she slept with Brady, unable to process his proposal until she could tell him the truth about her infidelity. But shockingly, Mike tells her he already knows she slept with Brady. (Courtesy of Netflix) It apparently hasn’t deterred him from proposing to her, and he leaves Brie speechless without answering the very important question. Hell, he left us speechless, too. For one, proposing at someone else’s wedding is low-key tacky. For another, was this some type of power move to assert dominance once and for all to get the girl, or was he genuine about this proposal? And is Brie even ready for marriage when she’s still emotionally struggling with not only her love for two men but making peace with all that’s happened in her past, including her sexual assault, miscarriage, and other traumas? Nefarious Forces are Coming for Doc and the Practice (Courtesy of Netflix) Doc and Hope survived the wedding reception, but the next day brought new challenges that will shake things up for the seventh season. Doc got a letter telling him his medical license had been suspended pending an investigation. It seems the doctor in Grace Valley has it in for Doc, and it is so much more than Doc doing an emergency surgical procedure and saving a man’s life. Hope got a phone call because the person assumed she was just the mayor and had no relation to Doc. They shared that the real plan is to expand a larger hospital network via Grace Valley into Virgin River and push Doc out of his practice to implement this plan. It’s safe to say that after 30 years, Doc isn’t taking this lying down without a fight. Marley Offers Up a Chance for Mel to Be a Mother, But is it a Catch? (Courtesy of Netflix) But the happy couple have the biggest cliffhangers of the finale. Mel was barely getting out of bed after an amazing wedding night with her husband when a new problem came to her doorstep. Or it could be a new opportunity. Marley, her pregnant patient who was a surrogate for a neurotic helicopter couple, Darla and Phil, arrived at Mel’s home panicked. It seems that Darla and Phil have shockingly changed their minds and no longer want the child due soon. (Ricardo Hubbs/Netflix) But Marley comes armed with a solution, not just a problem. She wants Mel to have the baby instead. Mel is speechless at this proposal, and we wonder what she will say and how she will respond. Why don’t Phil and Darla want the child? Is this finally Mel and Jack’s opportunity to have their own child? Jack Discovers Something Worrisome About Charmaine (Netflix/Screenshot) Poor Jack had a startle of his own in the biggest and final cliffhanger of the finale. The couple finally realized that it was odd that Charmaine didn’t show up at their wedding, especially since she volunteered to style Mel’s hair. Throughout the season, they’ve alluded to Charmaine’s custody issues with Calvin and his harassment of her. She even went so far as to get a restraining order against him. Jack shows up at Charmaine’s house, and the door is slightly ajar, so he searches for her. She doesn’t respond to his calls, and he notices the entire house is trashed. (Courtesy of Netflix) It seems that someone threw a violent fit or a knockdown, drag-out fight may have happened. Jack heads to the twins‘ room, opens the door, and hears a lullaby playing from the music box. He’s shocked and maybe even horrified by what he sees. The final scene cuts to black, and we ponder what Jack has witnessed. (Netflix) Is Charmaine hurt, beaten, or even dead? Are the twins long gone? Charmaine and the twins’ fates hang in the balance until the next season. It’s a fascinating cliffhanger because the usually polarizing character Charmaine is now someone we actively root for and hope she’s okay. Charmaine’s fate is the biggest cliffhanger yet, and we’ll have to wait until Virgin River Season 7 to get an answer. Over to you, Virgin River Fanatics. How do you feel about these cliffhangers?!
