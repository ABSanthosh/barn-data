  "text": "Christmas and New Year are over, and that can only mean one thing:  Fresh episodes of Chicago Fire are on the way! NBC has confirmed that Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 9 will hit the air on Wednesday, January 8, at 9/8c.  (Peter Gordon/NBC) Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 8 ended with some big cliffhangers that have had Chicago Fire fanatics waiting for resolution with bated breath.  Of note, Cruz’s life is potentially on the line because the past has come back to haunt him in a big way.  (Peter Gordon/NBC) It’s always interesting when a show pays off a storyline from years ago, and that’s exactly what’s happening here.  Cruz found a bullet in his locker and in his car, which ties back to his brother, Leon, who several years ago was linked to the Insane Kings, a gang operated by a man named Flaco. Will Cruz’s Blast From the Past Be Fatal?  To save his brother’s life, Cruz didn’t attempt to save Flace when he was on fire, which meant that he burned alive.  It’s a dark turn for sure, but even darker now that Flaco’s cousin is in the picture and very much interested in doling out some form of revenge.  The official synopsis for the episode teases that his “past comes back to haunt him.” There are so many unanswered questions about Cruz’s past, so there’s no time like the present to put him front and center for what’s sure to be a pulse-pounding storyline.  There’s no telling where this storyline will go, but there’s a chance it could lead to Joe Minoso’s departure because Cruz is in a lot of danger when you think about it.  If this individual can get into his workplace to leave a bullet earmarked for him, it stands to reason that he can get in anywhere to enact his revenge.  (Peter Gordon/NBC) But Cruz has already proven to be cunning and may actually put a plan in motion that allows him to get off scot-free, so we’ll have to stay tuned for that.  Had the show really planned on killing him off, it would have done so in the midseason finale because that’s one way to get fans talking about the show.  Cruz’s fate isn’t the only one up in the air because the midseason premiere will also feature the aftermath of Mouch and Herrmann’s exams to advance their careers in firefighting. The issue is that they may not have jobs at Firehouse 51.  Big Changes Are Expected Ahead of Chicago Fire Season 14 The two best friends are betting big on their futures, and they’re at the point in their careers where they want more.  Will “more” really be worth it if they have to leave their friends at Firehouse 51 behind? They’re such a closely bonded family that they will have to make a decision they agree with.  (Peter Gordon/NBC) Then again, maybe Chief Pascal won’t be on the show for as long as we anticipate.  Dermot Mulroney has struck a chord with viewers, so losing such a great character so soon would be a shame.  Pascal had some growing pains, but he has the potential to be one of the better characters.  The episode’s synopsis teases that Mouch will have something going on other than his exam in the premiere.  The network teases that he’ll be searching for a victim’s next of kin, which we’re sure will not be a lot of fun for anyone involved.  Taylor Kinney Is Back On Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 9 (Peter Gordon/NBC) Finally, NBC has confirmed that Taylor Kinney will return as Severide “prepares to teach an arson class at the academy.” Truthfully, we’re surprised that Taylor is still associated with the show because it seems like he’s been preparing for a permanent exit over the last few years.  That said, as one of the few original cast members left, the producers will probably do anything to keep him around.  NBC has yet to pick up Chicago Fire Season 14 officially, but you can get the latest on your favorite One Chicago shows in our NBC Cheat Sheet.  Over to you, Chicago Fire Fanatics! What do you think of the first details about the midseason premiere?  Watch Chicago Fire Online",
