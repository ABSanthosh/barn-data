  "text": "Can these long-time friends and sporadic lovers repair their relationship after Will arrested Angie? In real life, probably not. While arresting a romantic partner often seals the relationship’s fate, couples have reconciled over stranger things. We’re not debating whether Will and Angie should reunite romantically, though. It’s way too soon for that. (Disney/Wilford Harewood)  However, since the APD and GBI often work together, should Will and Angie stay polite co-workers or become closer friends again due to their long-term history? Will Trent is an outstanding man but often thinks in black and white, with no shades of grey. That works when he’s solving cases, but not so well in relationships. So, now that he arrested the love of his life in front of everyone they knew, can they ever be friends again? Or is there no going back? Angie Has Matured, but She’s Shown She’s Still Reckless and Passionate in Will Trent Season 3 (Disney/Zac Popik) Angie Polaski has matured since Will Trent started, but she is still unapologetic, passionate, and fearless when it comes to rescuing domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Even as Angie tried to rejoin the force, she went all “Nancy Drew” to catch an abusive husband who was also trafficking other workers. While she became bright enough to text Michael her location, she was still reckless in approaching him alone. That behavior wouldn’t fly with Will. While opposites often attract, in this case, maybe not anymore.  If they’re both going to develop to their full potential, Angie and Will need to be partnered with other people who respect their quirks. Both characters are human and could have many stories without each other, depending on how the series moves on from the resolution. Did Anyone Think Will Locked the Door for That Emotional Confrontation? (Disney/Wilford Harewood) It was a polarizing cliffhanger at Will Trent Season 2 Episode 10 when Will arrested Angie. They had been planning their lives together. Like Angie, many of us assumed he would choose her. Therefore, it made sense why Angie avoided discussing anything serious with Will that did not pertain to the case. It may have been predictable, but I suspected Will paid that waitress to lock the door at K Slaughter’s. It seemed odd that it was closed, and the waitress took a long time to return with the key. It was the only way Will could get Angie to talk with him since her instinct was to run. (Disney/Wilford Harewood) The conversation started typically, and you could tell that Ramon Rodriguez and Erika Christensen were friends because they looked happy to interact again. Granted, the emotional confrontation made fascinating drama, but it’s challenging to choose sides. Will made a valid point that Angie should have trusted him, but she also had doubts even then, which he proved by arresting her. It seemed that Will felt the most betrayed that Angie had lied to him, and she felt hurt that he had given up on them. They’re both valid points. That’s difficult to dispute. He did blow up their lives, but he’s hurting too. There were no winners here, only losers. This Might Be a Good Time to Press Pause on Will and Angie’s Friendship (Disney/Wilford Harewood) The Will Trent writers excel at showcasing rich character arcs and relationship history. Will and Angie have known each other since they were young children in the foster care system. They’re the epitome of being trauma-bonded, making it difficult for Will to let go of their friendship. At the end of Will Trent Season 3 Episode 4, Angie admitted she missed their friendship too, but they couldn’t return to how it used to be. There was too much baggage. That scene reminded me of the bittersweet scene in Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 23 Episode 22 between Rafael Barba and Olivia Benson after he hurt her by defending Richard Wheatley. Some betrayals dig deep, even when you want to forgive the other person. Angie showed Will some kindness when she told him it was time to let her go and let him move on. That was so hard for her since she still loved him. (Disney/Wilford Harewood) It was apparent she thought Will already had, but there will never be another relationship like theirs. That’s not necessarily good or bad, but you don’t often know someone since childhood. Hopefully, after they allow themselves some time to heal, they can be friends again since Erika Christensen and Ramon Rodriguez possess a natural connection. What did you think of Angie and Will’s first interactions in Will Trent Season 3? Are you Team Angie or Will? Would you prefer they be friends again or have less interaction and grow individually?
