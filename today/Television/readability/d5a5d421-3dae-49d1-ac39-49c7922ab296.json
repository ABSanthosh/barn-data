  "text": "As we’re days away from the yummiest holiday of the year and hurdling towards the biggest shopping season, most TV shows have gone on hiatus for the year. Fire Country Season 3 Episode 7 spoilers key you in for the next episode, which will skip a week since it is Thanksgiving and return with a fresh episode on December 6. Although we don’t have confirmation about when Fire Country will go on a fall hiatus, we expect to get an eighth episode in 2024 before the show ends for the year to make room for Christmas shows. (Eric Milner/CBS) CBS has announced the show’s Winter 2025 premiere date as Jan 31. The series will return on Fridays after the NCIS: Sydney Season 2 premiere and ahead of S.W.A.T’s new time slot. Fire Country has perfected the art of the creative cliffhanger, leaving viewers on edge more than once during its three-season run. And we have no doubt the Fire Country Season 3 Fall Finale will do more of the same. Although we don’t know where the show will end, Fire Country Season 3 Episode 7 should set the scene for the fall finale. Much like Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 26 Episode 8 left off after putting Carisi through major emotional trauma. And we’re stuck in limbo, wondering what that gunshot meant in the Grey’s Anatomy Season 2 Episode 8 finale. Fire Country Season 3 Episode 7 will be the last episode for Camden Casey’s character introduction, which the show handled much better than Sheriff Mickey Fox. Camden came in as Bode’s final training captain, although things weren’t going well when Fire Country Season 3 Episode 6 ended. Bode chose his family and town over obeying Casey’s orders to leave the fire scene after Camden disagreed with Vince. (Eric Milner/CBS) Vince tried to make amends with Casey, but it might not have worked. He doesn’t seem to be the forgive-and-forget type. We hope Bode’s disregard for his Captain’s orders didn’t affect his CFD future. Is it solely up to Camden whether Bode graduates Phase 3 of fire training? Or does he only have input, and the higher-ups make the final decision? Camden has rubbed most people wrong — even Bode during their latest fire call at the Eagle Sanctuary. But those of us who don’t mind a guy who’s kind of an asshole love him. (Eric Milner/CBS) The show has done a great job setting up his character for the Fire Country: Surfside spinoff we’re nearly certain will happen. Camden is damaged and tormented, determined to be a lone wolf so he doesn’t lose anyone else after the tragedy of his whole team dying — including a brother — during a fire call. If his spinoff comes true, seeing him in his element of SoCal will be interesting. He seems like a character we could enjoy getting to know. He’s done a great job helping Bode gain confidence in following his instincts and knowing when to question following the rules. Sharon, Vince, and Jake have tried to restrain Bode, but Casey wants Bode to explore his talents and be the best. But after last week’s test of loyalty, Bode and Camden might not be as buddy-buddy as before. With tension in the ranks, Casey might have a change of heart about his opinion of Bode and his cowboy antics. Especially if Bode decides to go renegade during a false alarm fire call that quickly escalates into a hostage situation. Who will Bode be once Camden leaves, and he makes it onto the roster of Station 42? Will he find a way to marry the lessons he learned from each person and become the prodigy everyone expects? Or will he return to his screw-up ways like Manny? Manny is back in charge at Three Rock, even though he’s an inmate who just arrived. It took a bit for the inmate crew to adjust to Manny getting First Saw ahead of Cole. He and Gabriela are still at odds, even though he’s done his best to return to her good graces. She’s been acting like a brat since Manny went to prison, and it’s old for this viewer. (Eric Milner/CBS) Gabriela is in the middle of a mental health crisis, and it’s causing her to push away everyone close to her. She feels like she’s blown up her life, and now she’s drowning in the aftermath of her impulsive decisions, from being in debt to Diego’s parents for her canceled wedding to hiding out in the AirStream parked inside the fire station. She dumped Diego for Bode. But now she’s decided not to be in a relationship with Bode. Most of us support this decision. (Eric Milner/CBS) Since the show started three seasons ago, Gabriela has constantly been involved in relationships. A relationship with Bode would be a rebound from Diego, who was a rebound from her first breakup with Bode. With so much turmoil, she needs time to find herself and learn to make herself happy before she tries to find a happily ever after with a partner. At the rate she’s spiraling, she’s heading for rock bottom unless she lets in those close to her. We all need help from time to time. She has a great support system, if she’d let them in. The Fire Country audience is divided on Bode’s decision to forgo a relationship with Gabriela. Some people — like myself — see that they’re not good for each other. (Eric Milner/CBS) They are both too willing to blow up their lives for the other. They ride the highs and crave the thrills. And they make bad decisions together. But the other half wants to finally see their relationship come to fruition now that all the obstacles seem gone. After all, we’ve invested three years into their not-ship. It seems a waste to let all that effort end without seeing what could happen. Was it wrong for Bode to say it’s over because Gabriela isn’t ready for a relationship right now? She did almost marry another guy. Naturally, she might want a break before rushing into another relationship. However, that doesn’t give her the right to keep coming back to Bode for her carnal needs. He’s right that he deserves all or nothing. Can he find something with newcomer Audrey James? There is so much chemistry there, even if she is already in a long-term relationship. We doubt it’ll last. Or will James relocate south and become part of Jared Padalecki’s crew in the potential Fire Country spinoff? (Eric Milner/CBS) James doesn’t appear in every episode this season, but there’s magic when she does. Especially when she’s on stage with Vince at Smokey’s. Her voice was insane! Speaking of newcomers, we just got word that we’ll finally be seeing more of Sheriff Mickey Fox, sister of Sharon Leone. There was a brief intro of her in Fire Country Season 2 Episode 6 and several mentions of her since then. But we haven’t gotten enough of her to justify a spinoff of her own. But that’s what Fire Country fans have coming with Sheriff Country Season 1 in 2025. Since Fire Country Season 3 Episode 7 will feature a hostage situation involving Bode, Camden, and Audrey, it’s possible fans could get an episode involving both spinoff main characters together. We hope the family reunion between Sharon and Mickey isn’t the only one we witness. (Eric Milner/CBS) Eve has started trying to make amends with her estranged family, starting with her brother, played by Jeff Pierre (Walker). She’s also reconnected with an old romantic interest in the CFD’s rescue at the Eagle park. Could we finally see more of Eve’s personal life now that she’s found her groove as Three Rock Fire Captain? And how about Sharon, now that she thinks she might have the answer to her health issues? James implied Sharon might be going through perimenopause. But as a loyal Fanatic pointed out, wouldn’t that have shown up on all the fancy tests Sharon’s doctor claimed he ran? Is she of age to go through Mother Nature’s change or is there something else going on, waiting to surprise us? What are your thoughts on how Fire Country Season 3 is progressing compared to its previous runs? Are you enjoying Camden Casey enough to see him as the lead in his own show? (Eric Milner/CBS) How are you feeling about finally getting more of Mickey Fox? Do you like the idea of the Sheriff Country spinoff? Leave us your thoughts in the comments!
