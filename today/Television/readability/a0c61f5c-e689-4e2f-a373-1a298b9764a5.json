  "text": "Kristen’s story is the most interesting of all the Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-10-25. I never expected to care about anything having to do with her. Usually, she’s a one-note, over-the-top villain whose nonsense I could do without. She’s got a great story coming up, though, that is rooted deep in Days of Our Lives history. Plus, that horrible Body \u0026 Soul story might be over for good. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 2-10-25 Promise To Pick Up Where They Left Off Friday’s cliffhanger was one of the best ones we’ve had in a while. Kristen: Rachel did this by herself? Knocked you out, tied you up here? Ava: No, not by herself. Someone else was here. Kristen: The Parrot Man? Ava: No. The Woman In White. Kristen: What the hell are you talking about? Woman In White [off-screen]: Hello, Kristen, my love. I’m eager to find out how Kristen responds to her mother being alive, but I’m even more excited about her realizing that the Woman in White is not such a great person. Of course, Kristen isn’t exactly self-aware enough to realize that she was wrong to idolize her mother, but the possibility is still delicious. All this time, Kristen has been saying that her mother was such a better person than her, that she would be so disappointed that Kristen has done evil things so often, and that she named Rachel after her because she wants her to grow up to be like her. But can anyone say with a straight face that Kristen would not lure her romantic rival to a secluded location, knock her out, tie her up, and send phony texts making it seem she went to the other side of the world? (Peacock/Screenshot) Of course not. Kristen did something similar to Chloe to get her out of the way of Kristen’s fantasy reconciliation with Brady. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-10-25 don’t say much about how Kristen’s reunion with her mother will go. They just say she’ll be shocked. Nobody in Salem should be shocked about dead relatives turning out to be alive, especially not a Dimera. They’re the ones who have perfected the resurrection drugs that only exist in Salem, for goodness sake! Of course, this woman could turn out NOT to be Kristen’s mother. Outgoing head writer Ron Carlivarti loves his doppelganger, after all. (Peacock/Screenshot) Still, that wouldn’t make much sense. What would be the point of a phony Woman in White, and why would she manipulate Kristen’s daughter? While Kristen Is Reuniting With Her Mother, Brady And Steve Search For Ava I’m not sure how I feel about Steve helping Brady search for Ava. Ava is Tripp’s mother, so Steve feels a certain obligation to look after her for his son’s sake. However, it’s hard to look past all the evil things Ava has done to Steve and his family. Heck, even having Brady be into her is a bitter pill to swallow, knowing she messed with John and killed Shawn Brady, Sr. She’s raped Steve, too, kidnapping Kayla and threatening to kill her if Steve didn’t have sex with her. Leaving aside the issue of crappy writing that had Kayla — herself a sexual assault survivor — accuse Steve of “cheating” after Ava raped him, it’s hard to understand how he can stand to be in the same room with her, never mind be one of the people responsible for rescuing her. Still, in this case, she is the victim, and someone has to get her out of that damn wheelchair and stop the Woman in White from encouraging Rachel’s worst impulses. (Peacock/Screenshot) Could These Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 2-10-25 Mean That Body \u0026 Soul Is REALLY Done? If you’re sick of reading my rants about how horrible Body \u0026 Soul is, I have potentially great news for you. There are a couple of spoilers that suggest the soap-within-a-soap is on its way out for good. There have been some signs recently anyway, most notably that Kate felt the fictional sudser was no longer worth her trouble. Kate Roberts doesn’t give up easily, y’all. If she’s saying it’s time to throw in the towel, it probably should have happened a while ago. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-10-25 say that the cast \u0026 crew of Body \u0026 Soul get an update on the show’s fate. Elsewhere, Leo has bad news for Doug III. These two spoilers can only point to the production being shuttered. Leo had hired Doug III to be his assistant on the show, but if there’s no show anymore, then there’s no job for Doug III. Similarly, the cast and crew getting an update that the show is continuing would not be spoiler-worthy. Of course, there are always some spoilers that don’t belong on the list because they’re common occurrences in Salem. Still, the chances are that the news involves the show closing down. (Peacock/Screenshot) Will Joy Stay In Salem Now That Body \u0026 Soul Is Gone? I like Joy despite the stupid story she’s saddled with, so I hope she sticks around. However, is there really anything left for her in Salem? She’s about to lose her job, and her boyfriend is waiting for the perfect moment to break up with her so he can be with Stephanie instead. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-10-25 say only that Joy will make an offer to Alex. Could she be staying in town in the hopes of winning Alex back? (Peacock/Screenshot) So far, Joy hasn’t really been manipulative or evil. She fell into bed with Johnny, then felt guilty about it and wanted to preserve her friendship with Chanel. But it might be interesting for her to go full bad girl. Joy could stick around, planning to do whatever she can to break Alex and Stephanie up. Chloe was like that back in the day, so why shouldn’t her sister try it? (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 2-10-25 Promise Jada Will Confront EJ, But What’s The Point? EJ’s plot against Jada should have fallen apart already. “Rafe” has evidence that she’s corrupt that doesn’t match Jada and Paulina’s memories and an anonymous source who gave it to him. He also supposedly gathered this evidence at the bequest of a guy who swore vengeance against Jada when he lost his job. I hate how people in Salem become stupid when the plot demands it. This shouldn’t go any further than it has, but it probably will. (Peacock/Screenshot) Jada confronting EJ should be fun, but it probably won’t get her too far, especially since Paulina seems to have decided she’s guilty based on the fact that “Rafe” said he believes it. Is too much to ask that she at least realize the real Rafe is in the basement? Please? Random Other Spoilers For Days Of Our Lives During The Week of 2-10-25 There are some assorted Valentine’s Day spoilers this week, based on the promo video. The best news is that Steve and Kayla will finally get some romance in. These two are one of Salem’s classic couples, but they’ve barely shared scenes lately. Additionally, Johnny and Chanel will discuss having a baby together now that they have reconciled. It seems like it’s too soon, considering they both fell apart because of Johnny’s jealousy, but I guess they’re moving on. Finally, Tate and Holly plan a night of romance… but it may be thwarted before it begins because Maggie insists on having a heart-to-heart with Holly and asking her if she’s planning on having sex.
