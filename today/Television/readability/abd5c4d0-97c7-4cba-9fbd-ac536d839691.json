  "text": "Some of your Virgin River favorites are going south of the border in Season 7. The only question is… who? And why? And when? OK, there are actually quite a few unanswered questions to tackle here. My queries stem from Tudum’s announcement about Netflix renewing Virgin River for Season 8, even before its Season 7 premiere. Published earlier this week, The article references how most of Season 7 was filmed in Vancouver, as usual, but with “a brief stop in Mexico” this time around. Mexico, you say? If you ask me, it sounds like the perfect travel destination for a honeymoon, which Mel and Jack have yet to enjoy since their wedding happened in the Season 6 finale. And after everything these two have been through, don’t they deserve to kick back on a beach with a couple of margaritas? Of course, Mexico also works for a girls’ trip — maybe even a bachelorette party for one of Virgin River’s brides to be. None of the show’s current couples are engaged, but several are on the cusp. Kaia and Preacher, perhaps? Or would it be too much to ask for Brie and Brady to finally get their acts together this season? (Sorry, Mike!) One thing’s for sure, there’s no way this Mexico trip could possibly compare to the one Alexandra Breckenridge already had on Family Guy: OK, Virgin River fans, let’s talk: What do you think will bring the show down to Mexico in Season 7?
