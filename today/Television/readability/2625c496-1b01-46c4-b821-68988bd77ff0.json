  "text": "Sharpen those stakes because it’s really happening. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is staging a comeback. We learned as much earlier this week, but details were scarce, as Sarah Michelle Gellar had stayed quiet about it. (Disney/Screenshot) Of course, more details have spilled out since, and we may have gotten ahead of ourselves a bit when we thought the titular slayer would be front and center in the sequel series. However, reports have since surfaced that while Sarah will be involved in some capacity, she may not be a series regular. (Disney/Screenshot) That alone leads us to believe the new series will have a different name. You can’t call it Buffy without the heroine at the show’s heart. In any case, Sarah wants the world to know that the project is real and that she has many reservations about returning to the franchise. Sarah Michelle Gellar Has Been Working on the Project for Years In a post on her official Facebook account, the kick-ass actress confirmed that the project has been in the works for three years. “Three years ago, I got a call from my dear friend and mentor Gail Berman,” the veteran TV star declared, adding that the producer and television exec wanted her to “sit down” with Chloé Zhao. (Disney/Screenshot) While Sarah admitted it was to “hear her take on a potential Buffy revival,” she fully expected the meeting to be a bust because she didn’t “see a way for the show to exist again.” Ultimately, Sarah agreed to the meeting, and the planned “20-minute coffee quickly turned into a four-hour adventure.” “We laughed, we cried, but mostly we both talked about how much this show means to us,” she recalls. The 47-year-old said she was shocked that she agreed to continue the conversation because she had been so against returning the series without a worthwhile reason. (Disney/Screenshot) “Ultimately, one day, we landed on an idea,” Sarah affirmed before speaking about why she was hesitant to restart the franchise again. “I have always listened to the fans and heard your desire to revisit Buffy and her world, but it was not something I could do unless I was sure we would get it right.” Reboots Rarely Work, But Sarah Is Determined to Make It Right That’s encouraging because reboots rarely make much of an impact beyond a splashy opening. Many are canceled after one or two seasons because fans don’t like what the new take offers. It’s refreshing to know Sarah is more concerned about what a new story could do to the show because many execs go rogue and bring shows back without the involvement of original cast members. We’re looking at you, Charmed reboot! (Disney/Screenshot) “This has been a long process, and it’s not over yet,” she added, stating that the new take will only be produced “if we know we can do it right.” And I will tell you that we are on the path there. I feel so lucky to be on this journey with these four unbelievably talented women, all of whom love Buffy as much as I do. And as much as you do. Thank you to all the fans who never stopped asking for this. This will be for you,” the message concluded. I think we speak for every fan when we say this is the best approach. Any network would want a revival of Buffy the Vampire Slayer because it will have a large initial audience and generate a lot of headlines. The fact that the series is going through the pilot process first highlights that those associated with it want to get it right. Sarah has spent years declining to bring the series back because she cares about the show’s legacy. (Disney/Screenshot) There’s so much to ponder because having this franchise back in our lives didn’t seem possible last week. What are your thoughts on Sarah’s sentiments? Do you think it’s time to bring Buffy the Vampire Slayer back from the dead? Hit the comments. Watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer Online",
