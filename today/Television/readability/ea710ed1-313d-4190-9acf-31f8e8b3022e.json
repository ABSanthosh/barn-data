  "text": "Night Court has officially adjourned its third season on NBC — and yes, it had another treat for all you Big Bang Theory fans. Part 1 of Tuesday’s two-part season finale had a few guest stars of its own, with Marsha Warfield returning as Roz and Michael Urie playing a zany judge who annoyed Abby with his wild popularity. But it was Part 2 that pressed that Big Bang nostalgia button: Simon Helberg, who played Howard to Melissa Rauch’s Bernadette on Big Bang, popped up in the episode’s final moments as Abby’s previously unmentioned “husband,” who walked into her office and planted a big kiss on her — just as Abby decided she wanted to spend the rest of her life with her boyfriend Jake. We were left with a classic “To be continued…” Huh?! Plus, in another Big Bang connection, Young Sheldon alum Raegan Revord played Shelby, a smart-mouthed teen who ran off to New York with her boyfriend to get hitched. Abby tried to scare them straight, but romance must’ve been in the air: Jake was also planning to pop the question. Things went awry when he misplaced the engagement ring, and he ended up getting cold feet. His hesitation spurred Abby to marry the teens after all — but Shelby backed out. (Turns out she just wanted to renegotiate her curfew.) The jury is still out, though, on a fourth season of Night Court: NBC hasn’t officially announced yet if the show is renewed or cancelled. Do you think it deserves to come back? Don’t we need to see how this Abby love triangle plays out? Give us your verdict by grading the finale in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.",
