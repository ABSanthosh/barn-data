  "text": "There has been so much discussion about the future of the Duttons now that Yellowstone has allegedly concluded after five seasons. The series is one of the most popular of the last decade, so Paramount+’s decision to proceed with prequels and sequels isn’t too surprising. While we don’t know the status of the Beth and Rip spinoff, a stunning new report about a very different take on the franchise has piqued my interest. (Paramount/Screenshot) According to Puck, CBS is developing a procedural headlined by Luke Grimes’ Kayce Dutton. Puck has been dropping Yellowstone bombshells over the last couple of years, so we’re inclined to believe the story has some credibility. (Emerson Miller/Paramount) Plus, it makes a whole lot of sense. CBS’s bread and butter is procedurals, so utilizing one of the most talked-about shows to get another one off the ground is a decent way for the network to jump on the Yellowstone gravy train. Yellowstone Left Kayce’s Future Wide Open At the end of Yellowstone Season 5, Kayce’s future was left very much to be determined, so there’s every reason to believe that Taylor Sheridan purposefully kept his options open here. The good news is that the Duttons are pretty much free of the ranch they called home for many years, which allowed Beth and Rip to secure a fresh start elsewhere. (Emerson Miller/Paramount) But trouble is never too far away from them, so it won’t be long before someone disrupts their happiness. Kayce was one of Yellowstone’s most intriguing characters, so I believe there’s much to be gained by giving the character a storyline over a longer arc. Of course, broadcast TV seasons, particularly on CBS, are much larger than cable shows. Granted, Yellowstone was fast approaching broadcast standards in its final season in terms of episode counts. (Emerson Miller / Paramount) The hope is that the series would keep Kayce’s family intact. There’s no Kayce without his wife, Monica (Kelsey Asbille), and their son, Tate (Brecken Merrill). Yellowstone didn’t give Tate much to do in its final seasons, but perhaps a broadcast drama with a case-of-the-week twist could allow for more from who I assume will be considerably older in the potential new series. Luke Grimes is the Perfect Procedural Lead I’m not quite sure where the series would be set, but it could be anywhere since we’re likely picking up with a considerable time jump. Beth and Rip’s story will find them in a new locale with countless new characters, so a similar tactic could be effective for Kayce’s series. (Emerson Miller / Paramount) The Duttons’ lives have changed considerably in recent years, but now that they’re no longer tied to the ranch, they can move on. The constant power struggles must have been taxing both physically and mentally, so now that they’ve moved on, there are far more interesting storyline avenues for these characters. In a sense, I’m glad that the rumors of Yellowstone Season 6 are just that because it’s time to follow these multi-layered characters into the next chapter of their lives. What are your thoughts, Yellowstone Fanatics? Is making a procedural set in the sprawling western’s universe a good idea? (Paramount Network/ROGER SNIDER) Do you have any reservations or were you on board at Luke Grimes? We don’t judge. Are there any other characters you’d like to join Kayce? Hit the comments below.
