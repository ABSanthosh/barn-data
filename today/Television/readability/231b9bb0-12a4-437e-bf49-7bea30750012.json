  "text": "The following contains spoilers for the season premiere of Dexter: Resurrection. Dexter Morgan’s bound to drop a few bodies in his new series Dexter: Resurrection, but in Friday’s premiere, it was another Morgan that drew first blood. When we pick back up with the Bay Harbor Butcher, he’s waking up from a coma after nearly being killed by Harrison at the end of Dexter: New Blood. After a tense reunion with Batista (and some unwelcome visits from a few franchise bad guys), Dexter escapes his hospital bed to head to New York City, where he hopes to make things right with Harrison. His son is working at a swanky hotel that has one particularly shady guest who’s overstaying his welcome. When that man drugs and attempts to rape a woman in his room, Harrison interrupts, coming to blows with the predator in the room’s bathroom. Harrison ultimately wins the fight by smashing the guy’s brains in with a toilet tank lid. And when it comes to cleaning up, let’s just say Harrison has learned quite a few things from his time spent with Pops in Iron Lake. “Harrison is a very impulsive character, and Dexter, ironically, while driven by a really strong impulse, is very disciplined on account of this guy,” Jack Alcott (Harrison) tells TVLine in the video above, while motioning to James Remar (Harry) beside him. “I think that that is a real gift that Harrison gets from Dexter… Being a really impulsive, reactive person can lead itself to all sorts of nasty situations and it is the discipline and the meticulousness that he received from his father that really gets him out of that situation in the hotel.” And about all that Iron Lake business? Dexter’s off the hook. Angela ran out of town, according to new Sheriff Teddy Reed. She apologized for mistakenly arresting Dexter for the murder of Matt Caldwell. The Iron Lake P.D. now thinks it was the guy’s father, Kurt, who did the deed. The cops also found a shell in Dexter’s jail cell which apparently proves that Logan shot at Dexter first, and that Dexter was only defending himself when he took him down. Sheriff Teddy even asks if Dexter wants to press charges against Angela and the department! He naturally declines. View the video above to hear more from Alcott, Michael C. Hall and David Zayas, then vote in the poll below and hit the comments!",
