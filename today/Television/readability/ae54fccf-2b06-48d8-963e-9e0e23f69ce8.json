  "text": "Did you ever hear the story about the cowboy alien and the soldier who fell in love on Roswell, New Mexico? Michael Guerin, a resident extraterrestrial with a rugged exterior and heart of gold, met Alex Manes, a gifted and kind Roswell native, when the two were merely kids. What started as a tentative friendship developed into an epic romance written in the cosmic stars. (Lewis Jacobs/The CW) It was far from roses and sunshine, but nothing could ultimately get in the way of a love like theirs. Roswell, New Mexico had the great fortune of being littered with great relationships. The series had an excellent track record in the love department, from Max and Liz to Kyle and Isobel in the final season. But when we first saw the insane chemistry between series stars Michael Vlamis and Tyler Blackburn, a true star-level ship was born. The passion between Malex was the kind that would knock you off your feet, and you needn’t look further than Roswell, New Mexico Season 1 Episode 1, to see just how connected the pair was. (Karen Kuehn/The CW) When we met the estranged pair, tension was in the air, and resentment was steadily building, but something else was also bubbling under the surface. It took until the end of the hour, when their desire and love boiled over, for the first glimpse of their relationship to emerge. As the story played out over the years, at times through flashbacks, you saw two young people who truly cared for one another. But they were driven apart by Alex’s abusive, horrifying father, who finally got his comeuppance during Roswell, New Mexico Season 2 when he died at the hand of his own son. (John Golden Britt/The CW) With Jesse Manes finally eradicated from their lives, the two still had some growing to do and continued work on themselves before they were ready to finally, after so many years, give their love a genuine opportunity to blossom. Once they were together, you saw how well-suited the two were, having spent the last few years reconnecting and developing a friendship they’d skipped over during the throes of adolescent wonder. Above all else, they were a team, and things weren’t always perfect. This was especially true during Roswell, New Mexico Season 4, when Alex was missing for most of the season, unbeknownst to Michael for quite some time. When Michael discovered his love was gone, he stopped at nothing to bring him home and never gave up on him. (Ursula Coyote/The CW) They never gave up on each other. It was incredibly fitting that Michael and Alex were the couple that got married in the series finale in the small town that had shaped so much of their lives. From high school sweethearts to fated lovers and husbands, their love story was a reminder to follow your heart. If it leads you back to your very first love, there’s a reason. (John Golden Britt/The CW) These two had been in love for years, and we like to imagine they spent the rest of their days just as in love as they’d always been and embracing the happily ever after they’d fought so hard to make theirs. Okay, fanatics, who else misses Roswell, New Mexico, and our beloved Malex? What do you think the two would be up to today? Let us know in the comments what you think Malex is up to nowadays and what your favorite part of their epic romance was! Watch Roswell, New Mexico Online",
