  "text": "The following contains spoilers from the first six episodes of Squid Game Season 2, now streaming on Netflix. Ahead of its Season 2 finale, Squid Game‘s sixth new episode invited its remaining players to “Mingle,” in a deadly version of the childhood ice breaker. Then at episode’s end, a melee took out several more players. Kang Ae-sim as Jang Geum-ja, Yang Dong-geun as Park Yong-sik 255 players entered the third game, “Mingle,” standing on a giant turntable until it and the jaunty music stopped. A number was then announced, determining the size of the groups they needed to quickly divide into, before darting into one of the small rooms forming the perimeter. The first sorting was into groups of “TEN!,” meaning we lost at least five. Next up was “FOUR!,” in which Player 001 (the Front Man, shhhh) selflessly broke away from Gi-hun (456), Jung-bae (390) and Dae-ho (388); there also was some drama when pregnant Jun-hee (222), transgender Hyun-ju (120), and Yong-sik (007) and his mom, Geum-ja (249), spurned shaman Seon-nyeo (044) — earning them a “curse” later. For “THREE!,” Yong-sik was literally dragged away from staying with his mom, and kindly/dependable Min-su (124) disappointed his group’s “noona,” Se-mi (380), by splitting off from her. (Gi-hun and Player 001 wound up “saving” Yong-sik’s mom.) Perhaps the most devastating round was “SIX!,” when Hyun-ju’s new friend Yung-mi got tripped during the frenzy, and “MG Coin” (333) slammed the door closed on her before the clock ran out, lest the others in their group all be executed. The final round was “TWO!,” and because there were 126 people left but only 50 rooms, a bloodbath was inevitable. Jung-bae wound up in a room of three, with Player 001 and some rando — but Player 001 choked the stranger to death in time to reduce their head count, shocking Jung-bae more than a bit. Choi Seung-hyun as Thanos (Netflix) In the calm after the “Mingle” storm…. MG Coin told Jun-hee he wants then to start over once they’re back outside, though she realizes (or at least suspects) that he is only after her share of the prize money to pour into an investment. Taking stock of the 100 players remaining, Gi-hun’s “X” team determined they need only six “O” players to change their mind — but before Gi-hun can give yet another “Quit or die!” speech, Player 001 urges the team leader to stay calm and let things play out. “O” winds up with the slimmest of leads, 50-49, with just Player 001 left to vote. Jung-bae privately worries about which way 001 will go, given the surprising behavior he just witnessed in their Mingle room. But Player 001 ties things up, 50-50, which dictates a re-vote the next morning. A new vote, of course, leads to more — and more aggressive — lobbying by each side. In the men’s room, Thanos and his crew taunt MG Coin about his vote, the money he ostensibly owes them for a bad crypto pitch, and his coziness with Jun-hee. Push comes to shove, shoves come to punches, and an all-out brawl erupts. Heads are smashed against sinks, stall doors are ripped off and used to bludgeon…. Thanos pins MG Coin on the floor and starts to choke him with his hands, but 333 swiftly changes fortunes by driving a fork, left over from their dinner kit, up and into his foe’s gullet. Fans of the Avengers films will be the first to tell you how it is with Thanos — always go for the head. Are you frankly sad to see Thanos go?
