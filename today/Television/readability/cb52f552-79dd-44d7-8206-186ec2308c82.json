  "text": "Remember when Pete had a crush on Alberta on Ghosts and she rejected him, and then the show kind of moved on? Well, the potential pairing might be back on! During this Thursday episode, Pete volunteers to keep an eye on Gabe, Jay’s stoned restaurant employee, and discovers a surprising new ghost ability: Since the spirits can smell, they can get high! Which is a very fitting reveal as it’s 4/20 in the installment and the episode is the 20th of the fourth season. While Gabe is smoking up in his car, Pete starts reminiscing about Bugles (which are still sold in stores and just as delicious as you remember, FYI!). Pete later catches up with Flower, who realizes that he’s “totally baked” like the bread he’s been admiring. Naturally, the honorable scout leader is horrified by what’s happening to him. He doesn’t smoke grass, he cuts grass, he exclaims. Hetty remarks to Alberta that Pete has, surprisingly, become something of a bad boy. Alberta is skeptical… until Hetty points out how Pete has been wandering and dating up a storm, was secretly in the mafia and punched Thor in the face after the Viking slept with Carol. Now, Alberta is intrigued and goes to Pete, who’s still high. Alberta leans in, puckers her lips ever so slightly and… Pete facepalms her, much to her embarrassment. Even though he’s had a crush Alberta for the longest time, he can’t be a cheater when he’s still with Donna. It’s been a while since the series addressed Pete’s feelings for Alberta, and her lack of them for him, but could this uncomfortable encounter be hinting at a big change ahead and a new Woodstone couple? Or do you think Alberta is suddenly into Pete for all the wrong reasons? Elsewhere in the episode, local mayor Tad (guest star Justin Kirk) hosts a campaign event at Jay’s restaurant and turns out be attic ghost Stephanie’s prom date. Hetty and Isaac think it’s a good idea to wake her, but they’re the ones who get a rude awakening when an angry Stephanie reveals that Tad left her to die. Stephanie wants Jay and Sam to expose Tad’s lies, but Jay is counting on the mayor helping them with the restaurant permits and argues that sometimes it’s OK for Sam to pick themselves over helping the ghosts. Stephanie’s “not even one of the main ghosts,” Jay adds. Ha! And also, ouch! Then basement ghost Nancy shares that she was there that fateful night and Stephanie is lying about Tad, who went after the killer before being knocked out. Stephanie is actually trying to get back at Tad for moving on with her best friend just days after her death. Unfortunately, Jay and Sam already had a change of heart and are outing the mayor in front of his guests, not knowing the truth. Sam bluffs about him passing a test and later lies that they were really high. Tad suggests they just split a gummy in the future and promises to give the permit office a call. Meanwhile, Stephanie discovers that Tad and her bestie found solace in each other after her death. They, eventually, got married and named their daughter after her, which finally wins mean Stephanie over. Not won over, though? Trevor, by Stephanie’s many hilariously blatant advances. Ghosts fans, what did you think of the episode? Are you into revisiting the idea of Pete and Alberta as a couple? Ghosts Powers, Ranked: Whose Special Ability Is Best? And Which One Stinks?",
