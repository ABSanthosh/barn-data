  "text": "James Gunn was keeping his Bat-options open by having Max‘s Creature Commandos — the animated series that official launched his and DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran’s new DCU — always show Batman in silhouette. Commandos‘ Dark Knight (well, his impaled corpse) was first glimpsed in the fourth episode, as part of a future hellscape envisioned by Circe. In this Thursday’s penultimate Season 1 episode, Batman was seen looming over an Ice Lounge party being thrown by Alex Sartorius, following the Gotham City scientist’s involuntary transformation into the radioactive skeleton/villain that would be dubbed Dr. Phosphorous. The latest peek at Batman was in near-full silhouette, backlit by lightning, once again keeping eagle-eyed DC fans from gleaning any intel on, say, the costume or chest logo sported by the new DCU’s version of the character — let alone if his exposed mouth and chin favors any particular actor (Robert Pattison included). “When they first gave [Creature Commandos Episode 6 animation] to me, we saw a lot more Batman,” Gunn shares in the video below, which was posted to Rotten Tomatoes. “And I was saying, ‘I am not ready to commit to that. I’m not read to commit to that. I’m not ready to commit to that.’ I was just like, ‘More silhouette, more silhouette, more silhouette.'” Any glimpses of the Caped Crusader instead were “a great way to show that Batman already exists in this universe,” Gunn explains. “Just like when we come to the Superman movie [starring David Corenswet and in theaters July 11], we see that Superman already exists, he’s already known by the people in Metropolis.” In other words, when it comes to Bats as well as Supes, “Yeah, we don’t need to hear the origin story again,” Gunn says. “That’s just a way to introduce that Batman is an important part of this universe, and he has an impact on it — including defeating such pretty dangerous, scary people like Phosphorus, who’s pretty tough.” “This is the DCU Batman,” Gunn affirms, echoing his affinity for the iconic comic book hero. “I love him and we’re gonna do great things with him” in the new DCU. “He’s the most popular superhero in the world and I can’t wait for people to see more of him, along with Superman, and together.” Want scoop on Creature Commandos, or for any other DC TV show?
