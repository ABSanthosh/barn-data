  "text": "St. Denis Medical broke through in a big way when it debuted on NBC in the fall, and the network issued some exciting news on Tuesday morning: St. Denis Medical Season 2 is a go.  The mockumentary is NBC’s first scripted renewal for the 2025-26 TV season. Make of that what you will.  (NBC) The freshman drama averages just under 4 million viewers and has a 0.5 rating in the demo, proving that the broadcast networks still have some life left.  NBC teases that the series has reached 21.4 million viewers to date, which is astounding, but it doesn’t hold much water when the network doesn’t break it down.  The Live + 7 numbers are enough to keep it on the air for several years.  St. Denis Medical Is A Big Hit (NBC) St. Denis Medical is set in an underfunded, understaffed Oregon hospital and focuses on its staff, who do the best they can with the resources they have.  It has a striking resemblance to prior broadcast TV hits Parks and Recreations and Abbott Elementary.  The humor comes from the characters being caught up in comical situations that force them to think on the fly and make decisions that will help both their patients and the hospital’s reputation.  The cast is led by Wendi McLendon-Covey (The Goldbergs) as Joyce. It is rounded out by David Alan Grier (In Living Color) as Ron, Allison Tolman (Fargo) as Alex, Josh Lawson (House of Lies) as Bruce, Kahyun Kim (American Gods) as Serena, Mekki Leeper (Jury Duty) as Matt, and Kaliko Kauahi (Superstore) as Val. Episodes currently air on Tuesdays at 8/7c, and the numbers are comparable to those of Night Court Season 2, which aired in the same timeslot last season.  (Ron Batzdorff/NBC) The Futures of Happy’s Place and Night Court Should Be Revealed Soon Now that NBC has picked up St. Denis Medical Season 2, a renewal for the Reba McEntire-fronted Happy’s Place is expected to be on the way. The Friday comedy averages 4.7 million viewers and a 0.40 rating with a week of DVR included.  Fellow NBC comedies Night Court and Lopez vs. Lopez face more worrying futures.  (NBC) Night Court has been declining since its high-flying premiere and has been freefalling this season, leading to concerns that the reboot won’t last much longer.  Lopez vs. Lopez could eke out another renewal, but Night Court is probably out for the count in this race.  NBC will make decisions soon about the rest of its lineup, so stay tuned for more. Check out our NBC cheat sheet for a full rundown of which shows have been renewed and canceled.  What are your thoughts on St. Denis Medical’s renewal?
