  "text": "Could the ridiculous Body \u0026 Soul storyline be almost over? Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-03-25 suggest there’s light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve never wanted any TV news more than that. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days Of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week Of 2-03-25 Suggest The Body \u0026 Soul Stalker May Be Revealed Soon Normally, if the week included a ton of spoilers for the story about a soap within a soap, I’d be beyond aggravated. However, it does seem possible that the storyline is near an end.  For one thing, many Body \u0026 Soul cast members get shocking news, and learning the stalker’s identity would fit that description. Additionally, spoilers say that Whitley King — the weirdo who convinced Abe she was his wife when he had amnesia — will be back for one episode on February 5. Whitley is an annoying, ridiculous character, but if she’s back because she’s the stalker and the cops are about to catch her, that justifies her reappearance. That said, I’m also wondering if Xander could be involved somehow. (Peacock/Screenshot) He threatened to destroy Body \u0026 Soul if Kate didn’t do what he wanted a while ago, and Kate had the guts to stand up to him. Xander doesn’t seem like the type to poison cupcakes or purposely send Bonnie down an elevator shaft, but he does do all sorts of shady things. That plot twist would be annoying, but it would also fit a Days of Our Lives spoiler for the week of 2-03-25 that says Sarah will uncover the truth about something. She already knows that Philip forged the letter, giving him half of Victor’s company, so what else is there for her to discover? She also works at the hospital, so she’s in a good position to find out more about how Bonnie ended up walking into the elevator shaft. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-03-25 say that Hattie will confront Leo. However, this is likely a red herring as far as the stalker story goes. Hattie just got her job back after forgiving Bonnie, so there’s no reason she’d turn out to be the stalker who tried to kill her. Besides, she was already interrogated about this and is not a good liar. However, Hattie isn’t happy about her character’s re-entry storyline on Body \u0026 Soul. Kate told her she was contractually obligated to do what was in the script without complaint. (Peacock/Screenshot) The contract doesn’t say anything about not bothering the writer about revising the next script before she sees it, though — and even if it does, that won’t stop Hattie from thinking she’s found a loophole. Leo has just become “best friends” with Marlena (which is another annoying issue since it breaks about 1,000 ethical guidelines), so now he needs to make up with Hattie so he can have double the fun with the lookalikes. However, he probably won’t appreciate Hattie bothering him about the scripts. These scenes are likely to be ridiculous. Leo is a silly character, and so is Hattie, and when they get together, it tends to be a waste of airtime. Still, if this is the last Body \u0026 Soul-related scene involving Leo and one of Deidre Hall’s characters, it’ll be worth sitting through so that we can get to the end of this nonsensical storyline. (Peacock/Screenshot) Meanwhile, The Fake Rafe Wedding Grinds To A Halt I’m disappointed that the real Rafe left his brains behind when he tried to escape from EJ’s clutches. He should have locked EJ in the secret room when he left, and it made no sense for him to trust EJ’s assistant to give him a phone to call the cops. As cliche as it would have been, I’d have loved for Rafe to derail the wedding with an announcement that the guy Jada was about to marry was not him. However, this annoying story might be almost over even without Rafe interrupting his own wedding. According to Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-03-25, Steve offers Jada a theory about what went wrong after the aborted wedding. Steve’s in the best position to realize that “Rafe” is not who he claims to be.  (Peacock/Screenshot) “Rafe’s” behavior at the bachelor party was so out of character that Steve had to wonder what was going on. There’s no way the real Rafe would insist he didn’t have to get his boss’ permission to take a case or have some secret mission involving EJ. Plus, the fake Rafe made up a story about being out of town on Steve’s assignment and wrote strange texts to Jada. Come on, Steve, crack this thing wide open! Interestingly, another spoiler says that Paulina questions “Rafe” after the wedding.  EJ’s plan involves planting fake evidence that Jada is a dirty cop so that Paulina fires her and replaces her with the Rafe lookalike, but could Paulina be helping Steve set up a sting? (Peacock/Screenshot) Paulina’s usually pretty on the ball, and EJ’s plan is ridiculous. He’s the only person in Salem who wants so desperately to be back in the DA’s seat that he would frame Jada and put a friendlier face in the commissioner’s office. Plus, Rafe would never abandon Jada because of so-called evidence that she did something wrong, especially after Ava did the same thing to him. What About The Other Kidnapping Story? The Days of Our Lives Season 60 spoiler video shows Kristen rescuing Ava, who tells her that someone else is in the Blake house, which may happen this week. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-03-25 say that Kristen “covers her tracks” with Brady.  I’m not sure what that means, but it would make sense for her to realize that Rachel sent the text that supposedly came from Ava. Kristen would be happy for Ava to be out of the way, but she also seems to be determined for her daughter to follow a different path in life than she did. It’s beyond me why she wants Rachel to live up to her namesake instead of being like her when Kristen’s mother (if that’s who this version of the Woman in White really is) doesn’t seem any less evil than Kristen! (Peacock/Screenshot) However, in the name of saving her daughter from being complicit in multiple felonies, Kristen might try to rescue Ava herself. Ironically, doing that might be exactly what Brady needs to see Kristen in a different light. However, Kristen can’t help being Kristen, so she’ll probably try to keep the whole thing secret until she’s ready to use it to her advantage. It will also be interesting if Kristen does come face-to-face with her supposedly dead mother. Kristen has been nostalgic lately, which fits her mother’s re-entrance into Salem life. Any reunion scene is bound to be emotional.  Kristen might also struggle to reconcile her idealized version of her mother with this woman who does the same horrible things that she does. In any event, I’ll be thrilled if this Ava story is short-lived.  While I don’t particularly love Ava and Brady together and wish he’d find someone who didn’t start out dating and then torturing his father, I like these repeated kidnapping stories even less. (Peacock/Screenshot) Stephanie’s news shocks Abe and Kate, so the chances are she’s quitting Body \u0026 Soul because she wants to be with Alex. Joy also has news for Alex, which means she’s probably fallen for him and is as determined as Stephanie to be with him. Chanel and Johnny might reconcile, as they are supposed to have a heart-to-heart.
