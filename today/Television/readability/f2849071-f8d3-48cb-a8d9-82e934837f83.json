  "description": "Superman \u0026 Lois‘ series finale, which earned an “A” from TVLine readers, helped the show’s titular duo reach an emotionally satisfying conclusion — but their story wasn’t supposed to end there. Prior to the CW drama’s cancellation, co-showrunners Todd Helbing and Brent Fletcher hoped to have at least seven seasons to properly tell the Man […]",

  "text": "Yeah this show deserved more Season to fully run it’s course,it’s always damn annoying when there is interference just because TPTB want to cash in a movie and can’t still comprehend to the date that it’s possible fow two different things to co-exist and it works better for the IP to be dominating on both the big and small screen, esp. when they deal with Multiverse logic. And also I blame the new cheap owners of The CW, Nexstar, filling their mouths saying they would keep the shows about family messages as long as they were “economically easy” and they made ratings. This show did both yet it was still forced to end. The frame of Jordan and Jon getting their respective suits as Clark realized that it was about time to start thinking about his legacy and the fact that now he really needed help given his health care condition and stop working alone as he was used to in order to continue protecting the world is something that I envision would’ve been a huge tease cliffhanger in a proper and longer 4th Season wrap up. I can imagine the hype it’d been to finally see them getting their costumes but leaving the full reveal for Season 5. The same thing goes to the shot of the Kents and Irons flying together could’ve how S4 ended. A part of me believes S4 was Clark dealing and accepting that with his new human heart he can’t keep Jon and Jordan in training wheels and would have to live up to what he said, both of them working together could be better than him. But the 3? A mighty team. On the other hand the storyline from the 7th episode where he revealed himself to the world is something IMO that could’ve been brought up to this final Season when in fact it could’ve been a culmination of the 5th one, let S4 be where it’s a recurring and building key point that the people of Smallville are suspicious of how Superman died and Clark was missing but then both returned, but don’t capitalize on it just yet. Building up to that iconic unmasking in the diner could’ve been a perfect S5 bookend IMHO. The same thing as it happened, but just as the cliffhanger of Season 5. Getting to do Darkseid is bold, Smallville only was allowed to use him as a cloud of smoke. But they could’ve used more of Tom Cavanagh’s Gordon Godfrey for that. TBH I thought they had other plans for other villains not done yet like Cyborg Superman or Mongul. Would’ve been cool to see a giant Deathstar-esque ship like the Warworld appearing in the sky and threaten to level Smallville. Maybe even recreate the iconic Flash Fam super sonic punch from the S4 finale to destroy the STAR Labs satelite The Thinke sent crashing but now with Clark, Jordan and Jon hitting the Warworld. A take of their own with the Black Mercy perhaps even. When you got a good show like this that accomplishes this kind of feats with it’s TV budget and it’s got tons of material left to cover to just go and cancel it despite it’s loyal fanbase is simply a jerk move, typical of these foolish execs. Same thing happened with Stargirl except that at least S\u0026L was allowed one more lap to end on it’s terms instead of being forced to do a “break glass in case of emergency” ending despite the massive fan campaigning that got. That said it’s nice the showrunners can share with us what were their plans for the future, Geoff Johns on the other hand still hasn’t shared much about what was in store post that flash forward tease with Shade and Jay Garrick. Man do I need Gunn to revive that show as part of the Elseworlds label… I’ll end this saying that theoretically there is a gap in-between the present and the timejump they took us in of 32 years. It’s a blank space to properly explore a lot more of what happened after Lex was defeated and a chance to see more of Alex Garfin and Michael Bishop in their suits. In a world in which IPs can flesh out the past with prequels (GoT) and Star Wars can do as well in the past (The Acolyte, Kenobi, Andor) and middle PLUS also past (New Republic: Ahsoka, Mandalorian, Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew) I don’t see why Superman \u0026 Lois can’t get the same treatment of the latter. Good luck James Gunn, because you’re gonna need it now more than ever.",
