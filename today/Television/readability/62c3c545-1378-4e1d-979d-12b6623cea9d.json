  "text": "We have good news and bad news for fans of Amazon’s ad-supported streaming service Freevee. The bad news is that the online retail giant announced today that it will be shutting the platform down after five years. And the news comes just as we were gearing up for the final season of Bosch: Legacy! (Freevee (YouTube screenshot)) The good news is that all of the content that made Freevee such a favorite among fans of quality original programming will still be available. Yes, you’ll still be able to watch the final episodes of Bosch: Legacy, as well as other popular Freevee series, like Judy Justice, Neighbours, Tribunal Justice, Jury Duty, and High School. In a statement issued to Variety, reps for Amazon confirmed that Freevee’s entire content library will soon be available on Prime Video. “We have built Prime Video into a first-stop entertainment destination where customers can personalize their viewing experience by streaming exclusive Prime member entertainment produced by Amazon MGM Studios, licensed movies and series, content from other services as an add-on subscription, live sports, blockbuster movies and series to rent or buy, FAST [free, ad-supported streaming TV] channels and the complete Amazon Freevee content offering.” (Aaron Epstein/Amazon) In other words, Amazon finally figured out that there was no point in offering two separate streaming services. So Freevee users will now need to find their content elsewhere, but this news is much less catastrophic than past streaming service closings. Of course, now that Amazon offers multiple ad-based platforms (many with numerous live channel options), the streaming world is beginning to feel a lot like a cable. But that’s a conversation for another time. Today’s Freevee news isn’t terribly surprising or upsetting. But it is another reminder that after a decade of aggressive expansion, the streaming landscape is now contracting. (Lindsay Sarazin/Prime Video) Freevee began life as IMDb TV, and soon it will be no more. But in a possible indication that streaming execs are finally realizing that it’s bad business to piss off subscribers, the platform’s content will live on. Beyond Black Beauty (which is already streaming on Prime Video) will enjoy the distinction of being Freevee’s very last original series. The platform will be gradually phased out in the weeks to come. What do you think, TV fanatics? Is Amazon doing us a solid by providing a new home for all those Freevee shows?
