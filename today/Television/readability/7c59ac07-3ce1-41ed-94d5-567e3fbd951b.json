  "text": "Scott Pilgrim has run out of lives on Netflix. The streamer has cancelled the animated spinoff Scott Pilgrim Takes Off after one season, co-writer and creator Bryan Lee O’Malley announced via social media on Wednesday. “We were recently informed that the show will NOT return,” O’Malley says. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” (TVLine has reached out to Netflix for comment.) O’Malley added that “it was an honor to work with all of the cast [and] staff around the world. It was like conducting a symphony orchestra every day. From the moment [co-writer BenDavid Grabinski] sparked the idea, the project felt like a one of a kind miracle.” Scott Pilgrim Takes Off was an animated adaptation of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels penned by O’Malley, which inspired the 2010 live-action film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. The plot centers on Scott Pilgrim, a Canadian indie rock slacker who falls in love with a girl named Ramona Flowers and then has to fight her seven evil exes in video game-style battles. Only in Takes Off, Scott is defeated in his first battle and vanishes, leaving Ramona and his friends to search for him for the rest of the series. The cast of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World returned to voice their characters in Takes Off, with Michael Cera as Scott and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona. The supporting cast included Kieran Culkin, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, Brie Larson, Aubrey Plaza, Brandon Routh, Alison Pill, Jason Schwartzman, Mae Whitman and Ellen Wong, among others. Scott Pilgrim Takes Off debuted on Netflix in November 2023 with a eight-episode freshman season, earning critical acclaim. (Check out our finale post mortem with O’Malley and Grabinski.)
