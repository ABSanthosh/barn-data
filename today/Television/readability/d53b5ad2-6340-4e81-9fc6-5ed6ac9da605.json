  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.5 / 5.04.5 We’ve complained many times about the horrific crimes that Will and the others experience on Will Trent. The series finally answered our prayers on Will Trent Season 3 Episode 12. Will had difficulty processing Marco’s death and didn’t think he deserved forgiveness. Going undercover in a dangerous cult with other vulnerable and broken people seemed like a horrible idea, but Will seemed determined to get back in the field to fix things. (Zac Popik/Disney) Amanda and Angie were the only people who noticed how badly Will was affected, which was more noticeable because of his feud with Faith. Will Trent Season 3 Episode 12 Showcased Will’s Trauma and the Aftermath Realistically Will has endured so much suffering, yet he has never gotten any treatment. I wanted to jump for joy when we saw Will in therapy, even if he resisted. That was realistic. Will seemed so angry and needed a therapist who understood neurodivergence better. While talking about emotions was a good start, shoving something to read in Will’s face only triggered him more. Will: I feel like you’re bad at your job. I feel like this is a huge waste of time. I feel like no matter what I do in here, it’s not going bring Marco back to life. Killing a child traumatized Will. But it’s one of the few times we’ve seen the aftermath, and Ramon Rodriguez portrays the emotional depth remarkably. (Daniel Delgado Jr/ Disney) Those visions were difficult to watch as Marion asked about Marco, and Will saw Marco’s bloodied body again. Poor Betty must be scarred by now, too, since she couldn’t even comfort Will. Will didn’t handle being on desk duty and only being allowed to process old cases. He’s one of those people who functions best by keeping busy and helping others. He needed to be back in the field, but Amanda and Angie thought he needed time to heal, something Will countered that he didn’t deserve. Will Wanted to Suffer Indefinitely, and Only Amanda and Angie Knew How to Handle Him Amanda loves Will so much, and letting him return to work nearly broke her heart because she couldn’t watch him.  (Zac Popik/Disney) Olas Collective proved they would kill their members if they knew too much, which frightened Amanda. She hated that he wouldn’t forgive himself because she wanted to define him by more than his job and mistakes, a fact she’d learned firsthand. She knew Will would never berate others for a mistake like he did himself, and she needed him to forgive himself so that he would not fall deeper into despair. While Amanda seems complicated, she loves deeply, and thankfully, she has Sunny to help her through worrying about Will. Will tried to eliminate everyone from his life. Only Will made it through the brick wall and got down on his level to remind him that they had survived everything together. I initially wondered if Angie and Will would reconcile, but they are better as friends, though it’s amusing how geeked Will and Seth get about the same things. (Daniel Delgado Jr/ Disney) Maybe Angie found a less dramatic version of Will, which may help her, too. I’m not surprised that Will and Marion ended things. They seemed more like a flirty, fun couple than a long-haul couple, and Will isn’t ready to let anyone in. He needs to wallow, and few people have the patience for that. Faith Took This Feud To The Next Level I totally called it when I predicted that Amanda wouldn’t allow Faith to end her partnership with Will over communication differences. First, Will is the closest thing Amanda considers to her kid, and he’s been through hell, so she wouldn’t want him to suffer more needlessly. However, it looked like Faith had a personal problem without a valid reason. She worsened things by going to Marion, who became suspicious and couldn’t legally change anything. (Zac Popik/Disney) I love how fierce Faith is, but lying about things didn’t suit her.  Will tried to help Jeremy at that moment, and the more people she tried to involve, the more likely it was that Jeremy could get made and hurt. Faith doesn’t want that on her conscience. Michael Ormewood Made a Delightful Wingman Michael Ormewood made a delightful wingman, bringing comic relief and meaningful insight to this episode.  He was clueless about interrupting Angie and Seth’s lunch date, yet he and Faith meshed well with them. It was only awkward how well they got along without Will, since he’s usually the link between them. (Daniel Delgado Jr/ Disney) Watching Ormewood with his two female close friends on the case was entertaining as they explored the land. The trio made a fun team; I wouldn’t mind seeing them work together again. Ormewood is his best in dad mode, and he was rightfully furious that someone would expose a teenager to guns more than snacks. Amanda utilized that and made Ormewood her wingman when confronting Reign, the cult leader, portrayed by Robin Weigert (Tracker). Those two made a fierce duo. Nothing got past them. Amanda didn’t believe anything that woman sold, including that she gave birth to that baby. I appreciated that Mike insinuated that she was careless for letting that teenager around guns since he would never allow his children around them unsupervised. Michael Ormewood saw what a fake this woman was, but that she needed to be in control. Breastfeeding that baby was a power move, especially if she stole it from one of the victims. (Zac Popik/Disney) I pray they get justice for Jade because multiple miscarriages are a horrible thing to endure, and Reign needs to be stopped. Olas Collective Knew How to Prey on Vulnerable People, and Will Could Be Their Next Victim While technically, cults aren’t illegal, Olas Collective knew how to prey on vulnerable people, and Will noticed that when he attended the first wellness seminar, yet the atmosphere appealed to him. No one told him it wasn’t his fault. People were allowed to grieve at their own pace, including thinking that they were awful people. Sometimes, that is needed, but having all these people cut ties with their friends and family wasn’t healthy.  It will fit the profile of someone needing help too well. (Zac Popik/Disney) He only changed his story to make himself sound like a negligent driver, but his grief and regret were genuine. While it’s understandable that he thought he could gather more information from the inside, I fear that he’ll get hurt. Will doesn’t think he deserves anything good. He’s pushed away everybody who cares for him; not even Betty can offer comfort. Right now, finding justice and working are the only things helping Will to survive. (Zac Popik/Disney) We’ll have to wait until the next episode to find out if Will still hid his satellite phone elsewhere to give Amanda updates and what he learns at this retreat.
