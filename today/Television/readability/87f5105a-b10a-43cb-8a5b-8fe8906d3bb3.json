  "text": "Jay Leno to Reunite With Tim Allen on Shifting Gears — Get a First LookWe all know Jay Leno loves cars, so it was only a matter of time before he paid a visit to Tim Allen‘s Shifting Gears. Leno will make a cameo as himself in the March 12 episode of Allen’s ABC comedy, TVLine has learned, with Leno bringing his car into the auto restoration shop run by Allen’s character Matt for a repair. ABC has released a first-look photo as well, which you can see here: This marks a reunion for Leno and Allen, with Leno recurring on Allen’s previous sitcom Last Man Standing as Joe, a mechanic at the sporting goods store where Allen’s Mike Baxter worked. Leno and Allen both rose to fame as stand-up comics in the ’80s as well, and share a love of cars, with Allen appearing on Leno’s reality show Jay Leno’s Garage. Elsewhere in the March 12 episode of Shifting Gears, titled “Gummies,” “Riley is horrified when she finds weed gummies in Carter’s pocket, prompting surprising advice from Matt,” per the official synopsis. “Meanwhile, Eve inadvertently lands Gabriel and Stitch in hot water after asking them to donate to a charity auction.” Shifting Gears is also bringing back Allen’s Last Man Standing wife Nancy Travis for an episode airing this Wednesday (8/7c, ABC), and Raising Hope alum Lucas Neff joined the cast earlier this month as Jimmy, the estranged husband of Kat Dennings’ Riley. Happy to see Leno and Allen together again? Hit the comments to share your thoughts on the casting news.",
