  "text": "While The Penguin Season 1 Episode 2 showed off the writers’ knack for white-knuckle suspense, this week’s installment slowed things down a bit and put the focus back on the characters and their backstories. Of course, The Penguin Season 1 Episode 3 still offered plenty of high-stakes drama, particularly in its wildly unexpected conclusion. TV Fanatic writers Lisa Babick, Whitney Evans, and Thomas Godwin discussed that game-changing ending as well as what might come next for Oz, Sofia, and Vic in this week’s round table discussion. Take a look: (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) After a twisty and chaotic second episode, The Penguin Season 1 Episode 3 slowed down a bit (at least until the end). We got into the logistics of Oz and Sofia’s partnership, and we learned a lot about what motivates Vic. What were your biggest takeaways from all that character development? Lisa: I loved how this episode gave us a deeper look into the characters, especially with the dynamics between Oz, Sofia, and Vic. For me, one of the biggest takeaways was seeing Oz’s attachment to Vic deepen and how that’s going to complicate things down the line. Oz might try to play the role of the calculating wanna-be crime boss, but his emotions slip through, especially when it comes to Vic. The bathroom scene is a perfect example. We’ve talked about this before, but it’s almost like he sees a bit of himself in Vic, but that’s also what makes Vic such a dangerous loose end for him. Vic’s motivations really stood out, too. At first, it seemed like he was sticking around purely out of loyalty or maybe fear, but after this episode, you can tell he’s playing his own game. His quick thinking with the cop during the drug deal showed us he’s more resourceful than we might’ve expected. But is that enough to survive in Oz’s world? I’m not sure, especially with the way Oz manipulates and uses everyone around him. Vic’s got some smarts, but whether or not he’s cut out for this world remains the big question. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) The partnership between Oz and Sofia is another fascinating layer. Sofia’s clearly not someone to be messed with, and while they might seem like partners now, I wouldn’t be surprised if Oz starts distancing himself from her soon, especially now that he screwed her over, leaving her in the alley. He won’t be able to talk himself out of it, not only because he left her there but also because his duplicity with Maronis came to light. Oz is a traitor, and Sofia isn’t going to let that go, especially because he’s betrayed her before — she’s going to rank Oz right up there with the other “old men.” Whitney: Oz is the star of this show, and I love seeing different sides of him. I love seeing how he thinks of his feet, but also how easily he can be triggered, like in the scene with Johnny Viti. He was hitting every single one of Oz’s insecurities, and if Sofia hadn’t been there and they didn’t need something from him, we could have easily seen an Alberto 2.0. The relationship between Oz and Vic also hit that point you knew it was always going to reach. Vic hasn’t exactly had one foot out the door, but he’s also never been as invested as Oz would have liked. With Garciela, he was finally able to hear from someone he loved about the life he was getting into, and he did waver, and it did force him to make a choice. I’m not sure if this is ultimately the life for Vic, but this was such a great episode to flesh his character out more and give much greater insight into who he is and that pull within him. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Thomas: Vic doesn’t have a family or a purpose anymore, and it’s not surprising that he chose the Penguin over a potential love interest, even if he struggled with it throughout the episode. Oz offers him something he can’t get anywhere else — a mentorship/fatherhood bond versus the virtual unknown of hopping on the bus and hitting the road. Vic sees an opportunity for something more than just a stuttering kid who lost everything, and Oz sees a bit of himself in Vic. The biggest takeaway is that the rumors may be true, and we are seeing the HBOMax version of Victor Zsasz, a particularly nasty killer in the comics who lacks empathy for his victims. The writers seem interested in exploring the parallels between Oz, Sofia, and Vic. What do you make of the ways in which they’ve all been shaped by their difficult family situations? Lisa: The family dynamics are really interesting in this episode, and I think it’s one of the strongest aspects of the writing. All three – Oz, Sofia, and Vic – have been shaped by their families, but in very different ways. For Oz, we know his attachment to his mother is central to his character. It drives a lot of his decisions and, honestly, his ruthlessness. He’s trying to be the crime boss, but you can tell he’s still influenced by that relationship, which makes him unpredictable. It’s almost like he’s trying to prove himself as someone powerful while still holding on to that familial loyalty. Sofia, on the other hand, is straight-up calculating. The whole drug idea was hers, which shows just how smart and rebellious she is. Coming from the Falcone family, it’s clear that growing up in that world has hardened her. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Her emotional vulnerability comes from being fed up with her family treating her like a fragile, broken china doll. While it’s not the same kind of vulnerability we see in Oz, it’s even more dangerous. She’s got nothing and no one to protect, so her anger drives her revenge. But like Oz, she knows how to use people to her advantage, and that’s what makes her such a dangerous player. Then there’s Vic, who’s completely out of his depth in comparison. His family situation seems to be his Achilles’ heel. Losing his parents to Riddler’s madness has clearly left a mark on him, and while he’s resourceful, I think his family trauma might be driving him in ways he hasn’t fully processed yet. Is he sticking around for survival, or is there something deeper — like revenge? It’s interesting how the writers are weaving in these family elements to shape their motivations, and it feels like it’s only going to get messier from here. Whitney: There’s still a lot we don’t know about Oz, but it’s safe to say with the little we’ve seen of him and Francis, there’s a fierce devotion there. And there’s a desire to be something his mother can be proud of, in whatever form that may be. It’s clear that trying to be somebody is perhaps the most important thing for Oz to accomplish, and I look forward to diving into his past more to fully see where that comes from. Sofia feels a little lost sometimes but also just stubborn and desperate to make up for lost time. She’s holding onto a lot of resentment and it’s obvious that she feels alone and is very much aware that she’s alone. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Outside of Alberto, I doubt she’s trusted anyone in her family for a long time, and she’s sort of adrift. It’ll be interesting to see how she continues to make a name for herself outside of the family, while also still needing the Falcone name to make serious moves in Gotham. Vic’s story feels like one we’ve seen before. This episode reminded me that Vic lost his family not that long ago, and he’s still very much grieving while also trying to move forward because he doesn’t really have a choice. But like Lisa mentioned, is there something deeper going on? Thomas: Complex characters can make or break a story, but The Penguin finds a solid balance between character building and moving the plot along. The restaurant scene is a little overdone, especially since Oz has already extended his affidavit on life previously. But part of what makes The Penguin so enthralling is the convergence of backgrounds. Vic comes from a loving family, while Oz is the product of an overbearing mother obsessed with convincing her son that he’s stuck in a black-and-white world — all or nothing, fail or succeed. We know some of Sofia’s background as well, but finding out how Bliss was used to keep her sedated and sedentary throughout her time in Arkham adds a rather ghastly aspect to her background. All three backgrounds are a bit different, especially where Vic is concerned, yet it seems all trails lead to the criminal underworld of Gotham City. The episode title, “Bliss,” obviously refers to the newest drug on Gotham’s club scene. Do you think it applied to any of the other storylines as well? Lisa: Yeah, while “Bliss” is obviously the name of the new drug in Gotham, I think the title fits a lot of what’s going on beneath the surface for the characters too. Oz, for example, is chasing his own version of bliss—power and control. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) He’s got this twisted sense of fulfillment when he’s pulling the strings and manipulating everyone around him. But we know that’s not real “bliss,” it’s just temporary. The cracks are already showing, and as much as he’s trying to be this calculating and smart wanna-be crime lord, you can see that his need for control is a kind of addiction in itself. For Vic, “bliss” might be the illusion of freedom or the idea that he can still carve out a life for himself, separate from the mess he’s found himself in. He had a shot to leave, but instead, he’s staying in this dangerous world. Maybe he thinks he’s close to finding his own version of bliss — whether that’s revenge or security — but I feel like that’s going to slip away from him pretty quickly. Sofia, on the other hand, seems completely uninterested in any kind of bliss. She’s all about power and survival, and I think that makes her deadly. For her, there’s no illusion of happiness or fulfillment, just the cold, hard reality of getting what she wants. So yeah, the title might be about the drug, but it really taps into what each character is chasing—whether that’s power, control, or even revenge. Whitney: Bliss certainly seems to be what Oz is after. He’s hellbent on being a major player in Gotham, someone who commands respect, like Carmine, someone he presumably studied and looked up to. Of all the characters, he’s the one most wanting and working toward finding a sort of bliss to bring purpose to his life. Thomas: Like most illegal narcotics, Bliss comes at a cost. While the side effects of Bliss aren’t explicitly referenced, it’s an excellent analogy for the lives of Oz, Sofia, and Vic as they struggle to reach the top. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Every celebratory moment, success, and triumph is fleeting. Vic enjoys basking in the limelight as Oz’s bagman right before having a PTSD meltdown. Sofia and Oz patch things up after making a successful deal, only to find themselves on their knees, facing the wrong end of a gun. Of course, the biggest headline from this episode is that wild ending. What do you think happened to Sofia? And if Oz really ditched her, what does that mean for their partnership? Lisa: That ending was intense, right? Vic ramming the car into Nadia’s men was a bold move, but what really stood out was Oz’s decision to ditch Sofia. If she survived—and honestly, it’s hard to imagine she didn’t—there’s no way she’s going to let that slide. Sofia’s not someone you leave behind without consequences. Oz might be thinking he’s protecting himself or making a strategic move, but if he did leave her to fend for herself, that could completely shatter their partnership. Oz has been walking a fine line, trying to manipulate everyone around him, but ditching Sofia might just be the step that pushes her to turn on him — again. She’s already got her own agenda, and now that Oz has shown he’s willing to throw her under the bus when it suits him, their trust — if there ever was any — is gone. I wouldn’t be surprised if Sofia starts plotting her revenge or even teams up with someone else to take Oz down — like Nadia, for example. She’s smart, calculating, and now, she’s pissed. As for Vic, his decision to drive off after the hit shows he’s in deep with Oz, even though he wanted to wait for Sofia. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) It’s clear that he’s trapped in this world now, and I don’t think Oz sees him as anything more than a pawn. Vic’s loyalty is going to come back to bite him, and with Sofia on the warpath, things are about to get messy. Whitney: I wondered if maybe the Maronis took Sofia, and if so, Oz should be fully exposed after 3 minutes alone with one of them. But if that’s not the case, and she made it out of there without anyone catching her, she’ll be even more turned off from Oz than she already is. No matter how smooth his words are, Sofia does not trust that man at all. His willingness to just leave her there, AFTER being called out by Nadia, will only show her that Oz is hiding things and only about saving himself. Their partnership lasted a whopping day, which is kind of impressive when you think about it. Thomas: The Oz and Sofia pairing is one of the most effective parts of episode three, and it would be a shame if it all came crashing down this early in the game. Then again, these are not the kind of people who help the elderly cross a busy intersection. It was only a matter of time before Sofia and Oz’s newfound criminal relationship reached its conclusion. However, I’m betting Oz’s extraordinary smooth-talking talents will soothe things over in episode 4. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) In a way, the ending was Vic’s finest hour. But it was also the kind of night he might look back on with regret for the rest of his life. What did you think of his decision to remain in Gotham and stick with Oz? Lisa: Vic staying in Gotham and sticking with Oz is definitely a decision he’s going to regret. Sure, in the moment, it might feel like his finest hour — he’s thinking on his feet, saving Oz’s skin, and proving himself. But the deeper he gets into this world, the more dangerous it becomes for him. He had a chance to leave with his girlfriend and start over, but by staying, he’s chosen to tie himself to a guy like Oz, who’s only going to use him until he’s no longer useful. I think Vic is caught between wanting to prove he can survive in this world and knowing deep down that he’s not cut out for it. He’s already shown he can make quick decisions, like bribing the cop and taking out Nadia’s men, but the cost of staying loyal to Oz is going to catch up with him. Vic’s not from this life, and I don’t think he’s fully realized just how deep he’s in. By choosing to stay, he’s crossed a line, and there’s no going back now. This was a huge moment for Vic, but I feel like the regret is going to come later once he starts to see just how ruthless Oz can be. He might’ve saved Oz for now, but that loyalty is a double-edged sword, and I don’t think it’s going to end well for him. Whitney: This is the kind of story where you know that no one’s truly going to get a happy ending, so sure, Vic will end up regretting this, but in the moment, it was badass. He thought of his feet, and he did what needed to be done to protect the person who may be sadistically cruel at times but has had his back. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Vic’s in such a predicament because he’s emotionally vulnerable, and Oz’s ideas and confidence are so alluring that you can almost see the vision in front of him. Vic trying to convince himself sometimes to believe Oz. But he’s still so unsure of himself and his place. Saving Oz will only strengthen the mentor/mentee dynamic between the two, and I wonder how much Vic will take advantage of learning from someone like Oz. Thomas: What interests me most about the final scene is how Vic looks at Oz from here on out. He knows how Oz is dedicated to this entire charade in order to elevate himself. But, there has to be some consequence in watching Oz instantly choose self-preservation when more than just his own life is on the line. It will be interesting to see if Oz’s leaving Sofia behind has any bearing on Vic’s view of him. Watch The Penguin Online",

All three – Oz, Sofia, and Vic – have been shaped by their families, but in very different ways. For Oz, we know his attachment to his mother is central to his character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e It drives a lot of his decisions and, honestly, his ruthlessness.

But the deeper he gets into this world, the more dangerous it becomes for him. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a chance to leave with his girlfriend and start over, but by staying, he’s chosen to tie himself to a guy like Oz, who’s only going to use him until he’s no longer useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think Vic is caught between wanting to prove he can survive in this world and knowing deep down that he’s not cut out for it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s already shown he can make quick decisions, like bribing the cop and taking out Nadia’s men, but the cost of staying loyal to Oz is going to catch up with him. Vic’s not from this life, and I don’t think he’s fully realized just how deep he’s in. By choosing to stay, he’s crossed a line, and there’s no going back now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a huge moment for Vic, but I feel like the regret is going to come later once he starts to see just how ruthless Oz can be. He might’ve saved Oz for now, but that loyalty is a double-edged sword, and I don’t think it’s going to end well for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhitney: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is the kind of story where you know that no one’s truly going to get a\u003ca href=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/happy-endings-cast-talks-revival-everybody-wants-to-do-it/\"\u003e happy ending\u003c/a\u003e, so sure, Vic will end up regretting this, but in the moment, it was badass. He thought of his feet, and he did what needed to be done to protect the person who may be sadistically cruel at times but has had his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"774\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/The-Penguin-Season-1-Episode-2-7.jpg\" alt=\"Making his next move.\" srcset=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/The-Penguin-Season-1-Episode-2-7.jpg 774w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/The-Penguin-Season-1-Episode-2-7-227x300.jpg 227w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/The-Penguin-Season-1-Episode-2-7-768x1016.jpg 768w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/The-Penguin-Season-1-Episode-2-7-726x960.jpg 726w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/09/The-Penguin-Season-1-Episode-2-7.jpg\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVic’s in such a predicament because he’s emotionally vulnerable, and Oz’s ideas and confidence are so alluring that you can almost see the vision in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eVic trying to convince himself sometimes to believe Oz. But he’s still so unsure of himself and his place. Saving Oz will only strengthen the mentor/mentee dynamic between the two, and I wonder how much Vic will take advantage of learning from someone like Oz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThomas: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat interests me most about the final scene is how Vic looks at Oz from here on out. He knows how Oz is dedicated to this entire charade in order to elevate himself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut, there has to be some consequence in watching Oz instantly choose self-preservation when more than just his own life is on the line. It will be interesting to see if Oz’s leaving Sofia behind has any bearing on Vic’s view of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatch The Penguin Online\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003ca target=\"_blank\" data-original=\"https://www.justwatch.com\" href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/us\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"JustWatch\" height=\"10px\" width=\"66px\" src=\"https://www.tvfanatic.com/wp-content/themes/tvf-trellis/images/just-watch.png\" id=\"mv-trellis-img-1\" loading=\"lazy\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n            \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
