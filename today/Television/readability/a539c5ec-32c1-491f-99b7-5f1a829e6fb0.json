  "text": "Elizabeth Olsen has conjured up her next TV role: The WandaVision star will headline the FX drama pilot Seven Sisters, our sister site Deadline reports. In the project, which has earned a pilot order from FX, “a large, tight-knit family begins to unravel when a sister” played by Olsen “starts communing with a voice no one else can hear — forcing each of them to confront long-buried secrets,” per the official synopsis. Succession writer Will Arbery penned the pilot, with Sean Durkin (The Iron Claw) on board as director and executive producer. The project reunites Olsen with Durkin, who wrote and directed her acclaimed 2011 film debut Martha Marcy May Marlene. Olsen is best known for playing Wanda Maximoff, aka the Scarlet Witch, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and she reprised the role in the 2021 Disney+ series WandaVision, earning an Emmy nomination for best lead actress in a limited series. She also starred in Max’s true-crime docudrama Love \u0026 Death in 2023, playing accused ax murderer Candy Montgomery, and the Facebook Watch series Sorry for Your Loss as grieving widow Leigh.
