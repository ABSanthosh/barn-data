  "text": "When it comes to horror movies, we’ve all wondered how our favorite TV characters would fare if they found themselves face-to-face with some of cinema’s most terrifying monsters. Would they have the skills, guts, or sheer luck to survive, or would they meet a grisly end before the credits roll? From the detectives of NCIS to the quirky residents of Only Murders in the Building — and yes, even Morgan from High Potential — this list puts some of the most iconic TV characters in a horror movie scenario. (David Bukach/Disney) So, who would survive, and who’s destined for a final scream? Let’s find out which TV characters would live to tell the tale — and which ones wouldn’t stand a chance. Athena Grant (9-1-1) Survival Odds: High (Disney/Eric McCandless) Athena Grant has faced everything from serial killers to natural disasters, so what’s a horror movie monster in comparison? I mean, c’mon! This badass 9-1-1 lady landed a commercial jet full of passengers with no experience — talk about grace under pressure! If she were up against something like a possessed Annabelle doll or even Michael Myers, Athena wouldn’t flinch. Her law enforcement skills, quick decision-making, and unshakable calm would help her fight or flee at the right time. Whether she’s rescuing survivors or squaring off against a supernatural foe, Athena would keep her cool and make it out alive. Roddy Ho (Slow Horses) Survival Odds: Low (Apple TV+) Roddy Ho from Slow Horses may be a tech whiz, but when it comes to real danger, he’s not exactly a hero. When the Terminator came calling at Slough House, Roddy hid in a bathroom, hoping to avoid the indestructible hitman while his teammates faced it head-on. If he found himself up against a horror movie villain like Michael Myers, Roddy would likely do the same: lock himself away and hope the danger (and everyone else) passes. His tech skills won’t save him, and without the guts to fight back, his survival odds are pretty bleak. Kristen Bouchard (Evil) Survival Odds: High (Elizabeth Fisher/Paramount+) Kristen Bouchard from Evil has seen it all — demons, possessions, and everything in between. Her background in psychology and her experience facing the supernatural would give her a serious advantage in a horror movie. If she were up against a monster like Pazuzu from The Exorcist or even the malevolent force from Sinister, Kristen wouldn’t panic. She’d use her investigative skills to figure out the creature’s weakness, stay rational in the face of terror, and maybe even find a way to defeat it. Her ability to stay calm under pressure and her familiarity with dark forces make Kristen one of the rare characters who could survive — and thrive — in a horror movie. Victor (FROM) Survival Odds: Medium (MGM+/Chris Reardon) Victor from FROM has already survived the nightmarish creatures that stalk his town, so he’s no stranger to horror. His survival instincts, odd behavior, and mysterious knowledge of the town’s dark secrets give him an edge, especially against supernatural threats like the monsters from The Descent. However, his solitary nature and cryptic ways might put him at risk if he can’t form alliances or if his past traumas slow him down. Victor’s experience with horror gives him a fighting chance, but his survival depends on whether he can stay one step ahead of the monsters — or if his own demons catch up to him first. Dean Winchester (Supernatural) Survival Odds: Certain (Bettina Strauss/The CW) Dean Winchester from Supernatural is practically built for horror movies. He’s already faced every kind of monster — demons, vampires, ghosts, you name it. Whether it’s going toe-to-toe with a creature like the Predator or taking down a cursed spirit like the one in The Grudge, Dean’s survival isn’t just likely — it’s guaranteed. Armed with his extensive monster-hunting knowledge, an arsenal of weapons, and his signature cocky attitude, Dean wouldn’t just survive — he’d probably enjoy the fight. The only thing in danger here is the monster that dares to take him on. Elizabeth Keen (The Blacklist) Survival Odds: Low (Will Hart/NBC) In a million lifetimes, I wouldn’t be able to resist putting The Blacklist‘s Elizabeth Keen on this list. She’s one of those rare characters where you might actually root for the monster. Whether it’s Jason Voorhees or the Xenomorph from Alien, her odds of survival are laughable. Keen has a knack for terrible decisions and trusting all the wrong people, which would be her downfall in a horror movie. She’d run right into danger, probably make some shady alliances, and end up betrayed. Honestly, her demise would feel like a victory for the audience. Olivia Benson (Law \u0026 Order: SVU) Survival Odds: Low (NBC/Sophy Holland) As a detective in Law \u0026 Order: SVU, Olivia Benson has faced some of the worst humanity has to offer, but a horror movie monster like the Candyman? That’s a different level of danger. Benson’s instincts and investigative skills would help her piece together clues, but her commitment to protecting others might lead her into traps she can’t escape. While she’s tough and resourceful, her logical approach would be a disadvantage against a supernatural foe. Olivia might put up a valiant fight, but in the end, the rules of horror are as unforgiving as the Candyman’s hook. Oliver Putnam (Only Murders in the Building) Survival Odds: Low (Disney/Patrick Harbron) Let’s face it: Oliver Putnam wouldn’t stand a chance in a horror movie. As the ever-dramatic director from Only Murders in the Building, he’d be too busy trying to direct the chaos instead of running from it. If he found himself up against a slasher like Ghostface or the relentless Michael Myers, Oliver would probably try to negotiate his way out with a dramatic monologue or convince everyone to put on a show. Unfortunately, the monster isn’t interested in a Broadway revival. While his charm might buy him a few extra minutes, it’s safe to say Oliver’s story would end with a final curtain call — and not in his favor. Sofia Falcone (The Penguin) Survival Odds: High (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Sofia Falcone from The Penguin has survived betrayal, Arkham’s horrors, and the manipulation of Gotham’s criminal underworld. She’s already faced unimaginable trauma and come out with vengeance on her mind. If Sofia were up against a monster like Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street, she wouldn’t flinch. Her ability to keep calm while plotting brutal revenge while tapping into her deep rage makes her a formidable survivor. Sofia’s compassion may make her vulnerable in some ways, but she’s ruthless when it counts, and her strategic mind would give her the edge she needs to stay alive — even when the odds are stacked against her. Dwight Manfredi (Tulsa King) Survival Odds: Medium (Brian Douglas/Paramount+) Dwight Manfredi from Tulsa King is no stranger to tough situations. But if he faced a horror movie monster like Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, his street smarts and mobster mentality would only take him so far. Dwight might be able to talk his way out of trouble or throw down in a brawl, but against a relentless slasher, his fists won’t be enough. His mob instincts could buy him some time, and he might even set a trap, but without supernatural knowledge or the right tools, survival is a coin toss. He’s tough, but this isn’t the streets — it’s a slaughterhouse. Morgan Gillory (High Potential) Survival Odds: Medium (Mitch Hasseth/Disney) Morgan Gillory from High Potential might seem out of her element in a horror movie but don’t count her out just yet. Her quirky outfits might look out of place when running from a monster like the Babadook, but Morgan’s sharp mind and unconventional approach to solving problems could help her figure out the monster’s weakness. However, her tendency to get caught up in the details might slow her down just when she needs to escape. While her fashion sense may survive, her odds of making it out alive are 50/50 at best. Jimmy Palmer (NCIS) Survival Odds: Low (Cliff Lipson/CBS) Poor Jimmy Palmer would be way out of his depth in a horror movie. Sure, he’s seen his share of dead bodies in the autopsy room, but facing off against a real-life monster like Pennywise from It? That’s a whole different story. Jimmy’s natural instinct would be to freeze, analyze, and maybe try to reason with the creature, but let’s face it — there’s no reasoning with Pennywise. While the NCIS team, especially Jess, would probably race to save him, they’d likely arrive just in time for a tragic autopsy of their own. Jimmy’s heart is in the right place, but horror movie monsters wouldn’t give him a second chance. Meredith Grey (Grey’s Anatomy) Survival Odds: Low (ABC/Liliane Lathan) Meredith Grey has saved countless lives on Grey’s Anatomy, but a horror movie is a whole different kind of trauma. If she found herself up against a relentless monster like the creature from It Follows, her medical expertise might help her patch up survivors, but it won’t do much to keep her safe. Meredith’s tendency to put herself in dangerous situations to save others could be her downfall here. While she’s used to high-stress environments, horror movie monsters don’t wait for surgery — so Meredith’s odds of making it to the end credits are pretty bleak. Jack Bauer (24) Survival Odds: High (FOX) Jack Bauer from 24 is no stranger to intense, life-threatening situations, and a horror movie wouldn’t be much different for him. Whether he’s up against a zombie horde like in World War Z or a cunning killer like Jigsaw from Saw, Jack’s survival instincts, combat skills, and sheer determination would keep him alive. He’s used to thinking on his feet and finding creative ways out of impossible situations. Jack would treat the monster like any other terrorist — identify the threat, outsmart the traps, and keep moving. The clock’s always ticking for Jack, but in a horror movie, he’d still come out on top. Liz (Shrinking) Survival Odds: Low (Apple TV+) Liz from Shrinking is the ultimate overbearing mother, neighbor, and friend, which would be her undoing in a horror movie. If she found herself face-to-face with Chucky from Child’s Play, she’d likely try to coddle him, thinking she could manage his bad behavior. Chucky, of course, would find this hilarious, letting Liz meddle and stick her nose into everyone’s business before making his move. She’d probably wreak more havoc than the monster, but Chucky would eventually tire of the act and finish her off with a grin. Liz’s well-meaning nature would be no match for a killer doll with a twisted sense of humor. Emily Cooper (Emily in Paris) Survival Odds: Low (Photo by Stéphanie Branchu/Netflix) Emily Cooper may be a fashion and social media maven in Emily in Paris, but those skills aren’t going to help her survive a horror movie. Faced with a supernatural villain like Samara from The Ring or the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers, Emily would probably spend more time trying to post about her near-death experience than figuring out how to escape. While her optimism and charm might buy her a little time, the horror world doesn’t care about Instagram followers or Parisian flair. It’s safe to say Emily’s stylish outfits would be ruined, and her survival odds — just like her latest post — would quickly fade away. Frank Reagan (Blue Bloods) Survival Odds: Medium (CBS/HIGHEST QUALITY SCREENGRAB AVAILABLE) Frank Reagan from Blue Bloods is a seasoned cop with years of experience handling tough situations, but facing a horror movie monster is a different kind of challenge. If he were facing a vengeful spirit from The Conjuring, his no-nonsense attitude and leadership skills would help keep his team calm. However, Frank’s more grounded, practical approach might leave him at a disadvantage when dealing with supernatural forces beyond his control. He’d put up a strong fight, but without any experience in the paranormal, his survival would depend on how quickly he could adapt — and how much backup he could rally.
