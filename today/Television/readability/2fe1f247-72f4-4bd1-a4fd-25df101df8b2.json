Your Outie would never pay full price for streaming, and Prime Video knows this! That’s why the streamer is still offering a limited-time deal on its Apple TV+ add-on. Here’s how to sign up for the subscription for $4.99/month to stream Severance, The Studio, The Buccaneers and more buzzy shows. Courtesy of Apple TV+Apple TV+ on Prime VideoOn Sale 50% off Apple TV Plus Streaming Deal: Get 2 Months for $5/Month Whether you’re hoping to binge Severance, Invasion (Season 3 premieres Friday, Aug. 22), or watch new episodes of The Buccaneers when they drop Wednesday mornings, you’ll need an Apple TV Plus subscription. Right now, you can get two months of the streamer for just $4.99/month when you sign up via Prime Video. Once the two months conclude, your plan will automatically renew at the regular price of $9.99/month, which is an additional fee added to your $14.99/month Prime Video subscription cost. You can, however, cancel your Apple TV Plus add-on before the two months are up to avoid paying full price. And you’ll want to act fast: Prime Video’s Apple TV Plus deal ends Friday, July 11. (See more Prime Day streaming deals and top tech discounts.) $4.99/month$9.99/month50% Off How to Sign Up for the Apple TV Plus on Prime Video If you decide to capitalize on the limited-time deal, Prime Video subscribers can easily add Apple TV Plus by visiting the streamer’s Amazon page. If you don’t yet have a Prime Video account, you’ll need to sign up for the service which costs $14.99/month. Here are step-by-step instructions for signing up for Prime Video with the Apple TV Plus add-on: Go to the Prime Video + Apple TV Plus page Click “Get Started” Enter payment information Start streaming Apple TV Plus on Prime Video Is There an Apple TV Plus Free Trial? Prime Video usually offers a seven-day Apple TV Plus free trial, but that offer is currently paused while the 50% off deal is active. Even though you can’t get seven days for free, we recommend taking the plunge and signing up for Apple TV Plus to enjoy the 50% off discount while you can — the streamer rarely goes on sale! If you are set on getting an Apple TV Plus free trial, you can sign up for the streamer directly on its own platform to unlock one free week. You can also get a three-month Apple TV Plus free trial by purchasing any Apple product. How to Watch Apple TV Plus for Free The only way to watch Apple shows for free online is by enjoying the aforementioned free trial when it is offered. Right now, the $4.99/month deal on Prime is the best way to watch the streamer for less, since you’ll get a couple of months for just $10. How Much Is Apple TV Plus? Apple TV Plus subscriptions typically go for $9.99/month. As mentioned above, you can currently sign up for the streamer for just $4.99/month on Prime Video. How to Sign Up for Apple TV Plus If you don’t want to capitalize on Prime Video’s offer, you can still sign up for Apple TV Plus directly from the streamer to enjoy a seven-day free trial. You won’t, however, be able to watch for 50% off like mentioned above. Below, we’ve outlined step-by-step instructions for subscribing to Apple TV Plus: Go to the Apple TV Plus website Select the “Accept Free Trial” button Enter user information Start streaming Apple TV Plus! What Is on Apple TV Plus? With an Apple TV Plus subscription, you can stream plenty of buzzy shows such as Severance, which has been renewed for Season 3, the Seth Rogen-led comedy The Studio, which has been renewed for Season 2, Invasion, which debuts Season 3 on Friday, Aug. 22, Shrinking, which is currently in production on Season 3, and The Buccaneers, which is currently streaming Season 2 episodes on Wednesdays. Apple TV Plus subscribers gain access to plenty of other shows, too, like Foundation, Silo, Stick, Ted Lasso, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, The Morning Show, Dope Thief, Surface and more.",
