  "text": "The world of Creed is expanding with a new series on Prime Video, the streamer announced during its Upfront presentation Monday. Titled Delphi, the show will follow the careers of several young fighters at Delphi Boxing Academy, the gym where Michael B. Jordan‘s titular boxer trained in the Creed film franchise. Starring Jordan as Adonis Creed, the son of legendary boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), the Creed franchise currently consists of three films, released in 2015, 2018 and 2023. A fourth big screen installment is currently in development, but no additional information has been announced. It’s also not known which, if any, characters featured in the Creed movies might make an appearance on Delphi. The most prominent recurring players in the movies include Jordan as Creed, Tessa Thompson as his wife Bianca, Phylicia Rashad as his stepmother Mary Anne and, of course, Sylvester Stallone as iconic fighter Rocky Balboa. Given the show’s setting, it’s most likely that we’ll see the return of Wood Harris as Tony “Little Duke” Evers, who took over management of the Delphi gym from his father, who trained both Apollo and Rocky. Marco Ramírez will serve as showrunner of Delphi, executive-producing alongside Jordan and Liz Raposo via their production company Outlier Society. Irwin Winkler, David Winkler and Charles Winkler will also executive-produce for Winkler Films. Will you give Delphi a fighting chance? Drop a comment with your thoughts on the Creed offshoot below. Which characters do you hope will return?",
