But this time around, we're getting to hear what Netflix's head of U.S. and Canada scripted series, Peter Friedlander, has to say about the project from the streamer's perspective. \"I think it's going to be what you want it to be. It's pretty special, just as an IP, it's very special, something like 'The Sandman,' Friedlander shared when asked during a recent Variety interview about the series and when viewers will be getting an extended look at the highly-anticipated series. \"And we want to handle it with deft hands for fans and to also bring new life to it in a way that both honors the original and celebrates its new iteration. It's a stunning spectacle.\" Avatar: The Last Airbender (Image: Nickelodeon) These shows are very big productions, and it takes a ton of time, both on the production side and in post, so you have to respect the long journey for some of these shows to deliver what hasn't been done on television before,\" the Netflix executive continued, explaining why production on \"Avatar\" (and others) has been taking so long. \"And that's what we have for a lot of these types of shows when we're working on them, whether it's 'Avatar' or 'One Piece' or 'Three-Body Problem,' these are big, visual spectacles that you have to honor the process and respect that, when you're breaking ground in visual storytelling, or you're on the visual vanguard of storytelling, that takes R\u0026D, that takes a lot of trial and error to get it right. But that's the intent, that's the hope, is that you're bringing eye candy matched with impeccable storytelling into these worlds. The journeys are long but hopefully fruitful. Being part of these spectacle shows, each one is bespoke, each one goes on its own journey, and it's a little bit in between film and television, so you have to break the mold every time you're working on one of them, and it's rewarding across the board when we get it right.\" Image: Netflix Here's a Look at Who's Who in Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender Along with Gordon Cormier (Aang), Kiawentiio (Katara), Ian Ousley (Sokka), Dallas Liu (Zuko), Elizabeth Yu (Azula), Paul Sun-Hyung Lee (Iroh), Daniel Dae Kim (Fire Lord Ozai), Maria Zhang (Suki), Tamlyn Tomita (Yukari), Yvonne Chapman (Avatar Kyoshi), and Casey Camp-Horinek (Gran Gran), here's a look back at the rest of the full cast, as well as who they will be portraying \u0026 their position in the upcoming series: Image: Netflix Water Tribe Amber Midthunder (she/her; Prey, Roswell) as Princess Yue: The compassionate spiritual leader of the Northern Water Tribe.
