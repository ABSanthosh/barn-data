  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.05 / 5.04.05 What’s it all for? That’s the question at the center of Landman Season 1 Episode 9, and like every issue on this show, there’s not an easy answer. But at least one person may no longer have the chance to find it. (Ryan Green/Paramount+) Is It Too Late For Monty to Learn Life’s Lessons? We might as well start with the most significant character development we’ve had so far on Landman, one that makes Cooper’s multiple beatings seem quaint. Although we didn’t have firm confirmation of his death, it would be a miracle if Monty survived until the Landman finale. (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) However, Tommy’s final scenes alone might prove enough that his friend is gone. Monty has made a living running full bore in his quest for wealth, but he’s left his family behind. Many people learn this lesson when it’s too late for change, and Monty was four heart attacks and three bypasses too late to change his story. By the time Tommy visited Monty in the hospital, Cami already seemed prepared for the worst. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was visiting with Monty, sharing his success story, which was driven by his desire to spend more time with his family, a far cry from Monty’s own. The fear on Monty’s face told a tale, but it’s hard to know if he was genuinely soaking it all in and considering a change or if his mind was still on the game. Maybe it was a little of both. Tommy and Rebecca Are the Future of M-Tex (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Promoting Tommy to Vice President was long overdue and showed Monty’s willingness to step aside, but offering Rebecca a full-time position as the VP of Exploration based on her shrewd negotiation skills and “killer” attitude alone showed Monty’s heart was still business first, people second. Maybe this is the story we’ve been waiting for that brings Demi Moore’s Cami into the story. If Monty is dead or even incapacitated in some way, the business could be in her hands. As sharp as Monty is with business, not having a clear path of succession would seem strange. But he’s also the kind of man who takes his longevity for granted with only modified lifestyle changes. As we discussed in the Landman Season 1 Episode 8 review, passing on the joys life offers while allowing your stress level to kneecap your health makes little sense. Yet that’s exactly how Monty lived. Landman is a Soap Opera (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Like other Taylor Sheridan shows, Landman is, at its core, a soap opera. Leaving the business in Cami’s hands while Tommy and Rebecca tried to work together would be incredibly dramatic. Tommy’s temper may have a hairpin trigger, but his compassion and empathy are boundless. Rebecca is fresh out of either. The idea of watching them navigate the intricate depths of the oil business is promising. From my perspective, it’s a nightmare, and I’m not alone. Nate has no idea what working for Rebecca means, but if she negotiates like she litigates, there’s not much hope for building bridges and plenty of certainty for destroying them. Consequences of Military Action (Ryan Green/Paramount+) Before any new working relationship can begin, whether Monty survives or not, the cartel mess needs fixing. It seemed like a good idea to enlist the military for a round of war games to scare away the cartel. But that theory was tested when the games took actual civilian lives. The Reserve commander was panicked. He was under the impression there were no people on that land. Tommy told him there were no oilmen out there, but he never said there weren’t any others. Although from a reasonable person’s perspective, it seems like Tommy has the cartel over a barrel, working with criminals doesn’t come with a reasonable set of rules. They already outwitted him by following him, a development that surprised Tommy. They need to meet and discuss a future in which they can both prosper without continuous fights. But Tommy is no longer alone in this fight, which is far more dangerous than it sounds. Rebecca is a Loose Cannon (Ryan Green/Paramount+) When we first met Rebecca, she revealed the heart of an activist. She knows the hot-button societal rules and when to push them to achieve her agenda. But can you imagine her in a situation similar to Tommy’s on Landman Season 1 Episode 1, bag over her head and a gun held to it while the cartel demanded answers? Can she really far well in situations like that? If Monty is gone, there won’t be time to reassess what it means to have her on the payroll, but she’ll also lose the only ally she had. At this point, we have no idea what’s head, but when it comes to Rebecca, it could go either way. The Bucket List at Rick’s Cabaret (Ryan Green/Paramount+) Angela and Ainsley continue to provide the show’s comic relief. During the promotional interviews for Landman, the sentiment was that the series was funny — Sheridan’s funniest to date. Other than Ainsley and Angela, there isn’t much to giggle at here. Life is interwoven with laughter and pain because anything else would see us all falling apart, but for genuine laughs, the women are the focal point. Of course, they want to help the folks at the retirement home fulfill their sexual bucket lists. And, of course, Ainsley wants Ryder to help bring them to fruition for the ladies. We can also count on Ainsley’s constant reminder to Tommy that he asked her to lie to him about what she does, so can he please pretend to believe them in return? At least this time out, we got to know Angela a little better with Tommy’s assistance. Angela Tries Too Hard When She Doesn’t Need To (Ryan Green/Paramount+) No matter how you slice it, Tommy had a rough day. He was moved enough by Monty’s plight to call Angela just to say, “I love you.” He sees a future in which he is left without family in tears outside his hospital room, and he wants to get on the right side of it. But he no sooner professes his love than he’s denigrating Angela’s meal preparation. Granted, the paella deal was bizarre, but she didn’t know how bad his day was because he didn’t tell her. He tried to slough it off as every day being the same for him, but this day was not the same as other days. However, he did say what he needed to say, which is that Angela is trying too hard when she’s already got his love. She doesn’t have to put on a performance to be appreciated. He’ll always appreciate her and everything she does, but if she does it with an expectation of reward, then she’s barking up the wrong tree. She’s a slow learner, but she’s a good cook and prepares mightily for her performances. I have hope for her. By the end of the second season, I think everyone will be happy she’s around — you included. (Ryan Green/Paramount+) Cooper Puts His Plan Into Motion Cooper is such a good kid. He cares for others and wears his honesty like a badge. He doesn’t like feeling useless, and he has big dreams he won’t wait to fulfill. Cooper seems to be all in with Ariana now. He’s working toward their future together, even if she’s not ready for that step. But his winsome demeanor is pretty impossible to resist, and he doesn’t need to work too hard to bring her around. Initially, she told him she couldn’t trust “this,” wanting him to focus on himself instead. But he has that dream and doesn’t think he has what it takes to chase it for himself. He’s like the anti-Monty right out of the gate. His biggest fear is not becoming addicted to the chase. I can’t help but wonder if Monty’s death isn’t Cooper’s chance to shine. By the end of “WolfCamp,” Cooper has set his plan into motion. Will he compete with M-Tex, or will he help his father take the company in a new direction? I sense a fusion of these stories. (Ryan Green/Paramount+) Do you think Monty is dead? Is Cooper the future of M-Tex? Can Tommy and Rebecca work together? And are the pieces of the Angela puzzle beginning to come together for you?

He cares for others and wears his honesty like a badge. He doesn’t like feeling useless, and he has big dreams he won’t wait to fulfill. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCooper seems to be all in with Ariana now. He’s working toward their future together, even if she’s not ready for that step. But his winsome demeanor is pretty impossible to resist, and he doesn’t need to work too hard to bring her around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, she told him she couldn’t trust “this,” wanting him to focus on himself instead. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut he has that dream and doesn’t think he has what it takes to chase it for himself. He’s like the anti-Monty right out of the gate.

Will he compete with M-Tex, or will he help his father take the company in a new direction?
