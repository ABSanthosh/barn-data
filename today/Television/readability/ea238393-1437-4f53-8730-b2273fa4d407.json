  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.5 / 5.04.5 Well, that episode of Fire Country was way more emotionally heartbreaking than anyone could have guessed. He might be an ornery, cantankerous, grumpy old man, but no one, not even Walter, should have to suffer losing their memories. As most people realize, our experiences and memories are what make us who we are. They dictate how we feel and the choices we make. Knowing where we came from helps us navigate where we’re going. Without our memories, we’re like an infant flying blind and needing guidance. It kind of makes sense why Fire Country would pair a Walter-centered episode with a surrendered baby. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) At least the episode wasn’t just one sad situation after another. For example, I am making a note to remember that window-breaking trick that Walter used on the crashed car. Is anyone else overly paranoid about disasters after three seasons of Fire Country? Also, did anyone understand a single word out of the car crash victim’s mouth? I had to turn the subtitles on because he was Mr. Mumbles. What’s Happening to Walter Is Heartbreaking, but It Doesn’t Change All the Pain He Has Caused One thing that had me scratching my head during “The Leone Way” was how no one heard the car crash. Walter and Bode didn’t walk that long or far from the campsite. The only thing I can think of that makes sense is that the crash happened while they were all down by the water fishing. If that is the case, that must have been hell for the poor guy behind the wheel. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Although, I think Walter could give him a run for his money in the suffering department. It’s been clear from Walter’s first appearance in Fire Country Season 1 Episode 20 that he is a proud man that says whatever he thinks — everyone else’s feelings be damned. Watching him become disoriented and wander into the woods with his grandson following after him hit pretty close to home for me and probably many other viewers. However, nothing got the waterworks going quite like seeing Walter be vulnerable there at the end. Was I a blubbering mess? I’ll never tell. And the timing couldn’t be more convenient for some quality broadcast entertainment with Luke heading off to Japan. I know Walter is an acquired taste, but that seems like an extreme amount of distance. However, I’ll just say it. It’s sad what Jeff Fahey’s (From Dusk Till Dawn) Walter is going through, but it doesn’t change the decades he spent verbally and emotionally abusing his sons. I actually chuckled when he said, “I’d rather die than be a burden to anyone.” (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS ) Oh, sweet, naive Walter. That man is a burden to just about everyone who meets him. To be fair, not every problem on Fire Country is Walter’s fault. Some people are the architects of their own issues — I’m looking at you, Manny. The Inmates at Three Rock Are There to Better Their Futures, and It’s Not Manny’s Responsibility to Make Sure They Don’t Squander That Opportunity Is Manny starting to get on anyone else’s nerves? Look, I absolutely love Kevin Alejandro‘s Manny. The guy is a prince among men because of the way he genuinely cares about the well-being of the inmates at Three Rock. But that was when he was captain. Now that he is back to inmate status, cutting lines with Cal Fire, he needs to keep his eyes on his future. This is Bode from Fire Country Season 1 all over again. I’m not saying Manny shouldn’t stick up for or help the guys at Three Rock, but all the men are there because they’ve been given an opportunity to right their wrongs and shorten their sentences. It’s not Manny’s responsibility to ensure that every guy there stays on the right path to redemption. It might be cold to say, but those are grown-ass men, and if they want to squander their chance at a new life, that’s on them. Manny’s only concern should be doing right by his daughter. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) I’m sure there are plenty of guys who would switch places from prison to Three Rock in a heartbeat. Thankfully, Manny’s intentions are mainly to keep morale up by setting a good example for the other guys. And it even worked out in the end with the guy who made the pruno not having to go back to prison. By the way, I looked up what pruno is made of, and that’s not at all the gross part. The ingredients are fruits, sugar, and high fructose. It’s the process of making it that is vomit-inducing. It’s going to be a minute before I can have wine again. However, if there is anyone who needs a glass of red to relax after all this madness, it’s Diane Farr’s (Chance) Sharon. Apparently, You Can Just Drop a Baby Off at a Fire Station Like You’re Dropping Off a Deposit at the Bank I know not everyone is a fan of Sharon. Whether it’s her parenting style or her general fly-by-the-seat-of-her-pants kind of attitude, you have to admit that she is the glue that keeps everyone together. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Seriously, Sharon is the rock of Fire Country. She was the only Leone who was thinking logically throughout this whole episode. At least Bode came around to his senses in the end. If you read the Fire Country Season 3 Episode 10 Spoilers, you might remember that I was pretty curious about how leaving a baby at a fire station worked. Well, it’s safe to say those answers were thoroughly answered. First, there’s just a box to drop a baby in? Like you’re at a bank drive-thru? That seems nuts to me, but the program wouldn’t still be in place if it didn’t help in some way. What I was thoroughly not expecting was the mother to come right back for her baby. Is that a common occurrence? Are there any firefighting readers out there? Please sound off in the comments. However, one thing I really liked about the program was that the mother could easily have her baby back, but she had to wait twenty-four hours to make sure that’s what she wanted. I can’t speak to what having a child is like, let alone raising one, but I am all for whatever helps mothers do what’s best for their children. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Still, that doesn’t mean every choice a mother makes is the right one. Just ask Leven Rambin’s Audrey. Everyone Is Right Where They Need to Be, So Brace for the Fire Country Wrecking Ball I know not every Fire Country viewer is a fan of Audrey, but how could you not feel for her as she revealed the story of her mother abandoning her? She may be tough as nails, but she still deserves the same kind of sympathy many viewers reserve for Gabriela. Speaking of that hot mess, I could not be any happier with her character arc at the moment. It is so uplifting to see her making the right choices and investing in herself for once. It took three seasons, but she is finally growing and developing into a stable adult, and it’s made her so much more likable. And how sweet is it that she is not at all jealous of Audrey and Bode growing closer? Also, I unintentionally called it in my Fire Country Season 3 Episode 9 Review that Gabriela would teach Audrey how to swim. I swear I had no idea that would actually happen when I made that joke, but I am all for it. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS ) Besides, Gabriela needs some female energy to hang out with that isn’t superior to her. Sharon and Eve are fantastic, but they have full plates. Gabriela needs someone to talk to about things in normal life that don’t include fires or inmates. It’s also time we all let go of Bode and Gabriela getting back together. They both need to stay on their own journeys of self-discovery and become the best versions of themselves. Bode and Gabriela had a (sort of) good run, but it’s time to put that shipping to bed. Besides, Bode really didn’t seem all that upset when Jake confessed that he and Gabriela slept together. If you ask me, everyone is right where they need to be for now. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) This means that the writers likely have something devastating planned because, as we have learned, the hands behind the series can’t let the characters stay happy for too long. How do you feel about Gabriela’s new journey of self-awareness? Did Walter’s vulnerability in this episode move you?

Well, it’s safe to say those answers were thoroughly answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, there’s just a box to drop a baby in? Like you’re at a bank drive-thru?

She may be tough as nails, but she still deserves the same kind of sympathy many viewers reserve for Gabriela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of that hot mess, I could not be any happier with her character arc at the moment.
