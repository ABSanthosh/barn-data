  "text": "This is a scene-by-depressing-scene recap of “The Mountain Teeth of Monsters.” For a discussion of the episode, please visit our 1923 Season 2 Episode 6 review. The snow is finally melting at the ranch when the combined families sit down to a meal. The chicken coop has been reaped, and Cara is happy to have found someone who sells chickens. They may have eggs for breakfast again soon. (Courtesy of Paramount+) Zane is ready to ride again, but Jacob says not even the flu heals that fast. Jack is sad they won’t have beans for breakfast anymore, making Elizabeth laugh.  Jacob realizes this is the first time every seat at this table has been filled since before the war. He wasn’t the only one to notice. When a car pulls up outside, they all grab their weapons. It’s the sheriff. Jacob wonders if someone died. Is someone in trouble? He’s got news about Spencer. They hoped, but they didn’t know. The switchboard operators heard every word, and loose lips sink ships. Jacob wants Bill to assign deputies at the house and the train station. He’s worried about the war escalating sooner rather than later. Spencer will travel from Amarillo in two days unless Denver is closed and the train has to go through Fargo.  (Trae Patton/Paramount+) Spencer is coming home, Jacob tells Cara. Pete is dead. Father Renaud is unimpressed. All this nasty marshal does is kill, and they’re no closer to justice. Father Renaud put his trust in this guy. He gets what he deserves. I hope God has a plan for him. “You’ve been tasked to bring justice to a murderer,” Renaud rages. “But the murderer is you.” He finally decides to separate from the guy, and he does it permanently. Nasty marshal no more! Three shots, and he’s gone. Banner’s guys are talking about Spencer. Even Banner is impressed to learn that Spencer was in the first infantry in Argonne. He wonders where Spencer has been in the six years since the war ended. He directs them to kill Spencer upon his arrival. (Trae Patton/Paramount+) After they kill Spencer, Banner says they kill the whole lot of them. Honestly, at the slow pace this story is going, I expect the series (or maybe just the season since it’s not a final out) to end just like Angel. Jacob and Zane are preparing for battle. Jack feels left out, but Jacob points out he’s in charge of protecting Cara and Elizabeth. Cara demands that Jacob promise to return alive. In 56 years, he’s never broken a promise to her, and she doesn’t want him to start now. Time to fast forward through Whitfield and his whore… Seriously, three minutes of that trash before Banner interjects himself with news about Spencer. Whitfield wants all of the Duttons to find their way to the train station. I don’t think these two make it to modern history because that’s where they’ll end up. Thankfully, Banner has one decent bone left in his body as he points out that the woman they’re torturing is someone’s daughter. If she were here, Whitfield says, he’d do the same to her. (Trae Patton/Paramount+) Time to FF again. But wait! Whitfield actually says, “Now pleasure, now pain,” as if he really thinks a woman trapped like that will feel pleasure. That’s the beginning of the porn industry right there. Teonna has no idea Pete is dead. Her dad is talking with her about the stars, as that’s how Pete will return. But Teonna feels in her heart that something is wrong. Jack is outside in his fuzzy chaps. He’s not feeling good about letting Jacob and Zane go on their own. The other guy will let Zane know he’s gone, telling the one left behind not to get bushwacked while he’s gone. Elizabeth sneaks up on Cara, who almost has a heart attack. Cara is knitting without purpose, just to keep her hands busy.  (Trae Patton/Paramount+) Elizabeth can’t believe it’s the 20th century, with cars, planes, and movie theaters, and they’ve got men protecting their house. Cara says no matter how much we progress, it will always be the same. The sin of coveting entices men to commit all the other sins.  Zane tells Cara that Jack went off to find Jacob — alone. They’re worried. Spencer is on the train, held up by a snow drift east of Fargo. He has options to get out. The conductor asks Spencer where he was stationed. Spencer earns respect for his service everywhere he goes. The couple is asking Alex about her travels, shocked that she’s made it this far without having any idea where she’s going. They’re simply transfixed by her story, including that she shouted from the stern of the ship that she’d meet Spencer in Boseman. Paul wants to drive her to the home of Edgar Rice Burrows right now to get it all on paper. Alex says much of the story is unwritten as these acts of God keep getting in their way. He doesn’t have an airplane, but he has a car. They’re going on a road trip. “We journey the path of pioneers in the name of lost love, soon to be found,” Paul says. (Trae Patton/Paramount+) Jacob finds the sheriff passed out in the train station. They could send a wire, but that would alert Banner’s men.  They’re worried that it could get quite dangerous when the place fills up.  But Jack is still out there on his own, and he makes first contact. They’re all heading to the train station. Jack is at ease, knowing these guys, and he holsters his weapon. One of the guys says everyone acts like Spencer is something special. Jack says there’s no one better with a gun in his hand, but he’s a close second. The guy takes him up on that and kills him. Well.  They even steal Jack’s saddle. (Trae Patton/Paramount+) By the time Spencer gets home, he may have no home left. Teonna is equally concerned, and they find Pete, his horse, and the marshal dead. Her tiny sliver of happiness is over. They can’t even bury Pete.  The road trip is going very well. They’re drinking and learning to drive. They’re in eastern South Dakota when they stop to pee. Next, they drive through the Rosebud Reservation. Alex sees wild horses and Native Americans selling wares on the side of the road. It begins to snow, and it’s pretty bad by the time Alex wakes up in the back seat. They’re in Wyoming, and they have 15 miles to go before they get to Buffalo.  At the local gas station, they put chains on their tires and get some gasoline. The woman in the gas station says that the car won’t make it to Emigrant. They need to take the train from Sheridan because this is the last gas station. Runs His Horse starts a fire, but Teonna doesn’t see the point. Life hasn’t shown her many reasons to keep fighting to live. He wraps his daughter in his arms for a pep talk. If she doesn’t live, someday, they won’t remember we’re even here. He thinks that someday, they’ll need them again when white men concrete the whole world. Someone will need to teach them how to live when it revolts. (Courtesy of Paramount+) FFS. We’re supposed to believe Father Renaud has managed to survive out there on his own, and he’s hiding in the grass, waiting to kill them. Alex is freezing, but the couple isn’t concerned. They’re from Chicago. They’ll warm themselves like the Irish — by drinking. Alex, bundled in blankets, gets onto the floor for a nap. They’re running out of gas, but the couple just holds hands and continues driving. Are they on a suicide mission?  Father Renaud sneaks up on Teonna and Runs His Horse in the dark. Runs His Horse shoots at Renaud, who shoots back. Renaud is babbling about darkness and light, giving a speech about returning Teonna to the dust from whence she came. Surely, her dad is going to rise up and kill this asshole. (Lauren Smith/Paramount+) Renaud is trying to save her soul and free her from eternal perdition. She renounces salvation and tells him to beg for it himself. His gun? Empty. She tosses hot ashes in his face and stabs the hell out of him. He’s a tough old bastard and is still gurgling when she shoots him multiple times. Teonna tries waking her dad, but he’s gone, too. Well, this is a lot of fun. Spencer is waiting for a train in the cold. He tells a girl nearby that there are only three seasons in the Rockies: July, August, and winter. When Alex wakes up, the car has stopped. Paul is gone, the fuel tank is empty, and the woman has frozen to death. They are in the middle of nowhere. Oh, look; Paul is in a frozen heap down the road.  Elsa pipes up in a voiceover. Man destroys everything. He has been at war with this world since he first entered it. War with its trees, its weather. If it were up to the wolves or the bears or the snake or spider, they would all be alone on the planet.  Life is a constant battle for survival, and only Earth survives.  Looks like Alex is going to die, too.
