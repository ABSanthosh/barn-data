The West Wing was quietly removed from Max during the final days of 2024, meaning bingers were left scrambling for how to finish watching the series online in the new year. But we have good news: All seven seasons of the Emmy-winning political drama are returning to Max this Wednesday, Jan. 8, our sister site Deadline reports. The show was reportedly removed from the streamer after “viewership hit a significant lull,” but executives have since (thankfully) reversed that decision. But what if you don’t have Max? Or you just don’t want to risk another surprise removal? Below, we’re breaking down where else you can watch the acclaimed political drama online — albeit for a price. In addition to streaming on Max, you can purchase individual episodes and complete seasons of The West Wing online on Prime Video. Seasons 1-7 are available to purchase for $29.99 each, while individual episodes go for $2.99 each. (You do not need a Prime Video subscription to purchase The West Wing.) If you have a DVD or Blu-ray player, you can also purchase physical copies of the series online to watch The West Wing from the comfort of your own home. The complete series can be purchased on Amazon in Blu-ray or DVD format, including 156 episodes across 28-42 discs. Plus, by purchasing this complete collection, you get bonus West Wing content including commentaries, unaired scenes and more. How Many Seasons Are There in The West Wing? The West Wing debuted in 1999 and ran for seven seasons on NBC. The drama followed the staff of a fictional Democratic administration during its two terms in the White House. It won 26 Emmys along the way, including Outstanding Drama Series four years in a row. (It’s true, kids, network shows used to win Best Drama.) The West Wing Cast The West Wing cast included Martin Sheen (who played President Jed Bartlet), Allison Janney (chief of staff C.J. Cregg), Bradley Whitford (deputy White House chief of staff Josh Lyman), Dulé Hill (Bartlet’s personal aide Charlie Young), Richard Schiff (communications director Toby Ziegler) and Janel Moloney (senior assistant to the deputy chief of staff Donna Moss) — most of whom recently reunited on stage at the 2024 Emmys. The cast also included Rob Lowe, Stockard Channing, Joshua Malina, Mary McCormack, Alan Alda, Kristin Chenoweth and John Spencer.",
