  "text": "Victor has come a long way from the man we met in FROM Season 1. Victor has been a bit of a loner with a sad history, but he has evolved over time. And just when he was ready to confront his past and start looking into the pieces of his history he could no longer remember, he was thrown a loop; his father was in town. Victor and Henry’s reunion during FROM Season 3 Episode 5 was incredibly moving. A lot of emotions were packed into a hug that neither man thought they’d ever experience again. (Chris Reardon/MGM+) Scott McCord injects such warmth and depth into Victor, and we jumped at the chance to discuss the father-son reunion and Victor’s complicated feelings. McCord was an absolute delight and was so sincere in his assessment of the fan-favorite Victor. Enjoy this one, FROM fanatics! This last episode was devastating in many ways. It’s an emotional hour for Victor with Henry coming to the town. Can you describe Victor’s emotions upon learning he’ll be reunited with his father after so many years? (MGM+/Chris Reardon) Yeah, yeah. I would love to talk about it. It was certainly something that I wasn’t expecting to happen. Of course, we never know what’s happening script to script, and we never know what the milestone events of the season are. When they introduced Henry, I thought, oh yeah, this is exciting. And then when I found out in episode four that he makes it into the town and they’re going to meet, well, it certainly evoked all kinds of emotion just in me. I thought it was beautiful, but I felt scared to approach it as an actor because I thought, “What’s that going to be like?” I think that with Victor, what immediately came up for me was this idea of, or this feeling, I should say, which I think Victor’s been feeling this season anyway, is this idea of, did I do all this? In some way, especially with the arrival of Henry, it’s this idea of, how did I fail him? Did I fail him? My mother’s gone, and my sister’s gone. In that moment with Henry, when Victor says, “I didn’t know how to get back home,” there is such immense guilt in that, I think. (Chris Reardon/MGM+) And that’s something moving forward with Henry, and within their relationship, they’re trying to figure out what is between them. It’s like he’s feeling his way as a father, and what does that mean now? Victor’s feeling like how do we deal with this lifetime loss? And with Victor, there’s an incredible amount of guilt, but also in terms of Victor’s purpose in solving this thing, going into his memories, trying to remember. I think so much of it is going to be and become about saving his father as well, now making up for that lifetime loss. You just answered a little bit of my next question. Where will we see things go with Henry and Victor moving forward? I imagine it will also be interesting and difficult for Victor to step into the role of being a son again and have family around. Yeah, it was something, too, from Robert Joy, who plays Henry. I mean, he’s beautiful. He’s just one of the most wonderful and generous actors and wonderful people. We talked a lot about that while the story is moving forward, and Victor again has his path that he’s on, at the same time, where are those moments? Do they have the time? (MGM+/Chris Reardon) What are those moments between them, even within just a simple look or a touch between them, where they’re trying to figure out how do I be the son and how do I be the father? It was a beautiful exploration all season that way with that. These are great questions. It was a big part of the story and a big part of the work this year. What do you feel you’ve learned about Victor this season that you didn’t know back in FROM Season 1? What came up for me immediately when you asked that, and I haven’t actually thought too much about that. But I think that one of the discoveries that I remember making and feeling, and this sort of ties into what we were just talking about with Henry, is where with Victor, there’s a regression that’s been certainly happening with dealing with this trauma and the memories. (Epix/Photo Credit: Chris Reardon) But when that happens, I think that certain changes happen to people when they start really cracking. Even just discovering and remembering that he had a sister. What did he used to think about? What is it going to do to him? And I started to feel like this season, there are these moments where Victor all of a sudden grows up a little bit, comes up a little bit, and takes charge. We see, or I hope that there is, and what I discovered was that all of a sudden, there was a slightly more mature Victor happening in certain moments in terms of dealing with everything and then dealing with his father. So, I guess to answer your question simply, I think what was exciting for me was that Victor does change in certain ways. I also noticed that while everything had been going inward, inward, inward for him for so long, as we see in these episodes that are coming up now, he starts to act outwards. (MGM+/Chris Reardon) It starts to happen outwards. He starts to put his energy out that way and in not-so-good ways, so that was new as well. One of the biggest strengths of FROM is the cast. You guys have a really strong cast, and there are a lot of great dynamics. I’ve actually really enjoyed Victor and Sara. That’s a very interesting dynamic. What is a dynamic you like that Victor has with another character? I’m so glad you brought up the one with Sara because Avery [Konrad] and I had never worked together, so those were our first scenes together. She’s amazing, and we crack each other up, but the relationship that we found, the dynamic that we found, is so brotherly, brother, sister. And there’s safety in that fort and that little hobble they create together of trust and understanding. I think of each other as well. Where with Victor, even knowing who she is, I love that dynamic. I just thought it was just very, very layered in a way that these two people, what would bring them together and trust each other in that way. (Chris Reardon/MGM+) And yet, at the same time, I think there’s a simplicity to it that is really beautiful. It’s just almost like it’s just kind of there right from the get-go. He steps into the house, and they have this relationship, but I think it’s partly because Victor even says, “I used to play with my sister in this house,” and there was a history to the house and all that. That’s a relationship that was exciting to me this season. If you could give us one word to tease the last half of FROM Season 3, what would you say? I’m going to hyphenate a word. (Chris Reardon/MGM+) Okay. Two words. I was going to say cracked, but I’m going to say cracked-open. Cracked-open? Is that fair? Can I give you that? (MGM+/Chris Reardon) Yeah! Does that work? That’s perfect. I love it. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. ***This interview has been edited for length and clarity.*** You can watch FROM on Sundays at 9/8c on MGM+. Watch FROM Online",

I also noticed that while everything had been going inward, inward, inward for him for so long, as we see in these episodes that are coming up now, he starts to act outwards. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"686\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5.jpg\" alt=\"Victor Outside - FROM Season 2 Episode 5\" srcset=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5-686x1024.jpg 686w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5-201x300.jpg 201w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5-768x1146.jpg 768w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5-643x960.jpg 643w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5-724x1080.jpg 724w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2023/05/victor-outside-from-season-2-episode-5.jpg\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e (MGM+/Chris Reardon)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt starts to happen outwards.
