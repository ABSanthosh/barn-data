  "text": "Kelly Monaco was “amazing” to the very end of her 21-year General Hospital run, says leading man Dominic Zamprogna. Fans of the long-running ABC sudser first met Monaco’s Sam on Oct. 1, 2003, having previously seen Monaco plat Livvie Locke on the GH spinoff Port Charles. (Lindsay Hartley briefly filled in for Monaco in 2020, 2022 and 2024.) Monaco’s work on GH earned her a Daytime Emmy nomination for Lead Actress in 2006. She was previously nominated in the supporting category in 2003, for playing PC‘s Livvie. News of Monaco’s exit broke in August, with the actress reportedly “blindsided” by the soap’s decision to kill off her character. After Sam agreed to donate her liver to Lulu Spencer, she was prepped for surgery on Oct. 24, giving her time to say goodbye to some of the people who have meant the most to her over the years, including Zamprogna’s Dante, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) and Jason (Steve Burton). When Sam returned to the screen on Oct. 30, we learned that the surgery was a success — and she even celebrated the occasion by getting engaged to Dante! Alas, Sam then started crashing, and tragically died. Speaking with Soap Opera Digest, Zamprogna said, “My monologues were her last scenes, so we finished those scenes and I basically said good-bye to Kelly then and there. In her final weeks of filming — and despite leaving the soap under clearly not happy circumstances — Monaco “was amazing. Amazing, amazing, amazing,” Zamprogna raved. Zamprogna told Digest he stills checks in on Monaco every week, and would not be surprised if they somehow, somewhere, end up sharing GH scenes again. “It’s a soap,” he said. “Who the heck knows what’s gonna happen?”",
