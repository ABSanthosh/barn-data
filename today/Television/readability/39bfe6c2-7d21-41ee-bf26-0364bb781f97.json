  "text": "It gets old hearing “thanks for reading,” but it means more now than ever. If you’ve been paying attention, you’ve probably noticed that Google search results aren’t what they used to be. The same handful of big players dominate the top, and often, the content doesn’t even match what you were looking for. The world of independent publishing is disappearing — fast. (Carissa’s Corner) Big business is erasing us through search manipulation, social media shadowbans, and the elevation of forums and mass-produced content over voices like ours here at TV Fanatic. You may have noticed some changes on our site lately — new trending and comment widgets, a growing team of writers (many coming from broader outlets like MonstersandCritics.com), and more diverse coverage.  These aren’t just updates; they’re part of our fight to stay alive in a digital space that’s increasingly unfriendly to independent thought. We’re also doing what we’ve always done best: speaking for you — calling out networks for prioritizing profits over loyalty, for treating longtime fans like they’re disposable. And now we’re entering a new phase. As of today, we’ve seen three of the four major broadcast networks reveal their fall TV schedules, and frankly? It’s bleak. NBC will only air two nights of scripted television — the rest is dominated by sports, especially as they ramp up for their NBA deal. FOX offers just one night for dramas and one for (mostly animated) comedies. Even CBS, long the home of traditional scripted lineups, is now committing one full night to unscripted reality. ABC’s schedule hasn’t dropped yet, but we already know it leans heavily on unscripted fare. That means if you’re someone who still watches TV the old-fashioned way — cable or over-the-air — your access to scripted drama and comedy is going to plummet. And that means we, at TV Fanatic, are in flux too. We’re going to be covering more streaming content. We’re going to be covering more (gasp) reality TV. And yes, we now have passionate reality TV fans on our team — because this is where the industry is headed, whether we like it or not. But here’s the good news: we’re not just going to follow — we want to lead. And that means we need you. We want to know what you’re watching. What you care about. What you wish more people were talking about. What shows still deserve better, even if the networks have moved on. So talk to us. Comment. Share. Sign up for our newsletter. Visit daily. Help us shape what comes next. We’re not just surviving — we’re evolving. And if we do it right, we’ll come out stronger, together. And this is just the beginning. I’ll be using Carissa’s Corner more frequently to speak directly to you — our readers, our people.  It’s a space where we can skip the press releases and straight-to-series breakdowns and just talk about what’s really on our minds. Sometimes, it’ll be about the industry, and sometimes, it’ll be about the community. But it’ll always be real. Thanks for being here. Let’s keep going — together.",
