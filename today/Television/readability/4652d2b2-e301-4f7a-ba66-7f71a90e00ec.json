  "text": "CBS has FBI Tuesday, so why not Blue Bloods Friday? It’s annoying that franchises take up an entire night of television — FBIs on Tuesdays on CBS and One Chicago on Wednesdays on NBC. Still, if any show deserves a night to itself, it’s Blue Bloods and any of its expansions. After insisting on canceling the original at the height of its popularity, the least CBS can do is give us THREE spinoffs. (Courtesy of CBS) Blue Bloods SHOULD Have Introduced A Spinoff On The Lineup Before It Went Off The Air CBS screwed up by not even thinking about spinoffs until after Blue Bloods started its final season. Honestly, I don’t know that Blue Bloods’ cancellation will ever make sense to me. But if a spinoff had been waiting in the wings, it would have softened the blow. (They also should have marketed the final eight episodes as a shortened Blue Bloods season 15 instead of calling them Blue Bloods Season 14 leftovers that only got onto the fall schedule because of the writers’ strike, but that’s beside the point.) That might not have been possible last season because of the writers’ strike, but if CBS had begun airing a Blue Bloods spinoff alongside those final eight episodes of the original show, it would have made the loss of Blue Bloods so much easier to take. We would have had half a season to get to know the new series, and then after Blue Bloods was done, the spinoff could have slid into its spot. That would have given fans a seamless transition that didn’t involve putting things in that time slot that absolutely do not appeal to Blue Bloods fanatics. (CBS/Screenshot) Sadly, CBS didn’t do that. Instead, they removed Blue Bloods from the schedule and stuck S.W.A.T in its place, as if the reason Blue Bloods was so popular was that it was a police procedural, so any other crime drama would do. CBS can’t go back in time and fix that egregious error. But now that there’s a spinoff on the table, it can start the process of fixing this by ordering two other spinoffs to accompany it. Having a Bunch of Blue Bloods Spinoffs Would Be Like Having Blue Bloods Back (CBS/HIGHEST QUALITY SCREENGRAB AVAILABLE) The reason Blue Bloods worked so well wasn’t because it was a police drama. It was the family aspects — the one thing that modern viewers are hungry for that network TV doesn’t seem to want to give them anymore. CBS felt the show was too expensive, and that’s why it canceled Blue Bloods. We can’t fix that at this point, but if we had a night full of spinoffs, it might help us feel like the Reagans are still in our living room every Friday night. So far, CBS has only ordered one Blue Bloods spinoff: Boston Blue. I’m excited but concerned because this new show promises to pluck Danny out of the Reagan family and put him in Boston, where he’ll interact with someone else’s prominent cop family. (Courtesy of CBS) Imagine, though, if there were two other spinoffs on the same night as Boston Blue. For example, we could have: Danny in Boston on Boston Blue Jamie and Eddie working for Nassau County Police while caring for their newborn in a spinoff where they move to the suburbs A prequel where Frank is a young father and cop and his father is Commissioner of Police (still my favorite Blue Bloods spinoff idea.) (Courtesy of CBS) Having all of those shows on one night would let us catch up with what most of the Reagans are doing after the finale (and do a deep dive into Frank’s past that actually feels like Blue Bloods.) The Biggest Problem With The Blue Bloods Friday Idea: Too Many Possibilities In order to make this work, some other shows would have to be moved elsewhere or scrapped. I’m petty enough to be okay with that. CBS treated Blue Bloods like something that needed to be rushed into the trash when it was one of its top shows, after all. Besides, that’s not the biggest problem with this idea. The truth is, there are so many Blue Bloods spinoff possibilities that one night isn’t enough. We need a show from Erin’s point of view about the cases she tries, one about Joe Hill, and maybe even one about Henry’s second act — him finding purpose and staying connected to the cops as a senior citizen who New York City wants to write off as feeble and frail. Forget Blue Bloods Friday. We need a Blue Bloods channel that shows nothing but spinoffs all week long and reruns of the original on the weekends. (Courtesy of CBS) Over to you, Blue Bloods fanatics. What do you think of the idea of Blue Bloods Fridays? After you vote in our poll, head to the comments to share your thoughts. All 14 seasons of Blue Bloods currently stream on Paramount+. Boston Blue will air on CBS sometime in the 2026-2027 TV season. Watch Blue Bloods Online",
