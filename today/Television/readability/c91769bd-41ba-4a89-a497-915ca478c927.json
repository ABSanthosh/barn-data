  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.1 / 5.04.1 Watching fall begin as we approach Valentine’s Day seemed odd, especially since this When Calls the Heart installment was very romance-focused. Nathan had requested forensic investigator Georgie McGill’s (Melissa Gilbert) assistance with the train robbery on When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 6, not realizing she and Bill were old friends. Jack Wagner and Melissa Gilbert sizzled, and hopefully, this is the beginning of a fun romance for Bill and Georgie. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) While Elizabeth suffered from a cold, she experienced some romantic fantasies of her and Nathan while he cared for her. Allie needed assistance healing her broken heart, and Oliver helped immensely as they researched the problem in the ecosystem. The two realized they had more in common than they realized and may have felt a tiny spark. Rosemary learned the children were unhappy about many things the Governor had done and thought they were the perfect opponents for Lucas on her new show. This was one of the most entertaining parts of the episode. When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 6 Explored Bill’s History With the One Who Got Away When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 6 finally explored Bill’s past and gave him the attention he deserved. His character is often overlooked unless he’s helping to solve a mystery. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) He finally got to take the lead along with Georgie McGill (Melissa Gilbert). As an avid Little House on the Prairie fan, I have been eagerly waiting for this arc, and Gilbert and Jack Wagner possessed chemistry from the beginning. Even though Nathan brought her to town, they didn’t need his assistance or input. While Georgie insisted they didn’t want to blow Nathan’s cover, it was obvious she preferred working with Bill, someone she knew and trusted. Working in a male-dominated field as a forensics investigator back then was challenging. Either your peers disregarded your thoughts or treated you as one of the guys. Bill:  You think I didn’t notice? Georgie: It drove me crazy is the truth of it. Even though Georgie usually excelled at reading minds, she never knew how Bill felt about her. They kept their feelings too close to the vest since he was entangled with Nora then and stepped up to claim her child. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) Angsty couples with regrets are often the most fun since they get a second chance at love. Hopefully, Georgie McGill sticks around long enough for us to see Bill lucky in love. While he and Georgie learned more about each other on the train ride, they weren’t as successful in gathering information from Sonny Garrison. However, the longer it takes, the longer she’ll be in town. Elizabeth’s Cold Led to Romantic Fantasies I never knew colds led to fever dreams. If I did, I’d want to get sick. It’s difficult to discern if the cold or strong cold medicine initiated these fever dreams or romantic fantasies. They were filmed well, and viewers could tell when Elizabeth or later Nathan experienced one of them making out while doing laundry. (©2025 Hallmark Media) Nathan looked hot, chopping wood, shirtless, and in his uniform, although he was also sweet, coming to care for Elizabeth every day. These little moments propel a couple forward. The only thing that annoyed me was that they discussed heartbreak. I believe Nathan is heartbroken because of Elizabeth, but she is deeply in love with Lucas. That seems like a rewrite of the love triangle. Allie and Oliver’s Relationship Shifted as They Researched a New Mystery Even though Allie turned 17 on When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 4, she still seems young. She’s recovering from her first heartbreak and is more interested in saving the wolves and the bears. While that project distracted and thrilled her, Wyatt’s rejection still stung. Luckily, another cute boy was around to help with the distraction. (©2025 Hallmark Media) While Allie initially saw Oliver as a buddy, their relationship deepened while hunting for clues. Oliver demonstrated how chivalrous and protective he was of Allie when he protected her from the intruders near McGinty’s Meadow. Oliver finally opened up to Allie. He confided in her that he walked the straight arrow because he couldn’t afford to get caught in trouble since his mom was actually in prison. Many people assumed he would end up like her. That was such a huge break in their relationship, whether they were close friends or became a couple. Oliver has difficulty trusting people, and he trusts Allie with his deepest secret. Hearing that made Allie realize her complaints about her birthday party and crush were petty. She tried to cheer Oliver up by bringing him a cupcake and throwing a makeshift party. You could feel the sparks as they shared the cupcake, and she shared how her birthfather was in prison, too. (©2025 Hallmark Media) Nathan may not like this blossoming romance, but it will be entertaining. When Calls the Heart Finally Used Lucas’s Character Better Lucas has been poorly used since the end of When Calls the Heart Season 10. While he’s always cared about bettering Hope Valley, it’s never been at the expense of others. He still cares about people’s opinions and has a soft spot for children, so he initially wanted to create the National Park. I wish he would eliminate Edwin, who treated them like annoying people, bothering the governor with their hazelnut business or their thoughts. Therefore, Rosemary and Fiona’s new show, “The Daily Dialogue,” was the ideal solution, allowing Lucas to hear and answer the children’s concerns. (©2025 Hallmark Media) He seemed genuinely happy to see them and eager to help. Their requests were more personal initially until it was Allie’s turn, and Lucas met his match. As mentioned earlier, Allie was passionate about providing cold streams for salmon to spawn and fish for the wolves and bears to eat and thrive. She had prepared research to show Lucas where the cattle crossed and disrupted the water, and she wouldn’t back down. Lucas may be in a tight spot since he agreed to share the land with Edie Martel, but he wouldn’t want to upset Allie or sentence animals to die. This finally became more interesting. We’re also excited that Fiona is still in town. She doesn’t look as enthused about getting married as she does helping others. (©2025 Hallmark Media) We would love it if she extended her visit, helped Rosemary with her new radio show, and continued to run the spa. Over to you, Hearties. Do Bill and Georgie have chemistry? Did Oliver help mend Allie’s heart? Was discussing politics with the children the best thing Lucas has done lately?
