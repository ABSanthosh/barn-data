  "text": "The Bear is serving up another meal: Hulu‘s Emmy-winning culinary dramedy has been renewed for a fifth season, set to debut in 2026, TVLine has learned. “The Bear continues to be a fan favorite worldwide and their response to this season — as seen through incredibly high viewership — has been as spectacular as any of its previous seasons,” FX chairman John Landgraf said in a statement. (The Bear is an FX production that airs exclusively on Hulu.) “Year-in and year-out, Chris Storer, the producers, cast and crew make The Bear one of the best shows on television, and we are excited that they will continue to tell this magnificent story.” The Bear stars Jeremy Allen White as Carmy, who returns to his hometown of Chicago to take over his family’s sandwich shop after the death of his brother Mikey, turning it into a fine-dining restaurant. Ayo Edebiri co-stars as Carmy’s fellow chef Sydney, with Ebon Moss-Bachrach as host Richie, Liza Colón-Zayas as line cook Tina and Lionel Bryce as dessert chef Marcus. The supporting cast includes Abby Elliott and Matty Matheson, with guest appearances by Jon Bernthal, Oliver Platt, Molly Gordon and Jamie Lee Curtis. Debuting to little fanfare in 2022 with an eight-episode freshman season, The Bear quickly became a critical darling, winning 10 Emmys for Season 1, including best comedy series and acting awards for White, Edebiri and Moss-Bachrach. Season 2 did even better, winning 11 Emmys, a record for a comedy in a single year, which included acting wins for White, Moss-Bachrach and Colón-Zayas. Season 4 debuted in June, with all 10 episodes dropping at once. (Read our finale recap here.) Happy to hear The Bear is keeping its doors open? What are you hoping to see in Season 5?
