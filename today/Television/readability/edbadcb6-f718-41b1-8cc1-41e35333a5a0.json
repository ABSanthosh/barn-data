  "text": "Trying to fit in as a teenager was brutal. I can’t imagine growing up in Atlanta, where etiquette and Cotillion Balls ruled the world. Will and Faith discover that their latest victim, on Will Trent Season 3 Episode 10, had many secrets and likely suffered from being part of a rich and elite society. They’ll have their work cut out for them as they go through multiple suspects and motives. (ABC/ Screenshot) Additional spoilers tease that Faith and Elijah’s (Darius Jordan Lee) relationship deepens. We haven’t seen him on-screen yet, but Faith obviously has a new boyfriend. Finally, Michael and Angie investigate the death of a regular customer at the local sandwich shop. The GBI Investigates the Disappearance of a Teenage Girl, Uncovering Many Secrets The leading case looks heartbreaking. Will always strives to save kids, and Faith may have difficulty with this, too, since Jeremy is only a few years older. It looks like the case quickly escalates from a kidnapping to a murder when Will finds Whitney’s body in an underground sewer. We’ve seen some horrific cases on Will Trent, and that’s a cold place to dump a body. (ABC/ Screenshot) Since this was a child, it’ll be even more challenging since Will has to break the devastating news to her mother and find the killer. That’s harder than it seems, as teenagers are pros at hiding things. While Whitney was an Honor Roll student and appeared close to her mother, she had her share of secrets. Will discovered she smoked pot and had some boyfriends. That doesn’t sound terrible for a teenager, so what was she hiding? The mystery remains as to whether Whitney committed an act to get accepted into elite society or was the ringleader. She looks like the epitome of sweetness and innocence, but sometimes, those are the people who have the darkest secrets.  (Disney/Zac Popik) Hopefully, whatever Will discovers won’t destroy her mother even more. Being Part of a Rich and Elite Culture Is a Competitive and Deadly Game Trying to become part of an elite and wealthy society can be fun or dangerous, depending on how it’s monitored. We’ve seen horror hazing stories on several procedurals, and Prime Video’s Cruel Intentions demonstrated how far students will go to join elite societies. Atlanta is known for its moral standards and exemplary etiquette, which is displayed at these debutante and cotillion balls. Some students take charge instead, making it challenging for others to join, and then hazing becomes a dangerous and deadly game. (ABC/ Screenshot) Since one suspect insinuated that Whitney had many enemies, we wonder if she was an instigator and others fought back or if she was on the receiving end. Will hates letting down victims, and it’s progress that he can admit that he may have missed a clue. Marion looks dressed up, so I suspect she and Will will attend the Debutante Ball to fish for clues. They’ll have to look like general chaperones rather than agents, which will help them blend in better, and the guests will feed them more information. You’d be surprised by the gossip you can learn from these events. (ABC/ Screenshot) Faith Has a New Boyfriend, Who Makes His First On-Screen Appearance During This Case Additional spoilers tease that Faith grows closer to Elijah (Darius Jordan Lee), whom we’ve never seen or heard of. I fear he will be like Luke, who randomly appears, and from the promo, that might be the case. Elijah is at the Debutante Ball practice, so he could be a dance instructor, another reporter investigating the case, or another option. Hopefully, since this case will touch Faith and her Atlanta culture, we’ll spend some time getting to know him. Faith is the only one besides Amanda who hasn’t had any romance yet on Will Trent Season 3, so it’s time for her to have fun. I don’t think this episode will revisit Jeremy and his legal troubles yet. It seems busy, but maybe she’ll learn about Jeremy and Will’s deal near the end. It’ll be another issue that will change Faith’s life. Michael and Angie Investigate a Death at a Local Sandwich Shop Like Will Trent Season 3 Episode 9, it appears that Angie and Michael will handle a side mystery. Their cases used to add comic relief, so let’s hope this one does, too. We don’t know much about this storyline, but I’ve watched many police procedurals where a restaurant regular dies. The chef or another employee will likely be involved. If the cook at the sandwich shop has issues with the regular, it would be easy to poison them since the cook likely knows their food allergens. (ABC/ Screenshot) There are also many household weapons in a kitchen, such as knives, so we’re curious to see where this one leads. Over to you, Will Trent Fanatics.
