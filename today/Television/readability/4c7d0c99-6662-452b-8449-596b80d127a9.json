  "text": "Exciting news, Law \u0026 Order: SVU fanatics! We have an exclusive sneak peek of Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 26 Episode 6 from NBC that gives us an additional clue as to what the episode will be about. Those of you who were wondering what was going on with Kate Silva will be thrilled with this. (NBC/Viriginia Sherwood) Silva and Bruno Work Together On A Brutal Attack As we discussed in our Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 26 Episode 6 spoilers, this episode focuses on a brutal attack at a campground. A woman and her boyfriend are attacked, leading to a complicated situation in which the boyfriend is awake but has no memory of anything, and the girlfriend ends up on life support. The exclusive sneak peek gives us more information. Bruno and Silva will be working with FBI Agent Clay, and they will get their first look at the crime at the scene. The scene introduces several important aspects of the case, but the most important one is Silva’s great deductive skills. She examines the scene thoroughly, offers a few insights, and discusses the case with Silva—all within a few seconds! (NBC/Ralph Bavaro) How Well Will Silva and Bruno Work Together? The sneak peek doesn’t tell us everything, of course, but we can get some hints about how well they work together from the short scene. Bruno takes the lead when talking to Agent Clay, but after he leaves, the two become more equal partners. Silva is able to bounce ideas off of Bruno, and the two come up with a theory together. Silva leads Bruno to think more carefully about what the evidence suggests. If this clip is any indication, these two will make a great team, and it’ll be fun for them to interact throughout the episode. (NBC/Virginia Sherwood) Bruno usually works with Fin, and we’ll have some more of that as well, but it’s great that the team is mixing up partners more and letting Silva have her chance to shine. Judging from the Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 26 Episode 5 exclusive clip, the crime will be even more brutal than it sounds, so keep that in mind. There’s blood everywhere, and it suggests the victim was hit in the back of the head with a rock. That suggests a serial killer, or at the very least, a rage-filled perp. It’ll be interesting to find out more. Here’s the clip for you to watch for yourself. After you’ve checked it out, hit the comments and let us know what you think. Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 26 Episode 6 airs tonight (Thursday, November 7) on NBC at 9/8c and will be available on Peacock tomorrow. Watch Law \u0026 Order: SVU Season 26 Episode 6 online",
