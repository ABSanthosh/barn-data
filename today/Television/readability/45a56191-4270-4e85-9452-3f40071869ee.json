  "text": "David Harris, the actor best known for playing Cochise in Walter Hill’s pulpy 1979 thriller The Warriors, has died. He was 75. Harris died Friday at his home in New York City after suffering from cancer, his daughter Davina Harris told the New York Times. Harris’ Cochise is an integral member of the street gang at the center of the 1979 cult classic The Warriors. Based on Sol Yurick’s 1965 novel of the same name and directed/co-written by Hill, the movie follows a gang that travels from the Bronx to Coney Island after being falsely accused of murdering a gang leader. Harris’ Cochise stood out for having an eccentric taste in fashion. Harris’ first acting credit came in 1976 when he played Haywood Patterson in the Emmy-nominated TV-movie Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys. He went on to appear in several TV series during his career, most notably recurring as Officer Donny Simmons from 1993-2002 on ABC’s NYPD Blue (watch a fan-made supercut below). He also appeared in episodes of First Wives Club, Instinct, Law \u0026 Order: SVU, ER, MacGyver and more. In addition to The Warriors, Harris’ film credits include Brubaker, Quicksilver, A Soldier’s Story and Fatal Beauty.",
