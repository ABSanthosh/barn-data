  "text": "CBS‘ NCIS: Origins is about “a story I don’t tell,” narrator Mark Harmon’s Leroy Jethro Gibbs tells us midway through the prequel spinoff’s premiere. Specifically, “This is the story of–“ Actually, the end of that sentence is a major spoiler, and the onset of a provocative mystery. And Gibbs’ full declaration, as the forever-analog former NCIS agent puts this story to paper in front of an Alaskan campfire, is bound to figuratively ignite your interest in what lies ahead. Launching this Monday at a special time (9/8c) with a double-episode premiere, NCIS: Origins is set in the year 1991 — not long after a young Gibbs (played by Austin Stowell) returned from serving in Operation Desert Storm, only to bury his tragically killed wife and young daughter. The series follows Gibbs as he begins his career as a newly minted Special Agent at the NIS Camp Pendleton office, under the tutelage of the legendary Mike Franks (Big Sky‘s Kyle Schmid). But we already know this story, some NCIS fans have contended, citing bits and pieces scattered across Mark Harmon’s 19 seasons on the mothership and a smattering of flashback episodes featuring Harmon’s son Sean as a young Gibbs. NCIS: Origins, though, is here to fill in blanks you weren’t expecting (including about the aforementioned story he mysteriously has never told), and bring to life seminal, never-before-seen moments from Gibbs’ past. (How do you think Jethro reacted when he first was told the Shannon/Kelly news?) Because Gibbs is new to his job at NIS — and because he is still shellshocked by his personal loss to a greater degree than he might admit — “Probie” is understandably reserved upon claiming his desk at Camp Pendleton. He holds back on hunches. He’s more laconic than even his older self. That low-key vibe may give a viewer concern, out of the gate, given that this is Gibbs’ story. I, for one, had some reservations coming out of the premiere, for that very reason. But there is a “Gibbs first” in Episode 3 that excitingly activates the character and imbues the rookie agent with a confidence that will be warmly familiar to NCIS fans. While Gibbs feels his way around NIS and his duties, the ensemble cast shines, and there are some real winners among this lot. Schmid already detailed for TVLine his process for becoming a young Franks à la NCIS guest star Muse Watson, and it is a growling, chain-smoking, mustachioed portrayal to behold. Mariel Molino (Promised Land), as Special Agent Lala Dominguez is a tremendous find, giving confident and fearless Marion Ravenwood in nearly every scene. Caleb Foote (Made for Love) and recurring guest star Bobby Moynihan (SNL) serve up comic relief as gung-ho Special Agent “Randy” Randolf and overworked forensics lab boss Woody. Diany Rodriguez (The Blacklist) is a bit of an enigma thus far as Special Agent Vera Strickland, though she and Molino have a powerful scene together early on. Similarly, Tyla Abercrumbie (The Chi) as Field Operation Support Officer/”Head Secretary in Charge” Mary Jo Hayes doesn’t get much focus until Episode 4, but when she does, she absolutely brings the goods as NIS’ warm beating heart. In recurring roles, Patrick Fischler (Mad Men) finds just the right level of officious as SAC Wheeler, and it’s very easy to see how Robert Taylor (Longmire) might age into NCIS‘ Ralph Waite, as Gibbs’ father Jackson. Now, you ask: What about young Gibbs himself? As noted above, series front man Austin Stowell — of Peacock’s A Friend of the Family and much more recently Starz’s Three Women — is tasked at the start with having to lie low and give us a Gibbs who is a bit unsure of himself, and is (too?) often distracted by tragic memories. And looks-wise, he is more “Jack Reacher” than “Sean Harmon.” But the nature of the character at this very specific point in his life does call for gravitas — this is Gibbs like you’ve never seen him before — and Stowell does well with that material, including to heartbreaking effect in Episode 4. (There are also times when Stowell’s voice eerily sounds just like Mark Harmon’s, or when he’ll cock his head just as Boss would when getting an update from DiNozzo.) The 1991 setting, as you can imagine, lends itself to not just Asteroids and Galaga machines in the NIS break room, but all manner of “retro” technology and crimesolving methods. (Do not ask Franks how to start up the newly delivered PC, and do not expect fingerprint analysis back from Woody inside of two days!) A trip to a mall in Episode 3 doesn’t distract with ’90s fashion, but there are occasional needle drops — including a use of a Bangles tune that took me a second viewing to truly appreciate. THE TVLINE BOTTOM LINE: Both young Gibbs and NCIS: Origins take a minute to find their bearings, but once they do, this latest NCIS offshoot shows promise.

And looks-wise, he is more “Jack Reacher” than “Sean Harmon.” But the nature of the character at this very specific point in his life does call for gravitas — this is Gibbs like you’ve never seen him before — and Stowell does well with that material, including to heartbreaking effect in Episode 4. (There are also times when Stowell’s voice eerily sounds \u003cem\u003ejust like\u003c/em\u003e Mark Harmon’s, or when he’ll cock his head just as Boss would when getting an update from DiNozzo.) \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 1991 setting, as you can imagine, lends itself to not just Asteroids and Galaga machines in the NIS break room, but all manner of “retro” technology and crimesolving methods.

A trip to a mall in Episode 3 doesn’t distract with ’90s fashion, but there are occasional needle drops — including a use of a Bangles tune that took me a second viewing to truly appreciate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE TVLINE BOTTOM LINE: Both young Gibbs and \u003cem\u003eNCIS: Origins\u003c/em\u003e take a minute to find their bearings, but once they do, this latest \u003cem\u003eNCIS\u003c/em\u003e offshoot shows promise.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cmark\u003eWant scoop on \u003cem\u003eNCIS: Origins\u003c/em\u003e, or for any other TV show\u003c/mark\u003e?
