Yet, due to many circumstances, 9-1-1: Lone Star’s final season has not appeased viewers in this area.  We wondered what a Grace-less season for this fiery series might look like, and the reality is bleak.  (Kevin Estrada/FOX) No Matter How You Slice It, Grace’s Exit Makes No Sense It’s hard for a series to develop characters, but that’s especially true when they are beloved.  We always knew there would be no easy way to write out Grace Ryder when the news broke that Sierra McClain wouldn’t return for the final season.  (Kevin Estrada/FOX) The writers had their work cut out for them, and so much of the issue was finding a way to do so that honored the character and her marriage to Judd.  The Ryders are the backbone of this series, so losing the fundamentals in the final season was already a colossal blow.  The writers didn’t want to risk more ire by killing the character offscreen or Grace and Judd separating.  However, with two installments remaining in the final season and coming off 9-1-1: Lone Star Season 5 Episode 10‘s dizzying emotional arc, we can confirm that Grace’s absence makes zero sense.  Grace’s Calling Priotizing Random Strangers Over Her Loved Ones Doesn’t Work  (Kevin Estrada/FOX) The Grace Ryder we know was a kind, giving, generous, devoted, and, yes, Godly woman.  Sure, she’d give the clothes off her back to help another person in need, so nothing is surprising about her lending a hand in some capacity.  However, missionary work that takes her across the globe and leaves her out of touch with her toddler and codependent husband doesn’t click for the character in the least.  Grace nearly died trying to give birth to sweet baby Charlie. She struggled so much with things like returning to work when it meant missing out on those little moments with her first child.  It’s unrealistic that she’d opt to leave Charlie for months to take care of other children.  Grace is a woman who always answers the call, but now, she’s placed herself in a position that keeps her from doing so for her husband and daughter. Not our Gracie.  An Attempt to Prove Grace’s Selflessness Sadly Backfired. (Kevin Estrada/FOX) The arc attempts to highlight Grace’s selflessness.  However, the problem is that when you have to hold it up against the degree to which things are falling apart back at home in her absence, it reads as a rash, short-sided decision that caused serious damage.  It was a stretch to believe that Judd could not only manage Grace’s absence from his life and limited access to her, but he could singlehandedly care for Charlie on his own.  Technically, when Grace left, Judd was wrapping up spending all of his time helping Wyatt mend and then assisting Wyatt in preparing for fatherhood himself.  (Kevin Estrada/FOX) Then, Judd had to jump back into firefighting, which meant his work schedule was all over the place. Sure, Judd would’ve had help from his village, but it was a lot on his shoulders, and I don’t envision Grace not giving that more thought.  But it also sucks that in Grace’s absence, we’ve had such huge storylines, including Tommy’s cancer. She and Tommy are best friends, and now it has her out of the loop and often out of network when it’s time to support Tommy through a literal fight for her life.  Knowing how Grace would have an integral role in some of these arcs doesn’t make her absence any easier to cope with since she’s not there for them.  Judd without Grace is an Empty Vessel (Kevin Estrada/FOX) We had a good idea of what Judd looks like without Grace during 9-1-1: Lone Star Season 2 Episode 9‘s flashbacks to their love story. Before Grace, Judd was a broken spirit with suicide ideation who didn’t find much meaning in his life and was guilt-ridden over a childhood trauma.  And when he thought Grace was leaving him and he didn’t meet her father’s expectations, he fell apart all over again.  Judd was a reckless, angry man who fell into a dark space he couldn’t claw himself out of, and if not for what Grace represented for him and eventually reuniting with her, it’s no wonder where he would’ve been.  (Kevin Estrada/FOX) The Judd who couldn’t get Grace’s legs unpinned when their truck went into the river wouldn’t leave her side because he’d literally rather die than live his life without her.  And as she fought for his life, he was willing and ready to kill the person who caused harm to her.  Judd’s love for Grace is intrinsically part of his identity. There is no proper way of getting past or through it, and watching him descend into alcoholism and depression is heartbreaking but not unexpected.  But did we want to see this for the character in the final season?  9-1-1: Lone Star Dims the Light of Brightest Couple in Final Season (Scott Everett White/FOX) Given that the Ryders have been the heart and soul of the series, it’s upsetting that we have to close out a series we love on such a dark note.  If we were going to spend the whole season with Judd slipping into darkness and not even having the emotional stability to take care of Charlie on his own, they could’ve killed Grace off.  It hurts me to suggest it, but it’s true. The results would’ve essentially been the same.  I’m still of the mind that given how this series has played out anyway, it would’ve been just as easy to simply have Grace offscreen or incredibly busy pursuing a degree and considering a career change.  We still would’ve had a similar concept of Judd trying to hold down the fort and care for Charlie.  An Alternative Plot Wouldn’t Have Squandered Judd’s Growth and Ending (Scott Everett White/FOX) He would’ve had the growing pains and come to grips with how much Grace holds the household together. The only difference is it would be without all of the depression, sadness, or out-of-character bits.  During 9-1-1: Lone Star Season 5 Episode 10, Judd was at his rock bottom, with the risktaking with his own life, drinking, lying, and destructive qualities.  He was having a crisis of faith and searching for signs from God that he’d be okay and Grace would get back to him.  Owen helping him through it was great since they’ve forged a genuine brotherhood, but these issues weren’t surprising but upsetting to witness.  The Judd we know has always had his faith, livelihood, and will to live so interconnected with Grace that there would never be any other arc to explore for him.  A Grace-Less Final Season Missed the Mark (Kevin Estrada/FOX) For one of Lone Star’s most beloved characters, it’s not the ideal ending for him, and one would have wished that he could have a final season that came full circle or properly got to address how much he’s evolved since we first met him.  Instead, Judd started the series in a depressive state after losing his entire squad in a fire, and he’s essentially signing off the series in a sad state because his wife and biggest support are gone, and he can’t cope without her.  We know Sierra McClain isn’t returning for the finale, so any hope of a Ryder reunion is dashed. At best, he’ll get a text message after the dust from the asteroid settles, stating that she’s on her way home.  But it doesn’t change that the Ryders’ beautiful reign flamed out unsatisfactorily, and even casual viewers are upset. Over to you, Lone Star Fanatics. How do you feel about Grace’s absence and Judd’s arc in this final season?  Watch 9-1-1: Lone Star Online",
