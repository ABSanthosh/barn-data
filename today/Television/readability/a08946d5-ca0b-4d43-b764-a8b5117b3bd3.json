So here’s hoping that the family dinner pictured in this exclusive sneak peek at the show’s winter premiere helps ease Carisi’s ongoing trauma. As you can see from the photo above, Kelli Giddish, who plays Rollins, will guest-star in the episode. Apparently, the family goes out for pizza — look how much little Nicky has grown since the last time we saw him! TVLine’s month-long #2025FirstLook continues with a shot from an episode titled “First Light,” which will air on Thursday, Jan. 16 at 9/8c. (Find out when your other favorite shows will be back from winter break!) In it, per the official synopsis, the haunted assistant district attorney “struggles to move on from his ordeal when the suspect changes his plea.” You’ll recall that Carisi had a very rough time in the procedural’s fall finale, when a simple trip to the bodega to buy flowers turned into a hostage situation/rape/murder. Though Carisi survived, relatively physically unscathed, both Rollins and Benson agreed that he wasn’t OK emotionally. And the suspect, who had pled that he was acting in self-defense the whole time, now seems to see the matter differently — might it have anything to do with what he yelled at Carisi as he was being led away in handcuffs? Will you tune in to see if pizza can fight Carisi’s demons? (We’ve had pies that could!) Hit the comments and let us know!",
