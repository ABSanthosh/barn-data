  "text": "Will Nolan turn in Bailey?  It’s trouble in paradise for Bailan on The Rookie Season 7 Episode 6, but they may not be the only couple facing some friction.  Everything may come to a head during a charity gala on Valentine’s Day. What can of Valentine’s Day will The Rookie deliver? A romantic one or a massacre? (Disney/Mike Taing) Nolan Will Confront Bailey about Jason’s Death  Bailey’s partnership with Malvado was fruitful. No one has to worry about her skeezy, abusive ex with an ax to grind and a determination to get back at Bailey because now he’s pushing up astroturf.  Unfortunately, it’s shady that a paramedic joined forces with a hired hitman to go after a fugitive, and it’s a less-than-ideal situation when your husband is LAPD.  Nolan found the burner phone at the end of The Rookie Season 7 Episode 5, and now he has some questions about his wife’s involvement with Jason’s assassination.  It doesn’t take a genius to put two and two together, and now that he has these suspicions, it presents a moral and ethical conundrum for Nolan as he must grapple with what to do with his wife.  (Disney/Mike Taing) Will he turn her over or consult someone? We’ll have to say, but one has to wonder if he’ll communicate with Malvado or even attempt to bring him instead.  Nolan Works a Missing Persons Case with Celina In the meantime, he’ll tackle a case with Celina that includes searching for a missing girl. Nolan is rarely able to keep much away from Celina, so we’ll have to see if she becomes his confidant.  Since it’s Valentine’s Day, there’s a great deal on the agenda, but one of the more amusing teases about the hour is that Grey will assign Chenford a non-romantic project.  (Disney/Mike Taing) However, will it be the perfect time for sparks to fly between them again? Also, what does an unromantic task entail?  The hour is titled “The Gala,” referring to a charity event, so maybe Chenford will have to join forces to prepare for it, and we’ll get some quality content for the two that continues to move them forward in this song-and-dance they’re doing.  Genny Returns, But Will Chenford’s Romance Return on Valentine’s Day? Genny’s return is also an intriguing development for the hour. One has to wonder if perhaps she helped plan the charity gala, and maybe that’s why she’s featured there and looking as gorgeous as ever.  Of course, we also catch glimpses of her in either her or Tim’s apartment, and there seems to be the usual sibling chiding. Maybe she’s on his butt about screwing things up with Lucy.  (Disney/Mike Taing) The charity gala will be where all the action and excitement happens, and it’ll test some of The Rookie’s couples.  If I had to guess, I’d say Grey and Luna are the only pairing who may not face any issues. They’re solid as a rock and have become a grounding pair within the series.  Luna appears to be having a good time at the gala, and Grey’s having a ball chatting it up with Nolan and even Lucy.  Which Couples Will Struggle at the Gala? (Disney/Mike Taing) Things appear okay with Angela and Wesley, as they haven’t had too many issues. However, one has to wonder if Wesley’s jealousy over Graham will eventually come out.  He’s been holding this secret about Graham’s interest in his wife, but if Graham is there and says or does something inappropriate, it may be the perfect time for something to happen and this jealousy arc to come to a head.  One of the more concerning couples that are at the forefront of my mind, however, is Nyla and James.  Nyla looks stunning in her ensemble, and I love any opportunity to see her dressed up.  Tension Between Nyla and James Could Reach a Boiling Point (Disney/Mike Taing) It’s no surprise that she and James are hanging out with their best friends, Angela and Wesley, nor is it that the bromance is going strong between Wesley and James.  But something is brewing between Nyla and James. There is a detachment, and it’s concerning that they haven’t been on the same page.  Little things like James’ activism work clashing with Nyla’s position as a cop have blown up significantly this season, and we don’t know what’s at the root of their problem.  It doesn’t feel as if their marriage is long for this world, and it’s upsetting, given everything both have endured.  (Disney/Mike Taing) We haven’t exactly seen James around while Nyla has struggled with the events of that needle jab and a serial killer coming after her. These days, she has more chemistry with the killer than her husband.  If the hour is teasing that things will come to a head for some of The Rookie’s couples, one has to wonder if there’s a bleak element for Nyla and James.  Have Miles and His Longtime Girlfriend Grown Apart? Out of everyone there, they seem the least likely to survive the night on the best terms.  Of course, there’s also a new couple, Miles and Camille, who will also have some screen time after she surprises Miles by moving to Los Angeles for him.  (Disney/Mike Taing) They’re high school sweethearts, and she’s been through all the ups and downs in Miles’ life, but it didn’t seem like he was the happiest about her arrival even though he’s spoken so fondly about her to his colleagues.  There’s something more to that and his feelings, and maybe we’ll learn what that is by the end of the hour.  We can expect a drama-filled Valentine’s Day installment of The Rookie.  Watch The Rookie Online Over to you, The Rookie Fanatics!  Will Nolan turn Bailey over to the police? Which couples will face issues at the gala? Do you think Chenford will reunite for Valentine’s Day? Sound off below with all of your thoughts and theories for an all-new The Rookie! And we’ll see you Tuesday for a full review!",
