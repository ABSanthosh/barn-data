  "text": "I can’t believe Will Trent is going there. Cults are the most dangerous places to investigate when someone is already depressed, so this seems like a disaster waiting to happen. The spoilers for Will Trent Season 3 Episode 12 indicate that while Will struggles with his own trauma, he goes undercover at Olas Collective, a wellness community, to investigate its deadly dealings. Screenshot (ABC/Screenshot) This has the potential to be another emotional episode as the GBI and APD work together, and Will continues to deal with the aftermath of his most important relationships. Will Grapples With Grief After Shooting That Young Teenager Will has struggled with losing so many people in his life, but being the cause of a trauma kills Will. Part of him wants to return to the field to make a difference, yet Angie and Amanda fear he’s not ready and needs more time to process. At the end of Will Trent Season 3 Episode 11, Will must attend therapy before returning to the field. Is it too much to ask that we see some of those sessions? Few characters need therapy more than Will, especially after this latest crisis. (ABC/ Screenshot) He isn’t exactly in denial, but he’s not in a rush to forgive himself either. He’s trying to move on without dealing with it. In some ways, this would be healthy, except Will wants to go undercover at a dangerous cult, where the female leader could eat him alive for breakfast. Will Gets in Over His Head With His Next Undercover Assignment How often have wellness communities disguised themselves as tranquil and united only to be a cult or something else? We’ve seen that most recently with Hulu’s Nine Perfect Strangers, but before Juliette Barnes was lured to a cult in Nashville when she was depressed, she believed she was improving herself. I’m worried that Will could get sucked in by the wellness center since the leader seems charming and wants others to believe they are united as one massive community. (ABC/ Screenshot) That doesn’t explain how some members have disappeared or even died, but belonging somewhere could appeal to Will with everything he’s been going through. Hopefully, this won’t be the only place we’ll see Will confront his demons because he won’t admit the truth while undercover. He’d have to keep his feelings private while interacting with other members and trying to discern their secrets. The leader seems to play to Will’s vulnerability, so Amanda might be right to be worried about him. Hopefully, Will is just playing along so she’ll trust him and confide in him about what’s really going on there before he gets in too deep. (ABC/ Screenshot) This looks to be another longer arc, so it could get worse before it gets better. Will Faith Follow Through on Getting a New Partner? While Faith and Will are still working cases together, things look tense between them in the weekly promo. Faith is often a woman of her word, so she could likely seek a new GBI partner. I’m unsure how that would go over with Amanda, who cares for Will and Faith like family, especially if Will and Faith don’t want other law enforcement involved. Amanda would want a valid reason for dissolving their partnership, and a fight wouldn’t cut it. (ABC/ Screenshot) She would also likely defend Will since Will kept Jeremy out of prison in the heat of the moment. Yes, Will should have informed Faith, but this situation was messy. This could be another reason Will decides to go undercover so Faith gets some needed space. Hopefully, she will cool down by the time he gathers some information at the wellness center, and Jeremy will stop being his informant soon. Will’s Relationships Will Likely Change After That Night Throughout Will Trent Season 3, he’s been happier and more laid-back since he started dating Marion. However, experiencing a trauma like accidentally killing a teenager will alter Will’s perspective again. (ABC/ Screenshot) It may be difficult to continue as if nothing has changed, even if, as Marion referred to it, it was a good shot. While she meant well and tried to reassure Will that he was a good person, he wouldn’t believe it. Will is the type of person who is hard on himself, and this trauma will haunt him. This may shift things since he didn’t respond to Marion’s missed calls when Angie comforted him. I don’t think it’ll be a love triangle, as much as I’d like Will and Angie to reunite. But Will realized he and Angie could be a different kind of soulmates. (ABC/ Screenshot) Even if they can’t date, seeing them be close friends again would be nice, but how will Marion feel about that? Over to you, Will Trent Fanatics. What do you want to see on “You’re the Worst Person In the World”? How long will it take Will to heal? Will he be taken advantage of at the cult? Do you think Faith will forgive Will?
