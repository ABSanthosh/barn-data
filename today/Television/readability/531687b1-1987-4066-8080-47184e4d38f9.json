  "text": "National Dog Show 2024: Which Winning Breed Just Made History?For the 23rd year in a row, NBC gave thanks to man’s best friend on Thursday with the 2024 National Dog Show, easily TV’s classiest annual dog-themed competition. (No offense, Puppy Bowl!) More than 1,800 dogs representing over 190 different breeds competed this time around, with the very good-est boys and girls convening at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center to witness the crowning of this year’s Best in Show winner. The dogs were divided into seven groups — Terrier, Toy, Working, Sporting, Hound, Non-Sporting and Herd — with one winner from each going on to compete for Best in Show. The unmatchable duo of John O’Hurley and David Frei once again returned to host this year’s National Dog Show, with additional commentary and behind-the-scenes coverage provided by sideline reporter Mary Carillo. So, which persistent pooch earned the title of Best in Show, joining previous winners like Stache the Sealyham Terrier, Winston the French Bulldog and Claire the Scottish Deerhound? Let’s get to the results: The winner of Best in Show at the 2024 National Dog Show is… Vito the Pug, marking the first time this breed has ever taken home this title. If you missed the 2024 National Dog Show’s initial broadcast after the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, you can stream it on Peacock, along with previous competitions dating back to 2013. Was your favorite furry friend victorious this year? Drop a comment with your thoughts on the 2024 National Dog Show results below.",
