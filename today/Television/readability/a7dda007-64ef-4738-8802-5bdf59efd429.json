  "text": "Don’t expect Vincent D’Onofrio’s name to appear in the second round of Avengers: Doomsday director chairs, or for Kingpin to square off against sometime-adversary Spider-Man on the big screen. To date, D’Onofrio has winningly portrayed Wilson Fisk aka crime boss Kingpin in three seasons of Netflix’s Marvel’s Daredevil… a handful of Disney+’s Hawkeye and Echo episodes… and now Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again (which has two episodes left in Season 1 and is already renewed for Season 2). But as things currently stand with the iconic Marvel villain and apparently complicated rights issues, D’Onofrio (nor anyone else) cannot play Kingpin in a feature film. Appearing on the Happy Sad Confused podcast (below, at the 22:30 mark), VOD was asked by host Josh Horowitz about the prospect of, like, serving as a villain to Tom Holland’s Peter Parker, who will return for Spider-Man: Brand New Day (on track for a July 31, 2026 release). “The only thing I know is not positive…,” D’Onofrio responded. “It’s a very hard thing to do, for Marvel to use my character,” he explained. “It’s a very hard thing to do, because of ownership and stuff.” Specifically, “Right now, I’m only usable for television series,” the actor added. Meaning, “Not even a one-off Fisk movie” would be possible, “or anything like that. It’s all caught up in rights and stuff.” And there is no indication that said rights issues will ever be untangled. “I don’t know when that would work out, or if it ever would work out at all,” he said. In the meantime, D’Onofrio said, he is focused on Daredevil: Born Again Season 2, which he learned about in real-time, along with scene partner Charlie Cox, when Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige announced it on stage with them at D23! “For me, my job is to service the story That’s my job as an actor,” D’Onofrio told Horowitz. “Give me a series, give me a film, I’ll do my best. Whatever it is.” Want scoop on Daredevil: Born Again, or for any other Marvel TV show? Shoot an email to InsideLine@tvline.com, and your question may be answered via Matt’s Inside Line!",
