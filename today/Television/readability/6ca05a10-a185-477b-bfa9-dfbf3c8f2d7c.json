  "text": "Can you see Sarah Drew playing detective in the vein of Veronica Mars or spy in the shoes of Sydney Bristow from Alias? When asked about her upcoming holiday-related mystery series on Hallmark+, those references crossed Drew’s lips, and she couldn’t be more excited. You’re probably thinking about watching Halloween or It’s the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown this Halloween, but you should put Mistletoe Murders high on your list. (Interview Screenshot) Yes, we know. What’s up Christmas making an appearance before Halloween every year? The simple answer is that it makes us and millions of others like us very happy. Beginning on Thursday, October 31, you can watch two episodes of Mistletoe Murders weekly, only on Hallmark+. What’s it about? Well, it’s hard to explain in a Hallmark context because we’ve never seen anything like it! (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Peter Stranks) Emily Lane owns a Christmas-themed shop in a small town. She has cats. She’s almost a cliche. But by the end of the first episode (the farthest that we’ve seen), you’ll understand that Emily Lane is not as she appears. Is her holiday love a ruse for something deeper and darker? Now, I’m not going that far as to suggest Emily doesn’t love Christmas, but I suspect she may be covering a side of her that will only emerge as the story unfolds. Emily Lane may be … a spy! The clues are all there. (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Peter Stranks) But don’t expect the secrets of Emily’s universe to be dropped at your feet. Emily Lane is the ultimate mystery of Mistletoe Murders. The first episode ends with a significant WOW factor that I’ve been thinking about for two weeks. In our exclusive interview with Sarah, she perfectly encapsulates the rush you’ll feel while watching as she recalls her own thoughts about the script and teases what drew her to the role. She talks about the format of the series, which is expected to be an annual festivity (yay!), and how every two episodes finish one mystery while adding to the overarching story of Emily Lane, which may prove to be the biggest puzzler of all. Watch our interview with Sarah to see if you’re ready to investigate Mistletoe Murders. Of course, it’s from Hallmark, so there will be a handsome detective, some catty townspeople whispering behind Emily’s back, and others who want to bring her into her circle. But this first-time endeavor to marry Christmas and Hallmark mysteries is an experiment that can only survive if you watch. Have you jumped into the Hallmark+ waters yet? Will Mistletoe Murders push you over the edge? If you’re still iffy on the premise, this preview may help. Is Hallmark delving into the spy genre? What Hallmarkisms do you want to be included, and what tropes do you hope are left behind? This is pretty exciting, and it’s just the tip of the iceberg of what’s to come for Hallmark+. Share your thoughts about Mistletoe Murders and everything else about the burgeoning streaming network below! The first two episodes of Mistletoe Murders drop on Hallmark+ on Thursday, October 31.",
