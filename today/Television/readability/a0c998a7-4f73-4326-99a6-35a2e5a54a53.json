  "text": "ABC News has let Terry Moran go after the correspondent’s recent social media post criticizing a member of President Donald Trump’s administration. “We are at the end of our agreement with Terry Moran and based on his recent post — which was a clear violation of ABC News policies — we have made the decision to not renew,” an ABC News spokesperson said in a statement to TVLine. “At ABC News, we hold all of our reporters to the highest standards of objectivity, fairness and professionalism, and we remain committed to delivering straightforward, trusted journalism.” TVLine has reached out to Moran for comment. The network suspended Moran Sunday after he wrote an X post Saturday that called Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller a “world-class hater.” “The thing about Stephen Miller is not that he is the brains behind Trumpism,” he wrote in the post, which has since been deleted. “Yes, he is one of the people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and translates them into policy. But that’s not what’s interesting about Miller. It’s not brains. It’s bile. Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He’s a world-class hater. You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate. Trump is a world-class hater. But his hatred only a means to an end, and that end his his own glorification. That’s his spiritual nourishment.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Vice President JD Vance both posted about Moran Sunday, calling for ABC News to “hold Terry accountable.” Moran joined ABC in 1997 and was the network’s senior national correspondent and an anchor for the ABC News Live streaming service. He also led ABC’s coverage of the Supreme Court. He recently interviewed Trump in the White House.",
