  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4.5 / 5.04.5 It’s still not Young Sheldon, and it can’t be, but Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage Season 1 Episode 2 was a lot closer to what I’ve been missing. Maybe it was the Missy subplot or Georgie talking to George’s grave, but the second installment of this new spinoff felt a lot more familiar and comfortable. I still think live laughter diminishes rather than enhances the show, especially when the audience laughs at more serious material, but we can’t have everything. (CBS/Robert Voes) Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s Second Episode Was More Serious I love it when a comedy can make me laugh and cry in the same episode. All the great classic comedies, like All in The Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, did that. So did Young Sheldon. Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage Season 1 Episode 2 found the perfect balance between emotionality and comedy. I wasn’t for the idea of George Sr. dying so close to the end of Young Sheldon because I was afraid it would make the ending too depressing, but without it, we couldn’t have had the subplots we had in this story. Georgie talking to his father’s grave made for strong opening and closing narration, so much so that, at first, I wished every episode would frame itself that way. It would turn into a tired TV trope quickly if they really did that, but it did work well for this episode. (CBS/Robert Voes) Missy’s Subplot Was Georgie \u0026 Mandy Season 1 Episode 2’s Emotional Heart Missy was always my favorite on Young Sheldon. She was bright and sassy but always lost in the shuffle because of all the attention everyone paid Sheldon. I know what it’s like to feel like you’re growing up in a sibling’s shadow, forever compared to them. Even though our situations were completely different, I always identified strongly with Missy’s feelings and was disappointed there wasn’t a lot of her in the final season. (CBS/Robert Voets) It’s not surprising that after her father’s death, she became a rebellious troublemaker. Missy was headed in that direction before that, but as she said, she had no one to stop her from going off the rails now. Missy: Now that you’re gone and Sheldon’s gone, I’m alone a lot. It’s a lot easier to get away with stuff now, but it sucks. For me, a beat meant to be one of Georgie \u0026 Mandy Season 1 Episode 2’s funniest moments was its most painful. Telling someone you’re there for them and then being called away the second they start pouring their heart out is an old joke, and I never find it funny. It’s not cool when someone feels invisible and alone and acts out because they have no other way to communicate the pain they’re in, and someone who is supposed to be there for them pulls the rug out from under them. (NBC/Robert Voets) Missy broke my heart when she finally cried at her father’s grave. I can guarantee, though, that this is only the beginning of her rebellious behavior, and not just because we know from The Big Bang Theory that Missy didn’t find much success and happiness as an adult. And that sucks. Georgie is right that she has a good head on her shoulders that she needs to use. I can understand her not wanting to listen to him, though. Not only is he her brother and not her father, but he dropped out of high school after learning Mandy was pregnant with his child, so he’s not the best person to advise her to stay in school and do what she’s supposed to do. (CBS/Robert Voets) Georgie and Mandy Already Have Cracks In Their Foundation The seeds have already been planted for Georgie and Mandy’s breakup. Though Audrey is wrong that Georgie being little more than a teenager is the entire problem here, the young couple is already showing signs of not being able to weather life’s storms together. Georgie’s panic attack was well done. It was understandable that he’d be afraid of having one early in life after losing his father the way he did, although I recognized what it was before he did. The studio audience didn’t agree, but I thought his exchange with the doctor was as hilarious as it was poignant. Only Georgie would try to convince the doctor that it “don’t sound right” when the doctor tells him his heart is fine. I also liked that Jim acknowledged the difficulty many men have with emotions. His self-deprecating joke about eating right and exercising to deal with stress while holding a piece of bacon in his hand was perfect. This is a serious problem in reality, but sometimes the best way to address a social issue is with humor, and Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage Season 1 Episode 2 did that perfectly. (CBS/Robert Voets) Connor Shouldn’t Be The Butt Of The Joke Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage Season 1 Episode 2 did a great job of dealing with mental health issues… except one. It’s clear that Connor is autistic, or at least autistic-coded and probably meant to be the replacement character for Sheldon in this spinoff. But too many of his scenes were about Mandy and her mother arguing about whether Connor was “normal,” and it felt like the underlying message was that the quirks that came with his neurodivergence deserved to be mocked. Big Bang Theory did that with Sheldon to an extent, though it didn’t feel as mean-spirited. (CBS/Robert Voets) Even though the adult version of Sheldon was often annoying, his sole purpose wasn’t to be the butt of jokes. His friends loved him despite his self-centeredness and annoying habits, and he was the lead character. So far, Connor’s only purpose in Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage is to come in, say something weird, get laughed at, and leave. I hope this changes soon. If Connor isn’t going to be a major enough character to have a storyline beyond being strange, then he needs to be written out of the show. (CBS/Robert Voets) Random Thoughts About Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage Season 1 Episode 2 A few additional thoughts: It would be awesome if Missy’s storyline was the set-up for Paige’s return. She’s been going down a similar path for years, and Missy got in trouble with her before, so this would be the perfect time to bring her back. Audrey is still too hard, and her constant jokes about Georgie being too young for Mandy need to stop Besides the awful Connor jokes, if I could wave a magic wand and delete one part of the show, it would be Reuben, who adds nothing. The situations in this episode were so relatable I almost forgot this is supposed to take place in the 1990s and not in the digital age. Over to you, Georgie \u0026 Mandy fanatics.
