  "text": "Jack Reacher is both an unstoppable force and an immovable object! And fortunately for Reacher fans, the hit Amazon series isn’t signing off anytime soon. Amazon has renewed the action-thriller for a fourth season well ahead of the Reacher Season 3 premiere! (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) Reacher Scores Early Renewal It’s not surprising as the series previously scored an early renewal ahead of its hit second season as well, when despite our indifference, Reacher Season 1 did so well. It speaks to Amazon’s faith in the adaptation and Lee Child’s best-selling series. There is a treasure trove of plots the television series can adapt from regarding the book series. At this rate, Amazon seems intent on trying to adapt them all! And it’s understandable, given that Reacher Season 2 was Prime Video‘s biggest success story in 2023. This is a still of Reacher Season 3 on Prime Video. (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) Reacher Season 2 Broke Records Leading to Early Renewal The sophomore season was the most viewed release of Prime Video in 2023. It spiked a whopping 50% in viewership from its first season and took the number two spot on Nielsens streaming charts. To say the head of Amazon is pleased with the series’ success is an understatement. Reacher has become a phenomenon that continues to resonate with our global customers beyond our wildest expectations and we are thrilled to bring the series back for an additional season. We are looking forward to more action and adventure from the immensely talented team behind the series including Nick Santora, Alan Ritchson, Lee Child, Skydance, and CBS Studios. Vernon Sanders, Amazon MGM Studios With that in mind, it tracks why Amazon would also greenlight a spinoff. Reacher Expands Franchise with Neagley Spinoff (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) Spinoffs are all the rage, and many of them can be hit or miss, but this one sounds particularly exciting. Fan-favorite character Francis Neagley will be at the center of the now-unnamed Neagley Spinoff that will see Maria Sten reprising their role as Reacher’s most trusted companion. Alan Ritchson will reprise his role in the spinoff, most likely passing to torch as Stern takes center stage. But until then, we can expect this dynamic duo to kick some serious ass in Reacher Season 3, which is slated to debut sometime in 2025. Reacher Season 3 Will Be Kicking Butt in 2025 (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) The third season will adapt Lee Child’s seventh book in the Reacher series, Persuader.  It’ll find Reacher going undercover in a dangerous effort to rescue an informant. Reacher will be going up against a nefarious foe from his past who has haunted him. Joining Alan Ritchson and Maria Sten in the third season are Anthony Michael Hall, Sonya Cassidy, Brian Tee, Johnny Berchtold, Robert Montesinos, Daniel David Stewart and Olivier Richters. (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) We’ll let you know when Reacher Season 3 has an official premiere date. Until then, what do you think about this early renewal? Will you tune into a spinoff?
