  "text": "Michael Strahan may have taken a step towards helping Good Morning America in the ratings war between competing morning shows. The former New York Giants star is rumored to have gone rogue and obtained what could be a significant interview for GMA. Football coaching legend Bill Belichick could be giving his time to ABC‘s show, following all of the headlines and rumors involving the situation with his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. (ABC/Screenshot) Based on insider remarks, Strahan may have sniped the huge interview away from one of the stars of NBC‘s Today. It follows CBS’s headline-making interview featuring Belichick and Hudson, with Strahan looking to grab a major win for his morning show. Michael Strahan Seized Belichick Interview Before Competitors According to a TV insider, Strahan didn’t go through producers but took it upon himself to obtain the Belichick interview. “Michael didn’t wait for anyone. He made the call himself. He didn’t rely on producers. He knew this was a huge opportunity — and he went for it like he was still wearing shoulder pads,” the insider said, per journalist Rob Shuter via substack. The insider also suggested that Strahan “plays to win,” and the Belichick interview is undoubtedly a win for Good Morning America, as it appears they snatched this away from NBC’s Today during the competitive ratings war. In particular, Savannah Guthrie was reportedly pushing to make a deal happen for NBC’s Today to have the Belichick interview, but Strahan “beat them all to the punch.” (NBC/Screenshot) GMA Star Relied Upon His NFL Connections Following his football career, Michael Strahan moved into a television career, including a gig with Fox NFL Sunday as an analyst alongside former players Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Rob Gronkowski, and sometimes, announcer Tom Brady. Due to that, and his days of playing stellar defense for the Giants, the Pro Football Hall of Famer knows plenty of people within the football world, and that helped significantly to get Belichick for GMA. “Michael got on the phone with Belichick’s new PR fixer and made it happen. He used the NFL connection. No one else on morning TV can compete with that kind of access,” a rival producer said, per Shuter. According to the source, Strahan does more than just read from the teleprompter on GMA: “He wins.” (ABC/Screenshot) Potential Win for GMA and Belichick After CBS Fiasco CBS News’s Tony Doukopil previously interviewed Belichick, 73, with the University of North Carolina football coach’s 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, sitting nearby. “We’re not talking about this,” Hudson said when Doukopil tried to ask Belichick how they met. That created a firestorm, as many viewed it as Belichick’s significantly younger girlfriend dictating what the seven-time Super Bowl winner would or wouldn’t discuss during the CBS Sunday Mornings interview. With that in mind, Belichick is potentially attempting to recover from the situation as he embraces his new coaching job at UNC and the release of his new book, The Art of Winning. (CBS/Screenshot) And Michael Strahan may have seriously given ABC’s Good Morning America a big victory, as they battle the likes of CBS Mornings’ Gayle King after her controversial space trip, and NBC’s Today, which have been doing their best to grab viewers. Let us know below what you think about Strahan’s one-on-one with Belichick and whether you think this will assist GMA in its battle to be the top morning show!
