  "text": "It’s a new year, and we’re celebrating it with an all-new installment of Chicago PD, which will center Intelligence’s newest member.  If you’ve been following our coverage thus far, you already know how much we love Kiana Cook.  She’s breathed new life into the series as Chicago PD has felt like a welcomed soft reboot for the show.  (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) Chicago PD Picks Up with Intelligence in a Precarious Position  And now, the unit has plenty to contend with after the wild and, at times, heartrending events of Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 8, which left the unit in quite a precarious position with the elusive Reid.  Their situation isn’t improving with Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 9.  “Friends and Family” will center on Cook when the unit gets pulled into a kidnapping case.  From the synopsis, it appears that the unit will face some “roadblocks” during this pressing investigation, and as a result, they’ll have to utilize alternate means to get what they need.  And that’s where Intelligence’s mysterious newbie comes into play.  Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 9 Places Kiana in the Spotlight (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) We haven’t learned that much about Cook outside of the job. We know that she got demoted to patrol after she got into it with her tactical partner and essentially got iced out.  Kiana is passionate about her job and wants to genuinely help people and do right by others.  We’ve seen how great and dedicated she is to the job based on how easily and quickly she jumped into action during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 2.  She also partnered well with Torres during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 5. Cook’s undercover work during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 7 was notable.  Cook has proven to be a force, but we know little about her life outside of the job, and the midseason premiere promises to rectify that.  We cannot be more excited about this!  Cook’s Family is Instrumental in Assisting with a Kidnapping Case (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) With Cook seeking her family’s assistance, could they be law enforcement, too? It’s also possible they’re on the other side of the law or in a gray area.  Intelligence understands the community and fosters ties, resulting in success. Whatever the case, this episode would put us squarely within Cook’s personal by introducing us to her family.   It’s a promising development for her character. Many characters didn’t get this peek into their outside world until later.  Stepping into Cook’s world outside beyond the unit means we get more layers to this fan-favorite compelling character. It’ll also help us understand her and how she interacts with others.  Will Cook and Torres’ Parnership Face Obstacles After Gloria? (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) After that finale, the Gloria debacle strained Torres and Cook’s relationship. His desire to cover his tracks with Gloria and prevent himself and Burgess from getting into trouble because of his affair nearly cost Kiana her life.  They shared mutual understanding and instant respect, and Torres’ deception may challenge that moving forward.  A peek into Kiana’s personal life may help the partners rebuild trust.  For both characters, understanding the other person solidifies a bond.  But it’ll also be great if the hour switches things up with Kiana interacting with other characters.  Voight has been impressed with her, but we haven’t seen the two spend that much time one-on-one. Kiana’s family may be critical in helping them out, which could mean we’ll get some Kiana and Voight screentime.  Chief Reid Poses a Threat to Intelligence (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) What’s interesting is learning that Intelligence will face roadblocks, and that wreaks of Chief Reid inserting himself into the mix.  The biggest cliffhanger was that Reid knew what happened with Torres and that the team covered for him, and he’s using that information as leverage to be Voight’s “friend.” But we don’t know what that “friendship” will entail.  Reid’s motivations are unclear, but worse yet, we still don’t know how he came across all of this information, and that’s more concerning than anything else.  Is the office bugged? Is there a mole somewhere?  Reid already came across as sketchy regarding Burgess and her promotion, and now he’s using Torres’ actions to keep Voight and the Intelligence unit under his thumb.  Reid’s Motivations and Methods Remain a Mystery (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) But we don’t know what he wants or plans for them. Voight doesn’t like to have anyone controlling him, so is it safe to say that Reid is exercising his power to make Voight submit? Reid may not be behind the roadblocks during this investigation, but it’s hard to shake the theory, given how much of a mysterious wild card he is.  Reid appears in a couple of images, including with the entire team, so if he isn’t an obstacle for them, he’s active in the case in some other way.  Fortunately, it’s an all-hands-on-deck situation, as we see the entire team in spoiler images. So we can be thrilled that the midseason premiere doesn’t bench anyone.  Unofficially, It’s Kim Burgess’s Season! (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) We also see a lot of Burgess donning red again (it’s becoming her signature color), and she’s definitely giving off the vibes of being Voight’s “second.”  Detective Burgess is still thriving in the new position, and that’s exciting to see all on its own!  With a kidnapping, possible tension, a shady Reid, and a deep dive into Kiana, the midseason premiere sounds like an action-packed, plot-heavy, and thoroughly entertaining affair!  Over to you, Chicago PD Fanatics! What are your theories and speculation about the midseason premiere? What are you looking forward to exploring?  We’ll have a full review of the episode.  Check back with us ahead of the premiere for more One Chicago goodies! Chicago PD returns Wednesday, January 8 at 10/9c on NBC.  Watch Chicago PD Online",
