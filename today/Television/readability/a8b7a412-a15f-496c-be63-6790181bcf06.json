  "text": "With the release of its third season, Netflix’s Ginny \u0026 Georgia easily topped Nielsen’s latest U.S. ranking of streaming originals. For the week of June 2, G\u0026G amassed just shy of 2.9 billion minutes viewed across 30 episodes, marking the series’ biggest Nielsen week ever and the fourth-best week for any original series in 2025 — trailing only Squid Game (4.6B for week ending Jan. 5) and The Night Agent (3.11B for week of Jan. 20, 2.92B for week of Jan. 27). Nielsen notes that 45% of Ginny \u0026 Georgia‘s audience was under the age of 35, and the series over-indexed among Black audiences (19%). Netflix’s Dept. Q placed second with 1.1 billion minutes viewed/nine episodes, followed by Prime Video’s The Better Sister (776 million minutes/eight episodes), Peacock’s Love Island USA (772 million minutes/216 episodes) and Netflix’s Sirens (719 million minutes/five episodes). Rounding out the Top 10 originals for the week of June 2 were Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale, Netflix’s Stranger Things, Paramount+’s MobLand, Netflix’s (recently renewed) Tires and Netflix’s YOU. Over on Nielsen’s overall ranking (which includes acquired series, movies and what not), TNT’s Animal Kingdom with its arrival on Netflix claimed the No. 3 spot (behind Ginny \u0026 Georgia and The Accountant 2 on Prime Video), with north of 1.1 billion minutes viewed for its 75-episode library.
