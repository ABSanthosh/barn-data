  "text": "We now know the names of Michael Scott’s children on The Office… and they sound perfectly Michael Scott to us. The Office stars Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey revealed on their Office Ladies podcast this week that there was a scene cut from the series finale script that told us the names of Michael’s children with HR rep-turned-love interest Holly. In the scene, which was never filmed, Amy Ryan’s Holly said in a talking-head interview that she and Michael had “two sons: Chebonshur and Lowshebin. Michael named them. He said it was based on the feeling he had when he first saw them.” (And yes, those are the correct spellings.) Holly was supposed to shoot that scene holding her two sons, Fischer says, but Ryan’s schedule didn’t allow her to appear in the finale, so the scene was scrapped. But Carell did appear, returning to the show for the first time since his Season 7 exit, with Michael making a surprise appearance at Dwight and Angela’s wedding. (“Michael, I can’t believe you came,” Dwight said through tears, to which Michael replied, of course: “That’s what she said.”) Later in the Office series finale, which aired in May 2013, Michael gushed to Pam about his family with Holly, after years of being unlucky in love. Pam told us that Michael has so many photos of his kids that he had to have two phones, with two bills: “He’s just so happy to have a family plan.” How are we feeling about Michael’s child-naming skills, Dunder Mifflin employees? Report to the conference room and drop your thoughts in a comment below.",
