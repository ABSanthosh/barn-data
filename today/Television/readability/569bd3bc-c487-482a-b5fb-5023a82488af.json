The actress has joined Season 5 of the Hulu comedy in an undisclosed role, the streamer announced on Threads. Zellweger is a two-time Academy Award winner for her roles in Cold Mountain and Judy. Her TV credits include The Thing About Pam and What/If. As previously reported, Keegan-Michael Key (Key \u0026 Peele, Schmigadoon!) and Oscar winner Christoph Waltz (Inglorious Basterds) will also appear on the show, with details about their characters being kept under wraps. Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez and Michael Cyril Creighton make up the returning cast for the new season, which will revolve around the murder of Arconia doorman Lester. In other recent casting news… * Leva Bonaparte announced on Instagram that she is exiting Bravo’s Southern Charm after four seasons. “I am in a place now in my life where I want to have time to focus on Boys and my Joys. And need some time for a life reset on what is aligned for me!” she wrote. * The Handmaid’s Tale sequel series The Testaments has added Mattea Conforti (NOS4A2, Power) to its cast as Becka, “a girl of humble origins who attends school with Gilead’s elite” and ” starts to question whether she wants the life she’s being groomed for,” Deadline reports. * Doctor Who has tapped Charlie Condou (Holby City, Coronation Street) to guest-star in a “big and bold” episode of the upcoming season (premiering Saturday, April 12 on Disney+).
