A close second, at least in our eyes? Yet another development in the Tiffany-Nuck-Victor love triangle, as she pushed Victor away for keeping a major secret from her. “Why you ain’t tell me Reg was still alive?” Tiff asked as Victor settled in next to her in the hospital’s waiting room. His sheepish explanation — that he hadn’t told anyone about his estranged brother’s continued existence — didn’t do much for her. “I thought we had something,” she said. And even though he confirmed that there were real feelings between them, she pulled away, saying they were “moving too fast.” By the end of the episode, she was texting with Nuck — her other would-be suitor — and lightly flirting as she thanked him for putting together a crib for the baby that’s due any day now. Cortez Smith as Nuck Courtesy of Paramount+ With Showtime Obviously, Tiff is grieving Rob, the father of her child who was murdered at the end of last season. And she has no idea that Nuck pulled the trigger that ended his life. For the latest on the contest for the expectant mother’s heart, we went to the experts: The Chi co-showrunners Justin Hillian and Jewel Coronel. TVLINE | I’m in love with Tiff and Victor as as couple, even though I think I might get my heart broken on that one. Would you call it a triangle, what’s happening between them and Nuck?JUSTIN HILLIAN | It’s… complicated. [Laughs] Luke James as Victor and Hannaha Hall as Tiff Courtesy of Paramount+ With Showtime TVLINE | It’s a square, because Alicia’s on the end, being like, “Do not do this.”JEWEL CORONEL | [Laughs] “Do not pass Go.” I think that’s one of those things, too. It’s like The Chi balance, the dichotomy of characters where you have someone like Victor, who has been Trig. You have someone like Nuck, who’s only known had to be a certain way. So it’s like: What does Tiff want for her future, having lost someone so important to her? It’s more in the idea of [the show] being female-centric this season, like, you know what? Where do you want to be in the next year, Tiff? Because these are two very different men.HILLIAN | We wanted to give her that agency. We wanted to present two very different options for her, and have them both pursue her, and have her decide — to Jewel’s point — which which way she wanted to go. Who do you think Tiff should choose? Let us know in the comments below.",
