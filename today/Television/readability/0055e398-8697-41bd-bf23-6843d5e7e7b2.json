  "text": "Gray skies will not be clearing up on Paramount+ anytime soon: Happy Face has been canceled after one season, TVLine has confirmed. The series was based on the real-life story of Melissa G. Moore, who found out at 15 years old that her father was actually an infamous serial killer who went by the name of Happy Face. Moore hosts a podcast of the same name on the topic, and she previously told her story in the 2009 memoir Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer’s Daughter. Happy Face starred Annaleigh Ashford (B Positive) as Melissa and Dennis Quaid (Lawmen: Bass Reeves) as her incarcerated father. “After decades of no contact, he finally finds a way to force himself back into his daughter’s life,” reads the streamer’s official description. “In a race against the clock, Melissa must find out if an innocent man is going to be put to death for a crime her father committed. Throughout, she discovers the impact her father had on his victims’ families and must face a reckoning of her own identity.” Deadline was the first to report Happy Face‘s cancellation. Are you disappointed that it isn’t returning for a second season, or do you feel that the story wrapped well enough in Season 1 that it doesn’t need more episodes?
