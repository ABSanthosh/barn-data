  "text": "Bella Ramsey is on the run again: The star of HBO’s The Last of Us has joined the cast of Maya, a new drama series for the UK’s Channel 4, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Ramsey will star alongside Daisy Haggard (Breeders, Episodes), who also created the series and will make her directorial debut. Haggard will play Anna, with Ramsey as her teenage daughter Maya, with the two of them forced to enter witness protection and relocate to a rural Scottish town. “As they try to adjust to their new reality, the trauma of their past continues to haunt them in the form of two hitmen intent on tracking them down,” according to the official synopsis. “As the walls close in, it becomes clear that a dangerous figure from their past is still a looming threat.” The series is set to be filmed on location in Scotland later this year; there’s no word yet on when or where it might air here in the U.S. “This story and these characters Daisy has created are so alive, nuanced, wickedly funny and scarily dark,” Ramsey said in a statement. “Every character jumps off the page, the dialogue is incredibly witty and I’m so excited to get to play Maya opposite Daisy’s Anna.” Ramsey currently stars as apocalypse survivor Ellie on the HBO zombie drama The Last of Us; it was renewed for Season 3 in April, days ahead of the Season 2 premiere. (Ramsey is set to play a larger role in Season 3 as well, following the demise of Pedro Pascal’s Joel.) Ramsey previously broke out as pint-sized warrior Lyanna Mormont on HBO’s Game of Thrones; their other TV credits include His Dark Materials and Becoming Elizabeth.",
