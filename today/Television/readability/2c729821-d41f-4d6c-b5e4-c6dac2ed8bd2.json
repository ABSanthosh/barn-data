  "text": "It’s the most anticipated episode of the season since the When Calls the Heart Season 12 trailer was released. Melissa Gilbert is guest-starring on When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 6, which airs at a special time. The series didn’t want to compete with the Superbowl, so it’s airing on Saturday, February 8, at 10/9c. You won’t want to miss it. In addition to Gilbert’s debut as forensics investigator Georgie McGill, the episode’s spoilers tease that Allie and Oliver discover a threat to the ecosystem, which likely helps Allie mend her broken heart. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) When Rosemary learns that Allie and the other children aren’t happy about the park’s plans, she invites them to debate Lucas on her radio show. This could be interesting since Lucas has always been fond of the children and will likely value their opinions. It’s one of the better political slants and could work if done well. Finally, the spoilers indicate that Elizabeth suffers from a cold. That doesn’t seem spoiler-worthy, except she rarely gets sick, so maybe we’ll see some scenes of Nathan caring for her. Melissa Gilbert Guest Stars as Georgie McGill, a Forsenic Investigator As a long-time Little House on the Prairie fan, I’m excited to see Melissa Gilbert guest star. From the sneak peek, it appears that Nathan called her in as a forensics investigator to assist them on the train robbery case. Nathan is generally observant, but he totally missed Bill and Georgie knowing each other and not needing his assistance. Georgie McGill had been trying to get Toddy Davis for years. She wasn’t going to trust someone she didn’t know. Becoming a forensics investigator was challenging enough back then, but it was even more complicated for females since law enforcement was often seen as a man’s career. Even from those few minutes, it was apparent that Georgie and Bill knew each other’s shorthand as they discussed how Nathan went undercover to lure Toddy Davis out. It was all in the eyes as they discussed paying Sunny Garrison a visit at the prison. Nathan may have brought Georgie McGill to town, but that was the end of his needed assistance. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 6 Spoilers Hint that Bill and Georgie Have History Bill hasn’t had much of a story in years, and Jack Wagner and Melissa Gilbert already have a sizzling chemistry in just a few scenes. We know they have a history, but we aren’t sure whether they were close friends or dated years ago when they trained together at forensics. While Gilbert is only slated for a few episodes, we’d love to keep her longer. She looks like she belongs at home in Hope Valley, and we’d love to see both Bill and Georgie leading a romantic story. We still know little about Bill’s past, and it’s time to fill in the blanks on why he never admitted his feelings for Georgie. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) Bill is rarely lucky in love, and we are excited to learn why. Will Solving a Mystery with Oliver Help Allie Heal a Broken Heart? It takes a long time to heal your first broken heart, but distraction and another cute boy often help. Oliver seems like a better match for Allie. He cares about saving wildlife and learning, whereas Wyatt doesn’t care much about school. While he’s only a few years older, Wyatt appears more worldly, and Allie is still an impressionable young girl finding her way in the world. She meshes better with Oliver since he seems lost and alone, too, except for Nathan and Elizabeth, who care for his well-being and education. Spoilers indicate that Oliver and Allie learn there is a threat to the ecosystem, which could endanger the wolves with which Allie has become so enamored. (©2025 Hallmark Media) It’s taken Allie a long time to find her passion, so hopefully, they will find a solution together. Rosemary’s New Idea Pits Lucas Opposite the Children Lucas decides to stay in Hope Valley to work on the National Park, which naturally affects Henry and the children’s plans for their hazelnut business. As Rosemary observes that many of the children aren’t happy with the governor, she decides they should confront him in her new radio show that she and Fiona developed. This delights me for many reasons. Fiona is still around and always has good ideas, including with radio. Maybe if it’s successful, they can convince her to stay longer and help people in other ways. More importantly, Lucas cares about helping people, and he loves those children. He would care about their concerns, so hopefully, the series writes him in character and he listens to them. (©2025 Hallmark Media) Finally, since this episode airs before Valentine’s Day, perhaps we’ll see some romance as Nathan cares for a sick Elizabeth. We’ll have to wait and see. Over to you, Hearties. What are you excited to see in “When Autumn Leaves Begin to Fall?’ Are you looking forward to Melissa Gilbert’s guest arc and learning how Georgie McGill knew Bill? Will Lucas’s radio discussion discussion with the children be successful? We love to hear your thoughts, so let us know in the comments. Remember, When Calls the Heart airs at a special time this week on Saturday at 10/9c. Watch When Calls the Heart Online",
