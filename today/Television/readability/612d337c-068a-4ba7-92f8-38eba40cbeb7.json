Bernthal will reprise his Marvel TV role as Frank Castle, aka The Punisher, in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Tom Holland returns as the titular web-slinger in his fourth Spider-Man movie, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings) and set to hit theaters on July 31, 2026. Bernthal debuted as The Punisher in Season 2 of the Netflix series Marvel’s Daredevil and then landed his own Netflix show, The Punisher, which ran for two seasons. He reprised the role earlier this year as well on Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again. Bernthal is also slated to play The Punisher in a standalone special for Disney+. His other TV roles include The Bear, American Gigolo and The Walking Dead. Along with Holland and Bernthal, the cast of Spider-Man: Brand New Day (which takes place after 2021’s Spider-Man: No Way Home) includes Zendaya (returning as MJ), Jacob Batalon (returning as Ned) and Stranger Things breakout Sadie Sink in an undisclosed role.
