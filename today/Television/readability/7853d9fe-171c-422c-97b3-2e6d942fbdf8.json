  "text": "Just when we were starting to lose hope in the executives over at ABC, they came through with news that Morgan Gillory and High Potential aren’t going anywhere.  That’s right, you didn’t read that wrong. The ABC smash hit will return for more brain-boggling cases that only Kaitlin Olson can crack.  Fans of High Potential are likely jumping for joy as the series has been killing it without a single mention of renewal. (Disney/Pamela Littky) Luckily, we can all stop pretending like we didn’t know this show was going to get the green light for more.  That isn’t big talk either because, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter, “ABC says the pilot episode’s audience has grown to more than 30 million in the four months since it debuted.”  (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) Again, as if we didn’t know High Potential would absolutely be returning for more whacky murders of tap-dancing mechanics and cases that hinge on Galapagos customs.  As far as we know, until the High Potential Season 1 finale, Kaitlin Olson will be joined by her regular castmates, Javicia Leslie, Deniz Akdeniz, Amirah J, Matthew Lamb, and Judy Reyes.  And, we can’t forget the tall drink of water that is Daniel Sunjata‘s Detective Adam Karadec, who will likely continue to sizzle every scene with his smoldering presence — wait what were we talking about?  The twelve million viewers that have tuned into High Potential Season 1 Episode 8 speak volumes of how much the series was missed during its winter break.  While ABC did take their sweet time delivering this news, we at least have to give it up to them as High Potential is the second show to be renewed by the network this broadcast season.  (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) What that means for the rest of High Potential Season 1 is yet to be seen. There may need to be reshoots to accommodate a new storyline or even an episode added in order to steer the plot in the right direction.  For now, we can only buckle up and enjoy the insane yet oddly educational ride Morgan and the team continue to take fans on.  Is anyone else contemplating a notebook to keep track of all of the crazy facts rolling around in Morgan’s mind? Just me?  As always, TV Fanatic will keep you up to date on any and all updates of your favorite new and returning shows. You never have to worry about missing a thing because we’re watching it all!  (Mitch Hasseth/Disney) How excited are you for High Potential’s renewal?  Who is your favorite character on the show so far?  Drop a comment below to let me know what you think, and join me again when I bring you more news about High Potential!
