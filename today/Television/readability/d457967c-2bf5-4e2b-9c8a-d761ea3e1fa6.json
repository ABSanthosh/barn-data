What is entertainment if it ticks all of the critical boxes but offers very little pleasure? (TV Fanatic) Our current team, including Carissa Pavlica, Jack Ori, Jasmine Blu, Joshua Pleming, Laura Nowak, Lisa Babick, Paul Dailly, and Whitney Evans, have shared their very crucial two cents to compile the list below only for true TV fanatics! Brilliant Minds (NBC) (Rafy/NBC) Brilliant Minds is refreshingly different from other medical dramas because it focuses on brain, neurological, and mental health cases. Almost every case affected one of the doctors and their personal lives. The series also hooked us with the sizzling attraction and banter between Drs. Oliver Wolf and Josh Nichols immediately, as well as the friendships and love triangle among the interns. Medical dramas are a dime a dozen nowadays, but this one was a breath of fresh air. The emphasis on accurate neurodivergent representation, Wolf’s trauma history, and the slow-burn relationship between Wolf and Nichols made this one a must-watch that NBC needs to renew ASAP. This series has everything. Watch Brilliant Minds Online The Diplomat (Netflix) (Alex Bailey/Netflix) The second season of The Diplomat took the political intrigue and personal drama of the first season and elevated it to a whole new level. Picking up right where the jaw-dropping cliffhanger left off, the series plunged viewers deeper into the high-stakes world of international diplomacy while peeling back even more layers of the complex relationships that kept audiences hooked. A standout addition this season was Allison Janney’s captivating portrayal of the Vice President. Janney brought a commanding presence to the role, effortlessly blending sharp wit with an undercurrent of vulnerability. Her scenes with Keri Russell were a masterclass in on-screen chemistry, as the two powerhouses played beautifully off each other. Whether trading barbs or navigating the minefield of trust and power, their dynamic added an electric layer to the show, amplifying its intensity and emotional resonance, leaving us begging for more. This season masterfully balanced razor-sharp political maneuvering with deeply personal stakes, as Kate Wyler navigated the treacherous waters of global crises and her own turbulent marriage. (Alex Bailey/Netflix) The tension was palpable as alliances were tested, secrets came to light, and the cost of loyalty — both personal and professional — was brought into sharp focus. It was a thrilling ride, filled with moments that had viewers holding their breath one minute and shouting at the screen the next, especially when we were left without a clue as to what was driving Hal to reach Kate in the frantic closing scenes. What made season two truly stunning was how it deepened its characters while expanding its scope but with even less on-screen time. The stakes felt higher, the twists cut deeper, and the storytelling remained as intelligent and captivating as ever. The Diplomat proved once again that it wasn’t just about politics — it was about the people pulling the strings and the emotional cost of living in a world where every decision could change the course of history. With powerhouse performances like Janney’s and Russell’s leading the charge, the season didn’t just build on the success of the first; it redefined it, delivering a gripping, edge-of-your-seat experience that fans won’t soon forget. Watch The Diplomat Online Found (NBC) (Matt Miller/NBC) It didn’t seem possible for a series with such a dark and twisty approach to a traditional procedural could push things further in the second season, but thus far, they took the shocking season finale and ran with it.  Found Season 2 is frustrating at times, no doubt, but at its core, it’s a wonderfully complex exploration of trauma and is deeply character-driven in a way so few procedurals pull off. The fallout from Gabi’s secret and the near-constant threat of Sir is gripping, while the motivation to find those who slip through the cracks drives everyone. The sophomore season peels back the layers of the core characters, good, bad, and ugly, in a refreshingly honest way. It also provides more context to Gabi and Lacey’s sisterhood and just how truly evil and sadistic Sir is. All this results in a heartrending, compelling, and unpredictable season.  Watch Found Online High Potential (ABC) (Carlos Lopez-Calleja/Disney) Here is a great example of a sleeper hit when it comes to broadcast television. High Potential brought viewers into the mind of the main character, Morgan, and it has been a perfect blend of police procedural, situational comedy, and heartwarming/wrenching drama. Kaitlin Olson is very well known for her comedic talents having spent almost two decades on the FX series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, as well as her short-lived show, The Mick. So, like this TV Fanatic, many viewers were surprised to see the actor stretch her acting talents in a police procedural with plenty of drama to spare. However, Olson’s charm and comedic timing have helped shape the show into a must-see TV. Episode by episode, High Potential has proven that it will only get better as the series continues. (Raymond Liu/Disney) Between the acting, writing, and all-around production value, High Potential keeps its episodic stories tight and neatly contained so that viewers can jump on board at just about any episode. The series hasn’t even concluded its freshman season, and audiences can’t get enough. Then again, who could blame them with a tall drink of water like Daniel Sunjata’s Detective Karadec at Morgan’s side? If that wasn’t enough, every episode of High Potential is rife with interesting facts from Morgan’s mind that help elevate every case into its own unique mystery without feeling repetitive. At this rate, it wouldn’t be crazy to think that this show could have the potential to stick around for many more seasons.  Watch High Potential Online Industry (HBO) (Simon Ridgway/HBO) Industry remains one of the best series not enough people are talking about. A series that deserves every bit as much accolades as the late, great Succession, Industry is a masterclass in incredibly strong plot points and writing, fantastic (and witty) dialogue, and the best performances by a truly talented cast on television. Industry Season 3 was easily the series’ best to date, with high stakes that essentially went balls to the walls with plot points that blew up the series’ premise, leaving us genuinely wondering how it’ll outdo itself. The industry’s collection of complex, ambitious, and downright diabolical characters (save Rob) resulted in the most ruthless season to date. The season also delivered what is inarguably the best episode of the year, Industry Season 3 Episode 4, “White Mischief,” placing Sagar Radia’s scene-stealing Rishi at the forefront for an adrenaline-inducing Uncut Gems-inspired masterpiece. The finale definitely leaves us clamoring for more. Watch Industry Online Interview with the Vampire (AMC) (Larry Horricks/AMC) After a stellar first season, Interview with the Vampire Season 2 was somehow even better. With standout performances from leads Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid, and Delainey Hayles, the series dove into the years after fledglings Louis and Claudia seemingly murdered their maker, Lestat, and landed in Paris.  Paris is where they met Armand, who would play an important role in the lives of all three vampires, and eventually, journalist Daniel Malloy, who was still in Dubai greedily devouring the words of both Louis and Armand as they recalled their time in the Parisian city.  There’s no real low point in the season, with each hour building upon the one before and allowing the narrative space to breathe. With only eight episodes, it could feel rushed, but there are no wasted moments. Every scene has meaning and purpose, leading up to the final two hours, some of the best on television.  You can’t have a best list and leave this show off it. If it continues at this pace, it will be in the running for the best horror television show in history. Watch Interview with the Vampire Online Love Island USA (Peacock) (Ben Symons/Peacock) Reality TV shows never get the respect they deserve, and that’s okay because those that get it get it. But it would be a travesty to leave Love Island USA Season 6 off a year-end list because it was that GOOD.  Love Island USA has never reached the heights of its UK predecessor, and when it made the move from CBS to Peacock, many people wrote it off. But in the age of social media, all the series needed was one good season to make an impact, and that’s what this one did.  The key to a successful Love Island season will always lie within the original cast members, and this one found stars in the trio of Serena Page, Leah Kateb, and JaNa Craig and men like Kordell Beckham and Rob Rausch. (Ben Symons/Peacock) The girls, known as PPG, were together from day one until the end, and their romantic exploits on the island had social media abuzz all summer.  From fights to tears to breakups, to bold love declarations, and everything in between, the season was a hit from the beginning, and it only got stronger as the days passed and the drama ramped up.  Many Love Island seasons fall off as the season goes, but this one continued to shine due to the cast of lovable characters (alongside the not-so-lovable) and the pure chaos that each episode brought.  And, hey! Love was truly in the air this summer, as the top three couples are still together as we head into 2025. A Love Island miracle!  Watch Love Island USA Online Masters of the Air (Apple TV+) On Masters of the Air Season 1 Episode 1, led by Majors Cleven and Egan, the 100th Bomb group arrives in England and joins the 8th Air Force’s campaign against Nazi Germany. (Apple TV+) Apple TV+ continues pushing boundaries with its content, and we admit that sometimes, it goes places we could have done without. Masters of the Air, though, is a show whose quality and storytelling we’d like to see emulated again and again. Masters of the Air is a gripping World War II drama that takes to the skies, literally and emotionally. It follows the brave men of the Eighth Air Force, who carried out daring bombing missions over Nazi-occupied Europe. Produced by the powerhouse team behind Band of Brothers and The Pacific, it’s a story of heroism, camaraderie, and the heavy cost of war. (Apple TV+) The series dives deep into the lives of these young airmen, showing their resilience, their fears, and the bonds they form under unimaginable pressure. It’s not just about the missions — they balance moments of triumph and heartbreak while wrestling with the morality of their actions. The cast is a dream, with Austin Butler, Callum Turner, and Anthony Boyle doing the heavy lifting as squad leaders with the courage to make countless missions to bring the war to a close and what remains of their men home. Stunningly filmed and packed with emotion, Masters of the Air is a high-flying look at a part of history that feels intensely human and incredibly real. It’s a must-watch for anyone who loves a mix of action, history, and heart. Watch Masters of the Air Online Matlock (CBS) (Sonja Flemming/CBS) When Matlock was first announced, we groaned at the idea of ANOTHER reboot, but this one took us (and the world!) by surprise. Kathy Bates’ Matlock not only re-imagined the concept behind the original show but turned the usual legal procedural tropes on their head. Using the case-of-the-week format — and Madeline’s sneakiness as she makes progress toward her revenge — Matlock Season 1 addressed issues such as the way women are and were treated in the workplace and how older people, especially older women, are seen as less capable than they are. It’s become a show we look forward to every week, even the brief sojourn between seasons feels like an eternity. Watch Matlock Online Silo (Apple TV+) (Apple TV+) Silo Season 1 was a fast-paced adventure, but Silo Season 2 scaled things back considerably, and somehow, it still towers above the year’s other offerings. Juliette left the Silo, only to learn the ins and outs of how another fell, broadening the mystery of this apocalyptic aftermath that has left the earth’s citizens living underground. The action and intrigue in the original silo haven’t slowed down either, as an uprising threatens to derail everything everyone has tried to build. Although the season-ending roadmap was written in the books, those of us watching without having read the materials have no idea what’s ahead, and we’re willing to bet the TV version will have a little something for those who have read the books something to digest, too. Thankfully, we already know that Silo Seasons 3 and 4 are on the way, so we don’t have to worry that this story will finish untold. Watch Silo Online Slow Horses (Apple TV+) (Courtesy of Apple TV+) For the past four seasons, Slow Horses on Apple TV+ has delivered some of the finest storytelling in spy thrillers today. Despite its occasional ups and downs, it remains the crème de la crème of the genre, offering a sharp mix of suspense, humor, and character depth. Jackson Lamb and his ragtag crew of MI5 rejects prove time and again that underdogs can outshine the stars, becoming the unsung heroes of the agency, much to the frustration of their more polished counterparts. It makes you wonder if Slough House is truly a dumping ground for MI5’s worst, or is it secretly where the best go to shine? Either way, you’ll find yourself rooting for this mismatched team at every turn. If there’s one downside to Slow Horses, it’s the limited six-episode seasons. Just when you’re completely hooked, it’s over, leaving you wondering how the hour just flew by. But that’s a testament to its slick, fast-paced storytelling, phenomenal acting, and razor-sharp writing. No other spy show on TV today comes close to the brilliance of Slow Horses. Watch Slow Horses Online The Way Home (Hallmark Channel) (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Peter Stranks) The Way Home Season 2 took everything fans loved about the first and deepened it, making the story even richer and more compelling. The Way Home Season 1 laid the groundwork for its success with its heartwarming blend of family drama, small-town charm, and time-travel mystery. Season 2 not only answered some of the lingering questions, such as solving the mystery of Jacob’s disappearance but also raised the stakes in meaningful, emotional ways, adding new layers to the Landrys’ complicated history and new characters that we fell in love with immediately. The relationships between Alice, Kat, and Del grew even more complex as they faced new challenges and discoveries that tested their fragile bond. On The Way Home Season 1 Episode 2, Del recreates traditions of family summers past, Alice misses her friends, and Kat grapples with Jacobâ€™s mystery in the wake of losing Elliot. (©2023 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Peter Stranks) The time-travel element also got more intricate, revealing unexpected twists about the Landry family’s past and how it continues to shape their present. The writers skillfully expanded the world while staying true to what made it special — a true feat when so many shows succumb to the sophomore slump. With stronger character arcs, even more captivating storylines, and the continued warmth of Hallmark’s signature storytelling, the second season cemented The Way Home as not just a show about family but about understanding where you come from to truly find your way forward. It was everything fans hoped for and more. Watch The Way Home Online Now it’s your turn! Did we even come close to capturing the essence of the best TV shows of 2024?
