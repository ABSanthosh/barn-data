The eight-episode freshman season wrapped on the network in November. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) “We look forward to giving fans a second season of Karl Alberg’s unmatched expertise as a crime solver in Murder in a Small Town,” EVP of Drama Programming \u0026 Development Brooke Bowman said in a statement.  “We’ve enjoyed a terrific partnership with [producers] Sepia and Future Shack and our incredibly talented cast and crew and can’t wait to see what’s in store for our characters next season.” Murder in a Small Town’s Numbers Aren’t Great (FOX/ YouTube Screenshot) Murder in a Small Town averaged a modest 3.2 million viewers and a 0.24 rating among adults 18-49 with a week of DVR factored in. While these numbers would usually spell doom, the series’ price tag pales in comparison to other FOX shows, like the canceled 9-1-1: Lone Star. Plus, Murder in a Small Town is a co-production, so there was every reason to believe that a deal could be reached to keep it intact for another go-around. We have to hand it to Kreuk. She’s anchored some of broadcast TV’s least-viewed shows, but they always secure renewals because they make financial sense. (FFOX/ YouTube Screenshot) Murder in a Small Town, also starring Rossif Sutherland as Karl Alberg, focuses on a police officer who moves to a small town and catches the eye of a librarian named Cassandra Lee. The series is based on the novels by L.R. Wright and has managed to capture a small group of very enthusiastic fans. We see you! The 2025-2026 TV Season is Taking Shape We discussed Murder in a Small Town’s renewal earlier this week in our FOX Cheat Sheet, but the network has limited space on its schedule for next season. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) The broadcast networks have been slower to renew this season. Murder in a Small Town joins Universal Basic Guys, Matlock, and St. Denis as renewals for the 2025-26 broadcast TV schedule so far. More decisions will be made in due course. But for now, what are your thoughts on Murder in a Small Town’s reprieve? We know that TV Fanatics, in particular, were really hoping for a renewal. Does this give you hope for the TV landscape?
