  "text": "George Wendt‘s Cheers castmates are raising a glass in his honor. Wendt, who died Tuesday at the age of 76, is best known to TV fans as Cheers’ wisecracking beer aficionado Norm Peterson, and his co-stars on the hit NBC sitcom are paying tribute to him in light of his passing. Ted Danson, who starred as bartender Sam Malone on Cheers, told Entertainment Weekly: “I am devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us. I am sending all my love to [Wendt’s wife] Bernadette and the children. It is going to take me a long time to get used to this. I love you, Georgie.” John Ratzenberger, who played Norm’s drinking buddy Cliff Clavin, added: “I’m heartbroken to hear about the passing of my friend George Wendt. For 11 years on Cheers, we shared a stage, a lot of laughs, and a front-row seat to one of television’s most beloved friendships. George brought Norm to life with a subtle brilliance — the kind that made it look easy. That was his gift.” Ratzenberger also called Wendt “a true craftsman — humble, hilarious, and full of heart… What you saw on screen was exactly who he was off-screen with impeccable comedic timing and a deep loyalty to those he loved. I’ll miss our conversations and the quiet moments of friendship that meant the most.” Rhea Perlman, who played surly bar waitress Carla, offered her sympathies as well, calling Wendt “the sweetest, kindest man I ever met… It was impossible not to like him. As Carla, I was often standing next to him, as Norm always took the same seat at the end of the bar, which made it easy to grab him and beat the crap out of him at least once a week. I loved doing it, and he loved pretending it didn’t hurt. What a guy! I’ll miss him more than words can say.” Kelsey Grammer, who played psychiatrist Frasier Crane, told The Hollywood Reporter: “I believe mourning is a private matter.  But I liked George a lot. He was beloved by millions.” NBC, the network that aired Cheers for 11 seasons, chimed in with their own tribute to Wendt on social media: “Watching him walk through that door and head to his barstool, America couldn’t wait to say hi to Norm every Thursday night. George Wendt was an essential part of the genius of Cheers and he will be missed by the millions who loved him. Norm was all of us. A regular guy who finished his hardworking day wanting to be surrounded by friends and a frosty beverage. We’re proud to raise a glass and toast a true comedy legend.”",
