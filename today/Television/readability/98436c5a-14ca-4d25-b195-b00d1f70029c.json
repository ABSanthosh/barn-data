  "text": "CBS‘ Matlock closed out its hit freshman run with several cliffhangers — including for the supporting characters toiling away at Jacobson Moore. Yes, we were left to wonder what Olympia (played by Skye. P. Marshall) will do with her discovery, accompanied by an all-out confession/defense, that Julian (Jason Ritter) — acting on Senior’s (Beau Bridges) orders — in fact stole the damning Welbrexa study that Matty (Kathy Bates), Edwin and Alfie spent all of Season 1 chasing down. Additionally, we and Matty were most unexpectedly introduced to a man (played by Sons of Anarchy‘s Niko Nicotera) who suspects he is Alfie’s father. But wait, there’s even more drama simmering heading into Season 2! Because Billy’s (David Del Rio) jaw dropped to the floor when on-and-off girlfriend Claudia (Bella Ortiz) announced to him that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Sarah (Leah Lewis) is oblivious to the fact that workplace rival Simone (Andrea Londo) is quietly looking into how Sarah landed gym owner Dino as her first client. (As Matlock showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman told TVLine, “you can’t take a case in a giant law firm without going through the proper channels…. it’s a fireable offense, so that’s what’s at stake.”) Speaking with TVLine in the red carpet video above, Del Rio shares how he and real-life wife Katherine were expecting their second child when he learned that Billy would suddenly be a dad himself. “This will be the first character I’ve ever played that has to deal with fatherhood,” he notes, “and to be in an environment such as the law game is going to be a real nice ‘two thunderstorms colliding.’ As an actor, you want your circumstances to be delicious.” Lewis in turn affirms that “Simone is going to make so much trouble” for Sarah, which “breaks my heart! “Sarah has been working her ass off for one thing this whole season and finally gets it, but of course the way she went about it [was wrong],” she adds. With her rival now hot on her scent, “I’m excited to see Simone pull out more intensity from Sarah, and see them fight tooth and nail.” The two actors proceed to sing Londo’s praises, and the spice and humor she brings to the role of Simone.
