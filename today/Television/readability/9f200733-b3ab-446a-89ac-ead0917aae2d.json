  "text": "Obviously, the first four episodes of The Penguin were not exactly devoid of bloodshed. But in an ironic twist for a show named after a flightless bird, the death toll really soared in The Penguin Season 1 Episode 4. We said goodbye to some well-liked characters (“beloved” would be an overstatement for anyone on this show), and the groundwork has been laid for an all-out war between Oz and Sofia. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) TV Fanatic writers Thomas Godwin and Tyler Johnson sat down to discuss the episode, the shocking deaths, and what comes next for Sofia Gigante and her former driver. Check it out: We said goodbye to some relatively big characters (Nadia Maroni, Johnny Viti) on this week’s episode. Is this show dispatching major players a bit too quickly, or do you like knowing that anyone can go at any time? Thomas: I was a bit disappointed by Johnny Viti’s sudden departure. I thought that would be an interesting dynamic, especially after his empathetic speech. It would have been interesting seeing him play second fiddle to Sofia and watching him grow in a role unfamiliar to him. Then she blew his head off and I spit out half my NOS and scared my dogs. Tyler: It’s been a while since a show has so wantonly killed off well-developed characters portrayed by relatively famous actors. It’s bringing to mind the heyday of Game of Thrones, which is never a bad thing. And thinning the herd in this way really helps keep the focus on the key three — namely, Oz, Sofia, and Vic. But at the same time, the varied cast of idiosyncratic bad guys (and gals) was one of my favorite things about this show, so I’m a little sad to see so many interesting characters kicked to the curb so abruptly. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) I’d be worried if I thought the writers were setting up a long-running series and had plans to introduce new characters in order to replace the not-so-dearly departed. But I’m more and more convinced that this show will be a one-and-done limited series (that was always the plan, but networks often change their plans these days), so maybe paring down the cast ahead of the final episodes is a smart move. What do you make of the relationship between Sofia and Dr. Rush? Does she finally have someone trustworthy in her corner? Thomas: I don’t know. He’s creepy to me. Seems awfully soft and maybe a touch sadistic to be someone Sofia can depend on. He’s that dude with the creepy white 1990s Dodge van with “free candy” sloppily finger painted on the side. Tyler: Yeah, there’s definitely something creepy about the good doctor. I’m usually dismissive of fan theories when it comes to this show, as the writers have made a point of subverting expectations thus far. But there’s a lot to be said for the idea that Rush will turn out to be the Scarecrow. And hey, if that happens then he might turn out to be Sofia’s most powerful ally! What do you think of Sofia’s decision to adopt her mother’s maiden name? Obviously, names are of major significance on this show and in the world of comics in general. Do you think the new moniker signals a shift in her character? (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Thomas: I think it does. I mean, who wouldn’t? If my dad shipped me off to the local nuttery so he could hide the fact that he hung my mother, I’d probably change names as well. Tyler: What’s in a name? Well, in the worlds of both gangsters and comic books, a lot! As Lisa Babick pointed out in her review, Sofia’s new name links her to Vincent Gigante, another mob boss who was the subject of mental health speculation. And of course, when a denizen of Gotham changes their name, it’s usually an indication that they’ve entered a new phase of heroism or villainy. Perhaps it’ll be a bit of both in Sofia’s case. It’s also worth noting that “Gigante” translates to “giant” or “gigantic.” Oz and her other foes might want to run and hide while they still can. What about Sal’s escape from prison? Was it too far-fetched, or has this show earned that level of dramatic license? What does his freedom mean for the war between Oz and Sofia? (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Thomas: Sal’s escape was, at least to me, the most cheesy thing I’ve seen on The Penguin. I did my time in the Marines. You don’t take a shiv to the gut (all the way to the hilt, I might add) which probably plunged straight through his bowels and potentially the liver, bladder, kidneys, or spine, and suddenly overpower a perfectly healthy corrections officer, escape, and fail to seek any kind of medical attention. He’s leaking his own feces into his bloodstream now, and I feel like they just needed an excuse to saddle Sofia with another untrustworthy partner and keep the Maroni family gig running. Sure, it’s fiction, but come on… Tyler: Yeah, that scene struck a sour note with me, which is a shame, as it was such a strong episode otherwise. Sure, it’s a comic book show, but it’s also taken pains to maintain a certain level of realism up to this point. To throw it away with that scene when it would’ve been so easy to write a believable prison break for Sal just seems odd to me. But hey, maybe it’ll all be explained later on. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Let’s talk shrooms. Oz is still trying to become the king of Gotham’s underground (literally), while Sofia is laser-focused on wiping out her enemies. Is Oz setting himself up for disaster with his quest to become the city’s top fungi guy? Thomas: I love the throwback to Batman Returns with the whole underground lair thing. I also think the “plot hole” going around online (with The Penguin and Batman rubbing shoulders in the tunnels beneath Gotham) is no biggie. Oz is at rock bottom. There’s only one direction he can go from here. Penguins can’t fly and all, but that direction is definitely up. Tyler: It seems like the show wants us to believe that Oz has drastically underestimated his opponent and is now literally in over his head. That might be the case, but with three episodes remaining, there are certainly quite a few twists to come. I think Bliss will end up having major plot significance — possibly in connection with the aforementioned Dr. Rush/Scarecrow theory. But I’ve learned not to try and predict this show. In fact, the only thing I’m sure of is that I have no idea what’s in store! Over to you, TV fanatics? What are your thoughts on this wild episode?
