  "text": "Ohio State and Michigan College Football Teams Break Out in On-Field Brawl After Major Upset — WatchMichigan’s rivalry with Ohio State boiled over Saturday after the unranked Wolverines beat the No. 2 Buckeyes — resulting in a massive post-game fight televised on Fox. After Michigan upset Ohio State 13-10, the Wolverines headed to the center of the field to celebrate. As the visiting team attempted to plant a Michigan flag mid-field, Ohio State players swarmed the group and a brawl erupted, resulting in police intervention. “Following the game, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies assisted in breaking up an on-field altercation,” the Ohio State University Police Department said in a statement after the incident. “During the scuffle, multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray. [Ohio State University Police Department] is the lead agency for games and will continue to investigate.” “You hate to see stuff like that after the game,” Michigan player Kalel Mullings told Fox’s Jenny Taft minutes after the fight dissipated. “It’s just bad for the sport, bad for college football… They gotta learn how to lose, man. You can’t be fighting and stuff because you lost the game… That’s wrong. Classless, in my opinion.” Meanwhile, in a post-game press conference, Ohio State coach Ryan Day seemingly defended the actions of his team. “These [Michigan] guys are looking to put a flag on our field and our guys weren’t going to let that happen,” he said.",
