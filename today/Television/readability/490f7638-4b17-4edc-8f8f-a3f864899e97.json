  "text": "With its second episode, The Way Home Season 3 introduced a new love triangle in 1974 between young Colton Landry, his best friend Evelyn Goodwin (!) and new-to-Port Haven Delilah Watson. But there’s another fourth party caught up in the midst of this complicated situation: Alice, who’s time-traveled to the ’70s to witness her grandparents Colton and Del’s love story, including their very first meeting. At the same time, Alice has befriended Evelyn, who harbors feelings for Colton, but Alice knows that the free-spirited blonde is fated to not get the guy she loves. Young Evelyn and Colton Courtesy of Hallmark Channel “I think Alice is really fighting with how beautiful and romantic and groovy the ’70s can be, and how much of a blessing it feels like to get some more time with her grandfather and to sort of see that love story beginning,” her portrayer Sadie Laflamme-Snow tells TVLine. “And then she’s also dealing with the extreme guilt of knowing how his life ended, and the responsibility that her and Kat had for that.” As Alice spends more time in the past with the younger versions of Colton, Del and Evelyn, she becomes “totally integrated into their social scene, and she has to, yet again, live through teenage-hood when she knows how it’s kind of all going to turn out,” Laflamme-Snow says. That puts the teen in a difficult predicament because “she knows now that she can’t interfere, but she does also know that she has a role to play,” Laflamme-Snow previews. “She’s not there just to observe. She’s there to integrate and to be part of their friend group and their story… People find out along with Alice what her job is in that sort of origin story of her family.” Taking on the responsibility of playing young Colton, Del and Evelyn are Jordan Doww (Stalked by a Reality Star), Julia Tomasone (Backstage) and Devin Cecchetto (Marry F*** Kill), respectively, and the show’s series regulars have nothing but praise for the new additions. “Once again, we’ve lucked out with our casting… They just bring such beautiful life and vibrance to the show,” raves Evan Williams (aka Elliot). Adds Andie MacDowell, who plays adult Del, about her counterpart: “I think [Julia] does a sweet job, and it’s fun to watch those younger characters, and to see the falling in love and the dynamic between Evelyn and Colton. That part [of young Del is] really well written. I think that [Julia] has a lot of fun. She has really great stuff to do.” Young Del and Colton Courtesy of Hallmark Channel As for Tomasone’s uncanny ability to capture her mannerisms and whether the two discussed their performances, MacDowell says with a laugh, “Well, she watched the show… I spoke to her, and I spoke with her voice coach but one time, and I saw her a little bit, and then we would do read-throughs. But she had the show to watch. I’m sure that’s what she went by.” Star Chyler Leigh, meanwhile, praises Doww’s work as young Colton: “There are so many moments, little gestures, or even just, like, the little smirk that he has, it’s so well done and well thought-out. I think all the work in the ’70s is absolutely just beautiful. Like, really gorgeous.” Press PLAY above to hear what else the cast had to say about the ’70s timeline, then hit the comments with your thoughts and theories!",
