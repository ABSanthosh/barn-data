  "text": "Is there love after life? According to Ghosts, the answer is a resounding “Yes!” Over the CBS comedy’s run, the show’s many spirits have paired up (Thor and Flower), hooked up (Trevor and Hetty) or almost gotten hitched (Isaac and Nigel). In the Season 4 finale, a new twosome took a big step forward when Alberta realized her feelings for Pete and they shared a kiss after he broke up with girlfriend Donna. Add in Sasappis’ recent romance with 1940s screenwriter Joan, and there’s no longer a ghost who hasn’t experienced some kind of romantic storyline. Showrunners Joe Port and Joe Wiseman admit that they do worry about having too many ghost couples, and it’s something they try to avoid. “We don’t want this to become just a show about relationships,” Wiseman tells TVLine, “but we have so many characters, and the ghosts have not a lot to do. So it seems natural that we would do some stories where they’d pair off. But yes, we consciously want to make sure that it’s not just a show about couples in relationships.” That said, recent developments, like Pete and Alberta’s smooch, and Sas losing his virginity with Joan, point to more romance in Season 5. For starters, the showrunners are hopeful that they’ll get to continue exploring Sas’ nascent relationship. (Click for scoop on what’s next for Pete and Alberta.) “We’re all big fans of Joan and Taylor Ortega, who portrayed Joan, and it’s nice to get Sas in a relationship and have him find love. So we would love to see more of Sas and Joan together, for sure,” Wiseman says. Meanwhile, opposites-attract couple Thor and Flower have, surprisingly, turned out to be the show’s most steady and longest-lasting ghost pairing… for now. “We like the idea of what’s, seemingly, the least likely couple, the war-loving Viking and the peace-loving hippie, [being] in a stable relationship, but you know, stories require conflict,” Wiseman teases. “So I don’t know that we should say that they’re going to be smooth sailing forever. But yeah, it was sort of nice to have a couple that was kind of steady and you didn’t have to worry about creating waves with them all the time.” One duo that fans should not expect to get re-involved any time soon is Trevor and Hetty, whose friends-with-benefits dalliance evovled into a power friends alliance in Season 4. “They seem to have a lot of people rooting for them to be together. It’s interesting. I guess never say never,” Port says of the possibility of revisiting Trevor and Hetty in a romantic context. “Their dynamic as these sort of scheming friends was a very winning one,” Port continues, “and we’re in no rush to get them together romantically. I think they have an interesting thing going on right now, and our plate is kind of full with relationships that we’re already exploring.” Ghosts fans, which pairings are you rooting for?
