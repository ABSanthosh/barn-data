  "text": "We’ve got a Pawnee family reunion to show you, and it’s as sweet as Sweetums. Jenny Slate got a heartwarming surprise on Friday’s The Drew Barrymore Show when her Parks and Recreation co-star and TV dad Henry Winkler popped up in the audience posing as a fan. Slate got emotional when she saw Winkler, who asked her: “Can I have some of that money back?” (Slate’s character Mona-Lisa Saperstein, you’ll remember, always begged Winkler’s character Lu for cash, sticking out her hand and demanding, “Money, please!”) Slate rushed over to hug Winkler, admitting through tears: “I didn’t know that people really get surprised on TV!” She also remembered running into Winkler at a recent awards ceremony, taking comfort in the fact that “my TV dad is here.” Slate memorably played Jean-Ralphio’s obnoxiously superficial twin sister Mona-Lisa Saperstein on Parks and Rec, debuting in Season 5 and appearing in nine episodes — including the series finale, where she and Jean-Ralphio faked their own deaths. Winkler appeared in eight episodes as Jean-Ralphio and Mona-Lisa’s overly generous father Dr. Lu Saperstein, making his debut in Season 6. Press PLAY above to watch the reunion in full, and tell us your fondest Parks and Rec memories in the comments below.",
