The third season of Dark Winds is set to hit AMC and AMC+ on March 9. (Courtesy of AMC) And the network is whetting our appetites with a trailer that fully embraces the noirish nightmare vibes that made the first two seasons so memorable. Based on the beloved book series by Tony Hillerman, Dark Winds has beefed up its cast for its third outing. TV veterans Jenna Elfman and Bruce Greenwood have signed on as series regulars. The show also boasts a star-studded roster of executive producers that includes Robert Redford and George R.R. Martin. The first two seasons of Dark Winds consisted of six tightly plotted episodes. The show’s episode order has now been expanded, which is perhaps a testament to its widespread critical appeal in an era in which true prestige TV is hard to come by. “The expanded third season, featuring eight episodes, picks up six months after the events of Season 2 and follows Lt. Joe Leaphorn (Zahn McClarnon) and Jim Chee (Kiowa Gordon) as they investigate the disappearance of two boys, with only an abandoned bicycle and blood-stained patch of ground left in their wake,” reads the logline. “Meanwhile, Bernadette Manuelito (Matten) attempts to settle into her new life 500 miles from home with the Border Patrol, but stumbles across a conspiracy involving human and drug smuggling with far-reaching implications.” (AMC) With its southwestern setting, dark tone, and interest in the philosophical side of crime, Dark Winds has drawn comparisons to the first season of True Detective. That’s not an unfair analogy, but Dark Winds also has a lot in common with more traditional procedurals. In other words, if you’re on the fence about jumping into this show, you needn’t worry about being subjected to any ponderous musings about the cyclical nature of time. That said, this series does not go easy on its audience. (Courtesy of AMC) “We all have a line down the center of our hearts. That line separates monsters from men,” Leaphorn says in the trailer. “And I’m afraid I have crossed that line.” Yes, Halloween might be over, but Dark Winds is still sending shivers up our spine. And we can’t wait to see what’s in store for Season 3. What do you think, TV fanatics? Is Dark Winds deserve a place in the conversation about TV’s very best cop shows?
