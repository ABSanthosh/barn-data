  "text": "Tracy Morgan is headed to the gridiron to reunite with his old 30 Rock pals. Morgan will star as a former pro football player in an NBC comedy pilot from Tina Fey, TVLine has learned. In the untitled single-camera comedy, Morgan plays “a disgraced former football player on a mission to rehabilitate his image,” per the official logline. Morgan and Fey will serve as executive producers along with fellow 30 Rock alums Robert Carlock and Sam Means, who co-wrote the pilot. Morgan played Tracy Jordan alongside Fey’s Liz Lemon on 30 Rock, which ended a seven-season run on NBC in 2013. Morgan is also set to star in Paramount+’s The Neighborhood spinoff Crutch, which earned a series order last May and is slated to premiere later this year. But his deal allows him to star in both projects in the future. After being a Saturday Night Live cast member from 1996 to 2003, Morgan played erratic actor Tracy Jordan on 30 Rock, earning an Emmy nomination in 2009 for best supporting actor in a comedy. Since then, Morgan has starred in The Last O.G., which ran for four seasons on TBS, along with guest appearances on The Twilight Zone and The Santa Clauses.",
