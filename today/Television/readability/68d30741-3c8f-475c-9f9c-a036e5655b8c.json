  "text": "The revolving door that is #OneChicago continues to spin: Toya Turner will not return to Chicago P.D. for the NBC crime procedural’s upcoming 13th season, TVLine has confirmed. “My time on Chicago P.D. has come to a close,” wrote Thursday in an emotional Instagram post. “This show challenged me, sharpened me, and revealed what I’m made of. I’ve evolved through this experience, both as an artist and in my craft, and I’m walking away with depth, clarity, and momentum for whatever comes next.” Toya then addressed the individual groups who made her experience so memorable. “To the cast and crew: thank you for the warmth, the laughter, and the generosity you brought every day,” she wrote. “It was an honor to share the screen and the set with such talent. To the ChiHards: thank you for welcoming me, rooting for me, and showing Kiana love.” Ending on a high note, she wrote, “And to everyone who believes in me: your support means the world. I’m excited for the opportunities ahead.” A specific reason for Turner’s departure is not yet known. Deadline reports that casting is currently underway for a new female series regular to play a “loose cannon” ATF Task Force officer with a military background. TVLine broke the news of Turner’s original casting at the top of Season 12, with showrunner Gwen Sigan describing Kiana as a “very cool” and “very different” addition to the show. “She’s been on the force for a few years, so we get to see that she knows her way around,” Sigan said. “She knows what she’s doing.” (Indeed, both the character and actress knew what they were doing; Turner was named a TVLine Performer of the Week in January 2025.) Just 10 days ago, Turner was sharing on Instagram the self-tape audition that brought her back to her hometown of Chicago. “I had no idea this audition would be the one to bring me home. But it was,” she wrote. “This self-tape made me a series regular on Chicago P.D. “Keep going, actors,” she added, “the right one really can change your whole life.” Not long before that, she posted a series of behind-the-scenes P.D. photos, saying, “Having #ChicagoPD withdrawals idk about y’all.” TVLine has reached out to NBC for confirmation.
