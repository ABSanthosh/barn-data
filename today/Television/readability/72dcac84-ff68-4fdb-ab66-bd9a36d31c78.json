  "text": "Amazon’s hit video game adaptation Fallout is already hitting “start” on Season 2: Macaulay Culkin has joined the cast in a recurring role for its upcoming sophomore season, our sister site Deadline reports. No details on his role have been confirmed yet, but Deadline says he’s playing “a crazy genius-type character.” Fallout, based on the popular video game series, is set 200 years after the apocalypse, with Ella Purnell starring as survivor Lucy and Walton Goggins playing bounty hunter The Ghoul. Season 1 was a huge success, becoming one of Prime Video’s top three most-watched titles ever and garnering 16 Emmy nominations, including nods for best drama series and best lead actor in a drama for Goggins. Amazon renewed the series for Season 2 in April, just eight days after it debuted. Culkin, of course, is best known for playing resourceful tyke Kevin McCallister in the 1990 holiday smash Home Alone and its 1992 sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. As a child actor, he also had memorable roles in My Girl and The Good Son. He returned to acting as an adult, earning acclaim for his work in Party Monster and Saved!, among others. He recently co-starred in Season 10 of FX’s American Horror Story, dubbed Double Feature, and HBO’s The Righteous Gemstones, contributing voices to the Adult Swim series Robot Chicken as well. Video game fans: Got an idea who Culkin might be playing? Hit the comments to share the scoop.",
