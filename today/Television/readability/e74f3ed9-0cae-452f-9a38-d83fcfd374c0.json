  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4 / 5.04 The music industry is a dirty business, and Jeremy Mitchell learned that the hard way. Will Trent Season 3 Episode 9 illustrated how far Rafael Wexford would go to take advantage of people to become the next gang leader, regardless of who got hurt. Jeremy was collateral damage, and Will grew tired of Rafael throwing their past in his face. He’s no longer an entertaining frenemy but a tiresome villain. (Daniel Delgado Jr/ Disney) Additionally, Michael and Angie investigated a unique case with an interesting twist that occurred at a private Swingers’ party. Finally, Angie’s past baggage hindered her new relationship with Seth. Forming a new relationship is complicated when he doesn’t know everything about her childhood. Multiple Rappers End Up Dead, Leading the GBI to Where Jeremy and Rafael Wexford Worked The cold open on this case was too long. We didn’t need to know how the concert went or that this rap group changed their music to sing about conscious issues. That could have been brought up later. It was more critical that Slow Blizzy, the lead suspect, worked at Off the Ropes Records with Jeremy and Rafael Wexford. That’s when the drama began. In the past few episodes, Rafael Wexford and Will still possessed a frenemy and brotherly vibe. That was gone as he wanted them immediately gone from his studio. (Wilford Harewood/ Disney) Jeremy wanted them gone, too, but for different reasons. He felt they were checking in on him like a young kid and thought he was old enough to make his own decisions. The parallels between Faith and Jeremy and Will and Rafael Wexford were some of the best scenes. Will refused to back down. I hate that we still don’t know what Rafael is holding over Will’s head, but it must be awful since so many people fear crossing him. Faith and Will learned from other suspects that Rafael ran a money laundering business out of the studio, and the murder was closer to home than they thought. Faith hated that her son blamed her, but Will thought she was a concerned and devoted mother. Jeremy Was Desperate to Succeed and Ended Up Over His Head Jeremy was desperate to prove that he had dropped out of school for the right reasons and could make music. He sounded so like Faith in her arguments with Evelyn. (Wilford Harewood/ Disney) He longed for his mom to be proud of him, and if he had stopped for a minute, he would have realized that Rafael Wexford was the bad guy, not Faith and Will. Rafael acted like he owned everyone and everything, like Jeremy’s new song, implying that he used Rafael’s equipment, so it was his. Rafael feared that Faith and Will would learn he was laundering drugs and money, so he fired Jeremy before they dug too far. Jeremy was an overeager and dumb kid who should never have agreed to deliver anything for Rafael Wexford. At least he had the sense to call Will for help, but that’s a massive mess to clean up. (Zac Popik/Disney) We haven’t seen the end of Rafael Wexford, though hopefully, we will soon. I’m excited to see Will and Jeremy team up to investigate him. While rightfully angry at Jeremy, he wanted to protect him and take down Rafael more. This will be entertaining, and perhaps Jeremy will realize how challenging it is to be a GBI agent. Will: I don’t know what you expected when you called me. I’m sorry, Jeremy. It’s this or prison. Jeremy: Okay. I’m in. Will: This stays between us. Jeremy: Just us. Thankfully, that means he’ll appear again this season. These family visits and complex relationships have improved Will Trent. I’m relieved Will helped Jeremy, which may affect his friendship with Faith. Will Trent Season 3 Episode 9 Introduced The World of Swinging and Dom/Sub Relationships I initially hoped to see Angie and Michael undercover at a swingers’ club, but this case was different. Michael and Pete still had difficulty processing swinging relationships, but Angie handled it professionally. (Zac Popik/Disney) Lilith, the victim, died from asphyxiation. She liked to be choked from the scarring on her throat, but they couldn’t prove that strangulation killed her. The party included voyeur rooms, vanilla play, and spicier play, like choking. While Lilith’s sub initially denied choking her since he disliked hurting her, another party guest saw him upstairs with her through the voyeur room. Understanding the dom and sub dynamic was challenging since Albert and Lilith cared for each other and were in a relationship, but he had to do whatever she said.  Generally, he waited downstairs at parties, allowing her to get her needs met by rougher partners. But none of them fulfilled her needs, and Lilith needed Albert to choke her harder, even if he wasn’t comfortable with it. Even though she died right after, Angie maintained Albert wasn’t a cold-blooded killer. She has sounded more like a lawyer than a cop during Will Trent Season 3. However, her instincts were right, and Albert knew he didn’t kill Lilith. Angie Almost Ruined Her New Relationship With Her Excess Baggage (Daniel Delgado Jr/ Disney) Seth is Angie’s first relationship since dating Will. She panicked when he began talking about his parents’ wedding anniversary and his mom’s apple pie. It seemed like he grew up in a traditional family, and she figured she would never measure up to that. It was easier with Will since he grew up with her and already knew her childhood trauma.  I don’t condone Angie’s snooping, but she’s been burned many times, and I understand why she assumed the ring and the photo meant Seth was married. It was entertaining that Franklin and Michael were ready to battle Seth when he came by. They’re protective of her, but they also know her relationship flaws. Everyone needs a tribe that stands by their side but is brutally honest. Thankfully, Franklin reminded Angie that Seth likely had issues, too, encouraging her to apologize. Angie: His parents have been married for 50 years and vacation in Nantucket. What would he do if he found out my mom sold me for a pack of Newport’s? Franklin: So, you’re afraid he’s going to reduce your life to its worst moments, so you’ve reduced his to its best moments? That’s a neat trick. (Zac Popik/Disney) Angie always had difficulty admitting she was wrong, so I appreciated how she began by asking for his advice on the case before apologizing. Initially, Seth made her talk in front of his interns since he had to talk in front of her co-workers. Still, he eventually relented, appreciating how difficult it was for her to reveal her traumatic past. They’re adorable; hopefully, we’ll see their relationship evolve slowly.
