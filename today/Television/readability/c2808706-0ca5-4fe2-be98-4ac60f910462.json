  "text": "The sun is gonna surely shine on Tuesday, when Mayim Bialik reunites with Big Bang Theory co-star (and self-proclaimed Blossom superfan) Melissa Rauch on NBC‘s Night Court. The five-time Emmy nominee plays a heightened version of herself, who arrives as a defendant and befriends Judge Abby Stone. Like Rauch, Abby grew up on Bialik’s 1990s sitcom, and is overjoyed when the television star expresses interest in spending time together. “This is a little bit of art imitating life,” Bialik tells TVLine. “Melissa did confess that she was a Blossom fan. I think the first day we met [on Big Bang], she was afraid if she didn’t say anything [and] I found out later, I might assume that she had been being nice to me because of that, or being weird because of it.” ‘Night Court’ (Nicole Weingart/NBC) Things never got weird between Rauch and Bialik, who remain friends to this day, but the same cannot be said for Abby and Mayim. Midway through the episode, Abby discovers that TV’s erstwhile Amy Farrah Fowler is (gulp) stalking her. (Yes, really!) “There’s definitely Single White Female components, but there’s also a Fatal Attraction component,” Bialik teases. “We dip into a little bit of both.” But rest assured, the real Bialik promises that the fake Bialik is a not a violent stalker. “It’s fun playing an exaggerated version of yourself,” she says. “As a viewer, I love when I see celebrities poking fun at themselves. I love when I see people bursting that bubble of what we expect of fancy celebrity guest spots. So, for me, it was fun to lean into that.” ‘The John Larroquette Show’ \u0026 ‘The Big Bang Theory’ (Warner Bros. Television/Everett Collection) The episode also doubles as John Larroquette Show reunion. Bialik played Larroquette’s daughter in three episodes of his eponymous sitcom, and Bialik reveals the connective tissue that led to her recurring role all those years ago. We also ask her about Max’s in-the-works Big Bang spinoff — which is set to see the returns of Kevin Sussman as comic book store owner Stuart Bloom, Lauren Lapkus as his girlfriend Denise, and Brian Posehn as Caltech geology professor Bert Kibbler — and whether she could see herself slipping into one of Amy’s signature sweater vests again, so soon after reprising her part in Young Sheldon’s May 2024 series finale. Watch the video Q\u0026A to get her answer to that and so much more, then hit the comments and tell us if you’ll be tuning into Tuesday’s Night Court (NBC, 8:30/7:30c).",
