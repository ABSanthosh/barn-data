They don’t need a badge to solve the case, and they often stumble into mysteries they have no business solving — yet somehow, they always manage to crack the case wide open. From Jessica Fletcher piecing together clues in Cabot Cove to Mabel, Oliver, and Charles sneaking around the Arconia, TV’s amateur sleuths have a unique talent for outsmarting the professionals and keeping us hooked. Only Murders in the Building (Disney/Patrick Harbron) But why do we love them so much? And what makes them so compelling compared to their badge-wearing counterparts? Let’s dive into the world of amateur detectives, from classics like Murder, She Wrote to modern hits like Only Murders in the Building, and see why these DIY crime solvers have become some of TV’s most beloved characters. Breaking the Mold: Why We Love the Outsider Part of the charm of amateur detectives is their freedom. They aren’t bound by police procedures or red tape. Jessica Fletcher, for instance, is a mystery writer who pokes her nose into cases that baffle local law enforcement — and nobody’s going to tell her to stop. Jessica Fletcher (ABC/Screenshot) She doesn’t need a warrant to ask questions or a badge to follow her hunches. She just follows the clues wherever they lead, and that independence is part of what makes her so compelling. Only Murders in the Building carries on that same spirit. Charles, Oliver, and Mabel have no investigative training — unless you count Charles’s brief role as a fictional detective in a TV show (which, let’s be honest, doesn’t quite qualify). Still, they’ve become experts in their own right, using their love of true crime podcasts and their sheer determination to uncover the truth. This mix of naivety, wit, and ingenuity makes their amateur sleuthing so endearing. They stumble, fail, and make mistakes — but ultimately, they always seem to find the truth where the professionals can’t. Hardy Boys (ABC/Screenshot) It’s the same with Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys, who’ve long embodied the “outsider” role. Despite their lack of experience, these teen detectives manage to unravel complex cases with nothing but their wits and resourcefulness. They may not have the authority to interrogate suspects, but they’re smart, tenacious, and most of all — relatable. And that relatability is key to why we love them. The genius behind these characters is that the rules of professional law enforcement don’t limit them. They don’t have to play by the same rulebook that the pros do. Nancy Drew (ABC/Screenshot) This gives them the freedom to approach a case with fresh eyes, unencumbered by traditional constraints. This makes them better detectives than the pros in many ways since they can think outside the box in ways that others simply can’t. Relatability Is Their Superpower Another reason amateur detectives are so compelling is that they feel like people we could know—or even be. Jessica Fletcher is that nosy neighbor who always seems to know more than anyone else. Mabel Mora – Only Murders in the Building (Craig Blankenhorn/Hulu) Mabel, Oliver, and Charles in Only Murders in the Building are the slightly eccentric but lovable people living right next door. These characters might not have badges or official credentials, but they have something even more powerful — curiosity, empathy, and the determination to do the right thing. Even Morgan Gillory from High Potential fits into this mold. She started out as a cleaning lady, but after analyzing clues in Detective Karadec’s office one night that helped solve a case, she became a police consultant. Now, with her lightning-fast deductive reasoning, she continues to crack case after case. Morgan Gillory (Nicole Weingart/Disney) Morgan isn’t tied down by bureaucracy; she’s an outsider who can spot the details everyone else misses. What’s fascinating about Morgan’s character is how her personal backstory fuels her crime-solving abilities — she brings an unconventional perspective to every case. What all of these amateur detectives share is a sense of humility and humanity. They aren’t superheroes or flawless experts — they’re flawed, relatable people just trying to make sense of the world around them. Their imperfections make them so endearing, and that’s what keeps us coming back week after week. Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys (ABC/Screenshot) Why They Endure: Timeless Appeal The appeal of amateur detectives isn’t new. These characters have been a TV staple for decades, and their enduring popularity shows no signs of fading. Why? Because they offer something unique: a mix of intelligence, humor, and humanity. They are the everyday heroes, solving crimes and overcoming obstacles in their own quirky ways. They make us believe that anyone can be a hero, regardless of their background or qualifications. Only Murders in the Building takes this formula and updates it for a modern audience, blending humor, suspense, and heart in a fresh but familiar way. Hart to Hart (ABC/Screenshot) In a way, Mabel, Charles, and Oliver are modern-day analogs of classic amateur detectives — brought to life in a timely and relevant way but still grounded in the same charm that made characters like Jessica Fletcher or Nancy Drew iconic. But it’s not just the classics and modern hits that keep the amateur detective genre alive. Veronica Mars took the trope of the high school detective and turned it into a powerful mix of mystery and social commentary. Hart to Hart gave us a glamorous, sophisticated couple who could outsmart anyone. At the same time, Sherlock Holmes has remained a beloved sleuth for generations, whether in his Victorian roots or his modern-day adaptations. Veronica Mars (Michael Desmond/Hulu) And let’s not forget Scooby-Doo, which has become a cultural touchstone for how a group of unlikely heroes can take down the bad guys and have fun doing it. It’s goofy, it’s silly, but it’s also a perfect example of how amateur sleuths don’t always need to take themselves seriously to be effective. The Mystery Continues: Anyone Can Solve the Case Amateur detectives offer something that professionals can’t: an outsider’s perspective. Their lack of formal training isn’t a weakness; it’s a strength. Not being tied down by tradition, rules, or the limitations of formal police work allows them to approach cases with an open mind and see things that others miss. Sherlock (BBC One/Screenshot) They may not have a badge, but they have something much more valuable — a sharp mind, a relentless sense of curiosity, and an unyielding desire to uncover the truth. At their core, amateur detectives are about problem-solving. They tap into our collective desire to make sense of the world, to find answers to the questions that keep us up at night. And that’s why amateur sleuths will always have a place in our hearts, from Jessica Fletcher’s small-town mysteries to Mabel and Oliver’s big-city shenanigans. So, Who’s Your Favorite? Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby (CBS/Screenshot) Whether it’s the sharp-witted Jessica Fletcher, the quirky trio from Only Murders in the Building, or the legendary Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, amateur detectives have proven time and again that anyone can be a hero, no badge required They remind us that intelligence, determination, and a little bit of charm can crack even the toughest cases.
