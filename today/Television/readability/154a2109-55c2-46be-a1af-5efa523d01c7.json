FBI International Season 4 Episode 1 spoilers will prepare you for the excitement to come. For the show’s fourth season, we expect to return to a normal season format of over twenty episodes. The season is kicking off in high gear, with lots of excitement, emotional backstories, and a new team leader taking over the FBI International Fly Team unit. (Nelly Kiss/CBS ) Here’s what fans can expect from the FBI: International Season 4 premiere. FBI: International Season 4 Cast Changes The shortened third season of FBI: International set up the exit of show lead Luke Kleintank, who played FBI Supervisory Special Agent and boss of the Fly Team Scott Forrester. Forrester left the series under a cloud of mystique. (Nelly Kiss/CBS) The story wrote him out as going into hiding in Alaska after getting mixed up with his mother, a former spy with a suspicious past. Taking the place of Fly team leader for FBI: International Season 4 is a familiar face for anyone who enjoys another of Dick Wolfe’s other massive franchises, One Chicago. Get ready, fans, because Jesse Lee Soffer is back in our PrimeTime lineup. But he’s not coming back as who we remember. Chicago P.D. fans were as heartbroken as Hailey Upton (Tracy Spiridakos) when Jay Halstead (Soffer) left the CPD Intelligence Unit after ten seasons. His exit created the path for his on-screen wife, Upton, to follow in Chicago P.D. Season 11. After a brief hiatus, Soffer is returning to a Dick Wolfe creation, this time as the boss of a team of international FBI agents. Another cast member leaving the FBI: International family will be Forrester’s romantic interest, Jamie Kellett (Heida Reed). The storyline sees Kellett leaving the team to take a role in Washington, D.C., after surviving the explosion that demolished the FBI Fly Team headquarters. (Dávid Lukács/CBS) Jesse Lee Soffer Joins as Special Agent Wesley Mitchell The biggest news of the upcoming fourth season is Soffer’s charismatic character, Wesley “Wes” Mitchell. Social media has been abuzz with quick trailers showing Soffer taking the reins on a team that bleeds loyalty for their previous leader. Wes seems friendly and laid-back, described as rakish and charming with unconventional tactics and brilliant instincts. Bonding over drinks seems to be a custom everyone is familiar with, no matter the locale. A short clip showed Mitchell around a quaint table with his subordinates, toasting a new team dynamic. Another clip promises a more personal side of Wes. It gave us a sneak peek at his tumultuous relationship dynamic. He may have control of his team as the leader, but his romantic interest doesn’t seem to have the same respect for his authority. What kind of jealousy streak must one person have to be willing to throw out their partner’s stuff over a voicemail? Especially when that partner works for the FBI. Yikes. The premise promises interest and a touch of humorous relationship drama. But what would a Dick production be without it? Fans have crooned over the Benson-Stabler no-mance for over two decades and it’s still a massive controversy among Law \u0026 Order: SVU fans. Some want the ‘ship to happen. Others don’t. Maybe 2024 is our year to find out one way or the other. Professionally, Wes promises to be a different type of leader than Forrester, but still a good one. He hails from the hardened streets of Los Angeles, with a rough childhood that influenced his first career with the LA police department. (Nelly Kiss/CBS) Let’s just hope he loves the team mascot, Tank. Otherwise this viewer will have an automatic dislike of one of my top TV man crushes. Late Season Four Staff Surprise for Station 19 Fans Fans who love Wolfe series often also have an obsession with anything under the Shondaland brand. This writer included! I might be the fan club prez. So it delights me to announce that another of my major man crushes will also be appearing on FBI: International, coming to us fresh off the cancellation of Station 19. Shondalanders will know him as Travis. (ABC/Gilles Mingasson) But get ready to remember Jay Hayden as FBI Agent Tyler Booth. Agent Booth (whoa, I almost typed Seeley there — guess I really need a Bones reboot for David Boreanaz now that SEAL Team is done) will be in Budapest seeking the Fly team’s help. Hayden and Soffer are best friends in real life. So, it should make for a great on-screen dynamic to see them play former partners who have lived through some stuff. Wes is already a loose cannon who does things his way, regardless of legality. When you add in the chaos of his spontaneous partner, things can start to get a bit off the books. It looks good that Mitchell has Agent Megan Garretson (Eva-Jane Willis), affectionately known as Smitty. Smitty will be the good angel on his shoulder, tasked with keeping him in check when he’s under the influence of the bad angel Booth. (Dávid Lukács/CBS) However, fans must be patient. Hayden won’t be joining the show until the second half of the fourth season. Fans and the Fly team will get introduced to Mitchell when he comes to Budapest on the hunt for armed suspects involved in a police shooting. The season opener starts in Los Angeles with Soffer and his partner involved in a car chase that results in his partner getting shot and the suspects fleeing to Europe with Agent Mitchell in hot pursuit. Soffer promises the fourth season opener will be a wild ride full of intense action that drops fans smack in the middle of the chaos of his life. From a gnarly robbery crew to Mitchell’s desire to solve his partner’s shooting, the season premiere will be full of new. But while new to the Fly Team, Mitchell will already have an established relationship with one member of the unit. Special Agent Cameron Vo (Vinessa Vidotto). A past that sounds strained, to say the least. Years prior, Mitchell was Vo’s training officer, which could explain why Vo seems so eager to embrace Wes as part of the team so fast. Be sure you’re tuning in to FBI: International live on Tuesdays at 9 pm/ET, starting on October 15. If you like the FBI franchise, things kick off at 8 pm/ET with FBI Season 7, with FBI: Most Wanted Season 6 following International at 10 pm/ET. Now it’s over to our Fanatics fans. Jump into our comments and give us your opinions on the newest additions to FBI: International. How do you feel about Soffer taking over for Kleintank?
