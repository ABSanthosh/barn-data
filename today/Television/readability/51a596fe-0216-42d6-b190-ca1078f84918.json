  "text": "Mary Cooper just took too big a risk for Georgie to fail. In Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s first season finale, Sheldon’s mother (played by recurring guest star Zoe Perry) put her house up as collateral so that her older son could secure a bank loan and buy McAllister Auto \u0026 Tire from his father-in-law Jim. “Honey, your whole life I was focused on your brother and sister,” she explained. “It’s your turn.” And while she trusted that Georgie would succeed, she also lit a fire under him when she issued the following warning: “If I do lose the house, me and Missy are moving in with you and Mandy!” Georgie, of course, goes on to become “The Tire King of Texas.” By 2018, when the character first appears in an episode of The Big Bang Theory, he’s the face of Dr. Tire, the most successful tire chain in the Lone Star State. But whether he’s able to keep McAllister Auto \u0026 Tire afloat long enough to rename the business remains unknown. Who’s to say this business doesn’t fail, and Mandy’s husband is forced to start over? And if that were the case, could Mary lose her home? Sure, in the Young Sheldon finale, Sheldon told us that his mother would eventually sell his childhood home. But we also know that Sheldon wasn’t around much after his big move to California, and he was largely unaware of just how much his brother dealt with in his absence. So again, who’s to say that Mary wouldn’t have lied and told Sheldon that she sold the house rather than lost it…? (It wouldn’t be a case of rewriting Big Bang history; it would be more of an amendment.) I brought that question to franchise vet (and Georgie \u0026 Mandy co-creator) Steve Holland, who had this to say about a potential pivot: “Anything’s possible. We haven’t thought that far ahead yet, but one of the things that we liked about [Mary putting the house up as collateral] is that it makes the stakes higher. “Georgie has always had this drive to succeed, but now there’s a lot of pressure on him,” the EP pointed out. “It’s not just his future that he’s risking. It’s also his mother and his sister’s house that he’s risking. We like piling as much on Georgie’s shoulders as we can.” With the conversation focused on Mary’s role in the May 15 finale, I asked Holland whether we’d see even more of Zoe Perry (who appeared in seven out of 22 Season 1 episodes) in Season 2 of the Young Sheldon spinoff. “We’re pretty happy with the way the balance worked out this season,” he answered. “It was always our goal to make this show feel like its own thing, and still get to use those characters from Young Sheldon that we love,” including Raegan Revord’s Missy, Craig T. Nelson’s Dale and Annie Potts’ Meemaw. “We still want to keep the focus on the Georgie \u0026 Mandy cast, but obviously we love having all of them there. But Zoe, especially, is now a part of this story and a part of the store moving forward, so we’ll be seeing her.” What do you think will happen in Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage Season 2 (and beyond)? Do you anticipate that Georgie is on the fast track to success, or will there be a long and winding road ahead? Sound off in Comments. Young Sheldon’s Big Bang Easter Eggs",
