  "text": "The Critics Choice Awards are making a big move, finding a new home on E!, after previously airing on The CW since 2018. Despite the network change, one thing remains the same: Chelsea Handler is back as host for the third consecutive year. The Critics Choice Association (CCA) announced the news, revealing that the 30th annual Critics Choice Awards will air on Sunday, January 12, 2025. (Photo courtesy Critics Choice Association) The event will feature a one-hour preshow — typical for E! — giving fans a chance to catch the red carpet buzz before the ceremony kicks off. This year, viewers can enjoy the entire experience without changing channels, making it an all-in-one event for fans of the glitz and glamour. A Star-Studded Night The show will take place, as usual, at the iconic Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, maintaining its tradition of honoring excellence in film, television, and streaming. Critics in the industry vote on the awards, which celebrate the best performances and achievements on both the big and small screens. CCA CEO Joey Berlin expressed excitement over the new partnership: “We’re thrilled to be working with E! to present our landmark 30th annual Critics Choice Awards.”  He continued, “With the incredible Chelsea Handler returning as our host, we know this special 30th anniversary show is going to be our biggest and best yet.” (Photo Credit: Philip Cheung) “We couldn’t be more excited to be airing the show live on E! and available to stream on Peacock the next day,” he said. Chelsea Handler’s return as host is especially fitting, given her history with E! Her popular late-night show, Chelsea Lately, aired on the network for seven years, from 2007 to 2014. “Returning for the third year to host the Critics Choice Awards has been made even sweeter knowing it will now air on E!,” Handler said. “I feel like I’m returning to my birthplace.” Jen Neal, Executive VP of Live Events and Specials at NBCUniversal Entertainment, echoed the enthusiasm: “E!’s longstanding tradition of being part of Hollywood’s biggest nights makes it the perfect home for the Critics Choice Awards.” She continued, “With Chelsea returning to E! as host of the telecast, this award show will be one of the most anticipated events of the season.” “We look forward to partnering with the CCA in honoring Hollywood’s biggest stars across film and television,” she added. With a new network, a familiar host, and the star-studded atmosphere that fans expect, the 30th annual Critics Choice Awards is shaping up to be a can’t-miss event this awards season.",
