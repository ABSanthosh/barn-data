  "text": "These days, it seems like we’re writing about spinoffs, reboots, remakes, and book-to-film adaptations. Or we’re having to write depressing news about cancellations. Blue Bloods is a series we’ve covered extensively and emotionally. Even though we’ve known the show is ending with its fourteenth season, that doesn’t mean fans are ready to say goodbye. But from the outpouring of protests from the Blue Bloods cast, it’s clear fans aren’t the only ones who aren’t ready for the show to end. (CBS) Blue Bloods is Getting a Cooking Show All of the Blue Bloods actors have spoken out about not being ready for the series to conclude. Especially Tom Selleck. While fans have been trying to save the show, the CBS network is not cooperating. Viewers will have to settle for the show’s upcoming spinoff, which will be coming soon. But we have good news: You can spend more quality time with the Reagans before the show ends. Fans are getting a Blue Bloods cooking show that will teach you how to make the yummy Sunday night dinner every week. You can cook the dish and have your meal while watching the episode. The Reagan family dinner recipes series is the closest fans can get to the real deal. (Courtesy of CBS) Reagan Family Dinner Recipe Series The show, a partnership between CBS and the Walhberg family restaurant, will air on the Blue Bloods YouTube channel. You can join Chef Paul Wahlberg — brother of Donnie (Danny Reagan) — every week as he whips up the delicious Reagan family meal, starting with the dinner we’ll see in the Blue Bloods Season 14 Episode 11 premiere airing Friday, October 18 at 10/9c. Want to know what’s on the menu for this week’s family get-together? Check out the first video in the new YouTube series as Chef Paul teaches you how to put together the famous Reagan family pot roast. Be sure you’re subscribing to the YouTube channel to get access to the videos when they drop every Monday. The YouTube series will have eight episodes, which correspond with the last eight episodes of the Blue Bloods series. While I’m looking forward to getting some delicious new recipes to try, I’m more excited about the prospect of hearing family antidotes of the Walhberg family — especially Donnie and Mark. You’re looking at an OG Walhberg fan. New Kids on the Block, baby! We haven’t received word yet if the other Walhberg brothers will appear on the show to help their chef brother cook. It would be awesome to see Donnie, maybe helping prepare a meal he’s in charge of bringing for Sunday dinner. (CBS / 2023 CBS Broadcasting ) Over to you, Fanatics. How do you like the idea of a Reagan family dinner recipe series that lets you make the same meals eaten by our favorite NYPD family?
