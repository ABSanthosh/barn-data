  "text": "ABC‘s new Golden Bachelor is trading pigskins for rose petals. The senior-themed Bachelor offshoot has been renewed for a second season, TVLine has learned, with former NFL pro Mel Owens as the new leading man. The 66-year-old Owens follows in the footsteps of inaugural Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner, who starred in The Golden Bachelor‘s freshman run in the fall of 2023. (Owens did not compete in The Golden Bachelorette, which aired last fall and saw Gerry’s ex Joan handing out the roses.) Owens was a star linebacker at the University of Michigan and was drafted ninth overall in the first round of the 1981 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He played nine seasons for the Rams and then switched gears after retirement, passing the bar and becoming a lawyer based in Orange County, California. Owens got married and had two sons, but he and his wife later divorced. “Now, after several years as a devoted dad, Owens is ready to rediscover a love rooted in the simple joys of companionship — sharing life’s everyday moments, making plans for the future, and growing stronger together as a couple,” per the official synopsis. “As the Golden Bachelor, he’s eager to meet someone who shares this vision and finally find that perfect teammate he’s been waiting for in his golden years.” Season 1 of The Golden Bachelor — a spinoff of ABC’s Bachelor franchise featuring singles age 60 and over — ended with Gerry proposing to Theresa Nist, and the two got married in a televised special. Unfortunately, Gerry and Theresa split up after just three months of marriage. A premiere date for Season 2 will be announced at a later date. Bachelor Nation, will you be tuning in to see if Mel gets a second chance at love? Give us your thoughts in a comment below.",
