  "text": "The Season 2 finale of Apple TV+’s Surface finally delivered the answer Sophie had been searching for all this time. The night her mother, Emma died, she drove herself and a young Sophie out to the Huntley estate, and that’s where she was shot and killed by… none other than Olivia Huntley, Henry’s wife. Wanting to protect their wealth, the family (led by patriarch William) covered it up. They hid Emma’s car in the woods and buried her body on their estate. The coordinates Sophie found earlier in the season led to the exact location of the car (which was the only outstanding evidence from the incident), but when she had initially found the vehicle, she couldn’t connect the dots. Her memories were still fuzzy. Amnesia, be damned! In yet another twist, Henry didn’t know that Sophie was there the night of the murder, and he’s angry that the whole time he was searching for her, she was right up the road working at the stables, under the name Tess Caldwell. Henry asks his old man if he threatened Emma. Perhaps that’s why she showed up in the middle of night, out of nowhere. William wants nothing to do with the conversation. He tries to shut it down, saying he just wants to go to bed. But then he says something truly horrid: “Your bastard daughter. She’ll never be a Huntley while I’m head of this family.” A gobsmacked Henry then does something unfathomable: He smothers his pops with a pillow, killing him. Later that night when Eliza sees her father sobbing near a large tree on the property, she knows exactly where Emma is buried. Eliza, whose aunt told her the truth, confronts her mom, Olivia, at Quinn’s wedding. Olivia says she was just trying to scare Emma off. Emma was yelling about the family trying to take away her daughter, and Olivia didn’t know who the poor woman was. She didn’t even think the gun was loaded, but when she pulled the trigger, BANG! Emma’s fate was sealed. All Olivia knew was that she had two young children in the house that she had to protect. Eliza later calls Sophie, tells her all about the tree and apologizes for not helping her before. Sophie and James both survive the car wreck from last week’s episode, but James kills the goon that was trying to kill them, so they make a run for it. But once they get to the train station, Sophie decides she’s tired of running. She gives James the flash drive linked to all the money, and he gives her her passport and the rest of the contents from her safe. With sadness and regret in their eyes, they part ways. Sophie and Callum meet up once again and she says she finally wants to tell her story. “All of it.” Her next stop is the police station where she’s ready to bare her soul and set things straight. She’s obviously wanted for questioning in the homicide, but the cops also know she’s wanted in San Francisco for financial crimes. Sophie says she’s ready to tell them everything she knows, including the evidence about Emma’s murder and the location of her body buried on the Huntley estate. The police are reasonably sketched out by Sophie’s multiple aliases, but the big shocker: There are other warrants out for her arrest that she’s not even aware of. “You’ve been running a long time,” the detective tells her. “You ready to tell the truth?” Sophie appears scared and confused, just as the credits begin to roll.
