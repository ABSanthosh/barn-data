  "text": "Much about LeAnn Rimes‘ character on 9-1-1: Nashville remains a mystery, but thanks to a new interview with TVLine sister site Flow Space, at least we know what she’ll smell like! (Yes, you read that correctly.) In preparation for her first series-regular TV role, Rimes reveals that she has created a signature scent “in honor” of her new character — a blend of rosewood, tobacco, leather, black pepper and the wood scent oud. “Fragrance is super-emotional for me,” the singer says, likening it to music in that way. She also dropped an intriguing little nugget about her character — she’s a mother! According to Rimes, the crew on 9-1-1: Nashville found this tough to swallow: “They were like, ‘Oh, wow, we heard you’re going to be playing a mom. What? There’s no way you’re old enough to play a mom!'” Meanwhile, Rimes has been running lines with husband Eddie Cibrian, whose experience with TV procedurals ranges from Third Watch to CSI: Miami. “I get really nervous doing that in front of him, but he’s been super helpful,” she admits. Premiering this fall on ABC, 9-1-1: Nashville stars Chris O’Donnell as Captain Don Sharpe, with Jessica Capshaw as Don’s horse-whispering wife Blythe and Michael Provost as their son Ryan. The cast also includes Hailey Kilgore as singing firefighter Taylor, Juani Feliz as trauma surgeon-turned-firefighter Roxie, Hunter McVey as bad-boy firefighter Blue, and Kimberly Williams-Paisley is a yet-undisclosed role. An exact premiere date has not been announced, but we do know that new episodes will air Thursdays at 9/8c, between 9-1-1 and Grey’s Anatomy. Everything We Know About 9-1-1: Nashville",
