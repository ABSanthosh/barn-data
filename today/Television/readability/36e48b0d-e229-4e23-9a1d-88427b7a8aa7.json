And with that news came a pretty extensive overview for the third season that gets us up to speed on where everyone's at heading into the show's return. But apparently, that wasn't enough because we also have two preview images for  S03E01 \"Closer\" to pass along, including an official look at Jordan (Alex Garfin) and the newest addition to the cast, Michael Bishop (replacing Jordan Elsass as Jonathan Kent): Superman \u0026 Lois — \"Closer\" — Image Number: SML301a_ 0096r1 — Pictured (L-R): Alexander Garfin as Jordan Kent and Michael Bishop as Jonathan Kent — Photo: Colin Bentley/The CW — © 2022 The CW Network, LLC. All Rights Reserved. The third season of The CW's Superman \u0026 Lois opens weeks after Superman's blowout defeat of Ally Allston. Clark (Hoechlin) and Lois (Tulloch) now are working at the Smallville Gazette together and enjoying small-town life. But the Kents' romantic bliss only shines a light on how isolating \"the secret\" can be as Chrissy (Sofia Hasmik) struggles to balance a new love interest and her friendship with Lois. However, Lois' own work-life balance is put to the test when an undercover assignment reveals a deadly foe that promises to change the Kent family forever. Superman would move heaven and earth for his family, but with a villain this merciless, even that might not be enough. Superman \u0026 Lois — \"Closer\" — Image Number: SML301a_ 0224r3 — Pictured (L-R): Tyler Hoechlin as Clark Kent and Elizabeth Tulloch as Lois Lane — Photo: Colin Bentley/The CW — © 2022 The CW Network, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Meanwhile, the Kent boys find themselves being pulled in opposite directions as Jordan (Alex Garfin) discovers what a superhero identity really means and Jonathan (Michael Bishop) searches for purpose beyond the football field. Amid all this upheaval, John Henry (Wolé Parks) is haunted by his doppelgänger's past, leading to dangerous consequences for him and Natalie (Tayler Buck). Lana Lang (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and Kyle (Erik Valdez) redefine their family post-separation, while Sarah (Inde Navarrette) explores what the future holds for her and Jordan now that she knows the truth about his powers. Having learned the hard way that no one else can be trusted to work with Superman, General Samuel Lane (Dylan Walsh) reclaims his post at the Department of Defense, only to face his own conflict in working with his grandson, Jordan.
