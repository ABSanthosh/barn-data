  "text": "The following contains spoilers for The Night Agent‘s Season 2 finale, now streaming on Netflix. Night Action agent Peter Sutherland eked out another big win as Season 2 of Netflix’s The Night Agent came to a close — he and Rose Larkin saved hundreds if not thousands of New Yorkers from being exposed to an insidious bioweapon. But Peter’s most dangerous assignment may lay ahead, as revealed in Season 2’s final moments. Heading into the already-ordered Season 3, Peter has been tasked by Night Action handler Catherine Weaver with essentially working as a double agent, doing the bidding of Jacob Monroe (Louis Herthum) while also reporting back to the FBI on the information broker’s every move as a crony of the likely next President of the United States, Governor Richard Hagan (Ward Horton). Previewing Peter’s Season 3 dilemma, series star Basso tells TVLine, “It’s a dangerous position to be in, and that is not lost on him — like fence-riding between two people that are utilitarian, that are going to use you until they don’t use you. “People will watch this and think, ‘Thank God Peter’s safe!’ when what they should be thinking is, ‘Oh shoot, Peter was safer in the cell,’ because now he’s fence-riding between two very dangerous entities,” the actor adds. Coming out of The Night Agent‘s Season 2 finale, TVLine also spoke with showrunner Shawn Ryan about the the familiar face that popped up, the threat that President Hagan will pose, a clutch recast and more. TVLINE | Secret Service Agent Arrington, who in Season 1 protected Vice President Redfield’s daughter, popped up in the finale to pat down Jacob Monroe ahead of his meeting with presidential candidate Governor Hagan. Was that just a little Easter egg or…?Not only is it a little Easter egg, but I think that might be a little preview for Season 3. Fola Evans-Akingbola will be a part of Season 3. TVLINE | How worried should we be about Hagan, who is now the clear frontrunner?I think anytime you suspect that a leader of a country, whether it’s the United States or a different country, is in it for the wrong reasons or is beholden to somebody unscrupulous in the shadows, you should be very worried. TVLINE | Louis Herthum was great casting, by the way, as Monroe.I’m married to an actress, so I know how anxious auditions are, but most of the roles this season and in Season 3 we’ve casts through auditions. Louis was somebody that I was only tertiarily aware of. I had seen him on Westworld in a very different role, but I wasn’t super aware of him. And then he auditioned and you’re like, “Oh, that’s who that guy needs to be.” We had seen a lot of auditions, and he redefined the character, took a slightly different path with it. I’d like myself and the writers to take a good amount of credit for what you see on-screen, but some credit has to be given to Louis because the way he played it, the way he read it, was different than anyone else’s and was really unique and wonderful. TVLINE | Keon Alexander similarly was so frickin’ intense as Javad.Full disclosure, we were down the road casting someone else in that role knowing that the other actor had a potential conflict that we thought we could work around. When it turned out we couldn’t work around it, we were like, “Oh, no.” And then we saw Keon’s audition, and not that the other guy wouldn’t have been great, but in some ways we got fortunate that it worked out the way it did. Because I thought Keon was tremendous. TVLINE | Unless I missed it, there was no little passing line catching us up on what became of Diane Farr…?We were very lucky to get Savannah Guthrie to do a little cameo for us, where Monroe is watching TV and she’s interviewing one of the presidential candidates and he references “the party of Vice President Redfield and Diane Farr.” So, I think we can assume that justice has found Diane Farr in Season 2. TVLINE | But she’s a bad penny that could probably turn up at some point.Listen, people went to go see Hannibal Lecter in prison for information. Who knows? Who knows when Peter might have to go visit her behind bars to find out something. TVLINE | Lastly, how important was it to you to not have a mole twist in Season 2, as far as a major character was not the friendly that we thought they were?Well, you always want to defy expectations, and I thought that Diane Farr’s turn in Season 1 was a big thing for a lot of the audience. In many ways we wanted to kind of use that not only against the audience — because it’s not like you’re trying to trick the audience, you want the audience to have the available information — but you love it when they’re surprised. But really it was a sort of jujitsu move with Peter, because he had been betrayed by Diane Farr and that makes it much more difficult for him to trust Catherine in Season 2. “Burned once, twice shy” or whatever that phrase is. He’s very much on guard in a way that kind of works against him for a bit. Want scoop on The Night Agent, or for any other TV show?

Because I thought Keon was tremendous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTVLINE | Unless I missed it, there was no little passing line catching us up on what became of Diane Farr…?\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe were very lucky to get Savannah Guthrie to do a little cameo for us, where Monroe is watching TV and she’s interviewing one of the presidential candidates and he references “the party of Vice President Redfield and Diane Farr.” So, I think we can assume that justice has found Diane Farr in Season 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTVLINE | But she’s a bad penny that could probably turn up at some point.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eListen, people went to go see Hannibal Lecter in prison for information.

In many ways we wanted to kind of use that not only \u003cem\u003eagainst\u003c/em\u003e the audience — because it’s not like you’re trying to trick the audience, you want the audience to have the available information — but you love it when they’re surprised. But really it was a sort of jujitsu move with Peter, because he had been betrayed by Diane Farr and that makes it much more difficult for him to trust Catherine in Season 2. “Burned once, twice shy” or whatever that phrase is. He’s very much on guard in a way that kind of works against him for a bit. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cmark\u003eWant scoop on \u003cem\u003eThe Night Agent\u003c/em\u003e, or for any other TV show\u003c/mark\u003e?
