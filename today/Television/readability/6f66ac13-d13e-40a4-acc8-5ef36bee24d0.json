  "text": "NCIS: Origins is the latest entrant into the NCIS world, but contrary to previous spinoffs, the show has a strong connection to the flagship series. Watching it peel back layers into Gibbs’ past life has been fun, especially since it breaks away from the basic procedural format and enriches this beloved world. NCIS: Origins is fun because viewers have sentimental value for Gibbs, filling the hole left by the character’s departure in the main series. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) It’s also refreshing to watch a show that is not set in the current times, where law enforcement must do good old-fashioned investigations by following the evidence.  Sure, modern luxuries like powerful computers and forensics would be helpful, but there is something about having a case board and examining how the clues tell a story. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) NCIS: Origins star Austin Stowell confirmed early on that the Gibbs in the prequel is not similar to the one on NCIS, and this makes sense since people grow and change. “This is someone who’s going through a lot of pain, going through a time in his life where he doesn’t even know if he wants to stick around, quite honestly,” the actor told Entertainment Weekly. Stowell added: “He suffered a tremendous tragedy just four months before we pick up this show and there’s a lot of newness in his life. There’s lots of firsts going on right now.” Therein lies the problem. This Gibbs simply does not pass the vibes check. (Sonja Flemming/CBS) Another Day, More Sadness The show picks up in one of the toughest times in the character’s life, a few months after he lost his family. The NIS job saves Gibbs, but it does not erase his past — which is very sad. Gibbs returns from the army injured, without anything apart from his mortal life, and with so much pain. This pain haunts him when he’s asleep and mocks him when he’s awake. As a result, we spend a lot of time with doleful Gibbs. This is not to minimize what he’s going through in Season 1 and possibly in the future, but it just doesn’t work at this stage for the show. (CBS/Screenshot) Having a lead whose appearance reminds the viewer of one of the worst things that can happen to someone is not fun. Seeing the pain in Gibbs’ eyes and the loss on his face, one can’t help but sympathize. When that’s happening, most of the time, it’s not fun. Correct me if I’m wrong, but we’ve never seen Gibbs smile in NCIS: Origins. How tragic is that? I’ll iterate that the show has all the right to explore this version of Gibbs, but it should have at least done a better job of giving viewers other characters who bring the fun. (Erik Voake/CBS) Explore the Other Characters More, and Make Them Fun For a show that deals with murders and other depraved things humans can do, it needs to lean more into some comedic breaks and keep them coming. NCIS: Origins must avoid tying every character to Gibbs because he drags them down. Misery loves company, and almost everyone becomes miserable after interacting with him. The only fun character to appear so far in NCIS: Origins Season 1 was Gibbs’ landlady, Ruth. Her attitude might not be the best, but she breaks the monotony of misery which dominates the show.\\ Ironically, she also doesn’t last long once Gibbs comes into her life, but in all fairness, it’s not his fault this time. One character cannot be everything for a TV show. At this stage in his life, Gibbs has no room for fun. (Erik Voake/CBS) Using the other characters to lighten the mood a little would be wise. Mary Jo is right there! Tyla Abercrumbie did not leave The Chi for her not to be given something funny! If that doesn’t work, NCIS: Origins picked an awful time and place to pick things up. Over to you, NCIS Fanatics. Is Gibbs’ constant dismalness doing a disservice to the show? What other aspects are you enjoying so much that you might overlook this if it’s a problem for you?  Chime in in the comments. Watch NCIS: Origins Online",
