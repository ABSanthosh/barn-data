  "text": "Murder in a Small Town is one of the few procedurals that spends as much time developing the romance of their lead characters as it does on solving cases. While some people love the cozy mystery vibe, others would prefer the series focus on developing stronger murder arcs. Let’s discuss if combining both can be successful or if this is a recipe for disaster. (James Dimmock/ FOX) Kristin Kreuk and Rossif Sutherland Teased Karl and Cassandra’s Relationship as the Main Draw Kristin Kreuk and Rossif Sutherland teased that the murders are only part of the show. The scenic coastal town pulls audiences in, and many are shocked by how many murders piled up along the coastline. The series is also about love, community, and this small town. It examines the heartbeats behind the murders as the two fall in love and see how these cases and their personal lives affect their relationship. Their relationship is complex. He’s recently divorced with two teenage daughters. Cassandra is fiercely independent and used to being single. Neither was hopeful for romance when they signed up for a dating app. She did it to appease her friends; he wanted to please his daughters. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) They were pleasantly surprised that the conversation flowed so well and connected instantly. However, it almost seemed like Karl and Cassandra got together too quickly. One minute, they met for a drink, and the next, they fell into bed together. While we love sexy couples, slow-burn couples with emotional build-up often work better. It felt like once Karl and Cassandra fell for each other, now they have all sorts of obstacles to overcome, beginning with being in love later in life. It’s not easy trusting someone after you’ve been burned, and Casandra was afraid, especially when she and Karl argued about George’s case in Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 1. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Neither had clear expectations yet. Watching their relationship evolve has been one of the most exciting parts of the series. Cassandra has learned the challenges of dating a cop, and Karl appreciates dating a fierce, opinionated woman like her. Do the Lead Actors Have Chemistry Together? Kristin Kreuk probably has more experience opposite lead actors and is well-versed in playing the girl next door. As mentioned, Cassandra often feels like a grown-up version of Lana Lang. She’s bubbly and popular, with an innate skepticism about her. Karl is a brooding workaholic, and those tendencies probably cost him his marriage. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Yet, Karl is a hopeless romantic and utterly blunt about his fascination with Cassandra, but not in a creepy way. Sutherland and Kreuk created an awkward first date and, ideally, a thoughtful connection between two people who were initially wary of falling in love. Their chemistry sizzled as they shared their first kiss, like the two had known each other for years. While I think a slow burn would have worked better for them since the first season is only eight episodes, I understand why the series ramped up their relationship. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Is the Weekly Case Format Working, or Would a Longer Arc Be Better? Many procedurals use a case-of-the-week format but also include an overlying season arc. Murder in a Small Town has based each episode on one of L. R. Wright’s nine-book series about Karl Alberg. They are scheduled to cover six books this season, leaving only three books of material for additional seasons. While I appreciate faithful book-to-screen adaptations, using the heart of the novels and only some material may have worked better. The cases are interesting since they often involve long-time feuds or family drama. Generally, these are not hardened psychopaths but people committing desperate or passionate crimes. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) However, some cases, especially the premiere, would have been better if they had lasted more than one episode. “The Suspect” was one of the most exciting cases and needed more time to breathe, even if it was only a full two-hour episode instead of 90 minutes. It felt like there were some loose ends with George Wilcox that viewers wanted cleared up. However, Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 3 switched gears and focused more on the mystery, mainly because of having a big-name guest star like Stana Katic, who gave a chilling performance. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) In many ways, that worked, except it took too long to get to the murder, and there were hardly any scenes of Karl discussing this case with Cassandra. They must find a happy medium between a Hallmark cozy mystery and a fast-paced procedural. The Guest-Stars Pull the Audience In So far, the guest stars are one of the critical aspects pulling the audience in. The series has featured many big-name actors, including James Cromwell, Stana Katic, and Erica Durance, who will appear in Episode Four. Having two Smallville actors reunite could be the biggest draw for the series. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Having these actors appear as the victims or the suspects entices viewers to tune in for at least one week, and hopefully, they will return to watch more of the series. Why are you watching Murder in a Small Town? Do you ship Karl and Cassandra? Do you prefer the case-centric weeks or only tune in when your favorite actor guest stars?
