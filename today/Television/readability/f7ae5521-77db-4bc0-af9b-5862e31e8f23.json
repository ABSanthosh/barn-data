  "text": "Jennifer Carpenter should be proud. Her character that audiences fell in love with over Dexter‘s nine-season run is in good f–king hands. In the second episode of Dexter: Original Sin, the foul-mouthed Debra Morgan (Molly Brown) is as angsty as ever, but with good reason. While Dexter starts his fancy new internship, Deb is feeling on the outs of her familial trio, expressing her feelings in the only way she knows how: with curse words. She tells a friend: “My dad and my brother are so far up each other’s asses, they don’t even know I exist!” Despite everything Deb has going on — from holding her own on the volleyball team to worrying about her dad’s health — the “under-appreciated daughter” (her words) can’t stop jabbing at her family left and right. Unfortunately, it’ll be decades before she learns the truth about her brother’s gory habits, but Deb still can’t help but feel shafted as the prequel’s first few episodes roll out. “My favorite thing about my relationship with Dexter throughout the series is that when you meet Deb and Dexter in the original, Dexter knows how to at least put on the front of being a good brother and here, he’s just messing up all over the place,” Brown tells TVLine in the video above, as she and Christian Slater discuss their favorite filthy Deb lines. “She reacts in rebellion in the way that a lot of teenagers do. You see Deb engaging in a lot of rebellious teenage acts through the show, things that cop Deb would not be OK with.” [Laughs] Even Harry recognizes that his daughter is feeling left out. Ignored, even. “I know I should include you more,” he tells her, in an admission to all the time he’s been spending focused on Dexter and the code. Deb barks back saying that the most time they’ve spent together as a family was when Harry was nearly dying in the hospital. “Now every day is bring your son to work day!” she yells. “At least when mom was here, I had someone.” (Aw, give her a hug, Harry!) While his younger sister continues struggling to find her place in the world (and in her home), Dexter is thrilled to learn everything he can from his new boss Tanya. (Watch our interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar here.) When she gives him access to the records room, he gets free rein to dig through all of Miami’s unsolved murder cases. So when Batista tells him about a loan shark named Tony Ferrer who was responsible for the death of a woman whose son borrowed money from him, it gets Dex thinking. Now that he’s tasted blood, his Dark Passenger is restless. And he just may have his next target in mind. Do you feel for young Debra, and how are you liking Brown’s performance so far? Sound off in the comments below!",
