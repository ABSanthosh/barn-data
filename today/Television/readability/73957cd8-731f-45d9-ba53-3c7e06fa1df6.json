The Simpsons Funday Football, an animated MNF game transformed in real-time into the world of the Fox comedy, will air live Monday, Dec. 9 at 8 pm ET on Disney+, ESPN+ and, on mobile, with NFL+. “With Springfield’s Atoms Stadium as the setting, The Simpsons Funday Football will be a true family affair as Bart Simpson sides with Joe Burrow and the Bengals while Homer aligns with Dak Prescott and the Cowboys,” reads the official announcement. “For most of the game, Bart and Homer will let their new Bengals and Cowboys teammates manage the action, but the iconic father and son duo won’t sit on the sidelines for the entire game. Each will select key opportunities to play offense and/or defense, replacing a player and joining his other 10 teammates on the field.” Additionally, cast members Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner and Yeardley Smith will lend their voices to several characters in prerecorded bits and skits. Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * Virgin River executive producer and Sullivan’s Crossing showrunner Roma Roth is reteaming with Virgin River/Sullivan’s Crossing author Roma Roth to adapt her Thunder Point novels into a TV series, our sister site Deadline reports. No network/streamer is attached yet. * Deborah Norville (Inside Edition) will host the syndicated game show The Perfect Line, which will be shopped by CBS Media Ventures next year, with an eye toward a fall 2025 premiere, our sister site Variety reports. In the trivia game, contestants are given a category and then arrange events, items or people in order to create “the perfect line,” with the last player standing having the chance to win $10,000. Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
