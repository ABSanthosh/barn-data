Amazon Fire TV StickOn Sale 55% off What Is an Amazon Fire TV Stick? The Amazon Fire TV Stick offers endless entertainment in just one little gadget! Nowadays, TVs are practically useless little monitors. So if your TV isn’t a smart TV, you’ll need an attachment to bring all your streaming apps to your screen — including Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock and more. You can also access live and free TV with an Amazon Fire Stick with subscriptions to Sling and Youtube TV, among others. Plus, even if you do have a Smart TV, an Amazon Fire TV Stick offers fast starts and easy navigation, likely offering smoother streaming and a better user experience than on your TV alone. How to Connect the Amazon Fire Stick to TV Amazon makes their streaming stick extremely easy to use. Here are step-by-step instructions for using the Amazon Fire TV Stick: Plug the device directly into your HDTV, or use the included HDMI extender. (Amazon recommends using the HDMI ARC port with Alexa Home Theater.) Plug into wall outlet. Connect to Internet and start streaming! Is the Amazon Fire TV Stick Worth It? The Amazon streaming stick has a 4.7 star rating on Amazon with over 452 thousand reviews. It’s one of Amazon’s most powerful streaming sticks — and at $17.99, it’s pretty much a no-brainer. Do You Pay Monthly for the Amazon Fire TV Stick? No! The streaming stick is simply an accessory for accessing your streaming subscriptions. With the stick, you will still have to pay for streamers like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and more in order to use them. Another perk? You’ll receive a six-month subscription to MGM+.
