  "text": "I’m OK with Yellowstone being over, but I’m not OK with not regularly seeing Beth (Kelly Reilly) and Rip (Cole Hauser) on my screen. There’s something about slow-burn romances told over a solid arc that makes the endgame so much more worthwhile. Beth and Rip experienced many bumps in the road, but somehow, they always ended up in each other’s arms. (Courtesy of Paramount Network) Yellowstone did a remarkable job of fleshing out this couple through flashbacks and beautiful scenes in the present-day storyline that highlighted their nuances and why they work so well together. When I think of Yellowstone, I think of Beth and Rip. That’s not to say Monica and Kayce aren’t a great couple. (Paramount Network/Danno Nell) It’s just that Taylor Sheridan had an immense adoration for Beth and Rip because there was so much emphasis on the finer details of their relationship, which built a solid foundation for them to come back for whatever life threw at them. I don’t believe in fate, but I think that something brought them together for a wealth of reasons, and I dread to think where they would have ended up in Yellowstone if it wasn’t together. Beth and Rip Beat the Odds The series had a high death count for a relatively short run, but what surprised me was how Beth and Rip’s scenes cut through the cultural zeitgeist. Yellowstone isn’t as big here in the UK as in the U.S., but I remember being taken aback when my friend showed me her phone and asked, “Which show is this?” (Paramount Network) Curious, I wondered how she saw the video, and she said countless of their scenes were showing up across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. It highlights that sometimes viewers don’t even need to watch a show to be relatively knowledgeable about a well-known couple. Kelly and Cole are given electric scenes that challenge them as actors and allow them to set Beth and Rip apart from more conventional TV couples. Beth and Rip get to know each other and know what makes the other tick. More importantly, if they have something on their minds, they try to avoid talking about it. (Emerson Miller/Paramount) Despite Yellowstone Season 5 limping to the finish line with unsatisfying final storylines, Beth and Rip remained the glue that held the whole thing together. Had their bond and presence not been felt, I dread how the final episodes would have been received because the plot was thin and dilapidated by the end. Beth and Rip Will Be Back in the Yellowstone Universe The good news is that Kelly and Cole are poised to share the screen again in an unconfirmed Yellowstone spinoff. At the end of Yellowstone Season 5 Episode 14, they found happiness in a new location with their own land. (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Carter followed them to chart this next chapter, so all three will likely be on-screen again before we know it. Watching how Beth and Rip react to no longer being tied to the Yellowstone ranch could be a compelling way to see how their relationship navigates this next stage in their lives. Something tells me they won’t have to look hard to find trouble, but they’ll surely back each other up when the going gets tough. That’s a true couple right there. Watch Yellowstone Online",
