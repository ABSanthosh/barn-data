Kennedy Jr. has said the cause is an \"environmental toxin\" and has vowed to get to the bottom of it. But we already have lots of science on this — so what does that research tell us? We talk with epidemiologist Professor Brian Lee, Associate Professor Karen Heffler, clinical psychologist Professor Catherine Lord, epidemiologist Professor Maureen Durkin, and Senior Science Researcher Dena Gassner. We want to hear your ideas for new episodes of Science Vs! Tell us via: Instagram at science_vs Bluesky at sciencevs X at @sciencevs  Email at sciencevsteam@gmail.com Voicemail at +1(774) 481-1238‬  Find our transcript here: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsAutism  In this episode, we cover: (00:00) Rates of autism are going up (03:33) The hunt for the cause of the ‘autism epidemic’ (13:43) Could screen time be causing autism? (20:10) The changing definition of autism (27:48) Could this explain the rise in autism? This episode was produced by Meryl Horn, with help from Wendy Zukerman, Ekedi Fausther-Keeys, Michelle Dang, and Rose Rimler. We’re edited by Blythe Terrell. Fact checking, research assistance, and consulting by Erica Akiko Howard. Mix and sound design by Bobby Lord. Music written by Emma Munger, So Wylie, Peter Leonard, Bumi Hidaka and Bobby Lord.

    "description": "A lot of influencers are going on all-meat diets, saying that all this meat is clearing up inflammation, healing their guts, and sharpening their focus. But others say, hold up — this diet is sure to lead to heart disease, cancer, and even scurvy. So we’re asking: Is it possible to live on meat alone? Is there any benefit to the carnivore diet? And what are the risks? We talk to nutritionist Prof. Caryn Zinn and internist Dr. Adrian Soto-Mota.  Find our transcript here: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsCarnivore  In this episode, we cover: (00:00) Carnivores Bring the Meat (04:28) They’re Gonna Get Scurvy, Right? (13:09) Fiber? Cholesterol? Heart Disease? Cancer? (20:11) A Miracle Diet? (22:31) Are Plants the Enemy? (25:57) Is it Just Keto? (27:50) Weight Loss (28:50) Should You Go Carnivore?

    "description": "Brian Cox and Robin Ince blast off into a cosmic controversy as they ask, should humanity become an interplanetary species? At Harwell Campus, a space science innovation hub, they’re joined by astronaut Tim Peake, biologist and Royal Society prize winning author Kelly Weinersmith, and comedian Alan Davies to explore the science, ethics, and challenges of settling on Mars or on the Moon. Are we bold pioneers venturing into the unknown, or just reckless tenants abandoning Earth in search of a new abode? Our panel discuss whether space settlement is inevitable in humanity’s near future and how pushing the boundaries of space exploration could make extra-terrestrial travel more accessible to the masses. From sourcing materials, to surviving radiation, and even growing potatoes from poo, they tackle what it really would take to live a life beyond Earth!Series Producer: Melanie Brown Assistant Producer: Olivia Jani Executive Producer: Alexandra FeachemBBC Studios Audio Production",

Brian Cox and Robin Ince invite a lively panel of celebrity guests to pose their burning scientific questions to a top-tier team of scientists. Mel Giedroyc is tunnelling into the world of engineering, asking how we build and operate trains under some of the world’s busiest cities? Mel has found a new best friend in, Isabel Coman, Director of Engineering at Transport for London, who is here to guide her through the particulars of subterranean transport systems. Deborah Meaden, entrepreneur and investor, is delving into the emotional lives of animals - do our furry, feathered, and scaly companions have feelings like grief in the way we do? Helping her to sniff out the science of animal emotions is Dr Liz Paul, a comparative psychologist from the University of Bristol. Comedian Nish Kumar wants to know - are we totally screwed when it comes to climate change, or is there still hope? Helping him unpack tipping points, rising temperatures, and how we might turn the tide is climate scientist Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading.Series Producer: Melanie Brown Assistant Producer: Olivia Jani Executive Producer: Alexandra FeachemBBC Studios Audio Production",

    "description": "In part two of our chat with Dr. Heather Ford, we delve deeper into the hidden dynamics of Wikipedia — the world’s largest encyclopedia and 8th most visited website, run largely by volunteers. We explore how pages are updated in real time, yet controversial topics like Indigenous place names often face delays and heated edit wars. Dr. Ford explains how this can lead editors to walk away, raising concerns about who gets to shape history. We also unpack the platform's lack of diversity and the growing influence of AI — with up to 90% of internet content projected to be AI-generated by the end of 2025.

    "description": "I'm joined by Dr. Heather Ford, ARC Future Fellow and Professor in the School of Communications at UTS, to explore the fascinating world of Wikipedia. Inspired by her article “We analysed 35,000 Wikipedia entries about Australian places. Some of them sanitise history” in The Conversation, we dive deep into the strengths and shortcomings of one of the internet’s most beloved resources. We unpack how Wikipedia works behind the scenes: who edits it, how “edit wars” break out, and why it remains such a radical platform — a place where history can be written in real time, sometimes even before events unfold. Together, we question whether Wikipedia offers an honest account of Australia’s past, particularly when it comes to Indigenous history.

    "description": "Named after a beast from Greek mythology, the harpy eagle is widely considered to be the most powerful bird of prey due to its strong legs and huge talons. With a crown of feathers atop its head, and known for eating monkeys and sloths, this regal-looking raptor dominates the rainforest canopies across much of South and Central America. Presenter Adam Hart looks into the folklore and cultural importance of these imposing birds, as well as finding out why these apex predators of the treetops are having to increasingly search for ground-dwelling prey such as armadillos. He also hears how harpy eagle researchers were the pioneers for biological applications of GPS in order to study and track these animals in the dense rainforest.Contributors:Dr. Helena Aguiar-Silva, biologist and associate research scientist at the National Institute for Amazonian Research and a member of Projeto Harpia Brasil.Dr. Eduardo Alvarez founder of a non-profit organisation called EarthMatters.org, to concentrate on the study and conservation of harpy eagles and to preserve their rainforest habitat.Presenter: Professor Adam Hart Producer: Jonathan BlackwellImage: Harpy eagle and nest with chick Credit: João Marcos Rosa",

    "description": "Many of us believe that hard work and persistence are the key to achieving our goals. But is that true when it comes to the pursuit of happiness? This week, we revisit a conversation with psychologist Iris Mauss, who explains why happiness can seem more elusive the harder we chase it, and what we can do instead to build a lasting sense of contentment. Then, we bring you the latest edition of our segment \"Your Questions Answered.\" Behavioral scientist Alison Wood Brooks answers listener questions on how to be a better conversationalist — from what to do when the other person isn't contributing, to how to stop others from interrupting.Miss our original episodes with Alison Wood Brooks? They're called \"We Need to Talk\" and \"The Conversations that Bring Us Closer.\" Do you have follow-up questions, thoughts, or ideas about the pursuit of happiness after listening to our conversation with Iris Mauss? If you'd be comfortable sharing your thoughts with the Hidden Brain audience, please record a voice memo on your phone and email it to us at ideas@hiddenbrain.org. Use the subject line \"happiness.\" Thanks!",

    "description": "Erythritol, a widely used sugar substitute found in many low-carb and sugar-free products, may not be as harmless as once believed. New research from the University of Colorado Boulder reveals that even small amounts of erythritol can harm brain blood vessel cells, promoting constriction, clotting, and inflammation—all of which may raise the risk of stroke.",

    "description": "Scientists have cracked a century-old physics mystery by detecting magnetic signals in non-magnetic metals using only light and a revamped laser technique. Previously undetectable, these faint magnetic “whispers” are now measurable, revealing hidden patterns of electron behavior. The breakthrough could revolutionize how we explore magnetism in everyday materials—without bulky instruments or wires—and may open new doors for quantum computing, memory storage, and advanced electronics.",
