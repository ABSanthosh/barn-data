    "description": "This might sound corny, but the relationship between maize and humanity is essential. We rely on corn—globally, more maize is grown than wheat or rice—and, in turn, corn is utterly dependent on us, to the extent that it's lost the ability to reproduce without our help. But corn's wild ancestor is such an unappetizing weed that, for decades, archaeologists couldn't believe today's juicy cobs were all descended from it. From this unpromising beginning, we've got a story that involves empires, vampires, and generations of women chained to the (literal) grindstone. Pass the popcorn and settle in as we explore the past, present, and future of corn—and the many delicious ways Mesoamericans have invented to get their daily dose of vitamin T(ortilla). Plus: do blue and yellow corn chips actually taste different? And what does it mean for your relationship status if you can't get a tortilla to puff? Learn more about your ad choices.

This method, capable of reducing development time from years to weeks, was successfully tested on known and patient-specific tumor targets. Using virtual safety screenings to avoid harmful side effects, the platform represents a leap forward in personalized medicine.",

This innovation could make quantum networks far more scalable, stable, and compact. By harnessing the power of graph theory, the team simplified the design of these quantum metasurfaces, enabling them to generate entangled photons and perform sophisticated quantum operations — all on a chip thinner than a human hair. It's a radical leap forward for room-temperature quantum technology and photonics.",

    "description": "What does it mean to be stoic? Many of us assume it means you have a stiff upper lip, or that you suppress your emotions. That's what Massimo Pigliucci thought — until he started to peruse a book called Meditations. It was written nearly two thousand years ago by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. But Massimo, now a philosopher, says Meditations, and Stoic philosophy more broadly, offer wisdom that continues to speak to our lives. This week, we explore Stoic ideas and what they tell us about a life well lived. Do you have follow-up questions and ideas about stoicism after listening to this episode?

This week, we revisit a conversation with psychologist Iris Mauss, who explains why happiness can seem more elusive the harder we chase it, and what we can do instead to build a lasting sense of contentment. Then, we bring you the latest edition of our segment \"Your Questions Answered.\" Behavioral scientist Alison Wood Brooks answers listener questions on how to be a better conversationalist — from what to do when the other person isn't contributing, to how to stop others from interrupting.Miss our original episodes with Alison Wood Brooks?

    "description": "This week, two conversations from the archives about parts of the world that are imperceptible to us, verging on almost unthinkable. We start with a moment of uncertainty in physics. Inspired by an essay written by physicist and novelist Alan Lightman, called The Accidental Universe (https://zpr.io/4965dUdNqtpQ), taken from a book of the same name. Former Radiolab co-host Robert Krulwich pays a visit to Brian Greene to ask if the latest developments in theoretical physics spell a crisis for science. He finds that we've reached the limit of what we can see and test, and we’re left with mathematical equations that can't be verified by experiments or observation.Then, come along as we kick rocks. And end up tumbling down a philosophical rabbit hole where the solid things around us might not be solid at all. We talk to Jim Holt, author of Why Does the World Exist? (https://zpr.io/UqHpLnDx2QNx) who points out that when you start slicing and sleuthing in subatomic particle land, trying to get to the bottom of what makes matter, you mostly find empty space. Your hand, your chair, the floor, it's all made up of mostly nothing. Robert and Jim go toe-to-toe over whether the universe is made up of solid bits and pieces of stuff, or a cloudy foundation that more closely resembles thoughts and ideas.Signup for our newsletter!!

    "description": "Brian Cox and Robin Ince blast off into a cosmic controversy as they ask, should humanity become an interplanetary species? At Harwell Campus, a space science innovation hub, they’re joined by astronaut Tim Peake, biologist and Royal Society prize winning author Kelly Weinersmith, and comedian Alan Davies to explore the science, ethics, and challenges of settling on Mars or on the Moon. Are we bold pioneers venturing into the unknown, or just reckless tenants abandoning Earth in search of a new abode? Our panel discuss whether space settlement is inevitable in humanity’s near future and how pushing the boundaries of space exploration could make extra-terrestrial travel more accessible to the masses. From sourcing materials, to surviving radiation, and even growing potatoes from poo, they tackle what it really would take to live a life beyond Earth!Series Producer: Melanie Brown Assistant Producer: Olivia Jani Executive Producer: Alexandra FeachemBBC Studios Audio Production",

    "description": "In part two of our chat with Dr. Heather Ford, we delve deeper into the hidden dynamics of Wikipedia — the world’s largest encyclopedia and 8th most visited website, run largely by volunteers. We explore how pages are updated in real time, yet controversial topics like Indigenous place names often face delays and heated edit wars. Dr. Ford explains how this can lead editors to walk away, raising concerns about who gets to shape history. We also unpack the platform's lack of diversity and the growing influence of AI — with up to 90% of internet content projected to be AI-generated by the end of 2025.

    "description": "I'm joined by Dr. Heather Ford, ARC Future Fellow and Professor in the School of Communications at UTS, to explore the fascinating world of Wikipedia. Inspired by her article “We analysed 35,000 Wikipedia entries about Australian places. Some of them sanitise history” in The Conversation, we dive deep into the strengths and shortcomings of one of the internet’s most beloved resources. We unpack how Wikipedia works behind the scenes: who edits it, how “edit wars” break out, and why it remains such a radical platform — a place where history can be written in real time, sometimes even before events unfold. Together, we question whether Wikipedia offers an honest account of Australia’s past, particularly when it comes to Indigenous history. This is a two-parter so be sure to tune in next week for part 2. Connect with Dr. Heather Ford on Linkedin https://hblog.org/",
