But Yosuke Kaifu wanted to “know the story behind those lines”.In a detailed reenactment of the perilous journey, Kaifu, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University Museum of the University of Tokyo, and his collaborators demonstrated how palaeolithic people could have travelled huge distances with the tools, materials, techniques and navigational skills available at the time. They describe their feat in Science Advances on 25 June,The study highlights that “these journeys are definitely much more epic than we give them credit for”, says Eleanor Scerri, an archaeological scientist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.Palaeolithic sites in the Ryukyu Islands — a chain that extends over 1,100 kilometres and includes Okinawa — contain human remains and stone tools dating back to more than 30,000 years ago, suggesting that their early settlers successfully navigated there from Taiwan, crossing the Kuroshio, one of the world’s strongest ocean currents.But exactly how they did this remains a mystery. The remains of any boats have long since rotted away, so researchers instead try to recreate voyages experimentally, using the kinds of tools and materials that humans were known to have access to at the time. Kaifu and his team began working on the Ryuku crossing in 2013, partly financing their research with crowdfunding. Their first attempts to cross on rafts made of reeds or bamboo were unsuccessful.Slash and burn",
