Alers/NASAJuly 24, 2025Fifteen years ago, a group of scientists made a bold claim in Science, one of the world’s most prominent research journals: They had discovered a microorganism that could survive using chemistry different from any known life-form.On Thursday, the top editors of Science formally retracted the 2010 paper, saying it was fundamentally flawed. The journal’s editors did not accuse the paper’s authors of misconduct or fraud. Instead they said they were motivated to conclude a chapter of scientific debate that had roiled research institutions and the lives of academics who once were brought under intense scrutiny by social media and bloggers.The paper’s authors disagree with the decision to retract the paper. Their defenders, including science officials at NASA, which helped fund the original research, say the move is outside the norms of what usually leads to the striking down of a published paper.“The change in policy at the journal, Science, to retract research publications due to a disconnection between the data and the published conclusions is unprecedented and upends the current standards in the research and scientific fields,” said Nicky Fox, the associate administrator of the science mission directorate at the space agency.Dr. Fox added that the agency encouraged the journal “to reconsider its retraction.”In 2009, researchers collected a microbe from Mono Lake, a salty and alkaline body of water in California. In the lab, they said, they found it could replace phosphorus, a key chemical for all known biological beings, with arsenic, an element that is typically toxic. If the discovery were confirmed, it would change scientists’ fundamental conceptions about life on Earth, and in the cosmos. They named the microbe GFAJ-1.The finding traveled beyond the terrain of academic conferences and scientific journals, amplified by teasers from NASA and the journal. Following a livestreamed NASA news conference, the discovery picked up the hashtag #arseniclife on Twitter, then a nascent social media platform, which other scientists used to express serious concerns with the study’s methodology and conclusions. Eventually, a general scientific consensus emerged against the claim that the microbe incorporates arsenic into its basic functioning.But as social-media and blog posts criticized the experiments and the scientists who had performed them, viral negative attention came to focus on Felisa Wolfe-Simon, an early-career scientist who had become the face of the discovery and was the paper’s lead author.ImageDr. Wolfe-Simon in a research lab library in Oakland, Calif. She has returned to academic research after a lengthy pause.Credit...Marissa Leshnov for The New York TimesThe internet and scientific critics largely moved on, and so did the journal. While some researchers called for the paper’s retraction, Science instead published technical critiques of the finding.Then last year, Science’s stance shifted. A reporter contacted Science for a New York Times article about the legacy of the #arseniclife affair.That inquiry “convinced us that this saga wasn’t over, that unless we wanted to keep talking about it forever, we probably ought to do some things to try to wind it down,” said Holden Thorp, editor in chief of Science since 2019. “And so that’s when I started talking to the authors about retracting.”Around that time, Dr. Wolfe-Simon was beginning to return to academic research after a lengthy pause.“I listed out all the reasons why I’m not interested in initiating retraction,” she said of her reply to a November 2024 email from Dr. Thorp. “So then we go back and forth.”The paper’s co-authors agreed, and they continue to stand by their work. NASA, which funded the research, also sent a letter expressing concern about the proposed retraction in November 2024 to officials from Science and its publisher, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, according to Becky McCauley Rench, a NASA astrobiology program scientist.“We were all very much in agreement that retraction was an absolutely inappropriate thing to do,” said David Draper, former deputy chief scientist and scientific integrity officer at NASA headquarters, who took part in the discussions.Following meetings with both the paper’s authors and NASA, and discussions with the Committee on Publication Ethics about its retraction guidelines, Science’s editors decided in recent weeks to move forward with the retraction.Dr. Thorp said that in the past, scientific papers were typically retracted in circumstances involving fraud or research misconduct. But he said current standards leave room for a journal to retract a study based on error by the researchers, which Science says it has done in 10 cases since 2019.“If the editors determine that a paper’s reported experiments do not support its key conclusions, even if no fraud or manipulation occurred, a Retraction is considered appropriate,” the journal said in its retraction notice.ImageHolden Thorp, the editor in chief of the journal Science since 2019.Credit...Octavio Jones for The New York TimesAs justification for the retraction, the Science statement cites the technical objections published alongside the paper, and failed replications of the findings in 2012.Dr. Wolfe-Simon notes that she and her colleagues responded to the technical objections at the time. She and another co-author, Ariel Anbar, a professor at the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, have criticized the conditions of the replication experiments.A separate blog post by the Science editors also states that the original experiment could have left the samples contaminated with arsenic. “Given the evidence that the results were based on contamination, Science believes that the key conclusion of the paper is based on flawed data,” the blog post says.Dr. Anbar and Dr. Wolfe-Simon object to the highlighting of that claim in the blog post but not in the official retraction. They say they have also responded to the claim in the past, and they pointed to other lines of evidence that do not depend on the supposedly contaminated data. Dr. Thorp replied that the level of detail in the retraction notice is standard.Dr. Anbar, however, did note his agreement with one of Science’s conclusions. “They’ve been very clear that there’s no misconduct,” he said.All but one of the researchers signed a letter, which Science published alongside the retraction notice, registering their objection and standing by their reported data. “Disputes about the conclusions of papers, including how well they are supported by the available evidence, are a normal part of the process of science,” they wrote.Science’s critics say this particular process of retraction has been unusual in its one-off re-examination of an old result. “If we were to retract any paper that is judged in the subsequent years to have drawn incorrect conclusions, we would have to eliminate at least three quarters of the entire scientific literature,” Dr. Draper said.He added that zeroing in on the #arseniclife paper could affect the scientific community more broadly.“Scientists are going to say, ‘Hey, that could be me next,’” he said.Dr. Wolfe-Simon said she was planning a personal response to the retraction.“I made a bunch of scarlet letter Rs as pins that I’m handing out to students and colleagues who would like one,” she said.Related ContentAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
