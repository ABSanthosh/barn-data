  "description": "Last week, antivaxxer Toby Rogers published two very long screeds attacking the EBM paradigm. Cleverly, echoed some of our criticisms of EBM but twisted them so that they are science denying, rather than affirming—just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"gold standard science.\" The post An antivaxxer attacks the evidence-based medicine paradigm: Echoes of RFK Jr.’s “gold standard science” first appeared on Science-Based Medicine.",
