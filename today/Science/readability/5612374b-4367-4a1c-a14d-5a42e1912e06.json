But a study, published Friday in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science is the first to show that a pod led by the 50-year-old Moctezuma has repeated the behavior at least four times. The finding suggests that the animals may be seeking out whale sharks.Of the four documented events from 2018 through 2024, the large Moctezuma was present for three of them. And the fourth incident was carried out by killer whales that he is known to associate with.You can find orcas in every ocean on Earth. Killer whales are actually the largest member of the dolphin family, but because dolphins are in fact a branch of the whale order, you might say that all dolphins are whales, while not all whales are dolphins. In a similar vein, whale sharks are not whales at all, but sharks, though like some whales, they are filter feeders.While there is only one species of killer whale, scientists have documented that many orca populations are adapted to particular habitats. Each appears to prey on specific animals, including whale calves, seals, salmon, rays and great white sharks.Whale sharks are gentle giants, but the coordinated assaults from Moctezuma and his pod are brutal, scientists report. The orcas ram the giant fish from below, flipping them over to induce a catatonic state. They also bite the whale sharks near their genitals, which causes them to bleed out before spiraling lifelessly into the abyss.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
