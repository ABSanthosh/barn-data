  "text": "Dr. Sunetra Gupta on SARS-CoV-2 An article from September 2020 titled Let Children Be Exposed To Viruses, Says Professor Gupta said: Professor Sunetra Gupta, who has been a leading critic of the cost of lockdown, says she welcomes the return of schools as children “if anything… would benefit from being exposed to this and other seasonal coronaviruses”. Gupta, who is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, told The Londoner that alongside huge social and educational benefits, the “evidence is mounting that early exposure to these various coronaviruses is what enables people to survive them”. The virus was less than a year old when Dr. Gupta, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, said that. There was no mounting “evidence” that early exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was beneficial for children, though there was evidence that it was dangerous for some of them. The next month, Dr. Gupta would partner with a pro-tobacco child labor advocate and two other pro-infection doctors who also made things up to write the Great Barrington Declaration. As SBM readers know, the GBD advocated for the mass infection of unvaccinated youth to hasten the arrival of herd immunity and shield more vulnerable adults. Because Dr. Gupta sought out TV cameras while doctors were busy treating COVID patients, there are many opportunities to hear her in her own words. You can watch her proposal to use unvaccinated children as human shields. Even though SARS-CoV-2 was brand new, Dr. Gupta felt comfortable with her plan to get rid of the virus by spreading the virus for two reasons. Firstly, she was convinced that immunity to it was durable and long-lasting. Second, she felt that the pandemic was “on its way out” in May 2020 and that the infection fatality rate (IFR) was close to 1 in 10,000. This low IFR which was mathematically impossible at the time. Things didn’t work out that way, unfortunately. Dr. Sunetra Gupta on the COVID vaccine However, when it came to the vaccine, Dr. Gupta felt very differently. The same standards did not apply. Dr. Gupta’s first objection to the vaccine was practical. Continuing her habit of just making things up, she falsely said children have didn’t “any risk at all”. Even though the vaccine has already protected children from rare but severe harms, Dr. Gupta felt we shouldn’t use it because the immunity it created wasn’t long-lasting. Dr. Gupta’s second objection to the vaccine was ethical. Even though everyone was clear that the pediatric COVID vaccine was to protect children against COVID, Dr. Gupta pretended otherwise, saying it was unethical to vaccinate children to shield more vulnerable adults. So let’s be clear what happened here. With SAR-CoV-2, Dr. Gupta claimed that her plan of herd immunity through mass infection was both wise and ethical. She thought it was appropriate to infect unvaccinated children with a novel virus so they could theoretically serve as human shields for more vulnerable adults. Without a shred of evidence, indeed before it was possible to have such evidence, she claimed that immunity to SAR-CoV-2 was long-lasting, that the pandemic was ending, and COVID posed no risk to children anyways. Although the virus killed and injured some children without creating robust, durable immunity, Dr. Gupta continues to defend her plan to repeatedly infect them with it. In contrast, even though the vaccine protected children, Dr. Gupta felt it was unethical and unwise to use it. With the vaccine and only with the vaccine, Dr. Gupta worried about waning immunity. With the vaccine and only with the vaccine, Dr. Gupta felt it was wrong to use give it to children to protect more vulnerable adults Unfortunately, Dr. Gupta versus Dr. Gupta was not an isolated incident. Many doctors spoke one way about SAR-CoV-2 and entirely differently about the vaccine against it. Many of my articles have discussed doctors who treated rare, mild vaccine side-effects as a fate worse than death, for example. Like Dr. Gupta, other pro-infection doctor similarly contradicted themselves. In 2020, Dr. Scott Atlas eagerly cheered infections in unvaccinated young people believing it would hasten the arrival of herd immunity. Later, he became an actor and got “choked up” over the notion, which existed only in his imagination, that anyone would vaccinate young people primarily to shield more vulnerable adults. You can watch his dramatic performance below, combined with an earlier video of him celebrating COVID infections in unvaccinated youth. Dr. Scott Atlas versus Scott Dr. Atlas Clearly, consistency and intellectual integrity were not priorities for pro-infection doctors. They repeatedly spread fake numbers, and they didn’t care. They made farcical forecasts that failed to come to fruition. and they didn’t care. They spoke one way about the virus and entirely differently about the vaccine, and they didn’t care. This is because these doctors’ cared only about infecting unvaccinated children with SAR-CoV-2, and they were willing to blatantly contradict themselves and say anything to achieve this goal.
