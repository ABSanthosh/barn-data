W. Norton, 2025Sometimes the lights are too bright, there’s too much noise, and it’s all way too distracting. Conservationists have dubbed this particular blight a “sensory smog,” and it’s happening more and more as humans introduce mechanized, loud and jarring sounds into everyday life. In Clamor, science journalist Chris Berdik journeys into the soundscape of our lives, aiming a wide lens on what the origin of sounds is, how they’re affecting our health and how they might shape our collective future. The latest research shows that years of hearing damage can silence quieter tones, such as the purr of a cat settling on your lap. Animals can tell the world around them has gotten louder, too. Amid the human-made underwater racket from cargo ships and seabed exploration, whales seem to be acting like people in a loud bar—staying closer together, talking louder and less often, or not bothering at all. We must protect our own eardrums, yes, but “auditory anxiety” (too many noises keeping heart rates and stress elevated is also a problem to solve for future generations and nearly all other life on this planet. —Brianne Kane Hachette Book Group Slither: How Nature’s Most Maligned Creatures Illuminate Our Worldby Stephen S. Hall.Grand Central Publishing, April, 2025Snakes creep most people out: they slither in and out of sight, hide in startling places and sometimes inflict deadly bites on unsuspecting prey. But science writer Stephen S. Hall, whose latest book is called Slither, is a lifelong snake admirer. For him, snakes are more than menacing. They are incredibly diverse and capable of surviving on every continent except Antarctica, Hall said in a recent appearance on our podcast Science Quickly. The snake’s ability to endure a range of conditions caught his attention, “not just because of the cleverness of the evolution or the selective process, but also, it’s a warning to us in terms of climate change and changes in the global meteorological systems,” he explained. “Snakes have a way of adapting to [such changes] that we don’t have, and maybe we can learn something from them.” Snakes may have directly influenced human evolution as well, he added. “Snake detection theory” posits that our ancient ancestors' ability to spot snakes in the wild may have helped contribute to larger primate brains.

Yet, globally, about 10 million people contract it every year, and some 1.25 million die of the disease. TB is a bacterial infection. We have good antibiotics to fight it, thanks in part to a forgotten group of Black nurses on Staten Island, who cared for TB patients during the early 20th century and participated in drug trials: the nurses meticulously recorded patient data, which was essential for the development of a cure. In his latest book, Everything Is Tuberculosis, author John Green argues that TB is very much still a modern-day crisis. He follows the case of a boy with TB in Sierra Leone whose years-long struggle became an emblem of how such diseases thrive in poverty and inequitable societies. “We do not live up to our promise that all people have been created equal. And that’s why we still have tuberculosis,” he said in an interview on our podcast Science Quickly. —B.K.W. W. NortonIs a River Alive?by Robert MacfarlaneW. W. Norton, May 2025In 2008 Ecuador startled the world. Articles 71 to 74 of the nation’s then newly ratified constitution stated that nature had rights—rights to be respected for its existence and the crucial, life-giving services it provided and rights to be restored when damaged. Further, it asserted that the government could intervene when human activities might disrupt these inherent rights. In his latest book, Is a River Alive?, Macfarlane travels to three very different rivers (in Ecuador, India and Quebec) to examine the question of a river’s sovereignty. He discovers that rivers create interconnected (and often fragile) worlds of plant and animal species—confirming they are life-giving wherever they run, as many Indigenous populations throughout the world have recognized for thousands of years. Now rivers are fighting for their lives as corporations, governments, pollution and climate change violate their vitalizing flow. “Muscular, wilful, worshipped and mistreated, rivers have long existed in the threshold space between geology and theology,” Macfarlane writes. “Rivers are—I have found—potent presences with which to imagine water differently. We will never think like a river, but perhaps we can think with them.” —Andrea Gawrylewski",

The snake’s ability to endure a range of conditions caught his attention, “not just because of \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/an-evolutionary-big-bang-explains-why-snakes-come-in-so-many-strange-varieties\"\u003ethe cleverness of the evolution\u003c/a\u003e or the selective process, but also, it’s a warning to us in terms of climate change and changes in the global meteorological systems,” he explained. “Snakes have a way of adapting to [such changes] that we don’t have, and maybe we can learn something from them.” Snakes may have directly influenced human evolution as well, he added. “Snake detection theory” posits that our ancient ancestors\u0026#39; ability to spot snakes in the wild may have helped contribute to larger primate brains. \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/slither-by-stephen-s-hall-explores-our-fear-and-fascination-around-snakes\"\u003eCheck out the full interview here\u003c/a\u003e. —\u003ci\u003eB.K.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-block=\"contentful/image\"\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcset=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=1280 1280w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=900 900w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Book cover for Everything Is Tuberculosis by John Green\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=900\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=1280 1280w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/4033899cf95ae079/original/everything_is_tuberculosis_by_john_green_penguin_random_house_cover.jpg?m=1751401762.857\u0026amp;w=900 900w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePenguin Random House\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/312472/everything-is-tuberculosis-by-john-green/\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eEverything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eby John Green\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eCrash Course Books, March 2025\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eTuberculosis (TB) is thousands of years old and has been cured since the 1950s. Yet, globally, about 10 million people contract it every year, and some 1.25 million die of the disease. TB is a bacterial infection. We have good antibiotics to fight it, thanks in part to \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-heroic-black-nurses-who-helped-cure-tuberculosis\"\u003ea forgotten group of Black nurses on Staten Island\u003c/a\u003e, who cared for TB patients during the early 20th century and participated in drug trials: the nurses meticulously recorded patient data, which was essential for the development of a cure. In his latest book, \u003ci\u003eEverything Is Tuberculosis,\u003c/i\u003e author John Green argues that TB is very much still a modern-day crisis. He follows the case of a boy with TB in Sierra Leone whose years-long struggle became an emblem of how such diseases thrive in poverty and inequitable societies. “We do not live up to our promise that all people have been created equal. And that’s why we still have tuberculosis,” he said in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/john-green-on-his-new-nonfiction-book-everything-is-tuberculosis\"\u003einterview on our podcast \u003ci\u003eScience Quickly\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. —\u003ci\u003eB.K.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-block=\"contentful/image\"\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" srcset=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=1313 1313w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=900 900w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1313px) 1313px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Is a River Alive? by Robert Macfarlane book cover\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=900\" width=\"1313\" height=\"1969\" srcset=\"https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=1000 1000w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=1200 1200w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=1313 1313w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=600 600w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=750 750w, https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7807a76509943853/original/River-cover.jpg?m=1751401787.013\u0026amp;w=900 900w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1313px) 1313px, (min-resolution: 3dppx) 50vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) 75vw, 100vw\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eW.

Articles 71 to 74 of the nation’s then newly ratified constitution stated that nature had \u003ci\u003erights\u003c/i\u003e—rights to be respected for its existence and the crucial, life-giving services it provided and rights to be restored when damaged. Further, it asserted that the government could intervene when human activities might disrupt these inherent rights. In his latest book, \u003ci\u003eIs a River Alive?,\u003c/i\u003e Macfarlane travels to three very different rivers (in Ecuador, India and Quebec) to examine the question of a river’s sovereignty. He discovers that rivers create interconnected (and often fragile) worlds of plant and animal species—confirming they are life-giving wherever they run, as many Indigenous populations throughout the world have recognized for thousands of years. Now rivers are fighting for their lives as corporations, governments, pollution and climate change violate their vitalizing flow. “Muscular, wilful, worshipped and mistreated, rivers have long existed in the threshold space between geology and theology,” Macfarlane writes. “Rivers are—I have found—potent presences with which to imagine water differently. We will never think like a river, but perhaps we can think with them.” —\u003ci\u003eAndrea Gawrylewski\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
