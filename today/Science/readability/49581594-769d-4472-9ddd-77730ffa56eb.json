We can all pray he won’t get confirmed by the Senate, but if he does, the doctors who sanewashed his anti-vaxx disinformation, Vinay Prasad, Leanna Wen, Jay Bhattacharya, Marty Makary, and Robert Redfield, will own everything he does for the next 4 years. Similarly, any doctor who sanewashed these doctors also owns the next 4 years. While Dr. Prasad and friends were telling the world that RFK Jr. was reliable and trustworthy, doctors like Jeffrey Flier, Zubin Damania (ZDoggMD), John Mandrola, John Ioannidis, and Adam Cifu were telling the world that Dr. Prasad and friends were reliable and trustworthy, while dunking on anyone who tried to warn them otherwise.
