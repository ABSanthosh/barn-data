The ocelot, a wild cat slightly larger than a house cat, and the common opossum, a marsupial, are usually predator and prey. But in this video, they moved in tandem.“We were skeptical about what we had seen,” said Isabel Damas-Moreira, behavioral ecologist at Bielefeld University in Germany. Perhaps the ocelot was shadowing its dinner-to-be to learn about its behavior, they wondered, although that didn’t explain the opossum’s laid-back behavior. Then came a second clip: the same odd couple wandering back along the trail minutes later.“Like two old friends walking home from a bar,” Dr. Damas-Moreira said.Intrigued, they contacted researchers in other parts of the Amazon who turned up three additional, nearly identical videos from different locations and years.Dr. Damas-Moreira and her colleagues then set up an experiment, which they described last month in the journal Ecosphere. They left strips of fabric infused with ocelot scent, puma scent and a control in front of camera traps.Opossums visited the ocelot scent 12 times, often lingering to rub against, sniff or bite the fabric. The puma scent attracted just one brief visit.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
