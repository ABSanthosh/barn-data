Last year’s winning entry, taken on top of the icebreaker research vessel Polarstern, shows the painstaking retrieval of a measuring instrument that had become trapped under sea ice off Greenland. Credit: Richard Jones Entries are now open for Nature’s 2025 #ScientistAtWork photo competition. Capture a moment in your working day on camera for the chance to win a £500 cash prize (or local-currency equivalent) and the opportunity to see your winning image appear in print and online as part of the magazine’s Careers section.To enter, simply take a photo that conveys the essence of your research focus and submit it to photocompetition@nature.com. Previous winning images have come from moments at the laboratory bench, or been taken during science-communication work, field trips and conference preparation. If preferred, winners can donate their prize money to a charity of their choice.The competition opened today, and closes for entries on 28 March. If you have any questions, e-mail photocompetition@nature.com.#ScientistAtWork photo competitionWinners are decided by a group of Nature media editors. Entries will be judged on their photographic merit and creative interpretation of a #ScientistAtWork.Full terms and conditions can be found on the competition home page, along with help and advice on how to frame and take a great image. You can also find inspiring images from previous winners there.Not just tundra and thunderAlongside lab-based images, previous winning shots depict scientists examining an Antarctic seal and observing monkeys under rain clouds in the Ethiopian Highlands. A snap of a hasty poster-ironing session has also impressed judges — as has a moody shot of a mathematician at his blackboard, and the view from the lectern during the 2017 March for Science event in Chicago, Illinois, during US President Donald Trump’s first term in the White House.Entrants are not in competition with professional photographers: this is an amateurs-only contest (we define a professional photographer as anyone who makes more than 25% of their income from photography work).So, reach for a good camera phone, or borrow a camera. It’s time to get snapping.In short• Nature’s Careers section photo competition has opened and will close on 28 March. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-00673-4 Related Articles Breaking ice, and helicopter drops: winning photos of working scientists Use these tips to take an amazing science photograph Subjects Latest on:",
