The Vicious Accusations Against Us As advocates for health and freedom, we wish to clarify our stance on vaccines. We have been unfairly and maliciously characterized as being “anti-vaccine” Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are not anti-vaccine, we are pro unattainable vaccine!  We have also been accused of imposing arbitrary standards of safety. Our standards are far from arbitrary. They are exquisitely crafted to sound reasonable, but realistically impossible, unethical, or both. Sadly none of the currently available jabs meet this simple threshold. When it comes to vaccines: “If it exists we resist.”  We base our standards on a broad consensus of celebrities, influencers, podcasters, athletes, and politicians.  For years, we’ve been unfairly labeled as science deniers and conspiracy theorists. But the truth is, we simply hold vaccines to a much higher standard than the so-called “experts” at the CDC, WHO, and every major medical institution worldwide. What we lack in expertise we make up in arrogance and tenacity.  We have 4 matters of concern when it comes to vaccines The Research Theirs is a compilation of cold facts collected from hundreds of thousands of anonymous children.

The Toxins Have you read the list of ingredients in a vaccine? You would have to be an expert in virology, immunology, and biochemistry just to figure them out! We know better. Every ingredient must undergo a rigorous Google toxicology analysis. We must not expose our children to ingredients that are difficult to pronounce or sound icky.
