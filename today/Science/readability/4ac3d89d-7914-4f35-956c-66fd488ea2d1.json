Dein. Ms. Petrova, who was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jumpsuit for the hearing, emerged from custody in a T-shirt that read “Hakuna matata,” and embraced Marc Kirschner, the scientist who heads her laboratory at Harvard Medical School. “Obviously, it’s hard to explain why someone like Kseniia had to be jailed for four months,” said Gregory Romanovsky, her immigration lawyer. He added that her release “means that the legal process, even though it may be slow, is working, which is great.”Ms. Petrova’s release is a victory, but a temporary one. She is still facing a two-pronged prosecution: The Trump administration began deportation proceedings against her in February, and around three months later, after she challenged the move in court, filed criminal smuggling charges against her.Lawyers for the government have said they intend to deport Ms. Petrova to Russia, a country she fled for political reasons in 2022. She has said that if she returns, she fears arrest or even death because of her activism.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
