They wondered about the future of the International Space Station as well as Artemis, NASA’s current effort to send astronauts back to the moon.“I don’t think we need to make any tough trade here,” Mr. Isaacman said. “I think we can be paralleling these efforts and doing the near impossible.”Mr. Isaacman shared the hearing on Wednesday with Olivia Trusty, a nominee to be a member of the Federal Communications Commission. During his testimony, Mr. Isaacman avoided direct answers to a number of questions while repeatedly saying that the space agency could work to send astronauts to both moon and Mars within its current $25 billion budget.“NASA was built to do the near impossible,” Mr. Isaacman said.Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas who chairs the committee, gave Mr. Isaacman a lecture about the bipartisan law that dictates NASA’s priorities, reading back the portion that states that Mars would be the destination after the moon. The Johnson Space Center, which runs most of NASA’s spaceflight programs, is in Mr. Cruz’s state.”When legislation uses the word shall, it denotes a mandatory obligation,” Mr. Cruz told Mr. Isaacman.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
