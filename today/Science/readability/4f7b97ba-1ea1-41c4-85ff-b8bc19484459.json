To understand the phenomenon and its impact, look no further than the men’s and women’s NCAA tournament fields.

Roughly one-third of these key contributors — the top eight players in total minutes on each roster — played for another D-I program just last season. Now I want an analysis for academics and research prowess. “I will be taking my statistical talents to the University of California, Berkeley this semester.” Chart Type Used",
