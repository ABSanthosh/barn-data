About 8.5 minutes after launch, communications between the ground and the upper-stage vehicle, which is known as Starship, were cut off.“We can confirm that we did lose the ship,” said Kate Tice, one of the hosts of SpaceX’s video stream of the launch.Videos posted on the social media site X appeared to show debris raining down from the sky over the Caribbean, likely parts of a disintegrated rocket.Starship is the rocket that Elon Musk, the company’s founder, says will take people to Mars someday. NASA is also paying SpaceX to develop a version of the vehicle to return American astronauts to the moon.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
