Forecast cloud cover during the eclipse Sources: Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses Database by Xavier M.

Davis, Joel Eastwood and Joey K. Lee March 28, 2025Updated 12:18 p.m. ETAnother eclipse is upon us.On Saturday, the moon will cast its shadow on Earth’s surface, a phenomenon that people in parts of the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, Russia and Africa will get to experience as a partial solar eclipse. It is only partially as impressive as the total solar eclipse that cut across the United States last year, but it is an opportunity to take a break from worldly matters and witness our place in the solar system.During the eclipse, the moon will appear to take a bite out of the sun, but how much varies by location. And clouds can spoil the view.The surface of the sun will never be fully obscured during this event, so it is never safe to look at the partial solar eclipse without protective eye gear.When is the solar eclipse?People in the regions where the partial solar eclipse is visible will experience it differently. How much of the sun will be covered, and what time it happens, depends on location. You’ll also need to check your local weather report for clear or cloudy conditions.NASA has published a list of eclipse times in several big cities here.In North America, the event begins early in the morning around sunrise, and for most, the sun will already be partially eclipsed when it emerges.Where is the path of the eclipse?Saturday’s eclipse will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere in a region that includes both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Unlike a total eclipse, it affects the sun in a broad region and has less of a clear path.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
