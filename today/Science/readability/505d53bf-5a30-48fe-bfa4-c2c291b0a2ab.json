  "description": "Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. In an effort to achieve targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma, researchers recently developed a new radioactive drug that emits alpha particles. With their short range of emission and high energy, alpha particles are particularly promising for targeted therapies that require high energy release in the cancer tissue while minimizing the damage to nearby healthy tissues.",
