Peter Blottman Photography/Getty ImagesCLIMATEWIRE | States on the East and West coasts are making better progress in cutting emissions from the transportation systems than the rest of the country.That's according to a report released Tuesday from the Natural Resources Defense Council. It highlighted those states' efforts in areas such as smart growth policies and the construction of electric vehicle chargers.\"On average, states earned the greatest share of available points on the metric that evaluated their ratio of nonroadway-expansion spending relative to total highway spending, as well as on the metrics that assessed their smart growth policies and EV fast-charge count,\" according to the report.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

The top 10 in order: Vermont, California, Oregon, Washington state, Maryland, Colorado, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, Rhode Island and New York.Texas, which has historically focused on freeways to the detriment of other forms of transportation, scored the lowest. The other bottom 10 states were largely in the Southeast and Midwest. Kansas was the second lowest behind Texas, followed by Arkansas, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Nebraska, Idaho, Louisiana and Kentucky.At the same time, some Midwestern states got high marks for maintaining their systems, Henningson said. And Oklahoma performed well on one measure: reducing the number of vehicle miles traveled.Reprinted from E\u0026E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC. Copyright 2025.
