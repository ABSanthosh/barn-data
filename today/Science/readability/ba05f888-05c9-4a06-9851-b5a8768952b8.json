  "description": "We're stuck in a bad news bubble, says Angus Hervey, founder of Fix the News, an independent publication that reports stories of global progress. He shares some of the compelling stories too often left out of our daily news — from a decline in AIDS deaths to decreased deforestation in the Amazon to more effective school feeding programs and greater acceptance of LGBTQ people in many countries. (This conversation with TED's Whitney Pennington Rodgers was recorded on September 5, 2024.)",
