  "title": "Sunday Pick: How do you approach gender as a parent? (with LB Hannahs) | How to Be a Better Human",
  "link": "https://audiocollective.ted.com",
  "description": "Thinking and talking about gender is complex for anyone, and for some people it’s a frequent conversation–especially for parents. In today’s episode, LB Hannahs, a genderqueer parent, shares their experience of parenting and discusses why they try to center authenticity and gender expansive thinking in the way they live their lives–both in how they interact with their kids, and how they work and show up in their community. Plus, from rethinking the gifts we give children to embracing the spectrums of identity, LB shares actionable recommendations for parents and non-parents alike on how we all can better support the LGBTQ+ people in our lives.Want to help shape TED’s shows going forward?
