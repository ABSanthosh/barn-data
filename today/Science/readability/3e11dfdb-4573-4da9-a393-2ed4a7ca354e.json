  "description": "Aviation expert Dr. Graham Wild returns to take us beyond the basics of flight and into the high-speed world of subsonic vs. hypersonic aircraft. We break down the engine mechanics behind these incredible machines, and I squeeze in a humblebrag about sitting in an SR-71 (yes, okay, it was grounded). It’s a theory-packed episode, so we’ve split it into two parts. Catch Part 2 next week. Connect with Dr. Graham Wild on Linkedin Twitter/ X - @aerospacedoctor",
