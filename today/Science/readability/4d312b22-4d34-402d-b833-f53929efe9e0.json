If these batteries are soaked in saltwater, some can ignite after floodwaters subside.It’s a relatively rare problem, but the risk is real.Of the 48 lithium-ion battery fires attributed to Hurricane Helene, 11 were caused by electric vehicles, said State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis. The rest were electric wheelchairs, hoverboards, scooters and golf carts. The E.V.s that caught fire were a tiny fraction of the more than 254,000 electric vehicles that were registered in Florida at the end of 2023.Why do batteries catch fire in floods?If saltwater reaches the interior of a lithium-ion battery, it can cause the cells to short-circuit by conducting electricity between the positive and negative terminals. This generates heat.In some cases, that heat can spur a chain reaction inside the battery called thermal runaway. Heat from one cell starts melting the plastic separators inside neighboring cells, which causes additional short-circuiting and generates more heat. The end result: a fire that can last for hours and is hard to extinguish.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
