  "description": "The early lineages of hexapods (broadly defined insects) have long been debated. Researchers at University of Tsukuba and collaborators critically examined the newly proposed \"Protura-sister\" phylogenetic hypothesis. This analysis revealed a fundamental flaw in the hypothesis, reinforcing the validity of the previously established \"Ellipura\" hypothesis.",
