But not all livestock producers are opposed to cultivated protein.Lab-grown chicken at an event held by the company Upside Foods in Miami the day before Florida’s lab-grown meat ban went into effect last June.Credit...Josh Ritchie for The New York TimesMarch 14, 2025Curious to try a lab-grown chicken sandwich? Don’t look to satiate your craving in Mississippi, which earlier this week moved to ban so-called cultivated or cell-derived meat.The proposed ban, unanimously passed by the House of Representatives, carries a $500 fine and up to three months in jail for anyone growing or selling such products within the state.The bill, which Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, a Republican, is expected to sign, is the latest in a series of legal maneuvers by states seeking to constrain the nascent cell-cultured meat industry — despite the fact that such products are currently unavailable to consumers in the United States.In contrast with alternative-meat products like Impossible Burger, which are made entirely from plants, lab-grown meat starts as cells taken from an animal. By nourishing them with a cocktail of nutrients, scientists can coax these cells to develop into animal muscle, connective tissue or fat — the basic components of meat.Proponents say cultivated meat can address the many environmental impacts of farmed livestock and provide meat eaters a protein that does not require the slaughtering of animals.Last year, Florida and Alabama became the first states to outlaw the cultivation and sale of meat grown in laboratories, and a number of other states, including Nebraska and Georgia, are considering similar measures.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
