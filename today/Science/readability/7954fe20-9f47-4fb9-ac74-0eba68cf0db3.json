  "text": "Nov 30, 2024 Is there a better gift than the gift of knowledge? No, there is not. It is the greatest gift that lasts a lifetime. Speaking of, you can gift a FlowingData membership to your friends, family, colleagues, and cats, and they’ll gain access to said knowledge from tutorials, courses, and a members-only newsletter. Or, treat yourself — an equally excellent idea. Plus it’s Small Business Saturday Cyber Monday, which is totally a real thing and not made up at all, so you’ll be able to check multiple boxes off your list. It’s super easy. Go to the membership page and select “Give as Gift” at the end of the page. You can schedule the gift arrival and include a message. There are two options: Deviation — Visualization courses, tutorials, and a newsletter on process, backed by real experience and a human. Supports this independent site. Outlier — Everything from Deviation, plus a signed copy of Visualize This (2nd ed.) and supports this independent site more. Thanks for considering this very small cyber business on this Saturday Monday. Your cat will love it. Get 10% off an annual membership with the code FLOW10MON when you support by the end of December 1, 2024, marking the end of the very real Cyber Monday.",
