Bryan Johnson, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist who’s well known for his extreme attempts to slow the aging process, thinks he knows the answer.

Recently, WIRED global editorial director Katie Drummond visited Johnson’s home in California to sit down with him for WIRED's special Beyond Wellness edition.This wide-ranging interview is a must-read as well as must-watch. Johnson shared his daily protocol—and much more—during the pair’s 90-minute conversation.
