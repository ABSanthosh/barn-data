The plant makes about 60 percent of the United States’ supply of fluids used in IVs, for in-home dialysis and for people who rely on IV nutrition. They include premature babies in intensive care and patients who rely on tube feeding to survive.The situation could become even more dire now that Hurricane Milton is hitting Florida. On Tuesday, workers at B. Braun, makers of a fourth of the nation’s IV fluids, loaded trucks at the company’s plant in Daytona Beach with the medical bags and drove them north through the night to what they hoped would be a safer location.The Baxter plant, in Marion, N.C., and the B. Braun site in Daytona Beach manufacture about 85 percent of the nation’s supply of IV fluids. Experts on shortages have long pointed out the risk of such over-concentration of critical supplies, citing exposure to disasters like those now at hand. Even before the latest storm, supplies were tight and reflected a longstanding problem of how few companies are willing to produce crucial but low-cost and low-profit medical products.A spokeswoman for the B. Braun site in Florida said that the company was working with federal officials and that the plant’s staff would be off work Wednesday and planned to return on Friday once the hurricane had moved on.On Wednesday evening, the Food and Drug Administration announced that it had authorized imports of IV products from Baxter plants in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and China.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
