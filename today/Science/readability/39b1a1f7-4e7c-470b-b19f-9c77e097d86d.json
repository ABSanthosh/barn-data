  "description": "Climate change is significantly affecting forest ecosystems through rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Tropical forests are particularly vulnerable to these changes, and the forestry sector is expected to experience severe effects due to the long-lived and stationary nature of trees, which require decades from planting to harvest.",
