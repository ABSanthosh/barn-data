But, as shown by CBC News, Mark Carney replaced Justin Trudeau (among other things) and probabilities flipped in favor of Liberals. As of April 16, 2025, the Liberals have a 98% chance of winning, up from a previous 1% chance just a few months ago. A flip of such magnitude and speed seems unfathomable here in the United States.
