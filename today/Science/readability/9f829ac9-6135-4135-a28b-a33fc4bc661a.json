Kennedy Jr. on stage during a campaign event at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, on August 23, 2024. Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty ImagesCLIMATEWIRE | More than 50,000 scientists and their supporters have signed an open letter asking Congress to safeguard federal research and scientific jobs ahead of the incoming Trump administration.The Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization, spearheaded and published the letter Monday morning. The document points to concerns that President-elect Donald Trump may eliminate or reorganize federal science agencies, reduce staff, and attack regulations aimed at protecting public health and the environment.“The Trump administration's current agenda promises to eviscerate the protections that Americans count on and support: clean air and water; safe food and medicine; products that won't harm us; and protection from extreme weather and other damaging effects of climate change,” the letter stated. “Without strong federal science, people will suffer, and historically marginalized communities will continue to bear the burden of these harms.”On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Experts have raised concerns that the incoming administration may downsize federal agencies, shift or curtail their research priorities, censor scientists and alter or destroy federal datasets.Trump has consistently disavowed the seriousness of climate change and pledged to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for a second time. He’s also recently tapped a number of political nominees known for denying mainstream science on subjects related to public health and the environment.Some of Trump’s picks for the new administration include key authors of Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. The document calls for dramatic reorganizations of some federal science agencies, like NOAA and EPA, and says that “the \"Biden Administration’s climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding.” Some nominations have raised concerns that the policy plan may influence Trump’s priorities after taking office.“The first 100 days of the Trump administration will be absolutely essential for taking action that can save science that saves lives,” the UCS letter to Congress states. “This is a critical time to show the administration that members of Congress of both parties are united in championing the science that helps protect the communities they represent.”Reprinted from E\u0026E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.
