  "link": "",
  "description": "The battle over whether we should be putting fluoride in our water has reached fever pitch. We’ve got U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and anti-fluoride activists saying it’s a neurotoxin that’s lowering our IQs. But supporters say that fluoride is a safe and effective way to protect our teeth from cavities, and that stopping water fluoridation would lead to a spike in tooth decay. To find out who’s right, we talk to epidemiologist Dr. Ashley Malin and community health scientist Professor Lindsay McLaren.  Find our transcript here: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsFluoride  In this episode, we cover: (00:00) Chapter 1: Why did we start water fluoridation?  (07:00) Chapter 2: What can fluoride do at really high levels?  (11:18) Chapter 3: Can low doses of fluoride affect the brain?  (20:41) Chapter 4: Anything else to worry about? (24:53) Chapter 5: Does fluoride in the water protect our teeth? This episode was produced by Meryl Horn, with help from Wendy Zukerman, Rose Rimler, Michelle Dang, and Ekedi Fausther-Keeys.
