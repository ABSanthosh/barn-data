  "description": "In 2020, Scientific American made waves with the provocative headline: \"No One Can Explain Why Planes Stay in the Air.\" But is that really true? Dr. Graham Wild, senior lecturer in aviation science and technology at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, joins us to set the record straight. In this episode, we dip our toes into the complex world of flight. We scratch at the very surface of the topic in an episode that could easily take over 20 hours.
