  "text": "For years now, aspiring parents have been designing their children. Screening embryos for disease-causing genes during IVF, selecting their future baby’s sex, picking egg and sperm donors to influence their child’s traits. Today, a lot of those “designer babies” are full-on kids or teenagers. And some families are discovering that, as hard as you try, things don’t always work out as planned: The kids feel like walking science experiments; the parents are disappointed in how their progeny turned out. Fertility businesses are selling a better chance of domestic bliss, and these families feel cheated.Now controversial new technologies promise parents even more control over their embryos. One US startup, called Orchid, claims its genetic screening can calculate a baby’s risk of autism, bipolar disorder, and hundreds of other health conditions. Another startup wants to help parents pick embryos with the highest predicted IQ. So WIRED spoke to a psychologist based on the West Coast who is already dealing with the fallout.I worked at an adolescent treatment center. I kept coming across teens who were in distress about the way they had been created. Their parents had wanted a child who was musical or athletic or tall. So they found egg donors with the traits they wanted, created embryos with the husband’s sperm, and then implanted them, often in surrogates. Usually, these couples didn’t have fertility issues.I’ve counseled a number of those families in the past 10 to 15 years. People who have children this way often place too much importance on genes while ignoring the environment. It’s like, “This is what our family is going to look like. We’re going to pick a kid, and this is how we’re going to put it together. Mom’s going to be in charge of the whole thing.” It’s like a project or building a company. People don’t always realize they are creating a human being and not a piece of furniture.In Silicon Valley, there are many distant parents—usually fathers—who hardly know their children. Sometimes the mom and child don’t bond, either. There are a lot of men who are extremely successful and want things a certain way. They tend to get what they want and don’t hear “no” a lot. So when their kid shows up and isn’t the way that they want, what happens?Usually, it’s a disaster.In these homes, a high value gets placed on achievement. I think the way these kids are created sends the message: “You're not good enough. You need to achieve. You’re not accepted.”When the kids struggle, it’s especially devastating. Some kids have disabilities from being born preterm, which used to be a big risk with IVF. Or they have learning differences or autism.Sometimes, parents chose an egg donor and then later found out that she had psychiatric problems. Then the kid gets viewed through that lens, which can be pretty devastating and traumatic: “Your donor is nuts, so you must be, too.”The child grows up feeling very different, knowing they were an experiment but not getting the proper support or acceptance they need to thrive. Because there's not a caregiver who's like, “I get you.” There's none of that.In my work, I help parents accept: This is the child that you have. And I help kids accept the reality of their parents and forge a relationship that’s less hurtful—or build a life without them.Many of my families have neurodiverse members who need help making abstract concepts more concrete. Sometimes just explaining “you and your child are not the same person” does the trick. Or say a teenager doesn’t feel loved. I might need to clarify to them that “love” is not a tangible feeling, like getting pinched or kicked. It means someone feels fondness toward you like you feel fondness toward Legos or drones.In high school, a lot of teens are linking up with half-siblings through 23andMe, sometimes ones who live all over the world. It's common in these families to have different egg donors for different kids because they’ve tried to get, say, a sporty son and an artsy daughter. What do you do when one of your children has found their half-siblings and is bonding, while your other child doesn’t have a good experience with their newfound relatives? Who do you invite to Thanksgiving?I really feel for the moms. They’re trying to balance everyone’s expectations and hold it all together. But it’s unfair to the dads, too. Because I’m not sure the dads can accurately predict human behavior. They probably can predict stocks, but human behavior has way too many variables. I don’t know if anyone’s making sure parents understand that they can’t test-drive a child and then return it.Trying to control your child is a recipe for disaster. The kid is going to rebel. If you have a preconceived notion of how they’re going to be, either you’re going to be severely disappointed or you’re going to shove them into a mold and it’s not going to work.Maybe sometimes it does work, but those people don’t come to me.—As told to Emi Nietfeld",
