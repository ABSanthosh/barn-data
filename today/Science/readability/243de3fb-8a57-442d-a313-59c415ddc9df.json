Christine Zhang and Ruth Igielnik, for The New York Times, show how pollsters frame their questions can have that effect, in the context of tariff approval. A generic question about tariffs showed favorability ratings below half of respondents, whereas polls that mentioned China produced higher favorability. So if policymakers use poll results in their decision-making, this should emphasize the importance of good sampling, or at least skepticism about who’s asking the questions.",
