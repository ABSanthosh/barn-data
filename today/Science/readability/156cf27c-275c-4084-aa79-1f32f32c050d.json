  "text": "Reporting from WashingtonTrump’s budget proposal calls for $163 billion in cuts across the government.President Trump on Friday proposed slashing $163 billion in federal spending next fiscal year, a drastic retrenchment in the role and reach of government that, if enacted, would eliminate a vast set of climate, education, health and housing programs, including some that benefit the poor.Issuing his first budget proposal since returning to office, Mr. Trump sketched out a dim view of Washington. His blueprint depicted many core government functions as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern era.Mr. Trump proposed cutting funding for some federal law enforcement, including the F.B.I. He called on lawmakers to slash money meant to police tax evasion at the Internal Revenue Service. He recommended striking billions in funds that help finance clean water projects. And the president reserved some of his deepest cuts for education, health and science, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see their budgets cut by around half.Democrats immediately rebuked Mr. Trump for his proposal. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, called it “heartless” and an “all-out assault on hardworking Americans.” Even some Republicans took issue with Mr. Trump’s budget, although others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the blueprint.Mr. Trump also asked Congress to reduce, if not eliminate, billions of dollars in federal aid to help the poorest Americans. For one, the White House called for reconfiguring federal programs that provide rental assistance to low-income families, cutting aid by more than $26 billion next fiscal year. And the administration proposed the termination of a federal initiative, backed by some Republicans, that aids needy families in paying their monthly heating bills.In one of the few spending increases included in the budget, Mr. Trump asked lawmakers to bolster spending at the Department of Homeland Security by more than $43 billion, furthering his work to crack down on immigration, conduct deportations and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The president also requested more than $1 trillion for the military next fiscal year.But he asked lawmakers to approve that increase essentially on a one-time basis, as part of a broader legislative package — due later this year — meant to advance the president’s tax agenda. The approach angered some Republicans, who signaled they would pursue a larger increase to military spending as part of the yearly process to fund government agencies and programs.“It is peculiar how much time the president’s advisers spend talking about restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of national power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans’ former Senate leader, in a statement that denounced the administration’s “accounting gimmicks.”For Mr. Trump, the budget served to formalize his conservative vision and his disruptive reorganization of the government, a campaign that has already shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of federal workers without the explicit approval of Congress.Some of Mr. Trump’s proposed military increases could benefit Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who has advised Mr. Trump on cost-cutting as part of the Department of Government EfficiencyMr. Trump’s budget supported the creation of a new missile defense shield and a renewed campaign for “U.S. space dominance.” Both are areas in which Mr. Musk and his rocket company, SpaceX, could stand to win major contracts funded by any increase in spending.In a letter Friday accompanying the spending blueprint, Russell T. Vought, the leader of the White House budget office, said the administration had produced its submission after a “rigorous, line-by-line review of spending.”Mr. Vought added that the president sought to root out money “contrary to the needs of ordinary working Americans and tilted toward funding niche, nongovernmental organizations and institutions of higher education committed to radical gender and climate ideologies antithetical to the American way of life.”Sharon Parrott, the president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said many of the budget changes contemplated by Mr. Trump still seemed most likely to fall hardest on low-income Americans, particularly those who rely on government services.“This is the latest repudiation of some of what he promised on the campaign trail, in terms of being a president who was going to seek to serve people struggling at the margins of the economy,” she said.Mr. Trump’s proposal is not law. Totaling about $1.7 trillion, after accounting for the full set of spending changes the president seeks, the budget serves only as a formal guide to Congress, where it immediately generated opposition.“President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: He wants to outright defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with his reckless tariffs,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the leading Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.The criticism was not limited to Democrats, as Republicans also raised alarm about cuts to some programs that serve the neediest Americans. Outlining her “serious objections,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who leads the Appropriations Committee, added in a statement: “Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.”By releasing the budget, Mr. Trump set the stage for what is bound to be a complicated, monthslong process to fund the government and avert a shutdown before an existing spending deal expires on Sept. 30. Entering that fight, many Republicans have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to slash federal spending, though warring G.O.P. factions have disagreed at times over the exact scope.Party lawmakers have also raced to identify potentially trillions of dollars in cuts that they can include to finance a related package that would expand a set of expiring tax cuts for families and businesses, one of the president’s signature — and costliest — economic policy priorities.But Mr. Trump’s proposal carries additional significance. He and his top budget adviser, Mr. Vought, subscribe to the idea that the commander in chief wields expansive authority to halt or cancel spending, even if Congress instructs otherwise. Their view has paved the way for the administration to slow, freeze or cancel billions of dollars in funds, sparking a vast array of lawsuits and prompting more than three dozen ongoing federal investigations into their activities.On Friday, Mr. Trump’s proposal left unanswered some of the most important questions facing Washington and its finances. It was silent on the nation’s fiscal trajectory, even as the president seeks to cut taxes in a sprawling and costly legislative package that carries substantial implications for the nation’s $36 trillion debt.“It remains to be seen what the rest of the president’s proposals will hold, and there is still the multitrillion-dollar question of whether the reconciliation bill will blow up the debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates deficit reduction.Nor did the president’s new budget address the future of the federal benefit programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that comprise the largest share of federal spending annually. Some Republicans are particularly interested in rethinking Medicaid, which provides health insurance to poor families, as a source of savings to pay for their tax cuts.The administration is expected to send those details in a fuller budget to Congress as soon as this month.Reporting was contributed by Alan Rappeport, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Catie Edmondson, Eric Lipton, Devlin Barrett, Lisa Friedman, Brad Plumer, Madeleine Ngo and Alicia Parlapiano.The budget proposal seeks to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts.ImageThe president’s budget calls for eliminating the endowments for the arts and the humanities, as well as the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Credit...Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesPresident Trump proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities in the budget he released Friday, taking aim once again at two agencies that he had tried and failed to get rid of during his first term.The endowments, along with the Institute of Museum and Library Services, were among the entities listed in a section titled “small agency eliminations” in his budget blueprint for the next fiscal year. The document said that the proposal was “consistent with the president’s efforts to decrease the size of the federal government to enhance accountability, reduce waste, and reduce unnecessary governmental entities” and noted that Mr. Trump’s past budget proposals had “also supported these eliminations.”In 2017, during his first term, Mr. Trump proposed eliminating both the arts and the humanities endowments. But bipartisan support in Congress kept them alive, and in fact their budgets grew during the first Trump administration.Since Mr. Trump returned to office this year, his administration has taken aim at the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, canceling most of their existing grants and laying off a large portion of their staffs. But the arts agency had yet to announce major cuts.The proposal to eliminate the endowments drew a quick and furious reaction from Democrats. One, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, vowed to fight the plan to eliminate the N.E.A. “tooth and nail.”Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, who serves as the top Democrat on the House subcommittee overseeing the N.E.A., said in an interview that Mr. Trump was “making a broad-based attack on the arts, both for funding and content.” She cited his proposals to eliminate the endowments as well as his takeover of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and his efforts to influence the Smithsonian Institution.“We were able to restore the funding last time,” she said, “but as you know, based on the first 100 days of this administration, they’re in no mood to keep much of government alive anymore, and their attack is focused on everything, and the arts have already got a bull’s-eye on their back.”At the Kennedy Center, the new leaders installed by Mr. Trump have worked to cut costs and reduce staff. On Friday they dismissed another 21 employees in several departments, according to two people with knowledge of the firings. Since Mr. Trump took over the center, roughly 40 of its staff members have lost their jobs.The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.The N.E.A. supports arts organizations and projects in every congressional district in the country, which has traditionally made it popular with lawmakers in both major parties. Many of its individual grants are modest in size. But they can be important, particularly for smaller organizations, where they make up a larger percentage of the budget. The grants are often seen as marks of distinction, which can help attract potential donors from the private sector.The arts endowment has been without a permanent leader since Maria Rosario Jackson, who was appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., resigned when Mr. Trump took office. Mary Anne Carter, who served as the agency’s chair during the first Trump administration, has been overseeing the agency this year, with the title of senior adviser.The Trump administration had already upended the endowment’s distribution of grants. Shortly after the second term began, the N.E.A. announced it was eliminating grants this year from a program supporting projects for underserved groups and communities.Then the agency announced that it would require grant applicants to promise not to promote “diversity, equity and inclusion” or “gender ideology” in ways that run afoul of President Trump’s executive orders — creating confusion and concern among arts groups applying for grants. Both requirements were put on hold as court challenges were considered, and recently the agency posted a notice suggesting that it would no longer require grant applicants to certify that they will not promote gender ideology but will expect the agency’s chair to review grant applications in accord with statutory requirements.The arts endowment, established in 1965, is a federal agency that distributes grants to arts organizations and state arts agencies across the country. Its budget was $207 million in 2024, and its financial report that year said it had provided more than $163 million in grants.Even as it moves to shut down the arts endowment in fiscal year 2026, the Trump administration is moving to redirect some of its already appropriated funding.Last month, the National Endowment for the Humanities announced that it and the arts endowment would each contribute $17 million to build President Trump’s proposed National Garden of American Heroes, a patriotic sculpture park that is central to his plans for commemorating the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.Javier C.

ImageFederal workers outside the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington on April 1.Credit...Roberto Schmidt/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, has said that tackling a chronic disease “epidemic” would be a cornerstone of his Make America Healthy Again agenda, often invoking alarming statistics as an urgent reason for reforming public health in this country.On Friday, President Trump released a proposed budget that called for cutting the funding of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by almost half. Its chronic disease center was slated for elimination entirely, a proposal that came as a shock to many state and city health officials.“Most Americans have some sort of ailment that could be considered chronic,” said Dr. Matifadza Hlatshwayo Davis, health director for the city of St. Louis.Of the proposed cuts, she said, “How do you reconcile that with trying to make America healthy again?”The federal health department last month cut 2,400 jobs from the C.D.C., whose National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion runs on the largest budget within the agency.Programs on lead poisoning, smoking cessation and reproductive health were jettisoned in a reorganization last month.Overall, the proposed budget would cut the C.D.C.’s funding to about $4 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024. The budget blueprint makes no mention of the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a $1.2 billion program. If that figure is taken into account, the cut may be even larger than Mr. Trump’s proposal indicates.The agency would also lose a center focused on preventing injuries, including those caused by firearms, as well as programs for H.I.V. surveillance and prevention, and grants to help states prepare for public health emergencies.According to the proposed budget, the cuts are needed to eliminate “duplicative, D.E.I., or simply unnecessary programs.” Congress draws up the federal budget, but given the Republican majority and its fealty to Mr. Trump, it is unclear how much his proposal will change.ImageSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the White House last month.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesC.D.C. officials had been told that the functions of the chronic disease center would be moved to a new organization within the health department called the Administration for a Healthy America.And the proposal released on Friday appears to allocate $500 million to the health secretary in part “to tackle nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, overreliance on medication and treatments.”But at the C.D.C., the chronic disease center’s budget was nearly three times as large. And even if part of the chronic disease center is resuscitated in the A.H.A., it’s unlikely that the new iteration would involve C.D.C. scientists relocated from Atlanta.“The actual subject-matter experts, who administer the programs, might not be there at C.D.C. anymore,” said Dr. Scott Harris, state health officer at the Alabama Department of Public Health. “We certainly don’t have the same level of expertise in my state.”The department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.The C.D.C.’s chronic disease center ran programs aimed at preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. But the center has also seeded initiatives farther afield, ranging from creating rural and urban hiking trails to ensuring that healthy options like salads are offered in airports. It also promoted wellness programs in marginalized communities.Dr. Davis, the health director in St. Louis, said her department was already reeling from cuts to programs to curb smoking and reduce lead poisoning and health disparities, as well as the rescinding of more than $11 billion that the C.D.C. had been providing to state health departments.ImageA diabetes prevention program at a Bronx Y.M.C.A.Credit...Benjamin Norman for The New York TimesImageThe center has seeded wide-ranging initiatives ranging from developing rural walking tracks and urban trails to ensuring healthy food options like salads are offered in airports.Credit...Tony Cenicola/The New York Times“I would take back Covid-19 in a heartbeat over what’s happening right now,” Dr. Davis said.In the proposed budget, the administration suggested that the eliminated programs would be better managed by states. But state health departments already manage most chronic disease programs, and three-quarters of the C.D.C. center’s funding goes to support them.Loss of those funds “would be devastating for us,” said Dr. Harris, the health officer in Alabama.The state has one of the highest rates of chronic diseases in the country, and about 84 percent of the public health department’s budget comes from the C.D.C., Dr. Harris said. About $6 million goes to chronic disease programs, including blood pressure screening, nutrition education for diabetes and promotion of physical activity.If those funds were cut, “I am at a loss right now to tell you where that would come from,” he added. “It just seems that no one really knows what to expect, and we’re not really being asked for any input on that.”Minnesota’s vaunted health department has already laid off 140 employees, and hundreds more may be affected if more C.D.C. funding is lost. Cuts to chronic disease prevention will affect nursing homes, vaccine clinics and public health initiatives for Native Americans in the state.“The actions of the federal government have left us out on a flimsy limb with no safety net below us,” said Dr. Brooke Cunningham, the state’s health commissioner.Until recently, “there seemed to be a shared understanding at the local, state and federal level that health was important to invest in,” Dr. Cunningham said.ImageDr. Brooke Cunningham, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health, in 2023.Credit...David Joles/Star Tribune, via Associated PressThe C.D.C.’s chronic disease center’s work touches American lives in many unexpected ways.In Prairie Village, Kan., Stephanie Barr learned about the center 15 years ago when, working as a waitress with no health insurance, she discovered a lump in her breast the size of a lemon.Through the C.D.C.’s National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, she was able to get a mammogram and an ultrasound, and staff members helped her enroll in Medicaid for treatment after a biopsy determined the lump was malignant, Ms. Barr said.“It was caught in the nick of time,” said Ms. Barr, now 45 and free of cancer. Since that program began in 1991, it has provided more than 16.3 million screening exams to more than 6.3 million people with no other affordable access, said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.The organization is one of 530 health associations that have signed a petition asking lawmakers to reject the proposed H.H.S. budget, which cuts discretionary spending by about one-third. The signatories said the cuts would “effectively devastate” the nation’s research and public health infrastructure.The budget also proposes dismantling disease registries and surveillance systems. “If you don’t collect the information or keep these surveillance systems going, you don’t know what’s happening, you don’t know what the trends are,” said Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas.“You’re losing all of that history,” he said.In a previous position as director of chronic diseases for Texas, Dr. Huang said he worked closely with C.D.C. experts who successfully reduced tobacco use among Americans. “Eliminating the Office on Smoking and Health is just craziness if you’re still wanting to address chronic diseases,” he said.ImageThe chronic disease center included programs aimed at preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageSmoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, causing more than 480,000 deaths each year, according to the C.D.C.Credit...Jenny Kane/Associated PressSmoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, causing more than 480,000 deaths each year, according to the C.D.C.More than one in 10 American adults still smoke cigarettes regularly, but rates vary drastically by region, and C.D.C. surveillance helps target cessation programs to areas where they are needed most.“Smoking rates have come down, but if the federal government takes its foot off the gas, the tobacco companies are ready to pop back up again,” said Erika Sward, assistant vice president for advocacy at the American Lung Association.She warned that tobacco companies are constantly developing new products like nicotine pouches, whose use by teenagers doubled last year. “It will take a lot more money to put the genie back in the bottle,” she said.The C.D.C.’s chronic disease center works with communities and academic centers to promote effective programs, from creating quitting hotlines to reach young Iowans in rural areas to training members of Black churches in Columbia, S.C., to lead exercise and nutrition classes for their congregations.In rural Missouri, dozens of walking trails have been developed in the “boot heel” in the southeastern part of the state, an area with high rates of obesity and diabetes, said Ross Brownson, a public health researcher at Washington University in St. Louis who directs the Prevention Research Center in collaboration with the C.D.C.“There’s strong evidence now that if you change the walkability of a community, people will get more physical activity,” Dr. Brownson said. “There aren’t going to be health clubs in rural communities, but there is nature and the ability to have walking trails, and land is relatively cheap.”With C.D.C. support, in Rochester, N.Y., people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing are being trained to lead exercise and wellness programs for other hearing-impaired people who can’t easily participate in other gym classes.In San Diego, researchers are testing ways to protect farm workers from exposure to ultraviolet rays and heat-related illnesses.“Once they are up and started, they are community-driven and don’t depend on the government,” said Allison Bay, who recently lost her job managing such projects at the C.D.C.The C.D.C.’s reorganization also eliminated lead poisoning programs. Lead poisoning is also “one of our greatest public health threats in the city of Cleveland,” said Dr. David Margolius, director of public health for the city.The C.D.C. does not directly fund Cleveland’s lead programs — the funding comes from the state. “But just having the federal expertise to call on to help lead us toward a lead-free future, I mean, yeah, that has a big impact on us,” he said.Michael CrowleyMichael Crowley reports on the State Department and U.S. foreign policy.Trump takes aim, again, at foreign aid.ImageThe State Department in Washington.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesPresident Trump wants to slash the State Department’s budget by $26.5 billion.That proposed cut comes after his administration earlier this year eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development and most of the hundreds of programs it operated, cutbacks that totaled nearly $22 billion.The biggest State Department cut would come through the elimination of $8.3 billion in U.S. economic and development aid, which the budget document says “has been funneled to radical, leftist priorities,” including climate change and L.G.B.T.Q. programs. The State Department does fund such programs globally, but they are only a fraction of such assistance overall.Another $6.2 billion would be chopped from global health spending, which Mr. Trump’s budget says “liberal NGOs” — nongovernmental organizations — use to fund or promote abortion. The cut far exceeds the amount of money that goes to organizations that do such work, however, and almost certainly encompasses cuts to other public health programs.Some spending must be cut as a result of Mr. Trump’s January executive order reinstating a federal ban, imposed by every Republican president since Ronald Reagan and rescinded by Democratic ones, on U.S. funding for foreign nongovernmental organizations that “perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.” The budget says it will focus spending on “lifesaving assistance and preventing infectious diseases from reaching the United States.” It also notes that it will preserve the spending by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief for its current beneficiaries.Another $3.2 billion would be chopped from “unaffordable levels of disaster assistance far in excess of what other countries contribute.” The plan would also end America’s $1.6 billion annual contribution to U.N. peacekeeping missions.Also targeted: Educational and cultural exchange programs, which would be eliminated entirely, saving $690 million. The budget says that foreign students who visit the United States and gain valuable skills “leave to take those skills overseas, including back to near-peer rivals, having deprived American students of places to acquire those skills.”Those programs include the Fulbright Foreign Student Program and TechWomen, which brings to the United States women who work in the fields of science, technology engineering and math for mentorship and exchange programs. The budget also erases programs for U.S. citizens, including the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program and American Music Abroad, which sends American musicians on tour around the world to build good will.The budget would also eliminate the National Endowment for Democracy’s $315 million in annual funding. Breaking from decades of U.S. policy, Trump officials have cracked down on federal spending to promote democracy abroad, to the delight of foreign strongmen.The budget proposes modest offsets to the State Department cuts, through the creation of a new $2.9 billion America First Opportunity Fund to focus on “strategic investments,” including repatriations, countering China and supporting “critical partners, such as India and Jordan.” And it would increase spending for the Development Finance Corporation by $2.8 billion.The Development Finance Corporation was created during the Trump administration to bankroll international infrastructure projects, cooperating with the State Department to support U.S. foreign policy and curb Chinese influence.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTScience backers say proposed federal research cuts pose dire risks.ImageA research chemist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Trump administration is proposing large budget cuts to the organization, which is responsible for setting standards of measurements used by scientists worldwide.Credit...Joanna Kulesza for The New York TimesPresident Trump’s proposed budget in the next fiscal year calls for firm support of artificial intelligence and quantum research but makes large cuts to many other parts of the sprawling enterprise of scientific research funded by the federal government.Only Congress has the power to enact such proposals, but if it does in this case, “the consequences for the future of our nation will be catastrophic,” said Sudip Parikh, head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, one of the world’s largest scientific societies. “The United States will no longer be in the global race” for leadership in research and development, he added. “We will have lost it.”Figures published by the society show that China has greatly increased its support for the scientific enterprise in the past two decades. As of 2023, the most recent year available for comparisons, China’s investment was close to matching the United States.One of Mr. Trump’s biggest reductions would be a 55.8 percent cut from the budget of the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the nation’s most basic research from which many applied scientific discoveries spring. It would fall to $3.9 billion from $8.8 billion.Smaller scientific agencies would also lose much of their funding, such as the U.S. Geological Survey, which would have its budget fall to about $800 million from $1.5 billion, according to the association’s figures.And the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is responsible for setting standards of measurement used by scientists worldwide, would need to work with $830 million after previously being appropriated $1.16 billion, the association said.The proposed cuts may be compounded by new policies to reduce payments that go to the shared overhead costs at universities, such as heat, technical support and building maintenance. The N.S.F. announced on Friday that, starting next week, it will only allow 15 percent of grant money to cover so-called indirect costs. Other agencies are reportedly making similar cuts to their indirect cost rate.The new rate is so low that scientists fear that it will become impossible to carry forward their work.“Trump’s mission to destroy U.S. science research continues,” Matthew Green, a computer scientist at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Bluesky on Friday.The Democrats on the Science Committee in the House of Representatives warned about the effects of such cuts on the nation’s “economic and national security future.”“The president obviously doesn’t understand that without robust American science, America will lose — plain and simple,” Zoe Lofgren, the California representative who is the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement.“For decades,” Ms. Lofgren continued, “we have worked on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our competitiveness and make the research ecosystem here in the United States the envy of the world. We succeeded in that. Now Donald Trump is rapidly destroying that foundation in a matter of months.”ImageFormer federal workers protesting against Trump administration policies in front of the Hubert Humphrey Health and Human Services building in Washington in February.Credit...Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAccording to a White House summary document, Mr. Trump’s proposed budget “maintains funding for research in artificial intelligence and quantum information science at key agencies, to ensure the United States remains on the cutting edge of these critical technologies’ development and responsible use.”Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, defended the overall science budget, saying in a statement that the administration was “refocusing investments in the priority areas that America must continue to lead in, securing our standing as a global tech leader and ending woke science spending.”That is the administration’s code word for both climate programs and ones seeking to encourage diversity, equity and inclusion.Ms. LaCivita added: “President Trump recognizes that artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy are amongst the most important technologies of our lifetime. They are crucial to maintaining our economic and national security.”The proposed budget follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to trim and reshape the U.S. scientific enterprise through executive orders and agency mandates.Words related to “woke” efforts began disappearing from federal science websites. The agencies have already shrunk after some recent hires were laid off and other employees accepted early retirement and buyout offers. Multiple freezes to new and existing awards have occurred at the National Science Foundation, which began canceling grants last month.Jason DeParleJason DeParle reports on poverty in the United States. Trump seeks to end permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless.ImageA homeless encampment in New Orleans in January. President Trump’s budget proposal would increase funding for emergency shelters but end aid for permanent supportive housing.Credit...Kathleen Flynn for The New York TimesWhile President Trump’s budget proposal seeks significant cuts in spending on homelessness programs, its larger impact would come from changes in how the money is spent.With homelessness at record levels, the plan would increase money for emergency shelters but end aid for permanent supportive housing, the focus of a decades-long movement to serve society’s most vulnerable.More than 300,000 people live in such housing, all chronically homeless and disabled. Many are veterans. Critics warn that the change would not only forestall the expansion of the permanent housing stock but force evictions of those it currently helps, who rely on the deep subsidies that the budget eliminates.“This is counter to the stated goal of reducing street homelessness, because it’s putting people back on the streets,” said Barbara Poppe, a consultant to local governments who worked on homelessness issues in the Obama administration.The Trump proposal would abolish two programs that finance long-term housing — the Continuum of Care Program and Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — and move them into the Emergency Solutions Grant Program. That program finances short-term shelters and housing limited to two years.The proposed cut of $532 million amounts to a reduction of about 12 percent in combined spending. But none of the remaining money can be spent on long-term housing, which supporters see as the most important safety net.Permanent supportive housing emerged three decades ago as a solution to chronic homelessness, initially with bipartisan support. Under a philosophy called Housing First, it provides deeply subsidized housing and offers — but does not require clients to accept — services for addiction or mental illness.Proponents say it saves lives by getting chronically homeless people off the streets, where they die at high rates. But in recent years, some conservatives have called the approach permissive and said it fails to address the underlying problems many homeless people face. Some blame it for recent surges in the unhoused population.Many people come to permanent supportive housing after a decade or more on the streets. In limiting their housing aid to two years, the Trump plan does not address the question of what should happen after that.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmong the many cuts in the proposed budget is the total elimination of the C.D.C.’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which worked to reduce rates of gun violence, drug overdoses, car accidents, and even childhood drownings.This would be felt locally, since more than 80 percent of the injury center’s budget goes directly to states, cities and nonprofit organizations that are collecting data and rolling out evidence-based programs. When the proposed budget was released on Friday, all but two of the injury experts and staffers listed on the center’s website vanished.The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities issued a strong objection Friday to Trump’s proposed cuts in federal student aid, saying that the administration’s proposal would “leave students shouldering higher costs, or put college entirely out of reach. And it would devastate the ability to meet the workforce needs of tomorrow.”Trump’s budget flops with some powerful Republican lawmakers.Senators Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell and Roger Wicker made clear their disdain for President Trump’s budget.President Trump’s budget drew harsh criticism on Friday from a trio of powerful Republican senators, who rejected what they said were woefully inadequate resources for the military, and suggested they would ignore his plan and ensure that Congress provided far more money for their priorities.In separate statements, the senior Republicans — Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the appropriations committee; and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on defense — expressed their disdain for Mr. Trump’s proposal.Their collective pushback amounted to a rare moment of defiance at a time when Republicans on Capitol Hill have done little to fend off the White House’s efforts to slash federal programs.Mr. Wicker said the administration’s proposed military spending levels would “shred to the bone our military capabilities and our support to service members.”“President Trump successfully campaigned on a Peace Through Strength agenda, but his advisers at the Office of Management and Budget were apparently not listening,” Mr. Wicker said. He said that Mr. Trump’s budget would effectively flatline military funding for the fifth straight year, “which is a cut in real terms.”Congressional Republicans are planning on approving roughly $150 billion in new defense spending through their sprawling tax cuts legislation. It is meant for specific new projects — not as a general-use boost to the Pentagon’s budget. In their budget request, administration officials factored in that money, and made the case that they planned to increase military spending by 13 percent.Hawkish Republicans on Capitol Hill view that gambit as an accounting gimmick, and want to see military spending levels raised through the regular appropriations process.“Make no mistake: A one-time influx reconciliation spending is not a substitute for full-year appropriations,” Mr. McConnell said. “It’s a supplement.”Ms. Collins, who called the budget proposal “late” and lacking in important details, nonetheless made it clear she did not approve.After a preliminary review, she said, she had “serious objections” to the defense portion. And she criticized Mr. Trump’s plan to gut or eliminate domestic programs including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps to offset high utility bills for low-income people across the country; another that provides federal educational services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and others that support biomedical research.“Ultimately,” she noted in her statement, “it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.”Mr. McConnell also noted in his statement that only Congress could set and approve federal spending levels, and that lawmakers often disregard the numbers laid out in the president’s budget request.“America cannot expect our allies to heed calls for greater annual defense spending if we are unwilling to lead by example,” Mr. McConnell, the former Republican leader, said. “Fortunately, presidential budget requests are just that: requests. Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power — and the credibility of our commitments — are appropriately resourced. I hope and expect that my colleagues will join me in placing America’s national security first.”Many Republicans cheered Mr. Trump’s budget, which Speaker Mike Johnson called a “bold blueprint that reflects the values of hardworking Americans and the commitment to American strength and prosperity.”But the dissent from some Republican lawmakers in both chambers was notable at a time when few of them have spoken out about any of the president’s moves.Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, called the cut to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program “reckless,” and said it would leave his constituents “out in the cold.”Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he was “very concerned the requested base budget for defense does not reflect a realistic path to building the military capability we need to achieve President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, slammed President Trump’s budget blueprint, saying that it would “tank the economy and hike costs for everyday Americans.” When announcing a state budget agreement earlier this week, she pointed out that New York had already been hit with about $1.2 billion in federal cuts, and said that Congressional Republicans needed to do more to stand up to Trump’s proposals, which would hurt their constituents.“While I’m doing everything in my power to protect New Yorkers from these devastating blows, no state in the nation can backfill the cuts that the President is proposing,” Hochul said in a statement.Eric LiptonEric Lipton has spent the last 18 months examining SpaceX contracts with the federal government and how federal agencies regulate SpaceX and other companies controlled by Elon Musk.Elon Musk and SpaceX would be big winners if Trump’s budget is approved.ImageElon Musk at the White House in April.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesElon Musk and SpaceX are big winners in Donald J. Trump’s 2026 spending plan.President Trump is delivering on Mr. Musk’s wish list at both NASA and the Pentagon to reorient federal spending on space in a way likely to drive billions of dollars in new business to Mr. Musk’s space technology company, if Congress signs off on the budget plan.At the Pentagon, Mr. Trump is calling for a massive jump in spending, an extraordinary 13 percent increase, almost entirely through allocations in a Congressional budget reconciliation plan under consideration.The jump would happen while many other federal agencies would be slashed, in part to supercharge federal spending in two areas where SpaceX is positioned to profit: a vast missile defense system and space missions to Mars and the moon.Mr. Trump has proposed a Golden Dome defense system to track and kill missiles headed toward U.S. targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other rivals.Pentagon officials say SpaceX is considered likely to be the top recipient of this burst of new spending, which could generate billions of dollars in new contracts for the company.That is because SpaceX manufactures both rockets that can launch military payloads into orbit and satellite systems that can deliver the surveillance and targeting tools needed for the project, which would require the largest military investments the United States has ever made in space.Mr. Trump’s budget plan also calls for an undisclosed but large amount of new money for “U.S. space dominance to strengthen U.S. national security.”The giant load of expected new business for SpaceX, which already had started to become clear based on policy shifts Mr. Trump has made since January, has drawn questions from Democrats in Washington, who have questioned if Mr. Musk is cashing in on his enormous contributions toward Mr. Trump’s re-election and his position as a top White House adviser.SpaceX is already, by far, the largest recipient of Pentagon spending on existing military low-earth-orbit communications systems, and it gets the largest cut of Pentagon rocket launch contracts. Congressional approval for the plan to significantly expand this spending would be a giant win for Mr. Musk and SpaceX.Mr. Trump’s proposed budget calls for Pentagon spending for 2026 to be $113 billion greater than for this year. But that increase would come entirely from allocations Congress is considering via its reconciliation plan for the 2025 fiscal year, according to Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former space industry executive, who pointed to a footnote in Mr. Trump’s plan.NASA’s budget faces overall cuts in Mr. Trump’s plan, but there are increases that largely match SpaceX’s own corporation priorities.The spending plan goes after Mr. Musk’s commercial rivals, calling for NASA to phase out funding for the Space Launch System, a rocket program being led by Boeing, and also the Orion astronaut capsule, being built by Lockheed Martin, which was part of three planned flights to take humans back to the moon.Instead, Mr. Trump’s budget calls for “more cost effective commercial systems that would support more ambitious subsequent lunar missions,” an industry that SpaceX now dominates. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, which has developed its own new rocket, also could be a big beneficiary of this shift, industry executives said Friday.Both Blue Origin and SpaceX have moon landing systems that NASA is contracted to use and that have not, at least so far, been targeted for cuts.“Their design is easier to do than SpaceX,” said Doug Loverro, a former NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations who has also been an adviser to the Trump administration, referring to Blue Origin’s moon landing plan.The NASA budget also calls for $1 billion in new spending to focus on a mission to Mars, which has been the primary driving force for Mr. Musk since he first started SpaceX. He is already building a new rocket, called Starship, to attempt to deliver on this plan.“SpaceX’s handprints are all over this,” said Mo Islam, a co-founder of Payload, a commercial space news site. “I don’t see there is any other way to look at it. SpaceX is positioned to be the primary beneficiary of the majority of these budgetary moves.”There are some items in the NASA budget that could result in declines in spending at SpaceX, such as less spending on the International Space Station, where SpaceX delivers both cargo and astronauts.But SpaceX still will likely emerge the winner. It recently won an $843 million contract to “de-orbit” the space station when it is retired in 2030. And Mr. Musk has pushed Mr. Trump to speed up that retirement date.“The decision is up to the President, but my recommendation is as soon as possible,” Mr. Musk wrote on his social media platform, X, in February.It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let’s go to Mars.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2025 In the 2024 fiscal year, SpaceX secured $3.8 billion in federal contracts, most of it from NASA and the Pentagon. The company has taken a total of $18 billion in federal contracts overall in the last decade, a New York Times analysis of federal contracting data shows.Experts like Mr. Loverro have long argued that NASA is too focused on an over-budget and behind-schedule moon program called Artemis, particularly the parts of the effort that rely on Boeing and Lockheed. That said, Mr. Loverro said the new spending plan “does impact SpaceX in a lot of very positive ways.”But Mr. Harrison, the former industry executive, said it also opens up SpaceX and the Trump administration to potential criticism.“It taints this now all with a suspicion of improper influence,” Mr. Harrison said. “Even if these are legitimate questions.”Trump proposes slashing funding for rental assistance and affordable housing programs.ImagePresident Trump’s proposal would substantially reduce aid for low-income families that rely on rental assistance, even as demand for federal subsidies typically exceeds available funding.Credit...Jose A. Alvarado Jr. for The New York TimesThe Trump administration proposed cutting roughly $33 billion in funding for the Housing and Urban Development Department, a move that would slash programs meant to boost the supply of affordable housing, reduce homelessness and fund community development projects.The plan would cut more than $26 billion in funding for federal rental assistance programs, and institute a two-year cap on subsidies for “able-bodied adults.” It would also seek to change the way the federal government doles out rental assistance, shifting responsibility to states to design their own programs “based on their unique needs and preferences.”The proposal would substantially reduce aid for low-income families that rely on rental assistance, even as demand for federal subsidies typically exceeds available funding. But president Trump’s budget cuts would still have to be approved by Congress.Trump officials said that deep cuts for the housing department were necessary, because they believed that state and local governments were better equipped to address housing affordability and supply challenges. The administration also said it was seeking to cancel some funds that were used for “equity” under the guise of affordable housing purposes. The proposal amounted to a roughly 43 percent budget reduction for the agency.“President Trump’s bold budget proposes a reimagining of how the federal government addresses affordable housing and community development,” Scott Turner, the housing secretary, said in a statement. “It furthers our mission-minded approach at HUD of taking inventory of our programs and processes to address the size and scope of the federal government, which has become too bloated and bureaucratic to efficiently function.”Officials called for eliminating a $3.3 billion program that provided block grants to more than 1,200 state and local governments to fund community development activities, such as economic development projects, housing rehabilitation and infrastructure upgrades. The administration said the program was “poorly targeted,” and that it would be better funded by state and local governments.Mr. Trump’s budget would also scale back funding for several programs that are intended to address the nation’s affordable housing crisis.It would cut a roughly $1 billion program that provides state and local governments funding to build or rehabilitate affordable housing for low-income households. Trump officials said the federal government’s involvement “increases the regulatory burden of producing affordable housing,” and that state and local officials would better address those challenges.It would trim $100 million for a program that encourages communities to remove barriers to affordable housing development, including restrictive zoning designations. In its proposal to eliminate the program, Trump officials said the funds had been used by local governments to pursue “racial, gender, and climate goals.”The budget proposal would also cut $532 million for homeless assistance programs. The proposal would consolidate two programs, Continuum of Care and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, into a “more targeted” program that would cap housing assistance at two years for homeless and at-risk individuals.About $479 million in funding for housing assistance for Native Americans would also be cut. And $60 million for a program that provides fair housing organizations funding to assist people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination would be cut under the proposal.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTrump’s plan proposes sweeping cuts to climate and renewable energy programs.ImageThe president’s budget outline calls for about $1.5 billion in cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Credit...Jason Andrew for The New York TimesThe Trump administration in its 2026 budget blueprint is proposing to dismantle many of the federal government’s biggest programs to study, prepare for and mitigate global warming.Under the proposal, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, one of the world’s premier centers for climate science, would see its budget cut by roughly a quarter, or $1.5 billion. The Trump administration said it would terminate a wide variety of climate research grants, claiming that NOAA has “consistently funded efforts to radicalize students against markets and spread environmental alarmism.”While the document did not specify which programs would be eliminated, scientists have warned that the cuts could hobble research on things like early warning systems for natural disasters, science education and the study of the Arctic, where temperatures have increased nearly four times as fast as the rest of the planet over the past four decades.The proposal would also reduce the Department of Energy’s annual budget by 9.4 percent, or $4.7 billion, mainly by cutting programs related to renewable energy and climate change.Even more significantly, the proposal aims to cancel roughly $15 billion in clean-energy funding that the Energy Department received under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill to spur new technologies that could help reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases. The cuts would mean pulling back on funds intended to encourage battery manufacturing, to develop technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the air and to expand electric-vehicle charging.In a document accompanying the blueprint, the Trump administration said the proposal “eliminates funding for the Green New Scam,” using Mr. Trump’s catchall phrase for the climate policies of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Under Mr. Biden, the federal government sought to promote technologies like solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles to help reduce emissions. But the Trump administration said it would end many of those programs, calling renewable energy “unreliable” and arguing that a $6 billion program to build electric-vehicle chargers was “wasteful and ineffective.” Instead, agencies would focus on promoting fossil fuels like oil and gas as well as technologies like nuclear power.The Biden administration has already awarded most of the clean-energy funding authorized under the infrastructure law to different companies, such as $7 billion to create “hubs” for hydrogen fuels and $6 billion to help industrial companies reduce their emissions. But not all of that money has actually gone out the door, and lawmakers have for months been speculating that the Energy Department might try to cancel or pull back funding awards. That has prompted a fierce lobbying battle to save projects.Other environmental agencies would also see steep cuts under Mr. Trump’s proposal.The Environmental Protection Agency would see its budget reduced by 54.5 percent, or $5 billion. The administration proposed ending the E.P.A.’s work in poor and vulnerable communities, saying that environmental justice programs “gave taxpayer dollars to political cronies who exploited the program’s racial preferencing policies to advance an anti-oil and gas crusade.”Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a coalition of former E.P.A. employees, called the budget plan “shortsighted” and said, “This is a wrecking-ball approach that would gut America’s frontline defense for protecting people’s health and the environment.”The Interior Department, which manages millions of acres of public lands and water, would see its budget cut by roughly 30.5 percent, or $5.1 billion. The Bureau of Land Management conservation programs would shrink by $198 million, while various tribal and Bureau of Indian Affairs programs and grants would face nearly $1 billion in cuts. The National Park Service would receive a $900 million cut at a time when national parks are dealing with widespread staff layoffs, longer lines, closed trailheads and shortened hours at visitors centers.The proposed budget eliminates Job Corps, a Department of Labor program since the 1960s that provides career training and education for low-income teens and young adults. The program, which the White House called “a failed experiment,” has long been a target of Republican administrations, and has been troubled by accusations of waste and safety concerns.President Trump’s proposed budget requests $13.8 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $359 million, with much of it intended to addressing the national shortage of air traffic controllers. The budget outlines a $5 billion investment to upgrade the infrastructure of the national airspace system, including a proposed increase of $824 million for the year. This includes a $450 million initial investment toward a multiyear, multi-billion-dollar radar replacement initiative — an effort as ambitious as it is overdue. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFunds for low-income students are on the chopping block in Trump’s budget.ImageDemonstrators protested the dismantling of the Education Department in March.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesPresident Trump’s budget proposal would shrink the Education Department, which he has called on Congress to eliminate, by slashing its funding by 15 percent, or $12 billion.The most significant chunk of that reduction, about $4.5 billion, would come from K-12 schools. The administration said this reduction would come from a plan to provide “streamlined, flexible funding to the states” and relieve the federal government of the responsibility of administering the money and enforcing compliance. These cuts would not impact Title I funding for low-income schools, an Education Department spokeswoman said.Mr. Trump would save $1.6 billion by cutting programs aimed at supporting low-income students and preparing them for college. The administration said these programs, known at TRIO and GEAR UP, were “a relic of the past” because access to college was not “the obstacle it was for students of limited means.”Other significant cuts come from slashing nearly $1 billion from federal work-study programs; $910 million from a program for college students with exceptional financial need; $890 million from services to help immigrant students become proficient English speakers; $729 million from adult education services; and $315 million from preschool development grants.The budget proposal also would cut $64 million in funding for Howard University, the nation’s only federally chartered historically Black college and university.One corner of the education budget that the Trump administration would like to boost is charter schools. His budget proposal would increase federal support for new charter schools by $60 million, or about 8.3 percent.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the proposal “cuts much of what helps poor, working-class and middle-class Americans get ahead.”“Our concern when the president started dismantling the Department of Education was not the bureaucracy, but the funding,” Ms. Weingarten said. “And now we know, he’s actually shortchanging kids. He would gut K-12 programs by $5.4 billion. Support for student aid is slashed.”Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said the budget proposal reflected her mandate to “serve as the final secretary of education.” Closing the Education Department would require approval from Congress, which has been opposed to such a move.“President Trump’s proposed budget puts students and parents above the bureaucracy,” Ms. McMahon said in a statement. “The federal government has invested trillions of taxpayer dollars into an education system that is not driving improved student outcomes. We must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”A correction was made onMay 2, 2025: An earlier version of this article misstated where some of the cuts outlined in the government’s budget came from. The most significant reductions would come from K-12 schools, but not schools designated as Title I.",

His blueprint depicted many core government functions as woke, weaponized, wasteful or radical, as the president looked to justify his request that Congress chop domestic spending to its lowest level in the modern era.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Trump proposed cutting funding for some federal law enforcement, including the F.B.I. He called on lawmakers to slash money meant to police tax evasion at the Internal Revenue Service. He recommended striking billions in funds that help finance clean water projects. And the president reserved some of his deepest cuts for education, health and science, including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would see their budgets cut by around half.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemocrats immediately rebuked Mr. Trump for his proposal. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, called it “heartless” and an “all-out assault on hardworking Americans.” Even some Republicans took issue with Mr. Trump’s budget, although others, like Speaker Mike Johnson, endorsed the blueprint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Trump also asked Congress to reduce, if not eliminate, billions of dollars in federal aid to help the poorest Americans. For one, the White House called for reconfiguring federal programs that provide rental assistance to low-income families, cutting aid by more than $26 billion next fiscal year. And the administration proposed the termination of a federal initiative, backed by some Republicans, that aids needy families in paying their monthly heating bills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn one of the few spending increases included in the budget, Mr. Trump asked lawmakers to bolster spending at the Department of Homeland Security by more than $43 billion, furthering his work to crack down on immigration, conduct deportations and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The president also requested more than $1 trillion for the military next fiscal year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut he asked lawmakers to approve that increase essentially on a one-time basis, as part of a broader legislative package — due later this year — meant to advance the president’s tax agenda. The approach angered some Republicans, who signaled they would pursue a larger increase to military spending as part of the yearly process to fund government agencies and programs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It is peculiar how much time the president’s advisers spend talking about restoring peace through strength, given how apparently unwilling they’ve been to invest accordingly in the national defense or in other critical instruments of national power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans’ former Senate leader, in a statement that denounced the administration’s “accounting gimmicks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Mr. Trump, the budget served to formalize his conservative vision and his disruptive reorganization of the government, a campaign that has already shuttered entire agencies and dismissed thousands of federal workers without the explicit approval of Congress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of Mr. Trump’s proposed military increases could benefit Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who has advised Mr. Trump on cost-cutting as part of the Department of Government Efficiency\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Trump’s budget supported the creation of a new missile defense shield and a renewed campaign for “U.S. space dominance.” Both are areas in which Mr. Musk and his rocket company, SpaceX, could stand to win major contracts funded by any increase in spending.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a letter Friday accompanying the spending blueprint, Russell T.

Totaling about $1.7 trillion, after accounting for the full set of spending changes the president seeks, the budget serves only as a formal guide to Congress, where it immediately generated opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: He wants to outright defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with his reckless tariffs,” Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the leading Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe criticism was not limited to Democrats, as Republicans also raised alarm about cuts to some programs that serve the neediest Americans. Outlining her “serious objections,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who leads the Appropriations Committee, added in a statement: “Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy releasing the budget, Mr. Trump set the stage for what is bound to be a complicated, monthslong process to fund the government and avert a shutdown before an existing spending deal expires on Sept. 30. Entering that fight, many Republicans have echoed Mr. Trump’s desire to slash federal spending, though warring G.O.P. factions have disagreed at times over the exact scope.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParty lawmakers have also raced to identify potentially trillions of dollars in cuts that they can include to finance a related package that would expand a set of expiring tax cuts for families and businesses, one of the president’s signature — and costliest — economic policy priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Mr. Trump’s proposal carries additional significance. He and his top budget adviser, Mr. Vought, subscribe to the idea that the commander in chief wields expansive authority to halt or cancel spending, even if Congress instructs otherwise.
