  "text": "It’s data from families that say their kids have been acting with bad behavior Recent events reminded me of a satirical article titled Hospital to Replace Doctors With Parents Who Have Done Their Research. It said:  A large tertiary care center in Sydney, Australia is pulling out all the stops to try and cut their expenses. As of next month, all doctors and nurses currently on staff will be replaced by parents who have done research on the Internet. Comments by Dr. Marty Makary, the head of the FDA, sparked my memory. He has been sounding very much like someone who has done his own “research”, using anecdotes to make decisions not just for himself, but for the entire country. During one recent interview he said: We have a lot of data and it may not necessarily be the traditional 50 year randomized control trial follow up. It’s data from families that say their kids have been acting with bad behavior … and they eliminate the petroleum-based food dyes and the behavior improves. That is data. Actually, “families say” is not data. However, it is enough for him to make removing food dyes being from ice cream a top priority, a moment for public celebration. In the fictional MAHA universe, this is a major achievement that will have substantial health benefits for American children. I personally know of people who have been injured by the vaccine. While criticizing our medical establishment for these performative trivialities would be worthwhile in its own right, their embrace of personal testimonials as “data” reveals something more concerning- they confuse their wishes with reality, and it won’t be just Fruit Loops that are affected. This “research” method is now affecting vaccines. Dr. Makary also recently said: I personally know of people who have been injured by the vaccine. I personally know of friends who have lost a loved one from the mRNA COVID vaccine … People have a right to be angry. They have been deceived … I would ask people to be patient with us as we do this the proper scientific way. Apparently, Dr. Makary will do what no one has done previously and study the safety of COVID vaccines “the proper scientific way”. Until then, he personally knows people who have been injured by the vaccine and therefore, anyone who suggests it is safe has deceived the public. This is a common tactic of our medical establishment. In this video, along with EBM guru Dr. Vinay Prasad, Dr. Makary spoke of people who told him about vaccine side-effects. Why else would someone develop an illness weeks after getting vaccinated, he asked? What other explanation could there be? He said that “hundreds of thousands” of Americans say they have been vaccine-injured, but those claims have not been investigated- until now. In the video, Dr. Prasad, promised that under his leadership, vaccine-injuries would be taken seriously, and that his team was searching hard for more of them. Though these statements would rightly someone get one laughed out of a high school science class, none of this is new. Dr. Makary got his job precisely because he was willing to treat obvious, though malicious and painful hoaxes as irrefutable evidence when it comes to vaccines supposedly killing children. He was willing to praise and elevate America’s #1 anti-vaxxer, and this launched him to his current position. There’s almost certainly an underlying, co-morbid condition. While Dr. Makary spreads rumors regarding vaccine-harms, when it comes to viruses, he does the opposite. Instead of telling tall tales, he rejects reality. Nearly identical examples about measles and COVID are below. Compare the casual way he dismisses dead children with the seriousness and concern he showed for supposed vaccine injuries. Hoping to numb parents to potentially grave threats, he claims that viruses don’t kill healthy children. This obviously false, healthy children have died from COVID and measles. Moreover “soft eugenics” is appalling, and viruses can hurt kids without killing them. Though Dr. Makary is eager to repeat the drone-like MAHA buzzwords gold-standard science, transparency and common sense, what he really means is that he’s just someone who has done his “research”. Unfortunately, he has significant power and can use his “discoveries” to impose his will on the American people. The FDA Has Replaced its Leadership With Doctors Who Have Done Their “Research”. Satire has become reality. Dr. Jonathan Howard is a neurologist and psychiatrist who has been interested in vaccines since long before COVID-19. He is the author of \"We Want Them Infected: How the failed quest for herd immunity led doctors to embrace the anti-vaccine movement and blinded Americans to the threat of COVID.\" View all posts Posted by Jonathan Howard Dr. Jonathan Howard is a neurologist and psychiatrist who has been interested in vaccines since long before COVID-19.
