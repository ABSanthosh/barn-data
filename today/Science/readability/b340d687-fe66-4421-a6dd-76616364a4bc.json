This was the first time this system had been identified in European prehistory.Meanwhile, individuals with ancestries unrelated to the dominant line were mostly men, suggesting that they had moved from other communities to live with the families of their wives, according to a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.“I was not expecting such a strong signature of matrilocality,” said Lara Cassidy, an assistant professor in genetics at Trinity College Dublin who led the study. “When that came out of the data, it was a bit of a shock.”“But upon reflection, if you look at what classical writers were talking about and if you look at the archaeological context, there are a lot of hints that women were able to attain high status in these societies,” she added.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
