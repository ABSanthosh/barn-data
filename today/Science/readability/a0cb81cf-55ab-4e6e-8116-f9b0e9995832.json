AT\u0026T and T-Mobile have deployed mobile units where residents can drive to connect their phones to Wi-Fi and send messages.

They're quite accustomed to busy storm seasons, and ready to provide critical information to served agencies as Milton comes through.”“It’s not as nice as getting a phone call from a loved one,” says Mooneyhan, “but if you’re in an area where the cell service and land lines are totally disrupted, a message saying ‘I’m OK, everyone’s fine, don’t worry,’ that beats the heck out of not knowing.”",
