  "description": "Ethan Lindenberger never got vaccinated as a kid. So one day, he went on Reddit and asked a simple question: \"Where do I go to get vaccinated?\" The post went viral, landing Lindenberger in the middle of a heated debate about vaccination and, ultimately, in front of a US Senate committee. Less than a year later, the high school senior reports back on his unexpected time in the spotlight and a new movement he's leading to fight misinformation and advocate for scientific truth.After the talk, Shoshana interviews Dr. Jennifer Reich, a sociologist, and asks the question, “Where has vaccine mistrust come from?” -- and how transparency in clinical trials and federal advisory boards are key in gaining community trust.Want to help shape TED’s shows going forward?
