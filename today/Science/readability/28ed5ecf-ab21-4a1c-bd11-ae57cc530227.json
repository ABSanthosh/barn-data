Credit: AP Photo/Louise Delmotte The head of Japan's meteorological agency on Friday dismissed widespread rumors of a major earthquake in Japan this summer as unscientific and a \"hoax,\" urging people not to worry because even the most advanced science still cannot predict any quake or tsunami. \"At the moment, it is still impossible to predict an earthquake with specific timing, location or its magnitude,\" Japan Meteorological Agency Director General Ryoichi Nomura told reporters. \"Any such prediction is a hoax, and there is absolutely no need to worry about such disinformation.\" Nomura was referring to rumors in Hong Kong and other Asian cities of a major earthquake or a tsunami in July in Japan have led to flight cancellations and reductions in service, affecting tourism. He said it was \"unfortunate\" that many people are affected by the disinformation, though he sympathized with the sense of unease that the people tend to develop toward something invisible. The rumor originates from a 2022 Japanese comic book \"The future I saw,\" which features a dream foreseeing a tsunami and is also available in Chinese. The chatter began spreading earlier this year through social media, mainly in Hong Kong. The author previously gained attention for allegedly predicting the 2011 quake and tsunami in northern Japan, which killed more than 18,000 people. Japan, which sits on the Pacific \"ring of fire,\" is one of the world's most quake-prone countries. Last summer, a panel of seismologists noted a slight increase in the probability of a megaquake on Japan's Pacific coasts. The government organized an awareness-raising week but only triggered panic buying, beach closures and other overreactions and complaints. While it is important to inform people about the science, Nomura said, it is also necessary for everyone in this quake-prone country to take early precautions. \"In Japan, an earthquake can occur anytime, anywhere,\" Nomura said. \"So I ask everyone to take this opportunity to ensure your preparedness for a major quake.\" © 2025 The Associated Press.
