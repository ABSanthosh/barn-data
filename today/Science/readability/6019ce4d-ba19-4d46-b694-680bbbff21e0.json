  "text": "WHERE I WORK 06 January 2025 Seán Ronayne’s quest is to record all common bird species in Ireland, sharing both happy and sad stories about wildlife. Christine Ro Christine Ro is a freelance writer in London, UK. Seán Ronayne is a freelance ornithologist in Cork, Ireland. Credit: Chris Maddaloni “This picture shows me recording sounds on a typical day in Marlogue Woods, near Cobh, Ireland. When I was a child, my father would bring me to the countryside, where he would mimic bird sounds and test me on them. This was one of those places, so it’s special to me.I have degrees in zoology, marine biology and ecological impact assessment. But I’ve discovered where I want to work only in recent years. My passion lies in nature, but creative communication is where I found my voice. I love to capture stories of wildlife — good, bad, sad, happy — and to communicate them to people in my way. Scientific data and publications are important, but I want my stories to be accessible to everybody.I used to work for a consultancy company doing bird surveys of proposed building sites (I still survey as a subcontractor, and sell sounds for television, radio and games). I spent a lot of time in the office and found myself wanting to listen to soundtracks of nature. I realized I didn’t have recordings of wild habitats in Ireland. So I began recording in some of the last remnants of such places. I travelled to uplands and loughs (Irish lakes), and made an album from the trip called Wild Silence.
