Hinton were awarded the prize “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.”The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has today decided to award the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield, Princeton University, U.S.A., and Geoffrey Hinton, University of Toronto, Canada, for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.John J.

Hinton were awarded the prize “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.”CreditCredit...Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOct. 8, 2024John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton received the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for discoveries that helped computers learn more in the way the human brain does, providing the building blocks for developments in artificial intelligence.The award is an acknowledgment of A.I.’s growing significance in the way people live and work. With their ability to make sense of vast amounts of data, artificial neural networks already have a major role in scientific research, the Nobel committee said, including in physics, where it is used to design new materials, crunch large amounts of data from particle accelerators and help survey the universe.The machine learning breakthroughs of Dr. Hopfield and Dr. Hinton “have showed a completely new way for us to use computers to aid and to guide us to tackle many of the challenges our society face,” the Nobel committee said.Neural networks — systems that learn skills by analyzing data and are named after the web of neurons in the human brain — are a part of everyday internet services, including search engines like Google, talking digital assistants like Apple’s Siri and chatbots like OpenAI ChatGPT. These services are rooted in mathematics and computer science, not physics.But research by Dr. Hopfield and Dr. Hinton in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped influence the development of the digital neural networks that have become part of the fabric of the modern internet.“If there was a Nobel Prize for computer science, our work would clearly be more appropriate for that,” Dr. Hinton, a recipient of the 2018 Turing Award who has been called the “godfather of A.I.,” said in a phone interview with The New York Times. “But there isn’t one.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
