That in turn set off widespread rumors on social media.Ms. Williams, 59, addressed the issue directly on Tuesday during an interview with New England Sports Network.“I think there’s some rumors around outside there that I’m losing weight and stuff,” she said. “No, I’m actually right at the same amount.”Ms. Williams is one of the two astronauts whose stay at the space station was stretched from eight days to eight months because of propulsion problems with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft that took them there in June. While taking pains to insist that Ms. Williams and Butch Wilmore, the other astronaut, were not stranded, NASA decided that Starliner would return to Earth empty and that Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore would join the space station crew until February. They are to head home on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft instead.A photograph that NASA released in late September showed Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore making pizza on the space station. Ms. Williams’s face appeared sunken and thin.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
