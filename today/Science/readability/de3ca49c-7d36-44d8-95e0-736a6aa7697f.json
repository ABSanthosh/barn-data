  "description": "Money worries are one of the biggest sources of anxiety in our lives. Psychologist Brad Klontz says these worries are shaped by more than the number in our bank accounts — they’re often driven by our unconscious beliefs. This week, we bring you a favorite 2022 conversation with Klontz, who says it’s possible to identify and change what he calls our “money scripts.”For more of our work, please consider joining our podcast subscription, Hidden Brain+. It's our home for conversations and ideas you won't hear anywhere else. Plus, you'll be providing vital support for the work that we do.
