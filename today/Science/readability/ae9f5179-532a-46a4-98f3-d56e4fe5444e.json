They are incredibly maneuverable. They are capable of hovering indefinitely” — an adaptation driven by a love of energy-rich nectar.As vehicles without crews have taken over the skies in conflicts, hummingbirds have become the subject of new research. The Flight Lab, accustomed to looking at the ecology, evolution and biomechanics of bird flight, is part of a broad effort, funded largely by U.S. defense dollars, to build a better robotic hummingbird. Mimicking these highly adapted birds — a phenomenon known as bio-inspiredtechnology — is the holy grail for the makers of flying robots.“A real hummingbird can fly circles around robotic humming birds,” Dr. Tobalske said. “They can fly circles around real birds too.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
