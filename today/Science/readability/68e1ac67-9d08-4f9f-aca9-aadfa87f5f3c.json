  "text": "I’ve been long-distance running on and off for the past 25 years. Every few years I enter a race just to see if I’m any closer to qualifying for the Boston Marathon, hoping the increasingly generous cutoff times for older athletes might offset my declining speed. Friends, the trend is not in my favour. Running and then triathlons led me to start drinking sports beverages. My usual hydration of choice while exercising has always been Gatorade. When I started running, it was the market leader. It was also cheap, and was universally used in races. Train with what you race with, I figured. Gatorade provides some sugar and a bit of salt, it never upset my stomach and I found it more palatable than water – whether it was almost frozen or warm as soup. So it’s all I’ve used. The market for sports beverages and particularly electrolytes has exploded. These products are widely marketed for hydration – not just for athletes – but for everyday living. If you listen to any podcast, you probably hear ads for companies like LMNT, which argues we should be consuming 4-6 grams of sodium per day, ideally with their sodium-rich packets you add to water. We’re constantly hearing the claim that water is not enough, and only electrolytes plus water can deliver optimal hydration and well-being. But are electrolyte powders really necessary for everyday living? In this post I want to look at the necessity and benefits of electrolyte powders and beverages for adults, outside of athletics. Optimizing fluid consumption and nutrition during exercise is a topic unto itself. Instead, I want to focus on electrolytes that are consumed outside of exercise situations, because that’s what the current marketing is pushing. Essential electrolytes in the body include sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and chloride. These minerals have critical roles in multiple physiologic functions, so, our bodies have mechanisms (mainly the kidneys) to keep levels tightly controlled in the bloodstream. The amount one needs to consume on a daily basis will vary based on age, physical activity, health status, and certain medical conditions, including pregnancy and lactation. But in most cases, micromanagement or even specific consumption of electrolytes isn’t needed. We get what our need from the food we eat, and we discard what we don’t need in our urine. Dehydration can cause electrolyte imbalances. When you lose fluids, be it by sweating, urination, or even vomiting, you are losing electrolytes. Strenuous, prolonged exercise can lead to significant fluid loss – but also sodium (and some potassium) loss. Endurance athletes aren’t the only ones that need to focus on staying hydrated and potentially replacing electrolytes. If you’re ill (especially if you’re vomiting, and not eating or drinking), it’s easy to become dehydrated and create an electrolyte imbalance. The same can be said for spending a lot of time in a hot environment. While water is essential, it may not be enough. Compensating for huge volumes of sweat by drinking water without replacing sodium can cause hyponatremia, which can be a serious medical issue. Now and then you’ll hear about cases of hyponatremia in endurance races, so the message to athletes to address significanct fluid loss with water AND electrolytes continues to be emphasized. What are electrolyte powders and drinks? Electrolyte powders are mineral powders that may be flavoured and can be added to water. They may include flavors, caffeine, vitamins, antioxidants, and sometimes carbohydrates. They vary widely in their ingredients and particularly, calorie count. Carbohydrate-containing beverages may be more appropriate for prolonged exercise, as they provide a source of energy, in addition to mineral replacement. Do you need electrolyte drinks and powders as part of your daily diet? For eons, humans have survived on earth without electrolyte powders, and that’s because we obtained electrolytes the natural way – through our food. The overwhelming majority of the time, you do not need to consume electrolytes. Exceptions include: If you’re engaged in vigorous exercise over 60-75 minutes, or if it is extremely hot when you exercise If you’re ill and have serious or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea If you’re sweating heavily for a long period Athletes or anyone with high sweat rates over prolonged periods may prefer electrolyte-containing beverage instead of water. Ideally, we would measure how much one is sweating and the salt concentration of your sweat, but this isn’t practical for obvious reasons. Stepping on the scale can help – if you’re losing a few pounds when you exercise – that’s water (plus electrolytes) lost and you may benefit from some minerals while you work out. Electrolytes yes, electrolyte powders, probably not The marketing for electrolyte beverages is impressive, making you feel like plain water just isn’t enough. And electrolytes added to water could potentially be absorbed more quickly. But in most cases, water is perfectly fine for to meet your hydration needs. Athlete or not, you need to ensure your diet and fluid intake contain enough sodium to compensate for losses through sweat and urine. For most people, that’s done without any intervention or any electrolyte supplements – no additional elements required.
