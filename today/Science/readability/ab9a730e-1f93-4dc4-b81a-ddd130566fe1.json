But A.I. models like AlphaFold make it possible to do that in a few hours or even minutes.That speed has real-world applications. AlphaFold has been cited in scientific studies more than 20,000 times, and biochemists have used the technology to accelerate the discovery of medicines.“We can draw a straight line from what we do to people being healthy,” Dr. Jumper said.It could also lead to new biological tools such as enzymes that efficiently break down plastic bottles and convert them into materials that are easily reused and recycled.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
