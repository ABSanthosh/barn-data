  "text": "We humans may be the only species that is aware of our mortality. We are obsessed with how to postpone the inevitable and, failing that, how to make the most of our lives. For much of our existence as a species, there was little we could do about either aging or death. In fact, for most of history, most of us died long before we actually aged. In the last few decades, molecular and cell biologists have made advances in understanding the underlying causes of aging, which raises the possibility of tackling aging itself.Researchers are exploring many mitigators: the beneficial pathways triggered by caloric restriction that improve health markers in old animals; targeting the inflammatory-compound-secreting senescent cells we accumulate as we grow older; boosting our stem-cell numbers; and revitalizing the energy-metabolizing mitochondria in our cells.These are all promising, but it will take some time before they are proven to be effective and safe in humans. While we wait for the biomedical establishment to come up with powerful ways to tackle aging itself, there are three simple measures that use our understanding of advances in biology and medicine to keep us in good health as we age.Eat LessA calorically restricted diet means consuming the bare minimum of calories while still getting all the nutrients we need. Such a diet is difficult to follow for most people and has been reported to slow down wound healing, possibly make you more prone to certain infections, cause you to lose muscle mass, feel cold, and suffer a loss of libido. However, a moderate diet that is balanced should provide many of the benefits observed of a calorically restricted diet. Michael Pollan said it best: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.Keep ExercisingPhysical activity turns on many of the pathways that stimulate mitochondrial production. It also helps maintain muscle and bone mass, a serious problem as we age; counters diabetes and obesity; improves sleep; and strengthens immunity. Aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health; load-bearing exercise helps maintain muscle mass. Both are important.Get Adequate SleepAll animals have the equivalent of sleep, because it is essential for life. Sleep is involved in repair mechanisms that prevent the buildup of damage to our cells, and sleep deprivation increases the risk of many diseases of aging, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. We need to ensure that we get an adequate amount of sleep.Embrace the SynergyThe trio of diet, exercise, and sleep will together be more beneficial than any therapy currently. These three measures are all synergistic. Each of these will make it easier to carry out the other two. For example, exercise will help you sleep better. Moreover, they will all help with other things that can help with healthy aging, including preventing obesity, which is a serious cause of many diseases of old age.Also Watch for These FactorsStress. It is known that stress has widespread metabolic effects that are harmful for health and accelerate aging. Reducing stress is always difficult, but the trio of activities mentioned can also help to reduce stress.Isolation. Many population studies point to loneliness resulting in poor health in old age. In an increasingly fragmented society, it’s important to maintain and nurture our social connections as we age.Purpose. People with a strong sense of purpose were healthier and less likely to die. One study found that one effective way to acquire a sense of purpose was to volunteer in activities that provide social interaction and bring benefits to the community or society.And Have Routine CheckupsBeyond these measures, there are some simple health precautions we should all take as we age. It is important to have routine and early checkups for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. All of these conditions can easily and cheaply be treated to increase our chances of good health in old age. In addition, good markers for early diagnoses are becoming available for a range of treatable diseases including some types of cancer. Early detection of breast, cervical, colorectal (bowel), skin, and prostate cancer can all improve clinical outcomes.",
