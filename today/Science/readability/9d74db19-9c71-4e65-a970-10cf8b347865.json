He is a paleontologist from Italy completing his doctoral degree at Cambridge.However, he is keenly interested in the Cambrian explosion, the period when complex life appeared in the oceans about 540 million years ago. The lineages of almost all the major living groups of animals can be traced back to the Cambrian.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
