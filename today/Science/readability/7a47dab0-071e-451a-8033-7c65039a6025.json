  "text": "The UK parliament is considering clamping down on how young people use smartphones. A bill brought forward by a Labour member of parliament proposes both banning phones in schools and raising the age at which children can consent to social media companies using their data.Calls for smartphone bans have been growing in the UK, driven by fears that the devices are driving a decline in kids’ mental health and ability to focus. Smartphone Free Childhood, a prominent pressure group inspired by Jonathan Haidt’s book The Anxious Generation, calls for parents to delay getting smartphones for their children until they are at least 13. Florida has already passed a law that bans under-14s from holding social media accounts, and Australia is considering similar restrictions.But academics warn that smartphone and social media bans are unlikely to be a catch-all solution to the problems facing young people. Experts on the impact of digital technologies argue that the legislation could end up shutting children out from the potential benefits of smartphones, and that more pressure should be put on social media companies to design better digital worlds for children.The latest proposed clampdown in the UK is thin on details, but the MP bringing the bill, Josh MacAllister, told the radio show Today that it would prevent social media companies making use of young peoples’ data until they are 16. “We can protect children from lots of the addictive bad design features that come from social media,” he said. The bill would also make a ban on phones in schools legally binding.The bill was introduced to the House of Commons on October 16 and is set to be debated on March 7, 2025. MacAllister submitted it as a private members’ bill—a way for MPs who are not members of the government to propose legislation. Private members’ bills rarely become law, but they can be a way to raise publicity and influence government legislation. Labour health secretary Wes Streeting posted on X in support of the bill, writing that concerns about smartphone use and its impact on mental health make for “a really timely debate.”The UK’s Department for Education already asks schools to prohibit access to phones throughout the school day, including during break and lunchtimes. According to research from the Policy Exchange think tank, 99 percent of secondary schools had some form of phone ban, although only 11 percent required children to either leave their phone at home or to lock it away at the start of the day. Other countries, such as Greece and France, have similar regulations.We know surprisingly little about the impact of smartphone bans in schools, says Sonia Livingstone, a professor at the London School of Economics who studies how digital technologies affect young people. There are relatively few good studies in this area, and those studies that have been done often point in contradictory directions. There is just about enough evidence to suggest that preventing children from accessing their phones improves concentration, says Livingstone, but it’s much harder to say that banning phones leads to less bullying or more play. “The research is just really insufficient for that,” she says.Separating out how specific issues like bullying, mental health, sleep time, exercise, and concentration are impacted by smartphones is extremely tricky, says Livingstone. She points to the lack of mental health services for young people and poor pay and conditions for teachers as other potential issues that get overlooked in favor of smartphone bans. Phones might be part of the problem, she says, but they’re also seized upon as an all-purpose solution. “They seem the bit we can do something about,” she says, “and they seem the most obvious new thing.”The proposed new bill would also raise the age at which children can consent to allow social media companies to use their date from 13 to 16. “If we can create a version of those apps and a version of smartphones effectively for U16s, it will make it easier for them to clock out and go do real-world activities,” MacAllister told the Today show. The UK already passed a law in 2023—the Online Safety Act—that is supposed to protect children from some kinds of content, but most parts of the act have yet to come into force.Rather than focusing on bans, legislators should think more about how to teach children to have healthier relationships with technology and hold tech companies to account, says Pete Etchells, a professor at Bath Spa University and author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time. “We need to think about how we design [digital technologies] better, and support people in understanding how to use them,” he says.And getting there, according to Etchells, means moving past simplistic narratives like assuming that restricting screen time will lead to more outdoor play. He points to a 2011 law in South Korea that banned children from playing online games between midnight and 6 in the morning. After four years, the ban had made no meaningful difference in terms of internet use or sleeping hours. The law was dropped in 2021.“If you talk to any mental health professional, any researcher in this area, they will tell you there’s no such thing as a single root cause for things getting worse or better,” Etchells says. Looking to smartphone restrictions as the main response to the problems facing young people might turn out to be the easy answer rather than the right one.",
