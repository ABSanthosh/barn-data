  "text": "Investigators are scrambling to figure out why a military helicopter and a passenger airplane collided and plunged into the Potomac River in Washington, DC, late Wednesday, the first major US air crash in 16 years.From the little that’s known, human error likely played a role, raising questions about a chronic shortage of air traffic controllers and pilots. During a press conference Thursday morning, President Donald Trump at times appeared to blame diversity programs within the Federal Aviation Administration and the helicopter’s pilots for the crash, though he admitted there were no known links between FAA hiring policies and the crash beyond “common sense.” Authorities may also be looking at coordination between military and civilian aviation.US officials say an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers plowed into the tail of a Bombardier CRJ-700 jet out of Wichita, Kansas, as the airliner was less than a mile from landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Video of the incident appeared to show the flaming remains of both aircraft tumble a few hundred feet into the shallow, icy river.The passenger jet, which was operated by regional carrier PSA Airlines on behalf of American Airlines, had 64 people on board, and police boats have already recovered 27 bodies. Officials said Thursday morning they expect there to be no survivors. The last aircraft tragedy this deadly in the United States was the Colgan Air crash in New York state in 2009.In a video released on Thursday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that the helicopter was associated with the Army’s 12th Aviation Battalion, which is based less than 20 miles from DC’s national airport. The secretary said the “fairly experienced” crew was conducting a required annual night evaluation and were equipped with night-vision goggles. The identity of those on board is known, and their next of kin are being informed.In a grainy video from the nearby Kennedy Center, a smaller light, presumably the helicopter, can be seen overtaking the brighter light of the plane, both of them flying low to the ground. The two collide in a massive explosion, splitting into several burning fragments.A few minutes before the American Airlines flight’s arrival, air traffic control asked if it could land on runway 33, a shorter runway. The pilots said yes, apparently switching runways during their approach. Some have wondered whether this change in flight path could have caught the Black Hawk off guard.But retired Air Force Brigadier General John Teichert told NewsNation television that this shouldn’t have caused a crash. “I think that while they would have been told to switch runways, it’s not this aggressive maneuver in a regional jet that would prompt them to reposition and be a surprise to the Black Hawk,” he said.Eighty percent of aviation accidents worldwide can be attributed to human error, and that is a prime candidate in this case, Marco Chan, a former pilot who now heads pilot programs at Buckinghamshire New University, told WIRED. “Perhaps safety protocols, human factors were at play,” he says. In recent years, the FAA has struggled to replace retiring air traffic controllers, even as the number of air passengers and flights rebounded after the pandemic. The FAA said last fall that it had exceeded its internal air traffic controller hiring goals for the year.Shortly before the crash on Wednesday night, air traffic control asked the helicopter if it had seen the aircraft and told it to “pass behind the CRJ,” which would have had the right of way unless the Black Hawk was on an urgent military mission. It’s not known if the helicopter responded.Military flights sometimes operate on different radio frequencies than passenger flights, so the passenger jet’s crew may not have heard the tower radioing the Black Hawk. Or there may have been a jammed transmission: If more than one party on a channel are radioing at the same time, that can prevent others from hearing the whole conversation.The airline pilots probably didn’t see the helicopter, and even if they had, it would likely have been too late, Chan says. “They would be very focused on the final approach on the actual landing on the runway. It would be very difficult to do anything at the end,” he says. “[The Black Hawk] would have been under the wing and flying toward the tail, and the pilots in the cockpit, they are at the front. It would have been very difficult for them to spot the helicopter.”Until the black box recorders are retrieved from the passenger plane, it’s impossible to know for sure what the passenger pilots didn’t know or didn’t see as they came in for landing.Several hours after the accident President Trump posted on Truth Social, stating that air traffic control should have told the helicopter how to maneuver to avoid the jet. “This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented,” the president said. Trump posted again on the platform on Thursday morning, thanking emergency responders and saying he had been fully briefed and that he was monitoring the situation.During a press conference later on Thursday, the president then appeared to blame FAA diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives for the crash, though he said he didn’t have any evidence demonstrating clear links. He also seemed to ascribe the tragedy to former US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. New Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the crash “preventable.”Allegations of overwork and fatigue have been plaguing air travel. The number of people flying has recovered since Covid and even exceeded pre-pandemic numbers. Hiring hasn’t been able to keep up.Air traffic controllers are particularly understaffed. Twenty-six critical air traffic facilities are staffed below the FAA’s 85-percent threshold, according to the US Department of Transportation.In July, the FAA agreed to increase mandatory rest time to 10 to 12 hours between shifts for air traffic controllers after a handful of near accidents.Last year, a controller cleared a FedEx plane to land on a runway in Austin, Texas, while a Southwest Airlines flight was taking off from it. Fatigue was not explicitly cited as a factor in the investigation, but controllers have complained of being overworked. “If you can’t plug the hole, if it’s only at 85 percent, someone will have to work harder,” Chan says.Some in the aviation industry hope that computers can take up some of the slack. A Korean company has developed a robot that can pilot planes, including military jets. There is also research into using AI to help control air traffic or pilot planes. AI could monitor fatigue among pilots or controllers, Chan says, but we’re unlikely to see a pilotless commercial plane any time soon.“Actual humans as pilots overseeing the operation of the computer is a safer bet at this moment,” he says.Additional reporting by Aarian Marshall.
