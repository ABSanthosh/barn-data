Crew-9 back on Earth.” [cheers] “Some harnessing being placed around the capsule. This harnessing is what will be used to lift the Dragon capsule out of the water and onto the recovery vessel. Wow, we got a cute little pod of dolphins. It wasn’t just one or two. The capsule will be placed inside of what you can see there is basically a basket. We call it the nest.” “Now working to get that spacecraft situated in the nest. And there you have it. The side hatch is open for the first time since September.” “It looks like we’re getting our next crew member here. That is none other than Suni Williams. Big smile, big waves.” “And of course that leaves NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore.” “And undocking confirmed. Freedom is free of its moorings. The Dragon hatch was closed at 10:05 p.m. Central time.” “Deorbit burn complete. Performance nominal. Nose cone closure initiated.” “Now, there. There’s Butch coming in through the hatch. All right. So I’m going to lead you down through the PMA, PMA 2 into Starliner.”A SpaceX capsule carrying two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, splashed down off Florida’s Gulf Coast on Tuesday, concluding their unexpectedly long stay in space.CreditCredit...Keegan Barber/NASA, via Getty ImagesPublished March 17, 2025Updated March 18, 2025They set off to spend eight days at the space station. The trip lasted nine months.On Tuesday, two NASA astronauts who had been in orbit since June, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, splashed down in calm, azure waters off the coast of the Florida Panhandle, concluding a saga that had captivated the country since last summer.Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore blasted off in June for the International Space Station on their test flight of Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft that was to provide NASA with another option, outside of SpaceX, to carry astronauts to and from orbit. But the Starliner experienced problems with its propulsion system, prompting NASA to send it back to Earth with no crew aboard.It was a SpaceX capsule, the Crew Dragon, that brought them back from space on Tuesday. The spacecraft detached from the space station just after 1 a.m. Eastern time and then traveled back to Earth, slowing from more than 17,000 miles an hour before deploying four large parachutes that gently plopped the spacecraft into the water just before 6 p.m.Minutes later, as recovery teams inspected the capsule, a pod of curious dolphins circled, a playful terrestrial welcoming party.ImageFrom left, NASA’s Butch Wilmore, Russia’s Aleksandr Gorbunov, NASA’s Nick Hague and NASA’s Suni Williams waiting to exit the SpaceX capsule after splashing down on Tuesday.Credit...SpaceX, via Associated PressOnce the capsule had been hoisted onto a ship, the door was opened and the beaming astronauts were extracted from the spacecraft.
