We are there, too! Just look for This Week in Science! Disclaimer, Disclaimer, Disclaimer!!! Science tends to be irreverent of pre-existing beliefs. Overturning the earth-centric universe with one that centers around the sun upset thousands of years of well-reasoned observations and many mythical contemplations later discoveries.  So that the sun itself is moving along a rural stretch of a spiral arm amidst billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy and a universe brimming frothing even, with trillions of galaxies firmly upending any concept of humanity being at or even near the center of anything. Archaeological anthropology has also gained an especially irreverent reputation, as there is scarcely an origin story of any culture on the planet that has not been amended or completely refuted by its findings.  Scientific irreverence also applies to the field itself. When new evidence emerges to question long-accepted interpretations, including those once presented as prevailing frameworks, science updates its knowledge, overturns those well-reasoned, well-founded assumptions.  Real knowledge is never gained by being right about anything. It’s earned through methodical seeking of truth, wherever it may lead. And seeking that truth is likely what led you here to another episode of This Week in Science!
