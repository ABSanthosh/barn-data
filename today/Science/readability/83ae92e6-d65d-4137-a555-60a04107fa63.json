  "text": "Somewhere in the pandemic and the terrible news cycle, co-host Kia Miakka Natisse got stuck in a butt divot in her couch and an even deeper funk. To break out, she sets out on a journey to the bottom of the ocean, looking for an answer to a single, existential question: can I be safe and free? On her hunt for wisdom, she journeys to Cape Town, South Africa, to dive into the ocean with freediver and self-proclaimed mermaid, Zandile Ndhlovu. We recommend wearing headphones for this episode.
