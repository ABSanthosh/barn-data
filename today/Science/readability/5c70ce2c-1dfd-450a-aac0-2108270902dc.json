Knudsen stablized the drug by adding fatty-acid chains, enabling it to bind to proteins in the blood, which prevents it from breaking down rapidly once injected. “It’s a tremendous honour to receive this prestigious award,” says Drucker. “But the most amazing gratification is when someone comes to my office and says, ‘I lost 40 pounds [18 kg] and I feel healthy’.”Everyone’s a winnerThe award is one of six Breakthrough prizes to be awarded this year in life sciences, physics and mathematics.Unusually for a major award, one of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to a grand total of 13,508 physicists spanning four collaborations at CERN, Europe’s particle physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland. Through experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these researchers have taken multiple precision measurements over the past decade to probe, and so far confirm, the standard model of particle physics. “We’re honoured the award was made to the entire collaboration because without all those people we could not have made these advances,” says Patricia McBride, a spokesperson for CERN’s CMS collaboration. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit CERN, she adds.CERN’s Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, one of the collaborations whose scientists share a Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics.Credit: Harold Cunningham/GettyThe award is well deserved, says Brian Rebel, a particle physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Finding the Higgs [boson] in 2012 was a once-in-lifetime event, but it was only the first step,” Rebel says. Since then, LHC scientists have been pinning down the mass of the Higgs and its interactions, as well as discovering 72 new particles, investigating antimatter and probing the nature of the ‘quark–gluon plasma’ that existed soon after the Big Bang. “It takes a small army to create the tools to test and validate these results,” says Rebel.Another Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to one of the architects of the standard model, theoretical physicist Gerard ’t Hooft at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who also won a share of the 1999 Nobel prize in physics for his work on the weak nuclear force, and contributed to understanding the strong nuclear force. “A beautiful synthesis emerges when one’s mathematics is linked to particles actually seen in the world,” says ’t Hooft, adding that he is “honoured” to win the prize.A theory of everything",
