  "description": "A popular podcast called The Telepathy Tapes claims that telepathy is real — and tons of people are convinced. So we open our minds to the possibility of mind-reading and ask: Could this be real?? And if not — what might be going on here? We dive into the science (yes — there is science!) with Dr. Katharine Beals, Prof. Jim Todd, and Prof. Chris French.  Find our transcript here: https://bit.ly/ScienceVsTelepathy In this episode, we cover: (00:00) Extraordinary Claims of Telepathy (08:28) What Could Be Going On Here?
