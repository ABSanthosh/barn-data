  "description": "High above the banks of the Mississippi river, a nest holds the secret life of one of America‚Äôs most patriotic creatures. Their story puzzles scientists, reinforces indigenous wisdom, and wows audiences, all thanks to a park ranger named Ed, and a well-placed webcam. If you want to spoil the mystery, here ya go: it‚Äôs a bald eagle. Actually, it‚Äôs three bald eagles. A mama bird and daddies make a home together for over a decade and give new meaning to our national symbol.¬†Learn about the storytellers, listen to music, and dig deeper into the stories you hear on Terrestrials with activities you can do at home or in the classroom on our website, Terrestrialspodcast.org.¬†Watch ‚ÄúI Wanna Hear the Eagle‚Äù and find even MORE original Terrestrials fun on our Youtube.And badger us on Social Media: @radiolab and #TerrestrialsPodcast.Special thanks to Abigail Miller, Laurel Braitman, Stan Bousson, Molly Webster, and Maria Paz Gutierrez.We have some exciting news!
