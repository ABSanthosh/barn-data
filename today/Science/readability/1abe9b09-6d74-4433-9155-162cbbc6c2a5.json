  "text": "The astronauts are finally home on Earth. Here’s the latest.Two NASA astronauts splashed down off Florida’s Gulf Coast on Tuesday, returning to Earth after a stay on the International Space Station that lasted some nine months longer than they had originally planned.After traveling to Earth at speeds of 17,000 miles per hour, a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying those two astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, set down in calm, azure waters off Florida’s Gulf Coast south of Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. Eastern time.The capsule deployed large parachutes that gently plopped the spacecraft into the Gulf Once the capsule had been hoisted onto a recovery ship, the hatch was opened, and the beaming crew members were helped to exit the spacecraft. Minutes earlier, a pod of dolphins had been circling the capsule, adding a moment of playfulness to a saga that had attracted national attention since last summer.The return of Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore after 286 days in space completed a voyage that began in June and was supposed to have lasted as few as eight days. Instead, the mission stretched into weeks, then months, as engineers puzzled over problems with the astronauts’ spacecraft — a Boeing Starliner that was to provide NASA with another option, beyond SpaceX, to get astronauts to and from orbit.As Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore stayed in orbit, the public worried that they were in danger, and wondered why NASA had not brought them home.More recently, in late January, the story turned into a political football when President Trump said his predecessor, President Biden, had callously abandoned Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore in space.Earlier this month, Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, who has become an influential adviser to Mr. Trump, said on X then that he had offered to bring the two astronauts back six months earlier, in the fall, but was turned down by the Biden administration for political reasons. He has not provided details of whom he talked to but said his contact was “not NASA.”Mr. Musk did not respond to an email requesting details of his offer.Bill Nelson, who served as the administrator of NASA during the Biden administration, said on Monday that he had never discussed a rescue mission with Mr. Musk or SpaceX to bring home Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore from the space station.Nor did anyone from the White House ever weigh in to influence the agency’s decision to extend their stay in orbit after problems emerged with the Starliner, Mr. Nelson said in an interview.NASA officials have steadfastly maintained that they made the decision to keep Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore on the space station as part of the crew because it made the most sense with the least disruption to the operations of the space station.“On the basis that there was no contact with NASA, there was no political consideration from NASA’s point of view,” Mr. Nelson said.In August, NASA officials decided that the Starliner spacecraft that had carried Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore to orbit would return to Earth empty. They then juggled astronaut assignments so that Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore would join the space station crew and then return to Earth on a SpaceX spacecraft instead.That spacecraft, part of a mission known as Crew-9, launched to the space station in September and brought up two other astronauts — Nick Hague of NASA and Aleksandr Gorbunov of the Russian space agency — who also returned to Earth on Tuesday.About a half-hour after the astronauts returned, the White House posted on social media, “PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.” However, it had been NASA’s plan since August for the astronauts to return from the Crew-9 mission around this time frame.A nine-month stay on the space station is not an unusually long time, and the astronauts themselves disputed the notion that they had been forgotten.“It’s work. It’s fun. It’s been trying at times, no doubt,” Mr. Wilmore said in an interview with Michael Barbaro, a host of “The Daily.” “But stranded? No. Stuck? No. Abandoned? No.”Here’s what else to know about the flight:Recovery: A ship operated by SpaceX has pulled the vehicle onto its deck, and crews helped them disembark from the spacecraft. The astronauts were be placed on what looked like a lounge chair with wheels — a standard safety precaution as they readjust to gravity.Return: After medical checks, the astronauts will be flown to Houston, the home of Johnson Space Center, the NASA facility that coordinates human spaceflight activities. Before being fully reunited with their families, the crew will spend some time at the astronaut quarters at the space center before NASA doctors say they can go home.Updates: NASA is hosting a news conference that is being streamed on its website. New York Times journalists will provide details and analysis from the event on this blog.A pod of dolphins greeted the returned astronauts.VideotranscripttranscriptNow we can see some harnessing being placed around the capsule. This harnessing is what will be used to lift the Dragon capsule out of the water and onto the recovery vessel. Wow, we got a cute little pod of dolphins. It wasn’t just one or two.SpaceX and the Coast Guard work together to try to keep civilian boaters away from returning spacecraft after astronauts splash down in the water. But on Tuesday night, they could not do anything about a pod of curious dolphins.A handful of the marine mammals swam up to a recovery boat that was set to lift the Crew Dragon Freedom to its deck and surfaced from the clear blue waters.“Wow, we got a cute little pod of dolphins, it wasn’t just one or two,” said Kate Tice, an engineering manager at SpaceX who was commentating on the company’s video stream. As the dolphins’ dorsal fins bobbed, she said that the team working on retrieving the capsule was “getting quick assists from the honorary part of the recovery team, those dolphins.”Dolphins are generally social and playful marine mammals and often travel in groups, or pods. The most common species near Florida’s Gulf Coast are bottle-nosed dolphins, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, although it was not clear which species was circling the SpaceX crews on Tuesday.It’s not the first time wildlife have visited astronauts just after they returned to Earth. In 2021, photographers captured a lone dolphin swimming near the recovery boats headed to pick up the Dragon spacecraft used for SpaceX’s Crew-1 mission. But an Orlando news station reported that the animal didn’t stick around for the capsule’s splashdown.ImageCredit...The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSteve Stich, the manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew program, said the astronauts “all looked very healthy.” He added: “They all looked like they were feeling about normal for the landing and recovery phase where their bodies are trying to re-adapt.”Asked if the mission would have changed if the 2024 presidential election had turned out differently, Joel Montalbano, an official from NASA’s space operations mission directorate, said, “We work for the president.” He added that they would take input from any presidential administration.NASA’s Stich was asked whether the company will continue working on the spacecraft after spending so much money on it. “Boeing all the way up to their new C.E.O. Kelly has been committed to Starliner,” he said, referring to Kelly Ortberg, who took over as the company’s chief executive last summer. ImageCredit...Ashley Landis/Associated PressStich said the astronauts will rehabilitate with doctors and then reunite with their families in “the next day or so.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSteve Stich of NASA praised the resilience of Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore — and that of their families — as well as their seamless transition to living and working nine months on the space station.NASA’s Stich highlighted Boeing, which made the Starliner spacecraft that malfunctioned and resulted in Suni Williams’s and Butch Wilmore’s long stay in orbit. He said today’s flight highlighted the value of having two different vehicles to get to orbit. “We’re super grateful for Boeing and their investment,” he said.NASA’s Stich praised the spacecraft and its performance. “The whole system worked just as planned,” he said.ImageCredit...NASA, via ReutersAt the start of the post-splashdown news conference, Joel Montalbano, an official from NASA’s space operations mission directorate, said that President Trump had asked SpaceX in January what it would take to bring Crew-9 home. “At the time that that question was asked, we were already looking at options,” he said, about the rotation of Crew-9 and Crew-10. He also called SpaceX “an incredible partner for us.”ImageCredit...Ashley Landis/Associated PressAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA news conference by NASA and SpaceX officials about the conclusion of the Crew-9 mission is set to begin soon. You can watch it in the YouTube player above.On X, Elon Musk offered a simple congratulations to SpaceX and NASA. He also thanked President Trump “for prioritizing this mission!”Shortly after the splashdown, The White House posted on X: “PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.” However, NASA’s plan since August 2024 was for the astronauts to return from this mission at around this timeframe.In fact, the astronauts were originally scheduled by NASA to have returned last month, in February. But problems with the next launch of astronauts to the space station on a different SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule added another month to the time that Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore spent in space.All four astronauts have exited the spacecraft and will receive initial health evaluations. They will then take a helicopter to shore. From there, they will fly back to Houston.ImageCredit...SpaceX, via Associated PressAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe final astronaut to exit the capsule is Butch Wilmore, who raises two thumbs up after he gets into the seat. It is not quite one hour since splashdown.VideoNext out is Suni Williams, one of the two astronauts who had been in space since last June.VideoThe second astronaut to exit is Aleksandr Gorbunov of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency.Just over 45 minutes since splashdown, the first astronaut to exit the SpaceX capsule is Nick Hague, the commander of the Crew-9 mission.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn Houston, employees of Johnson Space Center, the base of NASA’s human spaceflight activities, celebrated after watching the astronauts of Crew-9 splash down off Florida’s Gulf Coast on Tuesday.ImageCredit...Ashley Landis/Associated PressThe hatch is open, and the astronauts get a breath of fresh air.VideoThe capsule has been hoisted out of the water and placed on the recovery ship.VideoA pod of curious dolphins is swimming around the spacecraft before it gets pulled out of the ocean.VideotranscripttranscriptNow we can see some harnessing being placed around the capsule.

After acclimating to floating, a person’s anatomy becomes confused by the return of gravity, which can make astronauts dizzy and nauseated. Some astronauts are helped to medical examinations immediately after landing, sometimes in devices that look like lounge chairs on wheels.After their initial medical checks, the astronauts will be flown to shore on a helicopter from the recovery ship, and then they will be flown to the Johnson Space Center in Houston to undergo further medical testing. While they may reunite with loved ones as soon as they reach the center, NASA said it was typical for them to stay in the facility’s astronaut quarters for a number of days before flight surgeons clear them to return to their homes.No word yet on when Ms. Williams will be able to reunite with her beloved dogs at the Space Center.The life of an astronaut is full of waiting. There is not much for Crew-9 to do until the capsule is on the recovery ship and the side hatch is opened.A member of the recovery team in a black wetsuit and bright green helmet has climbed onto the capsule to prepare it for lifting onto the recovery ship Megan.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe astronauts will return to Earth enveloped in hot plasma.ImageInside the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on Tuesday.Credit...NASA, via ReutersIn orbit, a spacecraft like the SpaceX Crew Dragon carrying the astronauts is whizzing around the Earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour. At that speed, a spacecraft needs to dissipate a lot of kinetic energy as it re-enters the atmosphere.The spacecraft speeds up as it falls until it enters the atmosphere. Then the drag of air resistance starts to act as a brake.The blunt bottom of the spacecraft slams into air molecules, and the compression generates temperatures as hot as 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, making it one of the most dangerous sequences in the mission.A heat shield at the bottom is designed to absorb the heat and protect the inside of the spacecraft where the astronauts sit. The initially white surfaces of the top of the Crew Dragons are scorched, and they end up looking like well-toasted marshmallows after they are pulled out of the ocean.The intense heat strips electrons off atoms and creates a state of charged matter known as a plasma. The plasma glows and blocks radio signals for several minutes, creating some suspense in mission control until astronauts are heard again.Another SpaceX technology could make communications blackouts a thing of the past.The company’s Starlink satellites orbit at an altitude higher than the re-entering spacecraft so there is less plasma to block the radio signals between the spacecraft and the satellites. Starlinks can also send data by laser light, which is not blocked by plasma.SpaceX has demonstrated this ability to remain in contact through re-entry during flights of its new Starship vehicle, sending back real-time video of the eerie glow of plasma around the vehicle as it plunges toward Earth.",

astronauts is whizzing around the Earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour. At that speed, a spacecraft needs to dissipate a lot of kinetic energy as it re-enters the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spacecraft speeds up as it falls until it enters the atmosphere. Then the drag of air resistance starts to act as a brake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe blunt bottom of the spacecraft slams into air molecules, and the compression generates temperatures as hot as 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, making it one of the most dangerous sequences in the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA heat shield at the bottom is designed to absorb the heat and protect the inside of the spacecraft where the astronauts sit. The initially white surfaces of the top of the Crew Dragons are scorched, and they end up looking like well-toasted marshmallows after they are pulled out of the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe intense heat strips electrons off atoms and creates a state of charged matter known as a plasma. The plasma glows and blocks radio signals for several minutes, creating some suspense in mission control until astronauts are heard again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother SpaceX technology could make communications blackouts a thing of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe company’s Starlink satellites orbit at an altitude higher than the re-entering spacecraft so there is less plasma to block the radio signals between the spacecraft and the satellites. Starlinks can also send data by laser light, which is not blocked by plasma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpaceX has demonstrated this ability to remain in contact through re-entry during flights of its new Starship vehicle, sending back real-time video of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/14/science/spacex-starship-reentry-plasma.html\" title=\"\"\u003eeerie glow of plasma\u003c/a\u003e around the vehicle as it plunges toward Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
