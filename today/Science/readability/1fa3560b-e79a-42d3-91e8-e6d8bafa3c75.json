Her life took an extraordinary turn when two brothers, both poets and essayists, arrived from the capital. They noticed something special about the young girl who lived nearby. With their help, Rodríguez went to school and, against overwhelming odds, decided to become a doctor. She was the first woman to enter medical school in the Dominican Republic, and when she graduated in 1911, she became the country's first female doctor. But just as she was about to start her career, an unexpected tragedy changed the course of her life.LISTEN TO THE PODCASTOn supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

We're in the early 20th century, in a small village off the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic. Sugar cane fields surround a cluster of rectangular huts with roofs made of palm leaves. Beyond them, the turquoise waters of the Caribbean stretch as far as the eye can see.In one of the huts, a small girl lies on a mattress, limp with fever and pain. A doctor is sent for.Soon afterwards, a dark-skinned woman with tightly braided hair arrives at the doorstep. She’s wearing simple clothes and men’s shoes. The father of the sick child is confused. “Who’s this?” he asks. “Is this a nurse?”To his astonishment, the woman replies. “No. Soy la doctora. I’m the doctor.”The woman is Andrea Evangelina Rodríguez Perozo — Evangelina for short. She's the first Dominican woman to graduate from medical school. The island's first woman doctor.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): It was unheard of at the time for a woman like her to get the title of doctor; I mean, I see it as a really incredible thing.Claudia Scharf (Voiceover): I think Evangelina is a great example of transcendence in the field of medicine.Laura Gómez: This is “Lost Women of Science,” where we tell the stories of groundbreaking women who never got the recognition they deserved... until now. I'm Laura Gómez.I was raised in the Dominican Republic, but until recently, I'd never heard of Evangelina Rodríguez Perozo. When I did first hear about her, I immediately wanted to know more. How did this woman, born into poverty in the Dominican countryside, become not just the first but one of the most innovative doctors of her time? And why didn’t I know her name?In this five-part series, we’ll explore the life of Dr. Andrea Evangelina Rodríguez Perozo. We'll hear how she traveled all the way to Paris to learn the latest in medical advances, and how, later, she found herself on a collision course with her country’s new dictator, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. His regime did all it could to erase her legacy. But today, with the help of historians and others who've worked for years to piece together the puzzle of Evangelina's life... we can finally tell her story.This is Episode 1: “La Doctora.”Our story begins in the mid-1880s, on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic, in an up-and-coming town called San Pedro de Macorís. Horse-drawn carts clatter down newly paved streets, lined with food stalls and street vendors. It’s hot and humid, and the streets buzz with conversations in Spanish, English, Creole, and French.A blossoming sugar industry has drawn in migrants from all over the Caribbean and beyond, in search of opportunity. Among them is an old lady standing on the street selling homemade gofio, a Dominican sweet made of cornmeal and sugar. And beside her, looking shy, is a small dark-skinned girl of about six or seven: Evangelina Rodríguez.Like many of the people around them, Evangelina and her grandmother are newcomers to this town, here to try their luck in a place that’s brimming with possibility.April Mayes: She would have grown up in an environment that was becoming cemented. I mean, quite literally, concrete was coming in and cement streets are being paved.Laura Gómez: That's April Mayes. She's Associate Dean of Pomona College in California and a professor of Afro-Latin American history.Despite all the hustle and bustle, for people like Evangelina and her grandmother, the prospects were slim.By the mid-1880s, the Dominican Republic was still pretty young as a nation. It had only been independent from Spain since 1865. And hundreds of years of slavery had only ended four decades earlier. Dominican society was still deeply divided by class and race.April Mayes: That really decided your fate to a certain degree, because if your family had access to wealth, had access to land, had been educated, then your chances were really good. But being impoverished, being darker skinned, being landless, and not coming from generational wealth really mattered. And Evangelina falls there.Laura Gómez: Evangelina was born in 1879 in Higüey, a rural town back then about 40 miles northeast of San Pedro de Macorís. And from day one, she had many strikes against her. In addition to being poor, female, and dark-skinned, she was born out of wedlock.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): She was the illegitimate daughter of a woman named Felipa Perozo and Ramón Rodriguez, who was an officer in Pedro Santana's army.Laura Gómez: That’s Mercedes Fernández. She’s an assistant professor at the Catholic University of America whose research focuses on Hispanic literature. She wrote her Ph.D. on Evangelina Rodríguez.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): Her dad abandoned her when she was little, and her mom never took care of her.Laura Gómez: Abandoned first by her mother and then by her father, Evangelina fell under the care of her paternal grandmother. And when Evangelina was young, they moved to San Pedro de Macorís in search of a better future.But in years of selling gofio on the streets, they never seemed to get ahead. They earned just enough to feed themselves and keep a roof over their heads. At that point, Evangelina’s future seemed written for her.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): Social expectations were that she would have to either become a servant or find herself a husband. Either way, it was bound to be a life of hardship. And Evangelina saw different versions of her future all around her.Girls who worked themselves to the bone in a stranger’s home just for a roof over their heads.Girls who spent their lives hawking sweets in the street.“Lucky” girls who married… but then struggled to raise their many, many kids in families crushed by poverty and often sickness.But this girl, handing over gofio in exchange for a few coins, wouldn’t follow any of those paths. And that’s because, in the early 1890s, when Evangelina was about 12 years old, her small world suddenly opened up. It started when two brothers from the capital, Santo Domingo, moved into a house down the street. Their names were Rafael and Gastón Deligne.April Mayes: Both of them are poets, essayists…Laura Gómez: April Mayes again.April Mayes: They are touted as two of San Pedro's greatest literary cultural achievements, and unfortunately, both of them at different, slightly different times, are struck with leprosy.Laura Gómez: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that affects the skin, the nerves, the eyes, and the upper respiratory tract. It causes skin lesions and numbness that can lead to limb loss, paralysis, and even death. Today, leprosy can be treated and cured with antibiotics. But up until the early 1980s, it was considered incurable. And in Evangelina's time, contracting leprosy often made you a social pariah. Here's Mercedes Fernández.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): Having leprosy was seen like having the plague. People thought that leprosy was spread simply through touch.Laura Gómez: But Evangelina didn’t react like most people. She didn’t avoid being near the brothers or touching them. In fact, she offered to care for the sickest one, Rafael. She began visiting him daily, tending to his lesions. And over the years, as he lost mobility, she began to help him with everyday tasks like bathing and getting dressed.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): To me, it shows a really incredible sense of compassion from an early age. I mean, it seems to me that she sees this as a calling. Because she does it purely altruistically. She never receives any money for helping Rafael Deligne.Laura Gómez: Rafael Deligne became Evangelina's friend and mentor. He gave her books to read, he taught her poetry. And little by little, in her daily visits, Evangelina got glimpses into a very different world than the one she’d always known. Here’s April Mayes.April Mayes: San Pedro really is coming into its own as this cultural space. They have a variety of literary groups — they organize poetry contests, and essay writing contests, and all sorts of contests. And so the Delignes are right at the epicenter of this.Laura Gómez: Most afternoons, Rafael sat under a tree in his courtyard and received visits from San Pedro’s burgeoning intellectual elite. And on most days, the young Evangelina was there too. Mercedes Fernández again.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): The topics of conversation revolved around literature and philosophy, and I think Evangelina must have been sitting there with her mouth hanging open, listening and marveling at everything these people were discussing. And Evangelina began to absorb that intellectuality, and began to read on her own.Laura Gómez: Rafael could see how bright Evangelina was, and he saw promise in her. She was intelligent, she was capable, and she was clearly a gifted caregiver. So he encouraged her to look beyond her typical prospects. But the truth was, there just weren't many options open to women in the Dominican Republic at the time.But then, another chance encounter came along. April Mayes.April Mayes: It's one of those moments in history that you go, wow, if it had, you know, if someone slept in that day or something didn't happen and just it was one pivot in a different direction, right, this would be a whole different story we'd be telling. It’s that relationship that seals the deal, in a way.Laura Gómez: What happened next, after the break.[Mid-roll]Laura Gómez: When Evangelina was a child at the turn of the 20th century, schools were mostly run by the Catholic church. So girls who did go to school usually got religious educations, which didn't really prepare them to do more than go home and be homemakers. Here’s Mercedes Fernández.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): The idea was to educate women so that they could read their prayer books — I mean, it’s a very poor education, and an education that does not allow them to leave the home.Laura Gómez: For someone bright like Evangelina, who was interested in things like philosophy and poetry and science, an education wouldn’t have offered much, even if she could have afforded it.But there was a new type of school system taking hold at the time. In 1880, a Puerto Rican educator named Eugenio María de Hostos established the first so-called “normal school” in the Dominican Republic. These were secular schools intended to train future generations of teachers and educators. And for the first time, Hostos proposed opening such schools for women, too.April Mayes: Hostos, he understood that you need women to help build the nation.Laura Gómez: April Mayes.April Mayes: And women had been left so behind because they had been denied education that Hostos said, well, we got to get them up to speed because you can't have a national project that only includes one half of humanity, it has to include women.Laura Gómez: Leaders in the Dominican Republic were undertaking a “national project” to rebuild the country, which was still emerging from a long period of power struggles and unrest. After being colonized first by Spain, then by French Haiti, then by Spain again until 1865, the Dominican Republic finally became independent for good. But a few decades later, the country was still struggling to establish a stable and peaceful government. Here’s Mercedes Fernández.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): So, the woman is seen as a pacifying force. And it’s thought that the woman must educate her children at home, and in doing so, she’ll be able to pacify all these future citizens.Laura Gómez: Hostos’ school, known as the Institute for Young Women, focused on teaching subjects like history, philosophy, and science. And the idea was that the women who graduated would not only raise model citizens, they’d also go on to found their own schools to educate more women. So so-called “normal schools” were beginning to pop up around the country.Even though these schools still prepared women for a traditional life in the home, the idea of establishing a whole system devoted to women’s education was a radical one.And one day, one of these newly educated women found her way into the Delignes’ circle. Here's April Mayes.April Mayes: Anacaona Moscoso was among the first generation of señoritas who graduated from the Institute for Young Women in Santo Domingo, the capital.Laura Gómez: She then moved to San Pedro de Macorís and founded a new secondary school for young women.And so, the day that she showed up in the Delignes’ courtyard for a visit, Gastón and Rafael recognized what an opportunity this was for Evangelina. So they immediately introduced her to Anacaona.April Mayes: The Deligne brothers, her friends, said, this is a person we see potential in. If you can get her educated, she will be taken care of for life.Laura Gómez: Evangelina, of course, couldn’t afford it. But she wasn’t just a poor girl selling gofío in the streets anymore, invisible to anyone who was anyone. She was a friend of the Delignes.April Mayes: To people who might have seen her on the street selling sweets and would have just ignored her, passed her by, oh, now that she's connected to the Deligne, something must be different about her.Laura Gómez: And Anacaona must have thought so too — because she went all in for Evangelina. She found her an evening job teaching literacy classes to adults so Evangelina could pay for her studies, and that paved the way for her to go to school.In 1898, at age 19, Evangelina became one of four young women to join the first class of Anacaona Moscoso's new school.Laura Gómez: Evangelina thrived at the Institute for Young Women. For the first time ever, she had some financial stability. She was learning subjects like science, mathematics, and French. She was making friends with the other driven, smart, like-minded students, known as \"Normalistas.”April Mayes: And these were among the first generation of Normalistas produced in San Pedro de Macoris, who would then go on and continue the work.Laura Gómez: The plan was for Evangelina and her classmates to one day become teachers at their own schools… and also to marry, have children, and raise good, moral citizens.But Evangelina... well... now that she’d made it this far, she’d set her sights even farther. On something that no woman on her island had ever achieved before.It’s hard to know exactly what was going through Evangelina’s head back then. There are no diary entries or newspaper articles that offer us any glimpse into her mind. We don’t know if it was something she decided suddenly or had contemplated for a long time.All we know is that when she graduated secondary school, she announced to her peers that she intended to go to medical school.Medical school.It was a preposterous goal. For one, the medical profession was only just starting to emerge as a formal field in the Dominican Republic. There was only one medical school, in Santo Domingo. The few professional doctors on the island were mostly educated abroad, in places like Paris. Not to mention…Claudia Scharf (Voiceover): At that time, the practice of medicine was limited to men.Laura Gómez: That’s Claudia Scharf, a pediatrician and medical professor in Santo Domingo.Claudia Scharf (Voiceover): Forget about women participating as anything other than midwives or maybe nurses.Laura Gómez: But none of this seemed to discourage Evangelina. Maybe she was driven by her desire to help the Delignes — or stricken by Rafael’s death, which happened the same year she graduated from school. Maybe she was haunted by the stories of women she grew up with, trapped in cycles of sickness and hardship.Either way, now armed with an education and a newfound knowledge of science, she knew what she wanted to do. Mercedes Fernández again.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): She has a lot of faith in science. Being a good Normalista, she thinks that science will be the solution to many of the problems that exist around her. So she’s no longer satisfied with just being a teacher. She wants more.Laura Gómez: One by one, a network of benefactors pulled strings on Evangelina’s behalf. Some put in a good word with the university. One published an op-ed in a local newspaper arguing in favor of allowing women to enroll in medical school.And that’s how, in 1903, the unthinkable happened: Evangelina Rodríguez Perozo, a young Black woman raised in the streets, became the first Dominican woman to enroll in Medical School at the University of Santo Domingo. She was 24 years old.Claudia Scharf (Voiceover): She probably had to overcome a lot of rejection, and many people against her, not only because she was a woman, but also because of her humble origins and her race.That’s Claudia Scharf. Here’s Mercedes Fernández.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): And if we think about where she started — poor, with no mother, no father, nobody. So how would she have felt at that moment? Incredible! I mean, I bet she couldn’t even believe what she had achieved all by herself.Laura Gómez: For the next five years, Evangelina attended medical school alongside an all-male cohort. Once more, she was a promising student. She studied anatomy, biology, medical chemistry, and more. It seemed like she was finally on her way to being able to help people like the Delignes, like the poor people she grew up with, who were constantly dogged by illness.And then, near the end of her schooling, in 1907, life dealt Evangelina a devastating blow. Anacaona Moscoso, Evangelina's former teacher turned friend and confidante, died soon after giving birth to her third child.April Mayes: She had been warned by the doctors during her last delivery that if she were to become pregnant again, she might not survive that pregnancy.Laura Gómez: April Mayes again.April Mayes: And sure enough, she did not.Laura Gómez: Evangelina was shattered.April Mayes: Evangelina adored Anacaona. And the frustration that she was not able to control her pregnancy. And then there was nothing that they could do to save her life… It was devastating.Laura Gómez: And that likely brought into focus something that had been largely missing from Evangelina’s medical education: women and women’s health. Specifically: pregnant women’s health. Even though childbirth was one of the biggest dangers to a woman’s life at the time, her professors weren’t focusing on this at all.Perhaps that was because gynecology and obstetrics were still largely undeveloped as a specialty in the Dominican Republic. And maybe it didn’t help that all the doctors were men…But Evangelina became increasingly intent on learning about women’s health. Learning techniques that would allow her, as a doctor, to save women in Anacaona's situation.April Mayes: This propelled her… I don't think you get to obstetrics and gynecology with Evangelina without that loss.Evangelina was consumed with grief, but she pushed on with her studies.In 1911, at the age of 32, Evangelina defended her thesis and qualified as a doctor. Even then, she realized that she needed more knowledge and skills to help the women in her country. And she knew that she would have to look beyond her home country for that knowledge. In those days, any doctor in Latin America who wanted to specialize, dreamed of going to one place: Paris, France. Mercedes Fernández again.Mercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): Paris at that time was at the center of global medicine. If you look at different newspapers of the time, it's interesting to see the doctors’ degrees, because they all say doctor in such-and-such, graduate of Paris. They all put Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, right? So she sees it as a goal that she has to achieve.Laura Gómez: In the next episode of this series: how Evangelina makes it to Paris — a goal so ambitious for her it seemed almost crazy.Despite coming this far, the odds were still stacked against her. Evangelina had to raise a huge sum of money for her transatlantic journey — and that was just the start.How she faced those odds… that’s next week.This episode of “Lost Women of Science” was produced by Lorena Galliot, with help from associate producer Natalia Sánchez Loayza.

And from day one, she had many strikes against her. In addition to being poor, female, and dark-skinned, she was born out of wedlock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover):\u003c/b\u003e She was the illegitimate daughter of a woman named Felipa Perozo and Ramón Rodriguez, who was an officer in Pedro Santana\u0026#39;s army.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eThat’s Mercedes Fernández.

And when Evangelina was young, they moved to San Pedro de Macorís in search of a better future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eBut in years of selling \u003ci\u003egofio\u003c/i\u003e on the streets, they never seemed to get ahead. They earned just enough to feed themselves and keep a roof over their heads. At that point, Evangelina’s future seemed written for her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover):\u003c/b\u003e Social expectations were that she would have to either become a servant or find herself a husband. Either way, it was bound to be a life of hardship. And Evangelina saw different versions of her future all around her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eGirls who worked themselves to the bone in a stranger’s home just for a roof over their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eGirls who spent their lives hawking sweets in the street.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e“Lucky” girls who married… but then struggled to raise their many, many kids in families crushed by poverty and often sickness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eBut this girl, handing over \u003ci\u003egofio\u003c/i\u003e in exchange for a few coins, wouldn’t follow any of those paths. And that’s because, in the early 1890s, when Evangelina was about 12 years old, her small world suddenly opened up. It started when two brothers from the capital, Santo Domingo, moved into a house down the street. Their names were Rafael and Gastón Deligne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes:\u003c/b\u003e Both of them are poets, essayists…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eApril Mayes again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eThey are touted as two of San Pedro\u0026#39;s greatest literary cultural achievements, and unfortunately, both of them at different, slightly different times, are struck with leprosy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eLeprosy is a chronic infectious disease that affects the skin, the nerves, the eyes, and the upper respiratory tract. It causes skin lesions and numbness that can lead to limb loss, paralysis, and even death. Today, leprosy can be treated and cured with antibiotics. But up until the early 1980s, it was considered incurable. And in Evangelina\u0026#39;s time, contracting leprosy often made you a social pariah. Here\u0026#39;s Mercedes Fernández.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover):\u003c/b\u003e Having leprosy was seen like having the plague. People thought that leprosy was spread simply through touch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eBut Evangelina didn’t react like most people. She didn’t avoid being near the brothers or touching them. In fact, she offered to care for the sickest one, Rafael. She began visiting him daily, tending to his lesions. And over the years, as he lost mobility, she began to help him with everyday tasks like bathing and getting dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eTo me, it shows a really incredible sense of compassion from an early age. I mean, it seems to me that she sees this as a calling. Because she does it purely altruistically. She never receives any money for helping Rafael Deligne.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eRafael Deligne became Evangelina\u0026#39;s friend and mentor. He gave her books to read, he taught her poetry. And little by little, in her daily visits, Evangelina got glimpses into a very different world than the one she’d always known. Here’s April Mayes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes:\u003c/b\u003e San Pedro really is coming into its own as this cultural space. They have a variety of literary groups — they organize poetry contests, and essay writing contests, and all sorts of contests. And so the Delignes are right at the epicenter of this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eMost afternoons, Rafael sat under a tree in his courtyard and received visits from San Pedro’s burgeoning intellectual elite. And on most days, the young Evangelina was there too. Mercedes Fernández again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eThe topics of conversation revolved around literature and philosophy, and I think Evangelina must have been sitting there with her mouth hanging open, listening and marveling at everything these people were discussing. And Evangelina began to absorb that intellectuality, and began to read on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eRafael could see how bright Evangelina was, and he saw promise in her. She was intelligent, she was capable, and she was clearly a gifted caregiver. So he encouraged her to look beyond her typical prospects. But the truth was, there just weren\u0026#39;t many options open to women in the Dominican Republic at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eBut then, another chance encounter came along. April Mayes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eIt\u0026#39;s one of those moments in history that you go, wow, if it had, you know, if someone slept in that day or something didn\u0026#39;t happen and just it was one pivot in a different direction, right, this would be a whole different story we\u0026#39;d be telling. It’s that relationship that seals the deal, in a way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eWhat happened next, after the break.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e[Mid-roll]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eWhen Evangelina was a child at the turn of the 20th century, schools were mostly run by the Catholic church. So girls who did go to school usually got religious educations, which didn\u0026#39;t really prepare them to do more than go home and be homemakers. Here’s Mercedes Fernández.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover):\u003c/b\u003e The idea was to educate women so that they could read their prayer books — I mean, it’s a very poor education, and an education that does not allow them to leave the home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eFor someone bright like Evangelina, who was interested in things like philosophy and poetry and science, an education wouldn’t have offered much, even if she could have afforded it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eBut there was a new type of school system taking hold at the time. In 1880, a Puerto Rican educator named Eugenio María de Hostos established the first so-called “normal school” in the Dominican Republic. These were secular schools intended to train future generations of teachers and educators. And for the first time, Hostos proposed opening such schools for women, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eHostos, he understood that you need women to help build the nation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eApril Mayes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eAnd women had been left so behind because they had been denied education that Hostos said, well, we got to get them up to speed because you can\u0026#39;t have a national project that only includes one half of humanity, it has to include women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eLeaders in the Dominican Republic were undertaking a “national project” to rebuild the country, which was still emerging from a long period of power struggles and unrest. After being colonized first by Spain, then by French Haiti, then by Spain again until 1865, the Dominican Republic finally became independent for good. But a few decades later, the country was still struggling to establish a stable and peaceful government. Here’s Mercedes Fernández.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eSo, the woman is seen as a pacifying force. And it’s thought that the woman must educate her children at home, and in doing so, she’ll be able to pacify all these future citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eHostos’ school, known as the Institute for Young Women, focused on teaching subjects like history, philosophy, and science. And the idea was that the women who graduated would not only raise model citizens, they’d also go on to found their own schools to educate more women. So so-called “normal schools” were beginning to pop up around the country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eEven though these schools still prepared women for a traditional life in the home, the idea of establishing a whole system devoted to women’s education was a radical one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eAnd one day, one of these newly educated women found her way into the Delignes’ circle. Here\u0026#39;s April Mayes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eAnacaona Moscoso was among the first generation of señoritas who graduated from the Institute for Young Women in Santo Domingo, the capital.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eShe then moved to San Pedro de Macorís and founded a new secondary school for young women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eAnd so, the day that she showed up in the Delignes’ courtyard for a visit, Gastón and Rafael recognized what an opportunity this was for Evangelina. So they immediately introduced her to Anacaona.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eThe Deligne brothers, her friends, said, this is a person we see potential in. If you can get her educated, she will be taken care of for life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eEvangelina, of course, couldn’t afford it. But she wasn’t just a poor girl selling \u003ci\u003egofío\u003c/i\u003e in the streets anymore, invisible to anyone who was anyone. She was a friend of the Delignes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eTo people who might have seen her on the street selling sweets and would have just ignored her, passed her by, oh, now that she\u0026#39;s connected to the Deligne, something must be different about her.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eAnd Anacaona must have thought so too — because she went all in for Evangelina. She found her an evening job teaching literacy classes to adults so Evangelina could pay for her studies, and that paved the way for her to go to school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eIn 1898, at age 19, Evangelina became one of four young women to join the first class of Anacaona Moscoso\u0026#39;s new school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eEvangelina thrived at the Institute for Young Women. For the first time ever, she had some financial stability. She was learning subjects like science, mathematics, and French. She was making friends with the other driven, smart, like-minded students, known as \u0026#34;\u003ci\u003eNormalistas.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eAnd these were among the first generation of Normalistas produced in San Pedro de Macoris, who would then go on and continue the work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eThe plan was for Evangelina and her classmates to one day become teachers at their own schools… and also to marry, have children, and raise good, moral citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eBut Evangelina... well... now that she’d made it this far, she’d set her sights even farther. On something that no woman on her island had ever achieved before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eIt’s hard to know exactly what was going through Evangelina’s head back then. There are no diary entries or newspaper articles that offer us any glimpse into her mind. We don’t know if it was something she decided suddenly or had contemplated for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eAll we know is that when she graduated secondary school, she announced to her peers that she intended to go to medical school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eMedical school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eIt was a preposterous goal. For one, the medical profession was only just starting to emerge as a formal field in the Dominican Republic. There was only one medical school, in Santo Domingo. The few professional doctors on the island were mostly educated abroad, in places like Paris. Not to mention…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eClaudia Scharf (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eAt that time, the practice of medicine was limited to men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eThat’s Claudia Scharf, a pediatrician and medical professor in Santo Domingo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eClaudia Scharf (Voiceover):\u003c/b\u003e Forget about women participating as anything other than midwives or maybe nurses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eBut none of this seemed to discourage Evangelina. Maybe she was driven by her desire to help the Delignes — or stricken by Rafael’s death, which happened the same year she graduated from school. Maybe she was haunted by the stories of women she grew up with, trapped in cycles of sickness and hardship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eEither way, now armed with an education and a newfound knowledge of science, she knew what she wanted to do. Mercedes Fernández again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eShe has a lot of faith in science. Being a good \u003ci\u003eNormalista\u003c/i\u003e, she thinks that science will be the solution to many of the problems that exist around her. So she’s no longer satisfied with just being a teacher. She wants more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eOne by one, a network of benefactors pulled strings on Evangelina’s behalf. Some put in a good word with the university. One published an op-ed in a local newspaper arguing in favor of allowing women to enroll in medical school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eAnd that’s how, in 1903, the unthinkable happened: Evangelina Rodríguez Perozo, a young Black woman raised in the streets, became the first Dominican woman to enroll in Medical School at the University of Santo Domingo. She was 24 years old.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eClaudia Scharf (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eShe probably had to overcome a lot of rejection, and many people against her, not only because she was a woman, but also because of her humble origins and her race.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eThat’s Claudia Scharf. Here’s Mercedes Fernández.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover):\u003c/b\u003e And if we think about where she started — poor, with no mother, no father, nobody. So how would she have felt at that moment? Incredible! I mean, I bet she couldn’t even believe what she had achieved all by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eFor the next five years, Evangelina attended medical school alongside an all-male cohort. Once more, she was a promising student. She studied anatomy, biology, medical chemistry, and more. It seemed like she was finally on her way to being able to help people like the Delignes, like the poor people she grew up with, who were constantly dogged by illness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eAnd then, near the end of her schooling, in 1907, life dealt Evangelina a devastating blow. Anacaona Moscoso, Evangelina\u0026#39;s former teacher turned friend and confidante, died soon after giving birth to her third child.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eShe had been warned by the doctors during her last delivery that if she were to become pregnant again, she might not survive that pregnancy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eApril Mayes again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eAnd sure enough, she did not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eLaura Gómez: \u003c/b\u003eEvangelina was shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes:\u003c/b\u003e Evangelina adored Anacaona. And the frustration that she was not able to control her pregnancy.

Specifically: pregnant women’s health. Even though childbirth was one of the biggest dangers to a woman’s life at the time, her professors weren’t focusing on this at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003ePerhaps that was because gynecology and obstetrics were still largely undeveloped as a specialty in the Dominican Republic. And maybe it didn’t help that all the doctors were men…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eBut Evangelina became increasingly intent on learning about women’s health. Learning techniques that would allow her, as a doctor, to save women in Anacaona\u0026#39;s situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eApril Mayes: \u003c/b\u003eThis propelled her… I don\u0026#39;t think you get to obstetrics and gynecology with Evangelina without that loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eEvangelina was consumed with grief, but she pushed on with her studies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003eIn 1911, at the age of 32, Evangelina defended her thesis and qualified as a doctor. Even then, she realized that she needed more knowledge and skills to help the women in her country. And she knew that she would have to look beyond her home country for that knowledge. In those days, any doctor in Latin America who wanted to specialize, dreamed of going to one place: Paris, France. Mercedes Fernández again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eMercedes Fernández Asenjo (Voiceover): \u003c/b\u003eParis at that time was at the center of global medicine. If you look at different newspapers of the time, it\u0026#39;s interesting to see the doctors’ degrees, because they all say doctor in such-and-such, graduate of Paris.
