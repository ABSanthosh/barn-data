Peter Horree/Alamy Stock PhotoAn ancient Middle Eastern civilization that developed an early alphabet spread its culture far and wide—but not its DNA, finds a 23 April Nature study of hundreds of ancient human genomes.Phoenician civilization emerged more than 3,000 years ago, centred around what is now Lebanon, before expanding across the Mediterranean Sea. Middle Eastern Phoenician city-states eventually fell to other groups, but the culture thrived farther west—most notably in Carthage, in what is now Tunisia, until its destruction in 146 BC.Phoenician city-states shared languages—recorded with an alphabet that was a precursor to Greek and Latin letters—religious practices and maritime trading economies. Many researchers have presumed that their inhabitants also shared ancestries connected to the culture’s Middle Eastern origins.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Instead, Punic people shared an ancestry profile resembling those of ancient inhabitants of Greece and Sicily. Over time, North African ancestry entered the mix—reflecting the rise of Carthage after 500 BC.This unique mixture of ancestries is probably the result of a regular influx of diverse people connected by a “Mediterranean highway” maintained by trade between Phoenician outposts, says Ringbauer. The study identified related individuals found at distant archaeological sites, including a pair of possible second cousins, one from North Africa and one from Sicily.After the fall of Phoenician city-states in the Middle East, people with ancestry from this region might have been cut off from the Mediterranean highway, says Ringbauer.The absence of Middle Eastern ancestry in Punic people doesn’t surprise Pierre Zalloua, a geneticist at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. “The Phoenicians were a culture of integration and assimilation,” he says. “They settled where they sailed.”Ringbauer would like to know why diverse Mediterranean people adopted Phoenician culture, instead of sticking to their existing practices. “How can there be such a disconnect?” he wonders. “Does this mean Phoenician culture was like a franchise that others could adopt? That’s one for the archaeologists.”This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on April 23, 2025.",
