Sean Rayford/Getty ImagesCLIMATEWIRE | Floods could be deadlier than previously thought — and from more than just drowning.A study published Tuesday in Nature found that the number of U.S. deaths in flooded areas continued to rise for up to three months after the disaster, resulting in a 25 percent higher death rate from things like infections, injuries and heart disease, compared with periods of no flooding.The researchers from Columbia University used a statistical model to analyze national death data from 2001 to 2018 and calculate how death rates changed in the three months following floods versus normal conditions.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.
