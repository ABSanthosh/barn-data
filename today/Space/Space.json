We’ve been on alert for it to explode since April, when we confidently expected it to go boom some time before September. But we are still waiting.The star is a recurrent nova. This means it actually consists of two stars: a red giant and a white dwarf. The white dwarf is a dense stellar core about the size of the Earth, whose gravity is stripping gas from the red giant. The gas accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface before detonating in a thermonuclear explosion, causing the star to temporarily brighten. This does not destroy the white dwarf, which then returns to normal and the cycle repeats. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The existential threat from a large meteor is real, but two next-generation telescopes are about to make us saferOn 4 September, an asteroid was spotted curving towards Earth. Astronomers quickly established that it would impact the planet in 10 hours’ time. The Philippines island of Luzon was in the line of fire, and there was nothing they could do about it but watch. Sure enough, at 16.39 UTC (17.39 in the UK), just as predicted, the space rock plunged into the world and burst into flames.If you’re wondering why you’re still around to read this, it’s because that meteor was only a metre in length. Far too puny to cause any damage, the asteroid instead harmlessly ignited in the upper atmosphere, temporarily painting the sky in a blue-green streak of light. As it turns out, small asteroids hit the planet all the time. They’re nothing to worry about – but it doesn’t take a massive leap in size for one to become a threat. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The space scientist, 56, talks about science and diversity, being made a Barbie, dyslexia and why she told Jools Holland we’d encounter aliens by the end of the yearI said we’d find evidence of alien life by the end of 2024. But I said that when I was on Jools Holland’s Hootenanny, and my thinking was that if I said something outlandish they’d invite me back – if only to humiliate me. I’m sure alien life does exist. It’s just a numbers game. But we probably won’t get confirmation of it in the next three months.Science starts out as magic. I’m fascinated by things that seem intangible in the moment, and I like to think of magic as a science that we don’t understand yet. Sometimes beliefs just don’t stand up against the rigorous investigation needed for something to be science, but I think the wonder inherent to magic is needed to get there in the first place. It’s why so much of science fiction becomes science fact – why the telecommunication devices of Star Trek became today’s mobile phones. It’s important for scientists to think beyondThe universe doesn’t scare me. Words do. I’m dyslexic and it takes me ages to start writing books and hit deadlines, because I’m so scared I’m going to get things wrong. I know a lot of people who are terrified by time and space – it makes them feel small and insignificant. And I’ll concede that it can be daunting stuff. I much prefer to see the wonder in being part of it at all. But the terror I feel teetering on the edge of the black hole, trying to start writing? That keeps me awake at night.Scientists need humility. We need to be able to accept being wrong. If scientists can’t accept that possibility, then the scientific method doesn’t work. Sometimes science that turns out to be wrong was right based on the evidence of the time. Astronomy is a great example. Continue reading...",

They will be linked by lasers and light sensors, with one probe blocking the view of the sun as seen from the other craft. The effect will be to create solar eclipses that will last for several hours. Continue reading...",

This is the day on which the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from the northern celestial hemisphere to the southern.The celestial equator is the projection of the Earth’s equator up into the sky. So, on the equinox, the sun is shining directly above Earth’s equator, and this creates nearly equal hours of daylight and darkness across the globe. This is reflected in the name. The word “equinox” comes from the Latin words aequus, meaning equal, and nox, meaning night. Continue reading...",

And best friends grow up and apart in Waleed Akhtar’s fitful latestThe struggle to break free of restrictions – and the practical need for compromise – is something we can all appreciate. It’s there in Stella Feehily’s new play The Lightest Element, directed at Hampstead by Alice Hamilton – the story of astronomer and astrophysicist Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (Maureen Beattie, exuding brittle charisma), who was the first person to realise that stars are predominantly made up of hydrogen and helium, and not iron.Of course, her monumental breakthrough, made in 1925 at the age of 25, soon after her arrival at Harvard, was rubbished by her older, male supervisors (it contradicted the prevailing view), and when one, Henry Norris Russell (Julian Wadham), realised four years later that she was right, and published a paper on the subject, he was widely credited with the discovery. Men, eh? When we see this interaction, early on in the drama, he expects her to serve him tea while he crushes her thesis. Continue reading...",

Turner, who has died aged 87 from a brain tumour, pioneered the method prior to becoming one of the few British scientists to be employed by Nasa as a principal investigator on the Apollo programme.Argon-40/argon-39 dating is similar to an earlier technique called potassium/argon dating. In volcanic rocks and minerals any of the isotope potassium-40 (the parent isotope) that is present decays over time to the isotope argon-40 (the daughter isotope). Measuring the amounts and ratios of each allows geologists to calculate the age of the rock sample. However, the process was somewhat cumbersome. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Hampstead theatre, LondonCecilia Payne-Gaposchkin faced constant sexism and professional exclusion, but Stella Feehily’s play shows a woman with an iron will to succeedCecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, who died in 1979, is one of the many female scientists whose name is less well known than it should be. Astronomy, the field she worked in, was so male-dominated she had to leave her native Britain and move to the US simply to be able to practise it. She swapped one Cambridge for another, and became the first woman to head a department at Harvard.As a graduate student, she made the paradigm-shifting discovery that stars were made of hydrogen and helium, rather than iron, as was commonly held. Early on in The Lightest Element we see a 25-year-old Cecilia defending her ideas to the leading expert of the time, Henry Norris Russell. Julian Wadham plays him with an indulgent air: he seems supportive, yet still expects Cecilia to pour his tea. But the more she explains, the more riled he becomes, until he explodes: “Don’t you know when to be quiet?” Continue reading...",
