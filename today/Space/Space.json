    "description": "NASA’s Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer (OCHMO) assembled a small working group to review hydrogen sulfide (H2S) Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) values. The group met virtually three times during February and March 2023, and panel members submitted individual opinion statements in April 2023. Toxicology subject matter experts were chosen to result in a balanced panel with respect to expertise in SMAC determinations and specific H2S considerations, from both clinical and epidemiological perspectives. Panel members were Dr. Terry Gordon, Dr. Tee Guidotti, and Dr. Joyce Tsuji; OCHMO team members who facilitated the discussions were Dr. Doug Ebert, Dave Francisco, Sarah Childress, Kristin Coffey, and Kim Lowe.",

    "description": "New research into the single-celled organism is providing clues about what the early planet looked like – and raising the prospect that we may not be alone in the universeFor scientists, our earliest ancestor wasn’t Adam or Eve but Luca. Luca didn’t look anything like us – it was a single-celled bacterium-like organism. A recent study by a team of scientists based in the UK has delivered rather shocking news about this illustrious forebear. Despite having lived almost as far back as seems possible, Luca was surprisingly similar to modern bacteria – and what’s more, it apparently lived in a thriving community of other organisms that have left no trace on Earth today.Luca – short for the last universal common ancestor, the progenitor of all known life on Earth – seems to have been born 4.2bn years ago. Back then our planet was no Eden but something of a hell on Earth: a seething mass of volcanoes pummelled by giant meteorites, and having recovered from a cosmic collision that blasted the world apart and created the moon from some of the fragments. There is good reason why the geological aeon before 4bn years ago is called the Hadean, after the Greek god of the underworld Hades. Continue reading...",
