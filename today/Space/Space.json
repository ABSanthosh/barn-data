    "description": "Over the coming months, the planet will be in retrograde motion, and will also appear brighter as it draws closer The moon will help us track down Saturn, the sixth planet in the solar system, this week. Currently residing in the constellation of Pisces, the fishes, Saturn is gradually building in brightness as the Earth’s orbit is carrying the two planets closer together. This year, the closest approach between them will occur on 21 September.In the meantime, the moon can be useful as your guide to locate Saturn and then watch it over the coming months as the planet performs a lazy pirouette in the sky, known as retrograde motion. This is an optical illusion caused by our changing line of sight to the planet as Earth overtakes it on the inside. Continue reading...",
