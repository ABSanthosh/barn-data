Exhibited at planetariums on a large curved display situated above the audience’s heads, they offer a unique experience: more immersive than the traditional rectangular frame, though not as transportive as technologies like virtual reality.Maintaining the social aspects of cinema, watching a full dome film is sort of like going to the movies, and sort of not.

In doing so, we will be able to discern the ecliptic: the plane of the solar system, which defines the path in the sky that the sun, moon and planets all follow.The chart shows a wide swathe of the sky, stretching from the south-east to south-west, as it will appear above London on 31 January at 6.45pm GMT. Starting at the western end of the panorama, a beautifully slender waxing crescent moon will be visible. Just 2.4 days old, only 6.2% of its visible surface will be illuminated. Continue reading...",
