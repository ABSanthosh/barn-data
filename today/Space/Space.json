The ring gives a glimpse of a more distant galaxy, sitting directly behind NGC 6505, whose starlight has been bent around the foreground galaxy. Continue reading...",

But before it disappears from view in March, it will continue to put on a dazzling show.It will blaze brightly on 16 February at a magnitude of –4.2, the brightest of this apparition. It will also still be high enough in the sky to be well visible several hours after the sun has set, when the sky is fully dark. Continue reading...",
