The new moon was just over four days ago and will have approximately 20% of its visible surface illuminated.For those with a particularly good view of the southern horizon, looking the evening before could be particularly rewarding, as well. The moon will be lower, about halfway between Venus and the horizon, but it will be a little closer to Venus and will appear as a particularly slender crescent with a mere 13% of its surface illuminated.From Cape Town, South Africa, the pairing will appear in a completely dark sky, being easily visible at about 20.30 SAST on 4 December. From Sydney, Australia, at the same local time and date, the moon will be just three days old and have less than 10% of its visible surface illuminated.",
