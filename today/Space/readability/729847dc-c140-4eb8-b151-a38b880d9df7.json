  "text": "(Image credit: Getty) Spending over 25 years observing the night sky, I have come to appreciate what makes a great telescope — from the build quality and accessories on offer, to the optical performance and portability.This Black Friday weekend, I have come across quite a few instruments targeted at astronomers of all levels who have a variety of budgets — and there are so many great deals on offer across Black Friday and Cyber Monday events, meaning both budding and experienced skywatchers can save hundreds of dollars on top-quality telescopes. This is true whether you're looking to buy an instrument for yourself or even for a loved one with the holidays in mind.Before you purchase a telescope, there are a few things that you need to consider: how much you're looking to spend, what type of targets pique your interest (solar system or deep-sky) and whether you're a seasoned astronomer or just starting out in your skywatching hobby. I recommend doing your research before making any purchases, and you can check out my advice on the topic with our best telescopes page, where I answer your most frequently asked questions.Ready to buy a telescope this Black Friday or Cyber Monday? Here are my top picks that boast very good optics — offering excellent, pin-sharp views without chromatic or spherical aberrations — superb builds and decent, good quality accessories. They are also portable, easy to put together and intuitive to use.My top five telescope deals this Black Friday and Cyber MondayMore top deals: Telescopes on AmazonSee the latest discounts: Telescope at WalmartBrowse the sales: Telescopes at Best BuyBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
