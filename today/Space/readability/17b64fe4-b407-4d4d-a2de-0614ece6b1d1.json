The vehicle suffered an anomaly and exploded in Earth's atmosphere around 8.5 minutes after launch. (Image credit: SpaceX) SpaceX knows how to put on a show.The company launched the seventh flight test of its Starship megarocket this afternoon from its Starbase site in South Texas. The 403-foot-tall (123 meters) vehicle lifted off successfully and achieved stage separation. And its first-stage booster, called Super Heavy, made it back down to Starbase for a dramatic catch by its launch tower's \"chopstick\" arms.But some eight minutes into the flight, SpaceX lost contact with the Starship upper stage, known as Ship. It's currently unknown what caused the problem, but one thing is certain: Ship went out with a bang.The 171-foot-tall (52 meters) spacecraft exploded over the Atlantic Ocean near the Turks and Caicos islands around 8.5 minutes after launch, creating a spectacular sky show witnessed by many people in the area.And a fair few of these folks posted their photos and videos on X, the social media site owned by SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk.Related: SpaceX catches Super Heavy booster on Starship Flight 7 test but loses upper stage (video, photos)Just saw the most insane #spacedebris #meteorshower right now in Turks and Caicos ⁦@elonmusk⁩ what is it?? pic.twitter.com/a7f4MbEB8QJanuary 16, 2025Starship Flight 7 breaking up and re-entering over Turks and Caicos pic.twitter.com/iuQ0YAy17OJanuary 16, 2025Starship from the Icon of the Seas (Caribbean Sea) @SpaceX @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/1zzspKDgNUJanuary 16, 2025Here's the exact moment Ship 33 experienced a RUD. https://t.co/in2nZBWNV8 pic.twitter.com/iI7DtLiZlEJanuary 16, 2025\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn.

And there was a silver lining today — the Super Heavy \"chopsticks\" catch, which showcased SpaceX's planned recovery strategy for both the booster and Ship.Today's catch was the second such snag for SpaceX, which first pulled off the feat in October on Starship Flight 5.
