It assesses the feasibility of space settlement by untangling the scientific, political, legal and ethical questions the idea raises.A City on Mars “blew me away with its incredibly ambitious cross-disciplinary perspective,” said John Hutchinson, professor of evolutionary biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary College and chair of this year’s judging panel.“We finish the book understanding that, while humanity having a city on Mars might yet be centuries away, many good reasons remain to pursue the lofty goal of settling space. Many of those reasons begin with doing more science and developing more technology here on Earth – and in the meantime, trying our best to preserve our precious planet.”Last month, Musk claimed that humans could land on Mars within four years and live there in a self-sustaining city in 20. “Being multiplanetary will vastly increase the probable lifespan of consciousness, as we will no longer have all our eggs, literally and metabolically, on one planet,” he wrote in a post on X, the social media platform he owns.A City on Mars, which also features illustrations, is the Weinersmiths’ second book – they first co-wrote Soonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That’ll Improve And/Or Ruin Everything, published in 2017. Kelly is a part-time lecturer in the biosciences department at Rice University, while Zach is the creator of the webcomic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.The pair are the second married couple to win the prize, following Alan Walker and Pat Shipman in 1997 for their book, The Wisdom of the Bones.The other books shortlisted for this year’s award were Eve by Cat Bohannon; Everything Is Predictable by Tom Chivers; Your Face Belongs to Us by Kashmir Hill; The Last of Its Kind by Gísli Pálsson; and Why We Die by Venki Ramakrishnan.
