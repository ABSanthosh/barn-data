  "text": "The Nasa retiree turned private astronaut Peggy Whitson splashed down safely in the Pacific early on Tuesday after her fifth trip to the International Space Station, along with crewmates from India, Poland and Hungary returning from their countries’ first ISS missions.A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying the four-member team parachuted into the sea off the coast of California at about 2.30am PDT (10.30am BST) after a fiery reentry through Earth’s atmosphere that capped a 22-hour descent from orbit.The return flight concluded the fourth ISS mission organised by the Texas-based startup Axiom Space in collaboration with SpaceX, the private rocket venture of the billionaire Elon Musk, headquartered near Los Angeles.The return flight was broadcast live by a joint SpaceX-Axiom webcast.The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule splashed down into the Pacific Ocean with its parachutes deployed. Photograph: APTwo sets of parachutes, visible through the darkness with infrared cameras, were expected to slow the capsule’s final descent to about 15mph (24km/h) moments before its splashdown off San Diego.Minutes earlier, the spacecraft had been streaking like a mechanical meteor through Earth’s lower atmosphere, generating enough frictional heat to send temperatures outside the capsule soaring to more than 1,900C (3,500F). The astronauts’ flight suits are designed to keep them cool as the cabin heats up.The Axiom-4 mission crew was led by Whitson, 65, who retired from Nasa in 2018 after a pioneering career that included becoming the US space agency’s first female chief astronaut and the first woman to command an ISS expedition.Whitson, now director of human spaceflight for Axiom, logged 675 days in space – a US record – during three previous Nasa missions and a fourth flight to space as commander of the Axiom-2 crew in 2023. Her latest mission commanding Axiom-4 will extend her record by about three more weeks.The capsule was loaded onto a recovery ship before the crew made their exit. Photograph: APThe Axiom-4 crew also included Shubhanshu Shukla, 39, of India, Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski, 41, of Poland, and Tibor Kapu, 33, of Hungary.They are returning with a cargo of science samples from more than 60 microgravity experiments conducted during their 18-day visit to the ISS, which are due to be shipped to researchers on Earth for analysis.For India, Poland and Hungary, the launch marked the first human spaceflight for each country in more than 40 years and the first mission to send astronauts from their government’s respective space programmes to the ISS.The participation of Shukla, an Indian air force pilot, is seen by India’s space programme as a precursor to the debut crewed mission of its Gaganyaan orbital spacecraft, planned for 2027.The private crew of four, in dark suits, included, from left: Peggy Whitson, Tibor Kapu, Shubhanshu Shukla and Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski. Photograph: APUznański-Wiśniewski is assigned to the European Space Agency, while Kapu is part of his country’s Hungarian to Orbit (HUNOR) programme, though he is not the first person of Hungarian descent to board the space station.Charles Simonyi, a Hungarian-born billionaire software designer who became a US citizen in 1982, has twice visited the ISS as a space tourist, in 2007 and 2009, riding aboard Russian Soyuz capsules.But like many wealthy individuals from various countries who have paid their own way for rides into space, Simonyi was not flying on behalf of his homeland or any government.Named “Grace” by its crew, the newly commissioned capsule flown for Axiom-4 was launched from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 25 June, becoming the fifth vehicle in SpaceX’s Crew Dragon fleet.Shubhanshu Shukla waves as he leaves the SpaceX capsule. Photograph: APThe Axiom-4 team arrived at the ISS on 26 June, welcomed onboard by the station’s latest rotating crew of seven occupants: three US astronauts, one Japanese crewmate and three Russian cosmonauts. The two crews parted company again early on Monday this week, when Crew Dragon Grace undocked to begin its voyage home.Axiom-4 also marks the 18th crewed spaceflight logged by SpaceX since 2020, when Musk’s rocket company ushered in a new Nasa era by providing American astronauts with their first rides to space from US soil since the end of the space shuttle programme nine years earlier.For Axiom, a nine-year-old venture co-founded by Nasa’s former ISS programme manager, the mission builds on its business of putting astronauts sponsored by private companies and foreign governments into low Earth orbit.Axiom is also one of a handful of companies developing a commercial space station of its own that is intended to replace the ISS, which Nasa expects to retire around 2030.",
