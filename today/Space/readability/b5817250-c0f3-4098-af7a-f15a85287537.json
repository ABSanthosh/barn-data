Situated about 550 light years from Earth, it contains about 15 times the mass of the sun, is about 680 times the size, and pours out almost 76,000 times more energy.From the southern hemisphere, around mid-evening, Antares and Scorpius appear high in the eastern sky. From Sydney on 10 June, the moon and Antares will be side by side.",
