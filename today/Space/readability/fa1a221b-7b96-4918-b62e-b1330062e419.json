KSC has provided no updates since Wednesday.\"Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach the spaceport by Wednesday evening, with tornadoes possible ahead of Milton's center of approach,\" NASA officials wrote of KSC's status in a blog post, ahead of the storm's arrival.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!The KSC visitors center is also closed at least through today (Oct. 10), officials previously wrote on X. Milton's arrival is also affecting operations on the International Space Station. Crew-8, the eighth operational astronauts mission to the ISS by SpaceX, is delayed in its departure, and NASA expects to update the timing on Friday (Oct. 11). The most recent target date for departure for the four astronauts of Crew-8 was Sunday (Oct. 13). Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!
