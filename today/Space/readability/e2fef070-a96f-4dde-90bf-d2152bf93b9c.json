The Soyuz spacecraft has been in operation since the late 1960s and, due to its length of service, is considered the safest and most cost-effective space vehicle. The capsule of the spacecraft, which is not reusable, measures just 2.2 metres long and 2.1 metres wide. Each one can carry up to three people. It takes six hours to reach the space station and just three and a half hours to return",
