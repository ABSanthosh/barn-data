(Image credit: NRO)The Minotaur rocket family, built by aerospace giant Northrop Grumman, consists of repurposed intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Minotaur IV is a four-stage vehicle that stands 78 feet (24 meters) tall.A Minotaur IV hadn't flown since a July 2020 mission that launched from Virginia. But today, the rocket got back to work and did its job as planned.\"The NROL-174 Minotaur IV rocket was once a Peacekeeper ICBM that sat watch 24/7 in support of our nation's nuclear deterrent,\" NROL-174 Mission Director Laura Robinson, deputy director of the NRO Office of Space Launch, said in a post-launch statement.\"Now modified for space launch, it completed its final mission of placing a national security payload on orbit, a credit to the decades-long dedication of those who were part of the missile’s early development, maintenance and operations, and innovative conversion into the Minotaur IV rocket,\" Robinson added. \"It was truly a team effort.\"Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Related: SpaceX launches next-gen US spy satellites on 100th Falcon 9 flight of the year (video, photos)The NRO builds and operates the nation's fleet of spy satellites. The agency reveals few details about these craft and their capabilities, so it's no surprise that NROL-174 is shrouded in secrecy.The NRO's press kit offers a vague explanation, saying the mission consists \"of multiple national security payloads designed, built and operated by the NRO.\"NROL-174 flew via the U.S. Space Force's Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP). According to the press kit, the RLSP \"primarily launches more risk-tolerant experimental, research and development, responsive space and operational missions.\" Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!
