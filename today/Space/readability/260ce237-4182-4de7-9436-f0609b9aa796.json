Although its specifications are remarkable, its actual performance is the true litmus test. Pros +Nitrogen-purged, waterproof design +ED-R glass coatings +Wide-angle lens Cons -Very stiff focus wheel -Untethered eyepiece cover -No tripod thread Jump to: Design Performance Functionality User reviews How we tested Should you buy it? Related products The Opticron Explorer 8x42 is packed with premium features that are typically found in much more expensive monoculars. It boasts not only BAK-4-coated prisms for superior image clarity but also ED-R-coated glass with Opticron's latest high-light transmission coating. With a wide, 7.5-degree field of view and a wide-angle eyepiece offering long eye relief for people who wear glasses, this monocular ensures an immersive viewing experience.

This makes it easy to carry for extended periods, especially during outdoor activities. The polycarbonate chassis is durable and lightweight, and the focus wheel is rubber-coated for a comfortable grip. It has a tethered objective lens cover; the eyepiece cover is a push-on design.

(Image credit: Matt Morris)During our field test, the Opticron Explorer WA proved to be a reliable performer. We conducted our observations from a purpose-built hide, and the monocular delivered excellent images of the diverse birdlife in the area. Using the monocular at night is limited due to the small 8x magnification, but we were able to view the moon in some detail as the 42mm objective lens allows lots of light transfer.While its 8x magnification may not make it the most powerful optical device for this setting, it was delightful to use. We noted that the image stabilization of the monocular worked effectively at this magnification, reducing the common issues associated with image stability.The tethered objective lens cover falls out of the way when in use. (Image credit: Matt Morris)However, we found that the focus ring on the top of the device could have been more ergonomically comfortable. Achieving a proper focus required us to use both hands, which detracted from an otherwise excellent design. Quick and precise focusing is essential during a meteor shower, and the stiff action of the focus ring proved to be a drawback.As the light waned, we continued our observations, focusing particularly on the birds around a nearby lake. The Explorer started to lose contrast and sharpness as the daylight diminished. This was particularly noticeable when we were observing a moorhen with solid-black plumage — its features became increasingly indistinct. Even smaller birds, such as wrens and robins, accentuated this issue.On a positive note, the Explorer's compact and lightweight build compensated for the cumbersome focus ring, making it effortless to stow in a pocket and convenient for moving to different viewing locations.Functionality★ ★ ★ ½Compact design Stiff focus wheel Untethered eyepiece coverThe unit comes with well-made accessories. (Image credit: Matt Morris)This monocular features a compact and sleek design that is both stylish and functional. During our testing, we found that the focus wheel is quite stiff, which limits single-handed use and makes it more suitable for two-handed operation. While the eyecup adjustment mechanism feels a bit inexpensive, it is well weighted and functional.Included with the monocular are a padded shoulder strap and a belt pouch, both of which are of decent quality and add to the overall value of the product. The waterproof design and durable casing give the monocular a sense of reliability and robustness, making it suitable for various outdoor activities. It feels capable and comfortable to bring along for casual use or for more dedicated purposes, such as bird-watching.We discovered that the monocular delivered impressive performance when used to observe birds in a garden setting. The bright blue flash of the great tits' wings as they left the feeder was well captured by the Opticron monocular, providing an immersive viewing experience.However, one downside is that the unit lacks a tripod fixture, which would have been a convenient addition for hands-free viewing and prolonged observation. Nonetheless, the overall performance and build quality make this monocular a compelling option for outdoor enthusiasts and bird watchers.User reviewsThe monocular has good-quality glass and feels well-made. It's a good-value item that works well for the price. Some users find it easy to put in a pocket, but others mention that the focus wheel is very stiff.How we testedOur test included visiting bird hides, lakes and woodland locations in various weather conditions. We used the test subjects in as many different situations as possible so that it would cover a broad spectrum of use.Should you buy the Opticron Explorer WA ED-R 8x42 monocular?You will need two hands for this monocular when focusing. (Image credit: Matt Morris)If you're looking for a quality monocular with premium coated glass and a durable, well-constructed body, we highly recommend the Opticron Explorer WA ED-R 8x42. This monocular's compact dimensions and lightweight design greatly enhance its appeal. We found that the unit's glass quality consistently delivered performance on a par with more costly counterparts. Although the focus ring posed a minor issue, the superior image quality more than compensated for this drawback.If the Opticron Explorer WA ED-R 8x42 monocular isn't for you If you prefer easier focusing, consider the Hawke Endurance Ed 10x42 monocular, which features a top-mounted focus wheel. For better image quality and a convenient design, you might want to explore the Bushnell Legend Ultra 10x42, although it comes at a slightly higher price. Another option in the same price range is the Celestron Outland 20x50, which also offers multicoated optics and includes a smartphone adapter for capturing pictures through the monocular.
