But their brand-new ride, Boeing’s Starliner capsule, encountered so much trouble that Nasa decided to return it empty.That left the two test pilots, both retired navy captains, in orbit until SpaceX can bring them home. That will not happen until late March or early April, extending their mission to 10 months because of a SpaceX delay in launching their replacements.Williams performed a spacewalk two weeks ago with another Nasa astronaut. Thursday’s spacewalk marked Wilmore’s first time outside this trip. Both took spacewalks during previous space station stays.",
