Sometimes science that turns out to be wrong was right based on the evidence of the time. Astronomy is a great example.The ancients thought the Earth was the centre of everything. They had evidence for that. You could see the sun rise. You could see it set. It all suggested that the Earth was the centre of everything. Then we learned about wandering stars and had to rethink it. Scientists need to not be wedded to our ideas, which can be a very human failing.Science needs diversity. It’s not about quotas, it’s genuinely required by the discipline. You need different ideas coming in from different cultures, different ways of looking at things, different skill-sets working together. Otherwise everyone is exploring the same areas, seeing things in the same way, and it’s difficult to have progress and innovation.It’s important to me to work in promoting diversity, because I know what it feels like, being underestimated, being told that people like me don’t have a place in the field. I don’t want talented young people to feel like that any more.I can’t believe they made a Barbie of me. I told Mattel that when I was a child I used to pull apart Barbies and try to make one that looked like me. Now children like me can grow up and do things unlike what was once expected. I often use the doll as a vehicle when I go to speak to kids in schools. It bridges the gap. It’s a magical thing, but a powerful thing, too.We need to restore people’s faith in science. There are lots of reasons why people have wavered, but understanding the consequences is more important than understanding the reasons. We’ve gone through an evolution. In the past scientists were the knowledgable ones, we viewed everyone else as being there to impart our wisdom on. That’s not a great way to communicate and Learning should be more of a conversation, like in the case of astronomy. Yes, the big telescopes are where most of the breakthroughs come from – but we wouldn’t know where to point them if we didn’t have the involvement of amateurs.Webb’s Universe, by Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, is published in October by Michael O’Mara Books, at £25.
