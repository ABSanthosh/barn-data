It was conducted by the 101 Institute of CASC's Academy of Aerospace Propulsion Technology.On Jan. 2, 2025, China tested five new rocket engines, which could help power a variety of space missions. (Image credit: CCTV)\"The just-completed experiment tested an upper-stage liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen engine. It tested the overall coordination of the engine and obtained performance data. After assessment, we concluded that the test was a complete success,\" Xia Wei, a CASC engineer, told China Central Television (CCTV).Related: The history of rocketsChina is known to be developing new liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen engines for rockets including the Long March 10 launcher, which is designed to send astronauts to the moon.Also test-fired in Beijing were a main engine, an upper-stage engine, and a reaction and orbit control engine. Reports did not identify which of China's rockets the engines were for.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!In Laiyuan, a methane-liquid oxygen engine was also successfully tested, again with few details provided. China's commercial launch companies such as Landspace and iSpace have developed methane-fueled engines, while CASC is developing a powerful, full-flow staged combustion engine for its Long March 9 megarocket project. SAST, another CASC subsidiary, is also developing a methane rocket, which is expected to have a launch and landing test as soon as next week.Xia added that CASC will conduct research and testing of multiple engines for deep-space exploration, heavy-lift rockets, and other types of engines for China's major space projects, according to CCTV news. China could debut a range of new Long March and commercial rockets this year, according to SpaceNews. Join our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!
