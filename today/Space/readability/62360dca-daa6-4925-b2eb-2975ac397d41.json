(Image credit: SpaceX)The 27 satellites were on course to be deployed at just under an hour after they left the ground.According to SpaceX's billionaire founder Elon Musk, the Starlink network is not only a needed solution for people outside the reach of other broadband options, but a key to the company's plans for the future.\"Starlink internet is what is being used to pay for humanity going to Mars,\" Musk said during a recent update delivered to employees at SpaceX's Starship facility in Starbase, Texas. \"I would like to thank everyone out there who has bought Starlink because you are helping to secure the future of civilization and helping make life interplanetary.\"The first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is seen standing on a sea-based droneship after launching 27 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit on May 31, 2025. (Image credit: SpaceX)Starlink is now the largest satellite constellation ever launched into Earth orbit. According to satellite tracker Jonathan McDowell, there are currently more than 7,600 active Starlink spacecraft out of the nearly 8,790 total units deployed to date.Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
