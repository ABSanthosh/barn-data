The rocket flipped over and slammed into the ocean near the pad, sending an orange-tinted cloud high into a clear Arctic sky, as the video shows.Isar Aerospace's Spectrum rocket crashed and exploded during its first-ever flight, on March 30, 2025. (Image credit: Isar Aerospace)The launch pad and surrounding infrastructure appear to have escaped damage, according to Isar Aerospace. The company accentuated the positive about Spectrum's debut, saying the 95-foot-tall (28 meters) rocket performed quite well overall.\"Our first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,\" Isar Aerospace CEO and Co-founder Daniel Metzler said in an emailed statement. \"We had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our flight termination system.\"An Isar Aerospace Spectrum rocket lifts off from Andoya Spaceport in Norway on March 30, 2025 on its first flight.
