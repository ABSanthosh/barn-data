Playwright Stella Feehily focuses the bulk of her narrative on Cecilia’s bid, decades later, to become Harvard’s chair of astronomy.

She has, to use one character’s words, the “requisite iron”.Steely … Maureen Beattie in The Lightest Element. Photograph: Mark DouetAnnie Kingsnorth provides counterpoint as the preppy Sally, a student journalist sent to interview her with an ulterior motive. Sally’s creepy editor boyfriend (Steffan Cennydd) wants a scoop that will out Cecilia and her Russian husband to the House Un-American Activities Committee. It provides some entertaining moments between the pair, particularly when Cecilia drops her guard and introduces the young woman to Polish vodka.But the jeopardy never quite bites, and Feehily leans heavily on the journalism device to download Cecilia’s biography. Sarah Beaton and Johanna Town’s screen and light projections offer an elegant complement to the spare staging but can’t quite break the arid, academic feel of the production. Sally’s journey is nicely marked – from eating ice cream sundaes when we first meet, to her final meeting with her boyfriend who notes her drinking “hard liquor”. But Cecilia’s story never quite takes to the skies. Nevertheless, she persisted.",
