  "text": "Space Verdict This headlamp has everything you'd expect from a Petzl product. It is lightweight but very well made, throwing out 450 lumens up to 75 meters. There are a few small niggles, but nothing that would put us off buying one. Pros +Takes standard batteries or the CORE battery pack +Lightweight and compact +Single-button control Cons -Micro-USB to charge the rechargeable battery -Not completely waterproof Why you can trust Space.com Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test and review products. Petzl has been making headlamps since 1973, so you might say they know what they are doing! A lamp body, a battery pack, and an elastic headband is what make up the original 'modern headlamp' — and that's the same formula used today. That said, as the needs of consumers change, such companies look to develop their products to suit modern lifestyles in different environments and for a range of uses.We can now typically expect some level of waterproofing, a comfortable and adjustable headband, different lighting modes, a lockable light and a rechargeable battery. This unit has all of those things and more.SpecificationsLED Color: White and RedBrightness (Lumens): 450 lumensRuntime: 110 hours on low (7 lumens), 2 hours on full powerWeight: 2.96 oz/ 84gWaterproof Rating: IPX4Battery Type: 3 x AAA or the supplied CORE batteryWe reviewed the Petzl Aktik Core in 2022, and it still ranks among our favorites in our best headlamps guide. Here we are looking at the Petzl Tikka Core. Some subtle differences have improved its usability without going over the top with superfluous tech.Petzl Tikka Core headlamp reviewPetzl Tikka Core Headlamp: Design★★★★★The integrated phosphorescent reflector makes it easy to find in the dark (Image credit: Tantse Walter)Small and lightweightFour colorways to choose fromOne button operationThe Petzl Tikka Core is an attractive headlamp with an angular body. It is simple yet functional. You can choose from four colors — yellow, blue, grey and green. Our review unit is green, which stands out nicely in our kit bag. A new feature is a phosphorescent reflector that 'glows' in the dark, making it even more visible and easier to find amongst other dark equipment.The low-profile housing is welcomed, and the band is comfortable; it would be suitable for use as a running headlamp, camping, hiking and of course, sky-watching. It has IPX4 water resistance (which essentially means splashproof).The wide headband is nicely designed and has a reflective strip for increased visibility. (Image credit: Tantse Walter)The unit utilizes single-button operation to aid ease of use. All functionality, including changing the brightness, lighting mode, and locking the unit, is controlled by this button.One of the key features of Petzl's 'Core' range, is that they come with a rechargeable 'CORE' battery, but they can also take three AAA batteries if you prefer, or if you have no means to charge the unit (if you're out on a multi-day hike, for example).Petzl Tikka Core Headlamp: Performance★★★★The top right of the unit's face has a battery level indicator light, which is also the 'battery locked' indicator light. (Image credit: Tantse Walter)Comfortable to wearIntuitive to useReserve mode is handyWe've taken this head torch on several nighttime hikes over the past couple of weeks, and its performance aligns with what we'd expect from the Petzl brand.It is very light, and the headband can be adjusted for comfort; we even stretched it over a bike helmet when our dedicated bike light failed. It sits comfortably on the forehead and you forget you're wearing it.The quoted burn times for the Petzl Tikka Core are two hours on full power (450 lm), seven hours on medium power (100 lm) and 110 hours on the lowest setting (7 lm).On the two higher settings, a handy reserve setting gives an extra two hours of low light — enough for walking but not fast-paced activity. We were reassured that we wouldn't be left entirely in the dark if we forgot to charge the headlamp before we left the house.The battery itself has an indicator light too — red is on charge, green is ready. (Image credit: Tantse Walter)We found the switch from 7 lm to 100 lm quite a big jump and dazzled other walkers on occasion (and then again on the highest setting when cycling back to the low mode!); we would prefer more steps between the lowest and medium settings. All of the light comes from one LED; there are no dedicated spot (narrow beam for long-distance viewing) or flood (wide angle coverage over a large area) lights. We didn't find this a problem, but users who need to identify landmarks or targets at long distances (over 75 m) might want to look elsewhere.Another small drawback is that you have to turn on the white light before activating the red light. If you forget to set it to red before heading out for a night of skywatching, you risk briefly ruining your night vision when switching the headlamp on.Petzl Tikka Core Headlamp: Functionality★★★★This supplied storage sack doubles up to make an effective 'lantern'. (Image credit: Tantse Walter)Charges using micro-USBReflective bandIPX4 Water resistance Aside from the little niggles we've mentioned above, this is a solid, reliable headlamp with some discrete but helpful features.There is a lock function to save you from accidentally powering on the headlamp in your kit bag or luggage. To activate lock mode, turn the headlamp off and press and hold the button for around seven seconds; you will see the indicator light on the lamp blink three times. Now, if the button is accidentally pressed, it will blink three times but not activate the main LED. Long-press again to turn the lock off.1250mAh isn't a huge capacity rechargeable battery, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; it's quick to recharge using a power bank or mains power. The CORE battery can be removed from the unit, so you could purchase another one to swap in when needed; they are around $28. This sounds like a lot at first, but it's much, much cheaper (and better for the environment) than purchasing three AAA batteries every time you run out of power. The CORE battery still uses micro-USB charging rather than the preferred USB-C. This means slower charging than some models, and you must also remember to pack an extra cable.There is a charging indicator on the CORE battery and a little indicator on the top right lamp itself (look at the front of the unit as soon as you turn it off to see the battery level so you don't dazzle yourself looking at it when the light is turned on).Petzl has included a little translucent storage sack that doubles as a 'lantern.' It's surprisingly effective at giving a soft glow in your tent to help you find your belongings as you get comfortable and ready for bed. You can use the headband or drawstrings on the sack to hang it up.The bracket design lets you turn the lamp a full 360 degrees. (Image credit: Tantse Walter)Another handy feature is the bracket design of the headlamp. You physically tilt the lamp so the light points in the direction you want. It can swivel a complete 360 degrees — this is how you access the battery compartment.We've already mentioned the phosphorescent reflector at the front of the lamp, but there's also a reflective pattern on the wide band so you are visible to others.Should I buy the Petzl Tikka Core Headlamp?Buy it if:✅ You want a reliable model from a trusted brand: Petzl has been making headlamps since 1973, so it's safe to say they know what they're doing.✅ You want the option of using the CORE battery or AAA batteries: You can do both with this headlamp or purchase an additional CORE battery that you can easily swap in for more power.Don't buy it if:❌ You need a dedicated spot or flood light: All settings use one LED light, so you might want another model if you're (for example) working at close proximity to something or need to see a long way into the distance.❌ You want something fully waterproof: The Tikka Core has a waterproof rating of IPX, which is basically splashproof.The Petzl Tikka Core is a good choice for your next headlamp, providing that you don't need a dedicated spot or flood light. From our previous experience with Petzl, it will last you years and won't let you down.The ability to choose 'normal' batteries or use the supplied 'CORE' is attractive to multi-day trekkers, especially if you purchase another CORE that you can easily swap in.The IPX4 rating means it is suitable for light rain and won't be affected by sweat or humid conditions, but it's not for submersion, and it is probably best not to use it in heavy rain.If you need something waterproof, consider the Knog Bilby 400, which has an IP67 waterproof rating. An alternative would be the Nitecore NU31, also rated IP67, but the rechargeable battery can't be removed from the unit.The Silva Terra Scout XT has a slightly better waterproof rating than the Tikka CORE and has the hybrid power option (though it doesn't have a lock function).
