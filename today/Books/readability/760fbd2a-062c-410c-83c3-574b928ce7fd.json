  "description": "Colt has a secret identity. By day, he’s a seemingly ordinary child, but when the neighborhood needs his help, he transforms into Neigh Kid—dressed in a horse mask, a red cape, and nothing else. He envisions himself as a majestic hero, galloping through streets on a mission to save a lost pet. However, the humorous reality is that he’s a scantily clad child dashing away from his loving parents, who are desperately trying to get him to put on clothes. Colt’s playful antics are sure to elicit laughter from kids and adults. However, the overarching, serious message of the story is one of bravery. Although elementary school–age children will find the text accessible, adults may need to explain occasional wordplay: “A cat: lost. A street: crossed. Colt: tossed.” Moraes’s full-color cartoon illustrations strategically and cleverly cover the protagonist’s nudity with a well-placed falling leaf or a flick of his cape. Colt and his family are depicted with pale skin, and his neighbors are portrayed with brown skin tones. A list of objects is included at the end for readers to spot in the illustrations, making each read an interactive experience.",

  "text": "DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE SLEIGH! by Mo Willems ; illustrated by Mo Willems ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 5, 2023 A stocking stuffer par excellence, just right for dishing up with milk and cookies. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 13 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Pigeon finds something better to drive than some old bus. This time it’s Santa delivering the fateful titular words, and with a “Ho. Ho. Whoa!” the badgering begins: “C’mon! Where’s your holiday spirit? It would be a Christmas MIRACLE! Don’t you want to be part of a Christmas miracle…?” Pigeon is determined: “I can do Santa stuff!” Like wrapping gifts (though the accompanying illustration shows a rather untidy present), delivering them (the image of Pigeon attempting to get an oversize sack down a chimney will have little ones giggling), and eating plenty of cookies. Alas, as Willems’ legion of young fans will gleefully predict, not even Pigeon’s by-now well-honed persuasive powers (“I CAN BE JOLLY!”) will budge the sleigh’s large and stinky reindeer guardian. “BAH. Also humbug.” In the typically minimalist art, the frustrated feathered one sports a floppily expressive green and red elf hat for this seasonal addition to the series—but then discards it at the end for, uh oh, a pair of bunny ears. What could Pigeon have in mind now? “Egg delivery, anyone?” A stocking stuffer par excellence, just right for dishing up with milk and cookies.
