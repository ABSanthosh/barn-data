  "description": "Rather than construct narratives for their 20 randomly ordered selections, Pintos and Iannuzzi toss pithy fact bits and spot images across each spread around a full body portrait, with inconspicuous arrows here and there to link related items. Though at least systematic when it comes to providing range maps, typical sizes and weights, conservation status, and like basics, several entries may leave readers struggling to decode statements—for instance, the rat’s “predatory instinct is activated only when hungry.” Readers may also be left wondering why only about 3,000 electric eel young are born when the female lays roughly 17,000 eggs. The stylistic art is arresting, making vibrant use of texture to depict patterns on the Indian cobra, the Tasmanian devil, and the panther. Brief descriptions of the various animals ramp up the drama: The eagle is “silent and powerful,” while the heron’s “beak never misses.” A final note on food chains headed “Everybody Hunts” (herbivores may take rightful umbrage) closes out an informative if somewhat disorganized survey of the “red in tooth and claw” set. The only human figures are small silhouetted bodies or body parts included to show scale.",

  "text": "WHAT IF YOU HAD AN ANIMAL HOME!? From the What if You Had . . .? series by Sandra Markle ; illustrated by Howard McWilliam ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 7, 2024 Another playful imagination-stretcher. Markle invites children to picture themselves living in the homes of 11 wild animals. As in previous entries in the series, McWilliam’s illustrations of a diverse cast of young people fancifully imitating wild creatures are paired with close-up photos of each animal in a like natural setting. The left side of one spread includes a photo of a black bear nestling in a cozy winter den, while the right side features an image of a human one cuddled up with a bear. On another spread, opposite a photo of honeybees tending to newly hatched offspring, a human “larva” lounges at ease in a honeycomb cell, game controller in hand, as insect attendants dish up goodies. A child with an eye patch reclines on an orb weaver spider’s web, while another wearing a head scarf constructs a castle in a subterranean chamber with help from mound-building termites. Markle adds simple remarks about each type of den, nest, or burrow and basic facts about its typical residents, then closes with a reassuring reminder to readers that they don’t have to live as animals do, because they will “always live where people live.” A select gallery of traditional homes, from igloo and yurt to mudhif, follows a final view of the young cast waving from a variety of differently styled windows. Another playful imagination-stretcher.
