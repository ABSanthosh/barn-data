  "text": "31 Dec 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Flight of the Windigo? I made a short film at Film School about thirty years ago and the essence of the story stuck with me all these years. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Flight of the Windigo, what would they be? The Good, The Bad and the Ugly theme song. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Western or Adventure. That’s what I like to write as well. What books are on your TBR pile right now? The Captured, Behind the scenes making of John Ford Cavalry films, Pony Tracks, Charles Goodnight. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The confrontation in the outpost where they try to get at the aviator’s partner and he holds them off. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Standing to write so my shoulder doesn’t get bound up and hurting like it did during Covid – got a lot of writing done during the pandemic! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Put the time in and it will add up to something someday. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? The characters.
