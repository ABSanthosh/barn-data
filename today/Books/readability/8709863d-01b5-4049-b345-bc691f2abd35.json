  "description": "As a framework for his detailed advice on navigating the real estate business (in particular the practice of “flipping”—buying a distressed property, rehabbing it, and selling it for a profit), the author offers his “M.B.P.E.” method, which he modestly describes as “a waterfall of energy that will lead you to a revolutionary change as a human being, in your relationships with others, in your work and business.” The letters stand for “morning” (Iasiello emphasizes the importance of getting up very early every day), “prayer” (which he claims will “help you feel less lonely), “biohacking” (which is “regulating one’s body and mind through breathing, healthy food, supplements and proper use of sleep”), and “exercise” (which is important “because your mental and physical state is the first step towards getting results in real estate and life in general”). After making these clarifications, the author’s emphasis shifts almost entirely away from “life in general” to real estate as Iasiello explains the basics of his business to newcomers looking to start on their own. “In most cases when flipping real estate, your product is money, delivered quickly and smoothly,” he writes, with the kind of knowing directness that characterizes the whole book. “Your ideal client is someone who lives in your target neighborhood, needs money fast, and is willing to sacrifice some of the value of their home to get cash.” The author is pleasingly blunt when discussing everything from pre-foreclosures to evictions to absentee homeowners and the details of probate. He gives wise and easy-to-follow advice on how to spot likely properties, how to find buyers (“the engine that will keep your investment potential alive”), how to craft effective networks and ads, and dozens of other related topics. His narrative energy also applies to his life advice, but most readers will be coming here for the real estate tips, and they’ll be well rewarded.",

  "text": "THE CULTURE MAP BREAKING THROUGH THE INVISIBLE BOUNDARIES OF GLOBAL BUSINESS by Erin Meyer ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 27, 2014 These are not hard and fast rules, but Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business. A helpful guide to working effectively with people from other cultures. “The sad truth is that the vast majority of managers who conduct business internationally have little understanding about how culture is impacting their work,” writes Meyer, a professor at INSEAD, an international business school. Yet they face a wider array of work styles than ever before in dealing with clients, suppliers and colleagues from around the world. When is it best to speak or stay quiet? What is the role of the leader in the room? When working with foreign business people, failing to take cultural differences into account can lead to frustration, misunderstanding or worse. Based on research and her experiences teaching cross-cultural behaviors to executive students, the author examines a handful of key areas. Among others, they include communicating (Anglo-Saxons are explicit; Asians communicate implicitly, requiring listeners to read between the lines), developing a sense of trust (Brazilians do it over long lunches), and decision-making (Germans rely on consensus, Americans on one decider). In each area, the author provides a “culture map scale” that positions behaviors in more than 20 countries along a continuum, allowing readers to anticipate the preferences of individuals from a particular country: Do they like direct or indirect negative feedback? Are they rigid or flexible regarding deadlines? Do they favor verbal or written commitments? And so on. Meyer discusses managers who have faced perplexing situations, such as knowledgeable team members who fail to speak up in meetings or Indians who offer a puzzling half-shake, half-nod of the head. Cultural differences—not personality quirks—are the motivating factors behind many behavioral styles. Depending on our cultures, we understand the world in a particular way, find certain arguments persuasive or lacking merit, and consider some ways of making decisions or measuring time natural and others quite strange. These are not hard and fast rules, but Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business.
