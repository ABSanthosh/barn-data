  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Love at First Beat (Rough \u0026 Ready Country Book 10)? I experienced the meet-cute in real life! About a year ago, I was at a Starbucks in a hospital and ordered the same thing as a doctor who stopped by on his break—a venti Americano with cream and bacon and gruyere egg bites. Nothing happened beyond that because I’m a happily married woman. But the bizarreness of the coincidence got my writer’s brain turning! I’m also a classical musician, and I rehearsed and performed the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra while writing this book. This inspired me to add the character of the matchmaker grandpa, Anton Horowitz, who fast became my favorite side character. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Love at First Beat (Rough \u0026 Ready Country Book 10), what would they be? Besides the Rachmaninoff, which is central to the storyline, I’d pick Morgan Wallen’s “Spin You Around” for Fletcher, the grumpy cowboy cardiologist, and Daniel Levi’s “I Like It With You” for Drew, the sunshiny romance writer. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I’m a huge fan of contemporary romances set in small towns and featuring curvy girls and alpha males, especially cowboys and mountain men. So, I love to read what I write! What books are on your TBR pile right now? My TBR is piled high with mountain man and cowboy books by Elliott Rose, Lyla Sage, Elsie Silver, Sadie King, Mia Brody, and Hope Ford. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Besides the meet-cute, which I’ve wanted to write for the past year, I adore the scene at the romance readers club. The thought of big, burly Army cardiologist Dr. Fletcher Knight attending an all-female reading club for the inside scoop on how to woo Drew melts my heart every time I think about it. Throughout the book, he makes it abundantly clear he’ll do anything to win over his lady love. But in this scene, he proves it! That’s my kind of MMC! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) As a writer and musician, music and writing are interwoven for me. So, I often listen to music to help inspire storylines and get me in the right mood for writing, and each book has a full playlist of songs to accompany various scenes, themes, and characters. I also like listening to green noise and ASMR. My 14-year-old son makes fun of me for the ASMR videos, but I love getting the tingles while I write! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? “Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.” —George Bernard Shaw If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? It may be a cliché, but as a romance author, I live by this—love conquers all. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
