  "description": "When it comes to getting involved with men, independent Quinn, a gorgeous, green-eyed, 6-foot-tall redhead, has one unshakeable rule: They have to be unhappily married, with no kids. (After all, she’s no homewrecker.) Having sworn off marriage after two failures, only hot sex and romance with no expectations on either side does it for Quinn. (The fact that she’ll eventually have to pay for her cavalier disregard for the wives of her short-term lovers hardly comes as a surprise, but the author’s audacious twist on the inevitable comeuppance does, thankfully leaving her hero’s spiky, bright spirit undimmed.) Quinn’s eventual realization that her determined, no-strings approach to relationships has consequences begins when Marcus, “the one whose mere presence zaps my appetite, flushes my cheeks and makes me want to giggle like a schoolgirl mooning over her first crush,” walks into the upscale restaurant where Quinn is the wine- and food-savvy sommelier. “I love the magic that happens when a great glass of wine pairs perfectly with a dish,” she says. “It’s lusty and romantic…. It’s akin to the ideal relationship, fleeting but swoon-worthy.” Perfect though he seems, if Marcus isn’t married, Quinn will have to go with her second choice, a handsome, married, infidelity newbie. The author’s lavish descriptions of clothes, gourmet meals, and wine—some chapters open with a description of enticing menu offerings—and the characters’ nearly exclusive focus on hormone-charged relationships make for an engaging rom-com Sex and the City vibe. When she can no longer ignore the messy realities of her affairs, it takes time for Quinn to get past her defensive reaction and face a difficult decision: “I don’t feel guilty. I didn’t make any vows,” she says. The author doesn’t let her off the hook, but the off-the-wall result satisfies, and humor and a light touch are ever-present (Quinn’s blind date with a picky vegetarian at her Italian mother’s bountiful, nonvegetarian dinner table is a kick).",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
