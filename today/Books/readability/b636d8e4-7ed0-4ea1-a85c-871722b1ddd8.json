  "description": "The wild horse roundup that Lincoln County, Nevada, Sheriff Porter Beck and his deputy, Tuffy Scruggs, watch is a contentious event pitting horse advocates against ranchers who want every blade of grass on public land to go to their cattle. The use of helicopters to chase the frantic horses into corrals leaves some of the animals injured or dead. The roundup is run by Jolene Manning’s Bureau of Land Management crew, whose rough methods are decried by CANTER, a horse rescue group run by Etta Clay. When the helicopter crashes, Beck and Tuffy discover that the pilot was shot out of the sky. Jolene blames Etta, but Beck is open to other theories. Beck’s dealing with his Pop, the former sheriff, whose dementia is worsening; Covid-19, which is just starting to ravage the area; and his upcoming move to work alongside his girlfriend, state Det. Charlie Blue Horse. Despite his private opinion, Beck doesn’t take sides on the horse roundups, but he has a feeling that the CANTER crowd didn’t kill the pilot, who was having an affair with Jolene. On top of that, Beck’s adopted sister, Brinley Cummings, rescued from a horrendous childhood by Pop, was volunteering with a group dealing with troubled youth and hasn’t returned from following a runaway. When Jolene is buried up to her neck and trampled by wild horses, tensions flare. The FBI suspect Robert Lewis Northrup Jr., who suffers from PTSD. Enter the bosses of a politically sensitive lithium mine whose land impact reports may be false. Beck and his crew have a wild ride tracking down the murderer.",

  "text": "NIGHTSHADE by Michael Connelly ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 20, 2025 As the prosecutor sadly observes: “All this because of a dead buffalo.” Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 184 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Idyllic Catalina Island turns out to be just as crime infested as the rest of Los Angeles County in the latest series launch by the creator of Harry Bosch, Renée Ballard, and the Lincoln Lawyer. Det. Sgt. Stilwell has been bounced off the county homicide squad and rusticized to Catalina, where the exclusive Black Marlin Club won’t admit even four-term Avalon Mayor Doug Allen to full membership and the most serious infraction seems to be the killing and cutting up of a buffalo, presumably by Henry Gaston, who operates Island Mystery Tours when he’s not threatening endangered species. All that changes with the discovery of a body sunk in the surrounding waters. The corpse, most recognizable by its streak of purple hair, is that of Leigh-Anne Moss, a Black Marlin server recently fired for fraternizing with members and guests she sees as potential sugar daddies. Stilwell is sufficiently invested in her murder to compete vigorously over jurisdiction with Rex Ahearn, the LA County homicide detective who kept his job when Stilwell lost his. Their rivalry, fueled by mutual contempt, is only the first hint that Stilwell will end up fighting his counterparts in law enforcement and local government at least as hard as he fights crooks like hit man Merris Spivak and Oscar “Baby Head” Terranova, Henry’s boss, who comes under sharper scrutiny when Henry disappears and ends up dead himself. Connelly handles his hero’s obligatory romance with assistant harbormaster Tash Dano and his increasingly wary alliance with assistant D.A. Monika Juarez with equal professionalism, and if the wrap-up leaves some loose ends dangling, well, that’s what franchises are for.
