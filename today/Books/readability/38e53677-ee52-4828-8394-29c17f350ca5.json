  "description": "“Raised as a white person” in southern Brazil, Howard University professor Araujo is determined to include in her account both Latin America and those regions from which enslaved Africans were kidnapped. Synthesizing primary sources and other historians’ findings, she works her way from West Africa and West Central Africa, through the Middle Passage, to the Americas, then back again. As she contrasts the experiences of bondspeople across time and space, she takes care to explore the lives of enslaved women and to highlight enslaved people’s persistent efforts at resistance. Encouraging readers to understand suicide, infanticide, and celebration as expressions of resistance, Araujo argues that “bondspeople were protagonists of their own emancipation.” Araujo’s  writing can sometimes be dry, but this does not diminish the importance of her work. The facts alone are staggering; among them: “More than 4.8 million enslaved [people] landed on Brazilian shores…nearly ten times more than [in] the United States.” Seeing Nat Turner’s Rebellion of 1831 alongside Tacky’s Revolt in Jamaica in 1760 and the Malê Revolt in Brazil in 1835 helps readers understand the scope of enslaved people’s armed resistance. Also astonishing is the range of sources from which Araujo and her colleagues glean information: In addition to slave narratives and oral tradition, she cites Inquisition records, enslaved people’s wills, and a particularly revealing 1684 Portuguese law regulating conditions on slave ships, among a wealth of other documents.",

  "text": "KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON THE OSAGE MURDERS AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI by David Grann ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 18, 2017 Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 56 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2017 New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller National Book Award Finalist Greed, depravity, and serial murder in 1920s Oklahoma. During that time, enrolled members of the Osage Indian nation were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world. The rich oil fields beneath their reservation brought millions of dollars into the tribe annually, distributed to tribal members holding \"headrights\" that could not be bought or sold but only inherited. This vast wealth attracted the attention of unscrupulous whites who found ways to divert it to themselves by marrying Osage women or by having Osage declared legally incompetent so the whites could fleece them through the administration of their estates. For some, however, these deceptive tactics were not enough, and a plague of violent death—by shooting, poison, orchestrated automobile accident, and bombing—began to decimate the Osage in what they came to call the \"Reign of Terror.\" Corrupt and incompetent law enforcement and judicial systems ensured that the perpetrators were never found or punished until the young J. Edgar Hoover saw cracking these cases as a means of burnishing the reputation of the newly professionalized FBI. Bestselling New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn't stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann's crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs. Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.
