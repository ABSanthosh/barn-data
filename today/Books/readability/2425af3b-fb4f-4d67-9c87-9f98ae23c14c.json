  "description": "Hijabs are as different as the women who wear them, and the young people in this story praise their mothers for what makes them remarkable. As one mama prepares a nourishing meal, her child notes that her headscarf is a symbol of her devotion and care for her family. Another mother’s hijab represents her deep faith in Islam. The women differ in skin tone, cultural setting, and clothing style and wear various types of hijab: a turban that fits closely like a cap, a niqab that reveals only the eyes, a loosely wrapped shayla, and a full-body burqa. The story features figurative language and rhymes that generally flow well. While some metaphors are more literal and easy to follow (“a sleek and glassy onyx, / a gorgeous gleaming gem” to describe an all-black hijab look), others are more abstract and difficult to connect to the Muslim women being celebrated (“a juicy tasty mango, / growing ripe and plump” appears to be an awkward nod to a mother’s pregnancy). Abu’s simple illustrations feature bold colors and striking patterns in the background. A downloadable educator’s guide is available to support young learners.",

  "text": "MAMA BUILT A LITTLE NEST by Jennifer Ward ; illustrated by Steve Jenkins ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 18, 2014 A good bet for the youngest bird-watchers. Echoing the meter of “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” Ward uses catchy original rhymes to describe the variety of nests birds create. Each sweet stanza is complemented by a factual, engaging description of the nesting habits of each bird. Some of the notes are intriguing, such as the fact that the hummingbird uses flexible spider web to construct its cup-shaped nest so the nest will stretch as the chicks grow. An especially endearing nesting behavior is that of the emperor penguin, who, with unbelievable patience, incubates the egg between his tummy and his feet for up to 60 days. The author clearly feels a mission to impart her extensive knowledge of birds and bird behavior to the very young, and she’s found an appealing and attractive way to accomplish this. The simple rhymes on the left page of each spread, written from the young bird’s perspective, will appeal to younger children, and the notes on the right-hand page of each spread provide more complex factual information that will help parents answer further questions and satisfy the curiosity of older children. Jenkins’ accomplished collage illustrations of common bird species—woodpecker, hummingbird, cowbird, emperor penguin, eagle, owl, wren—as well as exotics, such as flamingoes and hornbills, are characteristically naturalistic and accurate in detail. A good bet for the youngest bird-watchers.   (author’s note, further resources) (Informational picture book. 4-7) Pub Date: March 18, 2014 ISBN: 978-1-4424-2116-5 Page Count: 40 Publisher: Beach Lane/Simon \u0026 Schuster Review Posted Online: Jan. 3, 2014 Kirkus Reviews Issue: Jan. 15, 2014",
