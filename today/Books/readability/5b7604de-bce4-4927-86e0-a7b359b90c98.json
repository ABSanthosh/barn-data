  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Perfect Match (Vice Club Nights Book 2)? Last year my family and I had a fantastic holiday in Italy and some of the places we visited are featured in the story. For me, Florence is more romantic than Paris, and I was so inspired that I wrote some of the scenes while there. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Perfect Match (Vice Club Nights Book 2), what would they be? “Femme Fatale” by Duran Duran as Tori is strong and sassy. For Gio, “Shot at the Night” by The Killers. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I don’t really have a favorite genre as I like to read all sorts of books, but mostly romance, small town, billionaires, MC, dark, suspense and military. I write about billionaires and former military main characters but I’m always looking to add a little twist or suspense. Perfect Match has a few surprises. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Steel by Eva Simmons, The Lost Bookshop by Evie Woods and Inda by Charissa Gracyk. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Definitely the ones set in Italy as it was a wonderful way to relive my holiday. I want to go back now! Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Not really, but if I get stuck on a story line the treadmill at the gym helps. Some of my best ideas have come to me on the treadmill. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Do what you love. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Life is full of surprises and so is my book. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
