  "description": "Vaharja, the Recordkeeper, is one of the “phantasmal” Elegies (immortal, instinct-driven entities). Though she’s no longer human, she’s recently shared an experience with a mortal named Gyer. He’s a government operative in the colony of Golem who’s wanted for treason; as he fishes in a “quaint lake,” Vaharja tells him of the Elegies’ origin. The story involves an Elegy who consumed a woman’s body and was reborn as a human one thousand years later, which wasn’t so long ago in this narrative’s timeline. Vaharja’s tale ultimately centers around Liarua Fora, who’s part of a small group of people volunteering to join the Forerunners of Golem, a branch of Golem’s government. What starts as a tour of a building turns into a harrowing ordeal as Liarua and others fight off terrifying creatures and contend with a mysterious energy that infects and mutates humans. This leads to a climax involving Liarua’s fellow volunteers and FOG associates, as well as Gyer and, of course, Vaharja. The cast and corresponding subplots of Nullius’ sophomore series entry are abundant—some characters will pop into the story with few or no traits described. Narrative perspectives frequently shift, from that of an android (with an “almost human-level autonomy”) to one of the infected, to a member of a cyberterrorist organization trying to recruit someone. It’s the enthralling mystery that truly drives the story—what part in all of this does the “shadowy” group Scion Finis play, and will the reincarnated Elegy remember who she is/was? There’s copious technology in scientifically advanced Golem, though most of it is familiar (a portis is simply a mobile device). But most of Golem feels otherworldly, given the immortals, vicious beasts, and the curious fact that Gyer regularly converses with Vaharja, who easily reads and records his thoughts.",

  "text": "IRON FLAME From the Empyrean series , Vol. 2 by Rebecca Yarros ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 7, 2023 Unrelenting, and not in a good way. A young Navarrian woman faces even greater challenges in her second year at dragon-riding school. Violet Sorrengail did all the normal things one would do as a first-year student at Basgiath War College: made new friends, fell in love, and survived multiple assassination attempts. She was also the first rider to ever bond with two dragons: Tairn, a powerful black dragon with a distinguished battle history, and Andarna, a baby dragon too young to carry a rider. At the end of Fourth Wing (2023), Violet and her lover, Xaden Riorson, discovered that Navarre is under attack from wyvern, evil two-legged dragons, and venin, soulless monsters that harvest energy from the ground. Navarrians had always been told that these were monsters of legend and myth, not real creatures dangerously close to breaking through Navarre’s wards and attacking civilian populations. In this overly long sequel, Violet, Xaden, and their dragons are determined to find a way to protect Navarre, despite the fact that the army and government hid the truth about these creatures. Due to the machinations of several traitorous instructors at Basgiath, Xaden and Violet are separated for most of the book—he’s stationed at a distant outpost, leaving her to handle the treacherous, cutthroat world of the war college on her own. Violet is repeatedly threatened by her new vice commandant, a brutal man who wants to silence her. Although Violet and her dragons continue to model extreme bravery, the novel feels repetitive and more than a little sloppy, leaving obvious questions about the world unanswered. The book is full of action and just as full of plot holes, including scenes that are illogical or disconnected from the main narrative. Secondary characters are ignored until a scene requires them to assist Violet or to be killed in the endless violence that plagues their school. Unrelenting, and not in a good way.
