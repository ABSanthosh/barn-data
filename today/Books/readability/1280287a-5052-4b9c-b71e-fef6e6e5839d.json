  "description": "Although Charlie Wags may seem like an ordinary little dog, he has an extraordinary secret: By wagging his tail, he can take flight and explore different places all over the globe. In his latest adventure, he’s off to explore the capital of the United Kingdom. Beginning at Buckingham Palace and ending atop the London Eye, the mystical pup takes the readers on a tour through the city’s major tourist attractions, learning about the history and the local customs as he goes. At the end, Wells and Barclay invite readers to “paws and learn” with additional fun facts about every monument that Charlie visited. They deliver a cozy, clever, and informative little story, complete with a map of London and questions to get the young readers involved with the tale. Sjöström’s full-color artwork brings Charlie’s travels to life with her stunning watercolor renditions of the city. The vibrant artwork offers young readers a way to experience a new land without leaving the couch, but the adorable little dog’s journey is sure to spark interest in travel abroad.",

  "text": "ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN by Tish Rabe ; illustrated by Laura Hughes ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 21, 2016 While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of... Rabe follows a young girl through her first 12 days of kindergarten in this book based on the familiar Christmas carol. The typical firsts of school are here: riding the bus, making friends, sliding on the playground slide, counting, sorting shapes, laughing at lunch, painting, singing, reading, running, jumping rope, and going on a field trip. While the days are given ordinal numbers, the song skips the cardinal numbers in the verses, and the rhythm is sometimes off: “On the second day of kindergarten / I thought it was so cool / making lots of friends / and riding the bus to my school!” The narrator is a white brunette who wears either a tunic or a dress each day, making her pretty easy to differentiate from her classmates, a nice mix in terms of race; two students even sport glasses. The children in the ink, paint, and collage digital spreads show a variety of emotions, but most are happy to be at school, and the surroundings will be familiar to those who have made an orientation visit to their own schools. While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of Kindergarten (2003), it basically gets the job done.
