I have seen over the years many explanations for this or that hot phenomenon reduced to “escapism,” a term so vague that it can be applied to anything and clarifies nothing.

The New Yorker’s Best Books of 2024 By now, the best of lists are starting to blur together, and some consensus is starting to form even outside James. So my eyes are now searching for the surprises: things I haven’t seen elsewhere and in some cases didn’t know (or remember) they existed. And most lists of any real breadth have a few that get me to look them up. Among The New Yorker’s Essential Reads picks, here are two that stopped my scrolling: The Calculation of Volume and The Silence of the Choir. Unsurprisingly, they are from smaller presses and in translation, both of which are welcome additions to my future reading considerations. Is BookTok Past Its Peak? On Book Riot, Arvynn Cerezon talks with some publishing folks about the state and trajectory of BookTok. The part that stood out to me: Harris also predicted that as the rules governing BookTok change, the importance retailers place on TikTok will shift. She sees a slow phase-out of the “As Seen on BookTok” tables, which have been popular in bookstores for the past four years. In a similar vein, publishers will most likely abandon the “TikTok sensation” perma-stickers that have recently become a staple element on paperback covers. “Much like BookTube and Bookstagram, BookTok will still be an important piece for authors and publishers to target when promoting their books; this will likely ring truer for fiction authors than nonfiction, as has been the case on the platform thus far,” she said.
