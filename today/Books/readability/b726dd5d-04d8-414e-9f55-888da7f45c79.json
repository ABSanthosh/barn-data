  "description": "In 1920, Leonarda Bucci gives birth to her first son, Emilio, in Agrigento, Italy. Her husband Salvatore, tormented by his nightmarish World War I experiences fighting in the Piave, struggles to overcome the baby’s resemblance to his abusive uncle Aldo. The Bucci family is sustained by Salvatore’s employment on the estate of wealthy olive oil merchant Giovanni Savoia and his wife Maria. The two families become closely connected by the friendships between Leonarda and Maria Savoia and their respective children, Emilio and Floria, who are born at the same time. Italy’s economic and political turmoil motivates Maria, Floria, and the Bucci family (which now includes a second son, Raffaele) to emigrate to Canada by 1933. Adjusting to Canada proves difficult—the immigrants face anti-Italian prejudice in school and in everyday life, exacerbated by World War II. After Raffaele loses his temper in a local diner, Salvatore, Emilio, and Raffaele are arrested under the War Measures Act and sent to a hellish camp called Petawawa. Salvatore tells Emilio, “When I was a soldier, I let them kill parts of me I wish I hadn’t…But you and only you have the power to let them die. They may lead you to believe that they have that power, but that is wrong. Only you do.” These words sustain Emilio through his time in Petawawa and a number of tragic losses. Scibetta’s compelling work of historical fiction explores themes of family dynamics, prejudice, and love with a narrative that vividly illustrates the hatred and discrimination that Italian immigrants to Canada faced during the 1930s and throughout World War II. In the current climate of demonization of immigrants, this work provides a unique and welcome historical perspective on displacement.",

  "text": "IT STARTS WITH US by Colleen Hoover ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 18, 2022 Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 242 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The sequel to It Ends With Us (2016) shows the aftermath of domestic violence through the eyes of a single mother. Lily Bloom is still running a flower shop; her abusive ex-husband, Ryle Kincaid, is still a surgeon. But now they’re co-parenting a daughter, Emerson, who's almost a year old. Lily won’t send Emerson to her father’s house overnight until she’s old enough to talk—“So she can tell me if something happens”—but she doesn’t want to fight for full custody lest it become an expensive legal drama or, worse, a physical fight. When Lily runs into Atlas Corrigan, a childhood friend who also came from an abusive family, she hopes their friendship can blossom into love. (For new readers, their history unfolds in heartfelt diary entries that Lily addresses to Finding Nemo star Ellen DeGeneres as she considers how Atlas was a calming presence during her turbulent childhood.) Atlas, who is single and running a restaurant, feels the same way. But even though she’s divorced, Lily isn’t exactly free. Behind Ryle’s veneer of civility are his jealousy and resentment. Lily has to plan her dates carefully to avoid a confrontation. Meanwhile, Atlas’ mother returns with shocking news. In between, Lily and Atlas steal away for romantic moments that are even sweeter for their authenticity as Lily struggles with child care, breastfeeding, and running a business while trying to find time for herself. Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over.
