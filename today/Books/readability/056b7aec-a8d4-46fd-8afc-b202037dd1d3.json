  "description": "After bullets shatter her living room windows, killing her police officer father, high school junior Kate’s life changes forever. As he lies dying, Dad gives her a piece of paper, issuing a cryptic warning: “Don’t read it…Don’t show anyone. Burn it.” Kate does get rid of the paper—but only after reading it. When she and her mom are allowed back in the house to collect some possessions, she stumbles upon $250,000, stashed in her guitar case. Fearing that her father was a thief, she hides the cash in a safe place. When Kate’s mom is offered a spring semester teaching position at a private school for competitive athletes in Vermont, the change feels like a respite from the trauma. Kate quickly settles into her new environment and even falls for a handsome skier named Ryan. But when people involved in her dad’s murder investigation wind up dead, Kate realizes that she’s in grave danger and must act. The novel’s pacing is a bit bumpy, ranging from slow to frenetic, but the payoff at the end is worth it. The characters are sympathetic and likable, and the development of the protagonists, who are coded white, is solid. Kate and Ryan’s whirlwind relationship is a testament to the power of first love.",

  "text": "STALKING JACK THE RIPPER by Kerri Maniscalco ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 20, 2016 Perhaps a more genuinely enlightened protagonist would have made this debut more engaging Audrey Rose Wadsworth, 17, would rather perform autopsies in her uncle’s dark laboratory than find a suitable husband, as is the socially acceptable rite of passage for a young, white British lady in the late 1800s. The story immediately brings Audrey into a fractious pairing with her uncle’s young assistant, Thomas Cresswell. The two engage in predictable rounds of “I’m smarter than you are” banter, while Audrey’s older brother, Nathaniel, taunts her for being a girl out of her place. Horrific murders of prostitutes whose identities point to associations with the Wadsworth estate prompt Audrey to start her own investigation, with Thomas as her sidekick. Audrey’s narration is both ponderous and polemical, as she sees her pursuit of her goals and this investigation as part of a crusade for women. She declares that the slain aren’t merely prostitutes but “daughters and wives and mothers,” but she’s also made it a point to deny any alignment with the profiled victims: “I am not going as a prostitute. I am simply blending in.” Audrey also expresses a narrow view of her desired gender role, asserting that “I was determined to be both pretty and fierce,” as if to say that physical beauty and liking “girly” things are integral to feminism. The graphic descriptions of mutilated women don’t do much to speed the pace. Perhaps a more genuinely enlightened protagonist would have made this debut more engaging .
