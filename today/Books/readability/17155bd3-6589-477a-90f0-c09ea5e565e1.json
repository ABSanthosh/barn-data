View All posts by Community Bookshop.org, a platform that has raised more than $38 million for independent bookstores since 2020, does a roundup of the bestselling books on its site each week that looks at the previous week’s bestsellers. While we have already made a habit of looking at bestselling books each week according to big mainstream sources, Bookshop.org’s list is a great way to switch things up. In addition to supporting local indie bookstores, the list gives us more variety. There’s a mix of brand-new books, books that have been out for a few years, and even more activist-minded books. Below is a sampling of the list, starting with a couple of the aforementioned throwback titles: The Inheritance Trilogy by N. K. Jemisin Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants by Robin Wall Kimmerer No Cop City, No Cop World by Lessons from the Movement by Kamau Franklin, Micah Herskind, and Mariah Parkerhttps://bookshop.org/a/81128/9781639736379 Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop (The heart-warming Korean sensation) by Hwang Bo-Reum, translated by Shanna Tan Problematic Summer Romance by Ali Hazelwood One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This by Omar El Akkad On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century by Timothy Snyder Sunrise on the Reaping (a Hunger Games Novel) by Suzanne Collins For the rest of the list, visit Bookshop.org.
