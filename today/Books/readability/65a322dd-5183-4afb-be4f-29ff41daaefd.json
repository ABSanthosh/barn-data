  "description": "Award-winning golf writer Barrett recounts in crisp, polished prose the stories of 20 U.S. Opens played at America’s toughest courses under the most difficult conditions. He begins in 1913 with amateur Francis Ouimet’s takedown playoff with England’s two finest professionals at The Country Club outside Boston. Barrett describes their play up close, with details that all golfers will enjoy. It was all amateur Bobby Jones in 1923 taking down the likes of Gene Sarazen and Walter Hagen to win his first U.S. Open in a playoff against Scotland’s Bobby Cruickshank before a crowd of 10,000. Throughout, Barrett provides excellent profiles of many players, like Cruickshank, whom readers might not be familiar with. In 1930, amateur Jones won his fourth U.S. Open, then retired at age 28. Two years later, Cruickshank would again contend but lose to Sarazen, who won his second Open by three strokes. Barrett neatly covers Ben Hogan’s miraculous comeback at Merion and the long-shot win by Jack Fleck at the fearsome Oakland Hills before reaching The King: Against a crowded, talented field, Arnold Palmer won his only Open in 1960 at Cherry Hills. At Oakmont the following year, he was beaten in a playoff by a young Jack Nicklaus. In 1973, Johnny Miller captured his Open by shooting a historic final-round 63. Tom Watson finally outlasted Nicklaus at Pebble Beach in 1982. Barrett closes his comprehensive book not with Brooks Koepka’s or Bryson DeChambeau’s multiple wins but with Jon Rahm, whose birdies at Torrey Pines’ last two holes brought victory.",

  "text": "UNGUARDED by Scottie Pippen with Michael Arkush ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 9, 2021 Basketball fans will enjoy Pippen’s bird’s-eye view of some of the sport’s greatest contests. The Chicago Bulls stalwart tells all—and then some. Hall of Famer Pippen opens with a long complaint: Yes, he’s a legend, but he got short shrift in the ESPN documentary about Michael Jordan and the Bulls, The Last Dance. Given that Jordan emerges as someone not quite friend enough to qualify as a frenemy, even though teammates for many years, the maltreatment is understandable. This book, Pippen allows, is his retort to a man who “was determined to prove to the current generation of fans that he was larger-than-life during his day—and still larger than LeBron James, the player many consider his equal, if not superior.” Coming from a hardscrabble little town in Arkansas and playing for a small college, Pippen enjoyed an unlikely rise to NBA stardom. He played alongside and against some of the greats, of whom he writes appreciatively (even Jordan). Readers will gain insight into the lives of characters such as Dennis Rodman, who “possessed an unbelievable basketball IQ,” and into the behind-the-scenes work that led to the Bulls dynasty, which ended only because, Pippen charges, the team’s management was so inept. Looking back on his early years, Pippen advocates paying college athletes. “Don’t give me any of that holier-than-thou student-athlete nonsense,” he writes. “These young men—and women—are athletes first, not students, and make up the labor that generates fortunes for their schools. They are, for lack of a better term, slaves.” The author also writes evenhandedly of the world outside basketball: “No matter how many championships I have won, and millions I have earned, I never forget the color of my skin and that some people in this world hate me just because of that.” Overall, the memoir is closely observed and uncommonly modest, given Pippen’s many successes, and it moves as swiftly as a playoff game. Basketball fans will enjoy Pippen’s bird’s-eye view of some of the sport’s greatest contests.
