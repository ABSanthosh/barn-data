  "description": "The author opens his nonfiction debut with a concise account of his own traumatic past: The Christian community to which he and his parents belonged gradually devolved into a cult from which all three of them had to struggle to extract themselves. “How could an organization seemingly driven by a noble mission become so toxic?” he asks when reflecting on these events (and broadening them to form the basis of this book). “How did I, someone who perceived myself as an ethical and values-driven leader, become complicit in psychological abuse?” Sturesson proposes and explicates a series of habits and practices to allow leaders to take ownership, take action, and become a part of positive change, always with the reminder that “it’s not about framing yourself as the hero.” The habits are generally broad and simple, detailed under headings like “Get Humble” or “Get Integrity.” The author’s elaborations (“values cannot give us all the answers. However, they should help us wrestle with vital questions about priorities, decisions, and behaviors”), drawn from his own experiences as well as the writings of well-known motivational books like Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989) or Victor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning (1946), are laid out with illustrations and bullet points. These elements, conveyed by Sturesson’s light, highly readable prose style, make the book a refreshing reminder of the basics of both responsible corporate culture and ethical interpersonal dealings. When the author writes things like “By focusing first on what you have the ability to control or influence, you will be much better positioned to help bring positive change,” Sturesson is teaching his readers about compassionate self-control in ways that effectively blend the fields of business motivation and self-help.",

  "text": "THE CULTURE MAP BREAKING THROUGH THE INVISIBLE BOUNDARIES OF GLOBAL BUSINESS by Erin Meyer ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 27, 2014 These are not hard and fast rules, but Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business. A helpful guide to working effectively with people from other cultures. “The sad truth is that the vast majority of managers who conduct business internationally have little understanding about how culture is impacting their work,” writes Meyer, a professor at INSEAD, an international business school. Yet they face a wider array of work styles than ever before in dealing with clients, suppliers and colleagues from around the world. When is it best to speak or stay quiet? What is the role of the leader in the room? When working with foreign business people, failing to take cultural differences into account can lead to frustration, misunderstanding or worse. Based on research and her experiences teaching cross-cultural behaviors to executive students, the author examines a handful of key areas. Among others, they include communicating (Anglo-Saxons are explicit; Asians communicate implicitly, requiring listeners to read between the lines), developing a sense of trust (Brazilians do it over long lunches), and decision-making (Germans rely on consensus, Americans on one decider). In each area, the author provides a “culture map scale” that positions behaviors in more than 20 countries along a continuum, allowing readers to anticipate the preferences of individuals from a particular country: Do they like direct or indirect negative feedback? Are they rigid or flexible regarding deadlines? Do they favor verbal or written commitments? And so on. Meyer discusses managers who have faced perplexing situations, such as knowledgeable team members who fail to speak up in meetings or Indians who offer a puzzling half-shake, half-nod of the head. Cultural differences—not personality quirks—are the motivating factors behind many behavioral styles. Depending on our cultures, we understand the world in a particular way, find certain arguments persuasive or lacking merit, and consider some ways of making decisions or measuring time natural and others quite strange. These are not hard and fast rules, but Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business.
