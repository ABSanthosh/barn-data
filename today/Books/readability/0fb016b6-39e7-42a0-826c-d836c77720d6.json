  "description": "Thad Hanlon, surfer and certified public accountant, has just opened a private investigation business in the Five Cities area of the California Central Coast. He and his new partner, attorney and martial artist Bri de la Guerra, are both reeling from the deaths of their significant others three years ago—and both are eager to get their agency off the ground by landing an inaugural client. A case arrives just in the nick of time, right outside the Land Cruiser out of which Thad and his 3-year-old son are currently living: Krystle Dudamel, a former exotic dancer from Bakersfield, is looking for her missing 14-year-old son Mobius, a surfing prodigy known around the Pismo Pier as Moby Dude. “The kid was respectable for a 14-year-old but very aggro,” narrates Hanlon. “Always snaking some local’s swell and cutting them off. Being hyper-aggressive in the water is not the best way to win friends and influence people.” Could Mobius’ disappearance be linked to the murder of a local gang member, whose body was recently disinterred from the Oceano Beach sand? Hanlon and Bri will have to find out…that is, if they ever want to secure a second client. Jones’ prose effectively conveys Hanlon’s laid-back attitude, and the plot features a number of entertaining, surfer-specific elements, as when Hanlon finds a message encoded in a pile of boards: “They were stacked helter-skelter, the top side of the boards facing up. No serious surfer would do that. Leave boards in direct sunlight for the wax to melt. Strange. Had to be a cipher. Had to be some kind of message.” Neither Hanlon nor Bri appearto be particularly haunted by their losses, but it may simply be that the book’s lighthearted tone has little space for mourning. Instead, Jones delivers a proper beach read, both in form and content.",

  "text": "NONE OF THIS IS TRUE by Lisa Jewell ‧ RELEASE DATE: Aug. 8, 2023 It's hard to read but hard to look away from. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 22 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller When two women who share a birthday meet, a journalist becomes the subject of her own true-crime mystery. On their 45th birthdays, Josie Fair and Alix Summer meet at a pub and discover they were born not only on the same day, but in the same hospital. Alix is a successful journalist, and Josie convinces Alix that her story is worth telling: Josie met her husband when she was 13 and he was 40. “I can see that maybe I was being used, that maybe I was even being groomed?” she confesses to Alix. “But that feeling of being powerful, right at the start, when I was still in control. I miss that sometimes. I really do. And what I’d like, more than anything, is to get it back.” From this premise Alix creates a Netflix series, Hi! I’m Your Birthday Twin! which investigates Josie’s life as she reconciles what happened to her as a teen and seeks a new path. With the story unfinished, the narrative unfolds in the present tense, with prose that jingles like song lyrics: “He turns to see if the girl is behind him, and sees her wishy-washy, wavy-wavy, in double vision through the glass windows of the hotel.” Alix is both intrigued and repulsed by Josie, but she initially gives her the benefit of the doubt. After all, Alix’s husband, Nathan, has a drinking problem, and Alix knows what it’s like to be reluctant to leave a bad situation. But Josie seems more interested in being part of Alix’s seemingly glamorous life than she is in fixing her own, and when three people end up dead and Alix’s life is turned upside down, the evidence points to Josie—and turns the TV series into a murder mystery. Transcripts from Alix’s interviews alternate with the narrative, offering increasingly varied perspectives on Josie’s story as told by her neighbors, friends, and family members. With so many versions of events, the ending shatters, leaving readers to decide whose is the truth. It's hard to read but hard to look away from.
