The Help Author’s Second Novel is Nigh When The Help and its adaptation were released to much fanfare, I largely ignored it. It was incredibly popular but it wasn’t for me. I’m certain plenty of readers who applauded the book back then cringe when they see the title today–Kathryn Stockett’s debut novel became an example of white people portraying Black people poorly, even harmfully. Well, some 15 years later, Stockett is back with a new book. If anyone has ever bemoaned Stockett’s plight or worried that cancel culture “got her,” I’m here to report, courtesy of The New York Times, that the co-founder of a major publisher worked with her on her 800-page manuscript for years without a contract. To me, Stockett is a prime example of how publishing has historically uplifted white authors writing marginalized characters while hesitating to invest in own voices books. This NYT piece is mostly about Stockett finding the task of writing her follow-up daunting, but with the mega-bucks I predict will be thrown at marketing the book and knowing what I know about our current climate, I’m sure it’ll do just fine. Moms For Liberty Is Shutting Down BookLooks Curiouser and curiouser. BookLooks, a site that gained some legitimacy despite its dubious review and vetting process and its affiliation with Moms For Liberty, is apparently shutting down. There isn’t much info to be gleaned from their statement, which includes vague pronouncements like this one: “It has been quite the ride with many ups and downs since God called us to this work in 2022, but after much prayer and reflection it has become apparent that His work for us here is complete and that He has other callings for us.” But Kelly Jensen is here to ask the questions and offer some context.

Celebrated Canadian Author Says Peace Out For Now, U.S. Louise Penny, author of the award-winning Armand Gamache series of murder mysteries, is bowing out of U.S. appearances in light of the current trade war happening between the U.S. and her home country, Canada. Penny, who’s been touring the U.S. for the past two decades, said this in a statement posted to her site and her Facebook: I can hardly believe I’m saying this, but given the ongoing threat of an unprovoked trade war against Canada by the US president, I do not feel I can enter the United States. At least not until that economic sword, that could throw hundreds of thousands of Canadians (as well as Americans) into poverty, is removed completely. There are, of course, other things the American president is doing that make visiting the USA unpalatable. The U.S. is playing a terrible game of tariffs with countries including Canada, which is putting up a good fight. Canada has removed U.S.-made alcohol from shelves and threatened a tariff on electricity sent to their neighbor in response to steep tariff threats from the White House (not to mention Trump’s wild insistence that Canada become our 51st state). So, who could blame Penny? There are folks in the U.S. who wish they could boycott the U.S. 24 New York Times-Recommended Fiction Books for Spring Spring is right around the corner! Time to make some decisions about which books you’re going to take outside while you breathe in that fresh, verdant air. If you need an assist with your seasonal TBR, The Times has a list of 24 novels to look forward to. Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games prequel, Sunrise on the Reaping, is bound to be a bestseller, I’m looking forward to reading Tilt by Emma Pattee (full disclosure, I know her, but as you can see I’m not the only one excited about this book), The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham Jones is also on this horror fan’s list, as are Ocean Vuong’s much-anticipated The Emperor of Gladness, and Flirting Lessons by Jasmine Guillory. This list is a great reminder that we’re set up for a sensational season of reading. We Need Diverse Books Inaugural Reading Day! Well this is the fun and uplifting news I needed at the end of an exhausting week. The esteemed and hardworking team over at We Need Diverse Books is organizing a day to celebrate diverse books and reading. Readers are encouraged to pick up books by people from marginalized communities on April 3rd. As many voices from the WNDB team, including Dhonielle Clayton (Blackout) and Roxane Gay (Bad Feminist), message, it’s important to make sure diverse books are on those shelves because everyone stands to benefit from reading books that represent the underrepresented. WNDB will be posting resources on how to find diverse books and will provide a diverse book to an underresourced school for every $10 donated. Schools and readers could use all the help they can get these days. Check out this article for more information on why diverse books are important and how you can participate. The comments section is moderated according to our community guidelines. Please check them out so we can maintain a safe and supportive community of readers!",
