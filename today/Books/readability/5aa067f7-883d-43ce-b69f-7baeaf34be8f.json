  "description": "Every town should have a place like the Geode Cafe and Bookshop, where the citizens of Umbra River, California, can gather to chat, read, and sip espresso drinks. Geode—its name a nod to the town’s Goldrush past—is owned by retired schoolteacher and empty-nester Olivia, a cheerful woman plagued by occasional migraines. She loves that her two best friends are close by; Anna is an animal psychic and the owner of Besties, the pet supply store and animal shelter next door to the cafe, and Emmaline is an aspiring writer who uses the store’s storage closet as an office. Since her husband was killed by a drunk driver, the young Emmaline has been on her own with her 4-year-old son, Charlie—who, like Anna, displays some psychic gifts. The three friends meet for weekly dinner and gossip, where they get into the secrets—good and bad—of their private lives, as well as those of Umbra River’s history. When Charlie starts having visions of a ghostly boy on a horse, it leads the women into an investigation of the town’s darkest chapter. Corazza’s prose casts a comforting spell on the reader, in part because so much of it is dedicated to praising the atmosphere of Olivia’s shop: “Geode’s old plank floors gave Emmaline the feeling of being pulled into Geode’s warm, calmly lit space, and if the appearance didn’t do it, the aroma of dough baking and fresh coffee did.” The plot, such as it is, moves at a snail’s pace as the town and its characters are introduced from various perspectives, with much information repeated and many cute businesses described in great detail. Despite some exceptions—cafe manager Lucy is a stock Irishwoman out of a bad 1950s comedy—the characters are well rendered, and the reader is mostly content to listen in on their conversations as they navigate the sometimes strange but more often mundane twists in their personal lives.",

  "text": "THE MAN WHO LIVED UNDERGROUND by Richard Wright ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 20, 2021 A welcome literary resurrection that deserves a place alongside Wright’s best-known work. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 17 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller A falsely accused Black man goes into hiding in this masterful novella by Wright (1908-1960), finally published in full. Written in 1941 and '42, between Wright’s classics Native Son and Black Boy, this short novel concerns Fred Daniels, a modest laborer who’s arrested by police officers and bullied into signing a false confession that he killed the residents of a house near where he was working. In a brief unsupervised moment, he escapes through a manhole and goes into hiding in a sewer. A series of allegorical, surrealistic set pieces ensues as Fred explores the nether reaches of a church, a real estate firm, and a jewelry store. Each stop is an opportunity for Wright to explore themes of hope, greed, and exploitation; the real estate firm, Wright notes, “collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent from poor colored folks.” But Fred’s deepening existential crisis and growing distance from society keep the scenes from feeling like potted commentaries. As he wallpapers his underground warren with cash, mocking and invalidating the currency, he registers a surrealistic but engrossing protest against divisive social norms. The novel, rejected by Wright’s publisher, has only appeared as a substantially truncated short story until now, without the opening setup and with a different ending. Wright's take on racial injustice seems to have unsettled his publisher: A note reveals that an editor found reading about Fred’s treatment by the police “unbearable.” That may explain why Wright, in an essay included here, says its focus on race is “rather muted,” emphasizing broader existential themes. Regardless, as an afterword by Wright’s grandson Malcolm attests, the story now serves as an allegory both of Wright (he moved to France, an “exile beyond the reach of Jim Crow and American bigotry”) and American life. Today, it resonates deeply as a story about race and the struggle to envision a different, better world. A welcome literary resurrection that deserves a place alongside Wright’s best-known work.
