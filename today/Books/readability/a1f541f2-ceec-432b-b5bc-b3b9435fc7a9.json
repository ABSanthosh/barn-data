  "text": "25 Feb 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Love in a Little Free Library (Love and Books Book 1)? I am obsessed with little free libraries and also have a family member with bipolar. I thought it would be wonderful to combine these two elements to showcase the complexities of loving someone with mental illness. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? YA! No matter my age, I will always be a die-hard YA reader! What books are on your TBR pile right now? Anything by Nicola Yoon, Jennifer Niven, Jenny Han, and Rainbow Rowell What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I loved writing the meaningful talks Elle and Ozzy shared because I think every girl wants a guy who is willing to open up and discuss the deeper issues of life, death, and love. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I either use Harry Potter or Twilight ambiance on YouTube while I write. When that’s on, I know it’s time to get serious and start typing away! Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Get busy living or get busy dying! If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That love isn’t always exactly like the fairytales and movies, but if you open yourself up to it…it can be so much better!
