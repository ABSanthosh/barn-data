  "text": "09 Jul 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Defending Love? Our heroine, Dani Sinclair, first made an appearance in the Sinclair Duet, a story about her brother. I loved her devotion to family, intelligence, and spark. I knew Dani had a story that needed to be told. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Defending Love, what would they be? I will always love you – Whitney Houston. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I mostly read thrillers. I love it when an author can surprise me. That is why I have a lot of story and suspense in the romances that I write. What books are on your TBR pile right now? The Robin on the Oak Throne, by K.A. Linde, is sitting on my bedside stand. I can’t wait to start it! What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The scene is when readers learn about Eli’s past, his heartbreaking reason for his rules, and his vow to move on with Dani. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Quite… so I can listen to the voices in my head. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Each day is a choice. I choose to be happy. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I’d like them to remember their feelings while reading and hopefully want to experience more.
