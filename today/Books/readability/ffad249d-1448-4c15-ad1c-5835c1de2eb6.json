We have a fair amount of titles on all five bestseller lists this week, including two newcomers from Bob Woodward and Michael Connelly. Freida McFadden is still in the top ten across all five of the biggest bestseller lists, but Rebecca Yarros has dropped down to three. In the other direction, a few authors saw their titles jump back up to making all five lists, including Ta-Nehisi Coates and Nicholas Sparks.Melania Trump and her unbelievably boring book cover are still on three of the bestseller lists, and I really don’t care. Do u? I legitimately thought I was looking at a censored version of the cover that someone over at USA Today put up in protest, then I realized it was real. Meanwhile J. D. Vance has fallen out of the top ten on most lists because sometimes we can have nice things; now we just have to hope he stays gone. Friendly reminder that there are so many other books to read besides Hillbilly Elegy; to learn why and also know what to read instead, check out Lies, Damn Lies, and Hillbilly Elegy as well as 15 Books About Appalachia to Read Instead of Hillbilly Elegy.To get these numbers, we look at the USA Today overall top 10; Publishers Weekly overall top 10; The New York Times top 10, both Combined Print \u0026 E-Book Fiction and Combined Print \u0026 E-Book Nonfiction lists; Amazon Charts top 10, both Fiction and Nonfiction; and Indie Bestsellers top 10, Fiction and Nonfiction, both Paperback and Hardcover.
