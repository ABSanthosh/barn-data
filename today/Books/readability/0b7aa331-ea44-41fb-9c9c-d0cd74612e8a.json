  "description": "Sabrina Finkelstein is juggling library school, part-time work at a branch of the New York Public Library, and a geriatric roommate she adores. Marcia Haber is a spry, independent 72. The two met on an intergenerational app meant to match seniors who could use a hand around the house with young people who could use a break on rent. When her grandson, Adam, is laid off from his job in Philadelphia, he comes to stay with Marcia and Sabrina. He’s hot, passionate about books, and excited to connect with his grandmother. Adam’s father had broken off contact with Marcia years ago when she came out as bisexual, and Sabrina doesn’t mind having Adam crash on the sofa, because it gives Marcia a chance to reconnect with her grandson. Soon, the chemistry between Sabrina and Adam is palpable, aided by their two-person YA book club, and the close quarters make for a steamy buildup. Then, returning from a disastrous first date, Marcia nearly catches Sabrina and Adam in a steamy make-out session. Sensing how this might complicate their housing situation, they decide to keep things platonic. But after Marcia has a minor health scare, her doctor suggests that living with two young people is causing her undue stress, and she asks Adam to move out. Adam—unbeknownst to his grandmother—tells Sabrina he thinks she should be the one to leave, and their hot secret romance turns into a competition to prove who’s the best fit for their septuagenarian roommate. This forced-proximity romance is a cozy homage to intergenerational friendships, New York City, romance novel fandom, and grand gestures. As romantic leads, Adam and Sabrina are compelling, and the occupational and financial uncertainty faced by single 20-somethings is very real, but readers might just find that the secondary story of Marcia’s foray into senior dating on the apps is what they stick around for.",

  "text": "SHIELD OF SPARROWS by Devney Perry ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 6, 2025 A thrilling, immersive tale that shows that some bargains demand more than just a crown. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 82 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller A reluctant princess is thrust into deadly political intrigue in Perry’s sweeping, high-stakes romantasy. Odessa is the overlooked and underestimated princess of Quentis, whose life takes an unexpected turn when a deal is struck between her father and the formidable Turan warriors force her into an arranged marriage with their enigmatic prince, Zavier Wolfe. Intended as a mere formality to secure trade routes and military alliances, the betrothal spirals into something far more dangerous when ancient magic, a ruthless Guardian, and a looming war threaten to upend everything she knows. Finally emerging from the shadow of her seemingly perfect half sister, Mae, Odessa must navigate court politics, monstrous creatures, and her own uncertain place in a world where survival often depends on strategy rather than strength. As tensions rise, she finds herself entangled with the dangerous, enigmatic Guardian—a man whose silver eyes hold secrets of their own. Perry’s worldbuilding is lush and immersive, crafting a kingdom rife with old magic, deadly beasts, and political machinations that add depth. The pacing is relentless, carrying Odessa from one life-altering event to another as she grapples with duty, defiance, and a destiny she never chose. Her internal conflict is compelling, torn between the expectations placed upon her and the fierce independence that threatens to make her an outcast in her own kingdom. Romance simmers as Odessa struggles to reconcile her obligations with her growing attraction to the Guardian, whose past is as shadowed as his reputation. Mae is introduced as Odessa’s political foil, and although her presence drives much of Odessa’s internal drama—being constantly overshadowed or underestimated—she’s mostly seen through Odessa’s perspective. Her motivations, ambitions, and political maneuverings might have benefited from deeper exploration to give more nuance to the power dynamics. However, Perry’s evocative prose and intricate plotting make for a gripping tale. Readers looking for a slow-burn romantasy with rich political intrigue and a protagonist forced to create her own fate will find much to enjoy. A thrilling, immersive tale that shows that some bargains demand more than just a crown.
