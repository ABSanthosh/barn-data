  "description": "Watts’ elegant sophomore novel follows Lewis, who’s from Arizona, and Australian Eloise—a married couple living in New York City—on a convoluted road trip through Nevada, California, Arizona, and Utah. The main purpose of the trip is to allow Eloise to study the Colorado River for her dissertation and give Lewis, who works for a foundation dedicated to land art, an opportunity to check on a project they’d been supporting. Quietly, Eloise also hopes their adventure will help her husband move through the grief of his mother’s death, which has been consuming their lives as he seeks out increasingly unorthodox ways to heal. While traveling across the barren landscape, Eloise begins to wonder if she’s pregnant. She struggles with whether to tell Lewis—who has never felt further away, despite their physical proximity—or if she should give in to her instinct to “continue to suspend [herself] in the amber of waiting.” The trip serves as the novel’s throughline while Eloise, the narrator, surfaces past memories and alludes to a very different present. The book is written in the second person as Eloise addresses Lewis, discussing their complicated marriage, love, art, death, climate change, wildfires, and America’s strange, dangerous, and expansive beauty, to name a few. Watts writes beautifully about grief, loneliness, and memory. One particularly poignant moment happens when Eloise realizes their future child will know their grandmother only through stories. She describes this as “an odd sort of mourning—grieving a future I didn’t know I’d even been so certain of.” This sorrowful knowing permeates the whole novel, which is less concerned with plot than with cataloging the couple’s relationship. Whether in love or nature, Watts’ prose artfully renders the mundane and majestic in equal measure.",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
