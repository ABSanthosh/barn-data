  "text": "Everand—a company that offers a monthly subscription for access to ebooks, audiobooks, podcasts, and more—just released their 2025 State of Reading Report. They gathered data on why we read, how and what we read, our beliefs about books, and the evolution of reading by interviewing 1,500 US consumers aged 18-64 who had paid for an ebook or audiobook subscription within the last two years. Some of the report’s findings are below. Why we read The survey found that 95% of participants thought that reading was important to them 95% read for leisure, while 85% find it releaxing How and what we read 50% of participants preferred a mix of reading physical and digital books 57% consumed a mix of audiobooks and ebooks Our beliefs about books 84% of participants believe the best stories are the ones you like The evolution of reading 28% of participants think social media has influenced their reading greatly 34% think social media has made reading more popular 69% participate in book clubs to discover new authors and books 86.2% strongly oppose book bans 77% use ebook and audiobook formats daily or weekly Going into the rest of the year, this snapshot of how a certain subset of readers read and view reading is interesting. Through it, we can see the vast effects that things like social media and recent book banning efforts have had on the book world in such a short time.
