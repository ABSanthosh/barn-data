  "description": "A bespectacled, pigtailed waffle has trouble making decisions. Even if the choices at hand aren’t that important, she, well, waffles. For Waffle, “most decisions feel big and forever.” Her indecisiveness has consequences. Taking too long to pick out a pair of socks results in Waffle being late for school. When she dawdles at the ice cream counter, nearly all of the flavors eventually run out. So Waffle devises a plan: She selects a school outfit from her closet with her eyes closed. Oops: She’s picked out beachwear. She tries copying what everyone else is doing and asking all her friends for guidance (“I’ll mix all their ideas together…so I don’t have to decide”); neither approach works. Eventually, looking through her telescope gives Waffle her best idea: She learns to narrow down choices to make them manageable. Along the way, Waffle picks up a few tips. Getting more information can be helpful in the process, as is the knowledge that sometimes “either choice is fine” and “many decisions aren’t forever.” This sympathetic, bibliotherapeutic story, written by a clinical pediatric neuropsychologist, will resonate with children who have problems making decisions. Parents will appreciate both the narrative and the closing note, the latter providing clear, useful guidance and tips for caregivers. The images of anthropomorphic foodstuffs—with cartoonishly large bodies perched atop skinny legs—leaven a serious topic.",

  "text": "ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN by Tish Rabe ; illustrated by Laura Hughes ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 21, 2016 While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of... Rabe follows a young girl through her first 12 days of kindergarten in this book based on the familiar Christmas carol. The typical firsts of school are here: riding the bus, making friends, sliding on the playground slide, counting, sorting shapes, laughing at lunch, painting, singing, reading, running, jumping rope, and going on a field trip. While the days are given ordinal numbers, the song skips the cardinal numbers in the verses, and the rhythm is sometimes off: “On the second day of kindergarten / I thought it was so cool / making lots of friends / and riding the bus to my school!” The narrator is a white brunette who wears either a tunic or a dress each day, making her pretty easy to differentiate from her classmates, a nice mix in terms of race; two students even sport glasses. The children in the ink, paint, and collage digital spreads show a variety of emotions, but most are happy to be at school, and the surroundings will be familiar to those who have made an orientation visit to their own schools. While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of Kindergarten (2003), it basically gets the job done.
