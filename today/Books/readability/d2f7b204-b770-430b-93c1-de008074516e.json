In these six gripping memoirs, individuals rise from trauma, loss, and adversity to rebuild with courage and grit. You’ll cry, cheer, and walk away changed. Eclipse of the Mourning Star by Robert Eujean Ogden Release Date: March 25, 2025 Eclipse of the Mourning Star is a powerfully emotional coming-of-age memoir, equal parts gutting and humorous in its recounting of murder, racial healing, glamour, romance, and even black holes. Including chapter illustrations by thirty-three world-renowned artists. Buy on Amazon Karen: A Brother Remembers by Kelsey Grammer Release Date: May 6, 2025 Karen by Kelsey Grammer delves into the tragic story of the author’s sister, Karen, who was brutally murdered at the age of eighteen. Kelsey was just twenty years old when his younger sister, a recent high school graduate, moved to Colorado Springs, where she was kidnapped by several men who had intended to rob the Red Lobster where she worked. They instead kidnapped Karen, raped her, and ultimately stabbed her to death. Buy on Amazon The Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football by Bill Belichick Release Date: May 6, 2025 No one embodies winning more than Bill Belichick, the greatest football coach of all time. Over the past fifty years, Belichick has been a man of notoriously few words, believing that a coach should keep a low profile. After he left the Patriots in 2024, he briefly became a coach without a team. He spent that year writing down the principles he learned from his father, Navy football, and from his forty-nine-year coaching career. Buy on Amazon This American Woman by Zarna Garg Release Date: April 29, 2025 Throughout Zarna’s whole childhood in India, everyone called her “so American” just for reading the newspaper, having deep thoughts, and talking back to anyone over the age of thirty. When Zarna’s dad tried to marry her off at age fourteen, Zarna fled—first to the streets of Mumbai and ultimately to the glittering paradise of Akron, Ohio, where she got to become American for real. Buy on Amazon The Next Day: Transitions, Change, and Moving Forward by Melinda Gates Release Date: April 15, 2025 In this book, Melinda will reflect, for the first time in print, on some of the most significant transitions in her own life, including becoming a parent, the death of a dear friend, and her departure from the Gates Foundation. The stories she tells illuminate universal lessons about loosening the bonds of perfectionism, helping friends navigate times of crisis, embracing uncertainty, and more. Buy on Amazon Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age by Amanda Hess Release Date: May 6, 2025 As an internet culture critic for The New York Times, Amanda Hess had built a reputation among readers as a sharp observer of the seductions and manipulations of online life. But when Hess discovered she was pregnant with her first child, she found herself unexpectedly rattled by a digital identity crisis of her own. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
