  "description": "The 11 stories in this collection share a common trajectory—they all center around engaging moments, swinging between humorous and dramatic, that shift the characters’ lives. In “As Happy As I Could Remember,” an unnamed narrator is ditched by her cousin during a road trip and befriends an eccentric group who adopt her into their off-grid lifestyle. As she struggles to figure out her future, another member of the party searches for her missing brother. The arguably funniest entry, “Lesson Plan,” acts as a parody of Donald Barthelme’s “The School”; instead of classroom animals with short lifespans, teacher Eliza deals with pets that just won’t die. The problem is, the principal wants her to give her kindergarteners the “death talk,” and she has no dead rodent to help. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the two strongest stories are more sentimental: “Like Salmon on Their Way Home” is a beautiful and moving tale about siblings Luanne and her younger brother Fred connecting after their father dies; “Soon It Will Be Summer,” which acts as the book’s conclusion, takes place in a small ski town and focuses on Ezra, a genius student and lift-operator who was raised by his older sister in a run-down trailer. (“I measured my childhood by the difference in color between what was under the poster and the rest of the wall.”) His situation is complicated when his sister becomes pregnant, thwarting his plans of going to college and making something of himself. The prose shines throughout, but some of the stories can feel flat in comparison to others. Even so, the collection is full of heart, and every character feels vibrantly alive and relatable.",

  "text": "THE WEDDING PEOPLE by Alison Espach ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 30, 2024 Uneven but fitfully amusing. Betrayed by her husband, a severely depressed young woman gets drawn into the over-the-top festivities at a lavish wedding. Phoebe Stone, who teaches English literature at a St. Louis college, is plotting her own demise. Her husband, Matt, has left her for another woman, and Phoebe is taking it hard. Indeed, she's determined just where and how she will end it all: at an oceanfront hotel in Newport, where she will lie on a king-sized canopy bed and take a bottle of her cat’s painkillers. At the hotel, Phoebe meets bride-to-be Lila, a headstrong rich girl presiding over her own extravagant six-day wedding celebration. Lila thought she had booked every room in the hotel, and learning of Phoebe's suicidal intentions, she forbids this stray guest from disrupting the nuptials: “No. You definitely can’t kill yourself. This is my wedding week.” After the punchy opening, a grim flashback to the meltdown of Phoebe's marriage temporarily darkens the mood, but things pick up when spoiled Lila interrupts Phoebe's preparations and sweeps her up in the wedding juggernaut. The slide from earnest drama to broad farce is somewhat jarring, but from this point on, Espach crafts an enjoyable—if overstuffed—comedy of manners. When the original maid of honor drops out, Phoebe is persuaded, against her better judgment, to take her place. There’s some fun to be had here: The wedding party—including groom-to-be Gary, a widower, and his 11-year-old daughter—takes surfing lessons; the women in the group have a session with a Sex Woman. But it all goes on too long, and the humor can seem forced, reaching a low point when someone has sex with the vintage wedding car (you don’t want to know the details). Later, when two characters have a meet-cute in a hot tub, readers will guess exactly how the marriage plot resolves. Uneven but fitfully amusing.
