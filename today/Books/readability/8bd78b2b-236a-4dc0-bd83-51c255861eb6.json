  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Dawn in Etrasco (The Equus Cycle Book 1)? Years ago, I took it as a challenge to write a fantasy with non-human characters. It’s in the vein of Watership Down and Animal Farm, but without the political undertones. I’ve also always been fascinated by how many species, real and fictional, are equine variations. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Dawn in Etrasco (The Equus Cycle Book 1), what would they be? Wild Horses by the Rolling Stones might be a bit on the nose. Don’t Stop Believin’ by Journey would speak to the overall story and saga arc. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? When I considered this, I started to think about fantasy, but then I thought, what about mysteries, thrillers, and history? I’m not sure I can narrow it down. It depends on the author. My favorite genre to write in, I think, would be history. I love finding unusual true stories. However, my favorite genre to write in to be wild and creative would be fantasy. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I actually just purchased Small Favor by Jim Butcher this morning. I love The Dresden Files. I also have The Great Bridge by David McCullough, School Days by Robert B. Parker, Return to Sender by Craig Johnson, and Iron Gold by Pierce Brown. However, like most authors, my TBR list has dozens, if not more, books on it. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I think that would be the prologue. It stayed pretty much the way I envisioned it from the start. Many of my other fun scenes to write went through various iterations. While I may love the way scenes like that turn out, that rewriting and rewriting often changes my initial vision, even if it works better for the story. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I like to have music playing in the background. It helps me focus and forget about the rest of the world. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? My philosophy is to write a story I’m excited by because I feel that that enthusiasm transfers from me to my writing. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I guess that would be, don’t give up if you know you’re right.
