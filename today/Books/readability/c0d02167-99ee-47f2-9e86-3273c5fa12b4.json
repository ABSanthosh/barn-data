  "description": "Thalia Eichel awakens somewhere unfamiliar with only fleeting memories. She soon runs into Alistair, the God of Protection, who reluctantly tells her she’s dead. He doesn’t know how it happened, and Thalia doesn’t remember. With help from Alistair, Thalia returns home to Druin, a labor town in a medieval-like fantasy realm, only to discover that her parents and twin brother are likely dead as well. Signs point to her family’s probable murderer: King Vitalis of the royal city of Varedon. In fact, Thalia’s brother Demetrius is alive and looking for her—as far as he knows, she is just missing. A reunion between the two is possible if Thalia and Alistair can track down a legendary medallion that can allegedly restore life. All the while, an underground organization plots a rebellion against the royals, stirring up mortals, gods, and goddesses. The author masterfully handles an extensive cast, shifting narrative perspectives between Thalia, Alistair, Demetrius, and others. Individual character arcs shine, from Alistair’s father, the King of the Gods, objecting to his son “mingling with the mortals” to Thalia’s best friend Torin Lehr fighting in bouts for a mysterious company promising info on Thalia’s whereabouts. Much of this first installment in Mavis’ series follows Thalia hunting the titular jewel while hinting at a secret involving an Eichel ancestor that may explain why someone has apparently targeted her family. Mortals and immortals alike wind up imprisoned and in peril, offering plenty of opportunities for Thalia to prove she’s capable in physical confrontations. The author portrays richly drawn environments, including the gods’ home planet where a luxurious palace sits near a crashing waterfall, and an “ethereal” forest housing such magical creatures as pixies and a lilac-colored stag.",

  "text": "BLOODGUARD by Cecy Robson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 22, 2024 An expertly crafted page-turner with unpredictable twists, steamy romance, and magical creatures. Awards \u0026 Accolades Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller A princess and a gladiator join forces amidst political intrigue and bloody carnage in Robson’s fantasy novel. For the citizens of the wealthy kingdom of Arrow, the most exciting entertainment can be found in the arena—for the gladiators from the surrounding kingdoms, it’s a relentlessly brutal series of fights to the death. The combatants hope to win enough matches to earn the royal title of “Bloodguard,” which will allow their families to immigrate to Arrow. Leith, a gladiator in his mid-20s, is a skilled fighter driven by his desperation to support his mother and two younger sisters (and by the rage built from years of killing his peers for an audience’s delectation). After killing the arrogant Lord Filip (who challenged him to an impromptu duel) and subsequently emerging victorious in a surprise melee with a group of his peers and a dragon, Leith is getting closer to becoming a Bloodguard. He attracts the attention of Princess Maeve, a 20-year-old healer. Now that her fiance, Lord Filip, is dead, she’s in dire need of a noble spouse so that she can claim the throne when she turns 21. Maeve proposes a deal: She’ll help Leith achieve the Bloodguard status in exchange for his hand in marriage. But as their relationship blossoms, problems arise when royal secrets are revealed and government corruption is exposed. Soon, they’re not just vying for a title and a crown—they’re fighting for their lives. Robson’s novel is an exciting blend of action, palace intrigue, and romance in a high fantasy setting. The story unfolds through the perspectives of Maeve and Leith, who are both compelling and well developed, with flaws, foibles, and distinctive voices. The supporting characters are equally intriguing. Readers will love the richly detailed worldbuilding and combat sequences, as well as the use of snarky, modern language (“Of course the only royal offering me help is one who’s clawing her way to the throne, not already sitting pretty on one. That tracks,” Leith gripes). The book’s thoughtful queer representation and exploration of oppression and exploitation are also noteworthy. An expertly crafted page-turner with unpredictable twists, steamy romance, and magical creatures.
