Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. What We Talk About When We Talk About Synergy Cynthia Erivo has announced a memoir of “powerful, personal vignettes” intended for “anyone who has been told they’re too much.” Simply More will be released November 18, just days before Wicked: For Good hits theaters. You know it’s going to be killer on audio. The book will use “vulnerable and enlightening” lessons from Erivo’s journey to “to help readers discover their true capabilities.” The multi-talented performer told PEOPLE she is hoping to “provide a little encouragement to anyone who is asking themselves and challenging themselves to be simply more.” An inspiring message from an inspiring star released alongside the second part of an inspiring story? That’s how you do it. That Old Bookish Magic What was the book that turned you into a capital-R Reader? At his Substack The New Dork Review of Books, original Book Riot contributor Greg Zimmerman reflects on the book that changed his life, and not just because it was the first one that compelled him to stay up all night reading. It’s a novel about finding your destiny, about identifying what it is you are supposed to be doing, which for me I realized at that moment was trying to find more books like it. And if I couldn’t find more books like that one, I knew the quest would keep me happy for however long I got to stay on this floating rock in space. It’s a lovely piece that taps into one of the best parts of being a book lover, and I so appreciate an opportunity to consider my own life-changing reads. The Sparrow. Gilead. Beloved. When Women Were Birds. Never Let Me Go. What would make your list? Let us know in the comments! A Toolkit for the Next Generation of Activists Teens have become integral leaders in the fight against book bans, but it can be hard to know where to start if there’s not already an advocacy group in your school or neighborhood.
