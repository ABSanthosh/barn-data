  "description": "Rory, a former Honor Warrior, loves Ingefær, a battle wizard, very much. They have traveled together for years working as bounty hunters and are ready to begin the next part of their journey together: marriage. While Rory has been hesitant to propose to Ingefær after so many of his loved ones have died, Furæyar Shrine, with its dazzling colors and beautiful view, feels like the right place to finally pop the question (“the gardens were the grandest spot for romance in Vanaby, perhaps the entire Realm”). However, as soon as Rory gets down on one knee, the shrine erupts in flames. He and Ingefær rush to help people, but in the aftermaththey are arrested for suspicion of causing the magically created fire. Lieutenant Smergasil is quick to point fingers at the outsiders, and while Rory is released, Ingefær is kept in jail until the trial, leaving Rory to find the true fire mage who started the conflagration and free her. The task proves difficult, as things have changed recently in the city of Vanaby, with military control giving lieutenants an incredible amount of power—and humans are not looked upon kindly in this land. Vecka creates compelling difficulties and character challenges that help drive the fast-paced plot and add to the already exciting mystery narrative. The lieutenant and his men watch Rory like a hawk as he’s challenged to use his wits and words to figure out how to free Ingefær. If he lifts a finger against a resident of Vanaby, he’ll find himself back in jail as well; for a former Honor Warrior, this is a great strain, and the author effectively shows how Rory struggles with it. Similarly, Ingefær must struggle to choose between escaping to live as a fugitive or staying locked up until her innocence is proved by the identification of the true culprit.",

  "text": "IRON FLAME From the Empyrean series , Vol. 2 by Rebecca Yarros ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 7, 2023 Unrelenting, and not in a good way. A young Navarrian woman faces even greater challenges in her second year at dragon-riding school. Violet Sorrengail did all the normal things one would do as a first-year student at Basgiath War College: made new friends, fell in love, and survived multiple assassination attempts. She was also the first rider to ever bond with two dragons: Tairn, a powerful black dragon with a distinguished battle history, and Andarna, a baby dragon too young to carry a rider. At the end of Fourth Wing (2023), Violet and her lover, Xaden Riorson, discovered that Navarre is under attack from wyvern, evil two-legged dragons, and venin, soulless monsters that harvest energy from the ground. Navarrians had always been told that these were monsters of legend and myth, not real creatures dangerously close to breaking through Navarre’s wards and attacking civilian populations. In this overly long sequel, Violet, Xaden, and their dragons are determined to find a way to protect Navarre, despite the fact that the army and government hid the truth about these creatures. Due to the machinations of several traitorous instructors at Basgiath, Xaden and Violet are separated for most of the book—he’s stationed at a distant outpost, leaving her to handle the treacherous, cutthroat world of the war college on her own. Violet is repeatedly threatened by her new vice commandant, a brutal man who wants to silence her. Although Violet and her dragons continue to model extreme bravery, the novel feels repetitive and more than a little sloppy, leaving obvious questions about the world unanswered. The book is full of action and just as full of plot holes, including scenes that are illogical or disconnected from the main narrative. Secondary characters are ignored until a scene requires them to assist Violet or to be killed in the endless violence that plagues their school. Unrelenting, and not in a good way.
