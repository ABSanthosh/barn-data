  "description": "When Los Angeles train station authorities force open two leaking, putrid-smelling trunks, the dismembered female bodies they find horrify them. Yet what leaves them especially aghast is the idea that Ruth Judd, the pretty young woman who presents a claim ticket for the trunks, could possibly be involved in what clearly appears to be murder. Notaro carefully reconstructs the Depression-era period in which this real-life crime took place and presents a sympathetic portrayal of Ruth, who manages to walk out of the baggage claim but is quickly identified as a suspect. In the narrative that follows the bodies’ discovery, Notaro alternates a chronicle of the hunt for Ruth with sections told from her point of view that reveal her motivations. A painful youth, marriage to a drug-addicted WWI veteran named Doctor, and a forced abortion at Doctor’s hands form the cornerstones of her troubled personality. She developed a lifelong obsession with the baby she lost and delusions that the child still lives. After Ruth and Doctor were temporarily separated, she eventually wound up in Phoenix, where she fell in love with Jack, a married—and unscrupulous—businessman. He got her a job at a clinic, which led to her friendship with the two lesbians who became the murder victims. As complex as it is deftly crafted—weaving newspaper accounts and letters written by the real-life Ruth within a compelling fictional web—this is a pulse-pounding, page-turning, heartbreaking account of the misunderstood woman behind a sensational news story that gripped a nation.",

  "text": "INTERMEZZO by Sally Rooney ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 24, 2024 Though not perfect, a clear leap forward for Rooney; her grandmaster status remains intact. Two brothers—one a lawyer, one a chess prodigy—work through the death of their father, their complicated romantic lives, and their even more tangled relationship with each other. Ten years separate the Koubek brothers. In his early 30s, Peter has turned his past as a university debating champ into a career as a progressive lawyer in Dublin. Ivan is just out of college, struggling to make ends meet through freelance data analysis and reckoning with his recent free fall in the world chess rankings. When their father dies of cancer, the cracks in the brothers’ relationship widen. “Complete oddball” Ivan falls in love with an older woman, an arts center employee, which freaks Peter out. Peter juggles two women at once: free-spirited college student Naomi and his ex-girlfriend Sylvia, whose life has changed drastically since a car accident left her in chronic pain. Emotional chaos abounds. Rooney has struck a satisfying blend of the things she’s best at—sensitively rendered characters, intimacies, consideration of social and philosophical issues—with newer moves. Having the book’s protagonists navigating a familial rather than romantic relationship seems a natural next step for Rooney, with her astutely empathic perception, and the sections from Peter’s point of view show Rooney pushing her style into new territory with clipped, fragmented, almost impressionistic sentences. (Peter on Sylvia: “Must wonder what he’s really here for: repentance, maybe. Bless me for I have. Not like that, he wants to tell her. Why then. Terror of solitude.”) The risk: Peter comes across as a slightly blurry character, even to himself—he’s no match for the indelible Ivan—so readers may find these sections less propulsive at best or over-stylized at worst. Overall, though, the pages still fly; the characters remain reach-out-and-touch-them real. Though not perfect, a clear leap forward for Rooney; her grandmaster status remains intact.
