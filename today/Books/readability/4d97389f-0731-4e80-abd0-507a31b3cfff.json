  "description": "In the mid-14th century, Jeanne de Flandre, a Breton aristocrat, is an independent and insightful woman happily married to John Montfort, who respects her intellect and counsel “because she always used her insights to further his position.” When John is named Duke of Brittany in the will of his half-brother Duke John III, the dying duke’s niece, Jeanne de Penthièvre (daughter of John III’s deceased full brother, Guy) is incensed. Against a backdrop of shifting alliances among the towns and villages of Brittany, rumor-mongering among the French royalty, and court machinations that result in the invalidation of Duke John III’s will, King Philip of France imprisons John. John charges Jeanne to “do nothing to jeopardize the possibility of regaining the title and securing our son’s rightful inheritance…for now, our cause is in your hands.” She moves their young son and daughter, along with a small loyal army and the ducal treasury, to safe havens in Rennes and then Hennebort. Her leadership in routing the army that is laying siege to Hennebort is an inspiration to the fiercely independent Bretons, who dub her “Jeanne de la Flamme.” She forges an alliance with King Edward III of England, who needs Brittany’s help for his own designs on the French throne. Edward convinces her to bring her children to England for their safety…then turns the tables on her. Taylor builds on historical events with believable dialogue and action to bring Jeanne de Flandre to life as a fully realized woman. Political intrigue, ship movements, and battle plans mix with details of everyday life in the mid-1300s to propulsively move the story forward. Weaving Jeanne’s analysis into the narrative adds depth. Much like the fiction of Bernard Cornwell and Philipa Gregory, this book will enchant readers interested in well researched historical fiction.",

  "text": "THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 1, 2004 Heartfelt, yes, but pretty routine. Life lessons. Angie Malone, the youngest of a big, warm Italian-American family, returns to her Pacific Northwest hometown to wrestle with various midlife disappointments: her divorce, Papa’s death, a downturn in business at the family restaurant, and, above all, her childlessness. After several miscarriages, she, a successful ad exec, and husband Conlan, a reporter, befriended a pregnant young girl and planned to adopt her baby—and then the birth mother changed her mind. Angie and Conlan drifted apart and soon found they just didn’t love each other anymore. Metaphorically speaking, “her need for a child had been a high tide, an overwhelming force that drowned them. A year ago, she could have kicked to the surface but not now.” Sadder but wiser, Angie goes to work in the struggling family restaurant, bickering with Mama over updating the menu and replacing the ancient waitress. Soon, Angie befriends another young girl, Lauren Ribido, who’s eager to learn and desperately needs a job. Lauren’s family lives on the wrong side of the tracks, and her mother is a promiscuous alcoholic, but Angie knows nothing of this sad story and welcomes Lauren into the DeSaria family circle. The girl listens in, wide-eyed, as the sisters argue and make wisecracks and—gee-whiz—are actually nice to each other. Nothing at all like her relationship with her sluttish mother, who throws Lauren out when boyfriend David, en route to Stanford, gets her pregnant. Will Lauren, who’s just been accepted to USC, let Angie adopt her baby? Well, a bit of a twist at the end keeps things from becoming too predictable. Heartfelt, yes, but pretty routine.
