  "description": "Lisa Owens, whose fiance’s death was never solved because of police ineptitude, became a cop, in large part, to make sure that others never experienced the pain and uncertainty that she did. Now she’s an overworked homicide detective whose boss is desperately trying to get her to focus on developing a personal life, apart from her career. Owens does take time off—and uses it to investigate the brutal killing of her best friend, Dorothy Jensen, a beloved mentor who was her middle school teacher years earlier. The retired educator lived in a condo on Stypman Island, a haven for people escaping the cold winters of the northern United States, where she was found beheaded with her eyes and tongue cut out. The meticulous Owens eventually joins forces with local cop Kim Witherspoon, whose law enforcement experience has been nothing short of nightmarish, as she’s been forced to work for a sexist, antigay, and morally bankrupt chief of police. The two women soon discover that Owens’ best friend’s murder is linked to drug trafficking, blackmail, and multiple other deaths. Numerous noteworthy elements fuel Foley’s narrative, including an impressively diverse cast of secondary characters, including a politician with twisted sexual proclivities, a naïve marine biologist, and a sleazy realtor. They effectively flesh out the multilayered mystery, and the author also explores environmental issues, such as global warming and marine plastic pollution, with subtlety and compassion. Infrequent moments of social commentary add brass-knuckle impact, as well: “He’s greedy, he doesn’t believe in climate change, he’s a racist, a misogynist, and he’s homophobic…He’s like half the men in Florida.”",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 250 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
