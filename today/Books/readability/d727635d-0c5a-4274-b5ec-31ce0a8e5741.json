  "description": "Daemicke links a teacher’s childhood gift of The Secret Garden to the community gardens that Grace Lee Boggs (1915-2015) later planted in empty lots around Detroit with the aid of young volunteers. The author characterizes her subject as “a gardener not only of plants but also of minds.” Lin echoes that theme in emblematic tableaux that follow Boggs through early troubles finding work “because she was Chinese” and leadership of the Workers Party to grassroots initiatives like the “Detroit Summer” program. She had such close associations with Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement that her FBI file wrongly dubbed her “Afro-Chinese.” She spent decades involved in both local and larger causes and makes a final appearance here speaking to a diverse circle of youthful “solutionaries” (as she called them) about “art, the earth, and change, challenging them to turn ideas into action.” Daemicke brings home the reality that the struggle for civil rights, particularly for Asian Americans, has been long and tragic with a quick closing reference to Vincent Chin, victim of a hate crime in 1982. The narrative ends with hopes of making the world a “healthier, kinder, and more just place for everyone.”",

  "text": "BOY TALES OF CHILDHOOD by Roald Dahl ‧ RELEASE DATE: Dec. 1, 1984 Throughout my young days at school and just afterwards a number of things happened to me that I have never forgotten. . . . Some are funny. Some are painful. Some are unpleasant. I suppose that is why I have always remembered them so vividly.\" Vividly indeed: with the intimate, confiding tone of a born storyteller, Dahl turns each of his family/school memories into a miniature adventure, thriller, or horror-story—with the earthy emphasis on pleasure (food, comradeship), fear, and pain. After a brief, charming slice of family-history, explaining how his Norwegian parents came to live and prosper in Wales, Dahl gets right down to business. From the years at Llandaff Cathedral School (ages 7-9, 1923-25), there's a candy-by-candy tribute to the local sweet-shop, site of \"The Great Mouse Plot\": Roald and friends, fed up with the meanness of filthy sweet-shop-owner Mrs. Pratchett, secretly put a dead mouse in the Gobstopper jar—but suffered mightily for their glorious prank. (Mrs. P. reported the crime to the Headmaster—unleashing the first of many school-career canings, all described in gruesome, technicolor detail.) Summer vacations in Norway are also recalled in a mixture of ecstasy—the fish, the scenery—and agony: an operation for adenoid removal without any anesthetic. And the extremes of pleasure and pain continue through Dahl's years at two English boarding schools: homesickness, sadistic Matrons and Masters, practical jokes, the indignities of \"fagging\" (warming up the toilet-seat for older boys), chocolates. . . and, always, the dreaded Headmaster's cane. (\"By now I am sure you will be wondering why I lay so much emphasis upon school beatings in these pages. The answer is that. . . I couldn't get over it. I never have got over it.\") Some readers may be put off by Dahl's style here—chatty, bedtime-story-ish, deceptively avuncular. Others might not take to the British references (no special explanations for a US audience), or the particularly British approach—full of bitter humor and odd relish—to grisly, gory matters. But those who've appreciated Dahl in various forms will find both the master of chills and the lover of chocolate here—in a fine, juicy collage of funny/awful boyhood highlights.
