  "text": "25 Jul 2025 6 Biographies \u0026 Memoirs of Discovery These aren’t just stories of where someone came from—they’re about who they chose to become. Across countries, careers, and collisions with fate, each voice reveals what it means to build a life from the inside out. You’ll walk away inspired, unsettled, and wide awake. Searching for Home by Judy Kashoff Release Date: July 2, 2025 They traveled for 5 years by horseback, on elephants, and leaky boats, but mostly by bicycle. They drank tuak with headhunters in the jungle of Borneo, slept in a Wat on Christmas Eve, and watched a monk go up in flames in Cambodia. For five years, their bikes were their only home. Explore 3 continents with Judy and Dave—and see where they ended up. Buy on Amazon Jeremy Renner My Next Breath by Williams J. Frederick Release Date: July 17, 2025 From humble beginnings in California to Oscar-nominated performances and global fame in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Jeremy Renner’s journey has been anything but ordinary. But it was a life-threatening accident that truly redefined his purpose. Buy on Amazon Buckets \u0026 Battles by Drew Schifino Release Date: July 21, 2025 Buckets \u0026 Battles is Drew Schifino’s raw, no filter story of life on and off the court, records, rivalries, women, wild nights, and the grind to keep chasing the dream when the game tried to break him. From Pittsburgh playgrounds to strip clubs in Morgantown to overseas ball in Europe, Schifino takes you inside the wins, the losses, and the chaos in between. Buckets. Women. Betrayal. Redemption. This isn’t just hoops, it’s life, lived fast and told real. Buy on Amazon Artesonraju: The Mountain is Only Half the Journey by Joshua E. Smith Release Date: July 24, 2025 In Artesonraju, Josh and his climbing partner Adam travel from the United States to South America to attempt to climb Artesonraju, one of the most beautiful peaks in the Peruvian Andes. On their first foray into the mountains, Josh gets dangerously sick from the altitude, and he and Adam must retreat to civilization to regroup. In their subsequent attempts to get back in the mountains and salvage their trip, they encounter bandits who want a horse in exchange for safe passage, share a taxi with a kidnapped puppy, ride the most dilapidated roller coaster in the hemisphere, and eventually climb a mountain. Buy on Amazon The Woman Who Stayed by Serena Wilder Release Date: July 17, 2025 When a woman on the edge of collapse buys a one‑way ticket to Rome, she isn’t chasing an Instagram fantasy—she’s fleeing a life that no longer fits: a crumbling marriage, a career that devours her spirit, and the endless expectations of family. What begins as escape becomes a raw, transformative pilgrimage across three continents. Buy on Amazon Coach: Lessons from an All Blacks Legend by Mike Cron Release Date: July 1, 2025 Mike Cron was an All Blacks coach over 217 games. He was instrumental in the success of one the greatest sports dynasties ever – an All Blacks side that lost just 14 games of the 103 they played, won two successive world cups, and set a new world record for their time ranked as number one.
