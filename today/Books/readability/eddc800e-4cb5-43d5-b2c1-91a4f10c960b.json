  "text": "09 Oct 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Kianola? The question I get most is “Why middle school?” I wrote about middle school because it was such a brutal but formative time in my life, and many people can relate. You have raging hormones, feeling like an unruly kid kicking the back of your seat. You’re noticing the opposite sex for the first time, but you have no idea how to even talk to them. School is hard, bullies make it even harder, and your self-worth feels like it’s tied to how popular you are. You’re trying to figure out who you are with the odds stacked so high against you, and sometimes, the best you can do is just weather the storm and survive. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Kianola, what would they be? Nole – “On the Wing” by Owl City Keki – “Someone to Call My Lover” by Janet Jackson Dapple – “Beer for My Horses” by Toby Keith What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I grew up on fantasy like The Lord of the Rings and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, but also YA books like Stargirl so both my reading and writing are a bit of each. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Everything by C.S. Lewis. I made a loose goal in my head to read all of his works, but I often get too caught up in how many are left and where I’m going rather than enjoying what’s in front of me. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Midnight beach. It still feels like a warm hug whenever I think about it. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I write mostly on my tiny little phone screen in the Notes app and then edit on the computer. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I have a post-it note hanging from my monitor that says “Highly productive generosity” and another that says “Writing will set you free.” If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Be gentle. Be kind, and quick to forgive. We all make mistakes, and you never know what someone else is going through.
