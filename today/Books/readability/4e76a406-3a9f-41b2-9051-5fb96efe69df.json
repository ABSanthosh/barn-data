The finalists for the 45th Los Angeles Times Book Prize were just announced Wednesday. The list is 61 nominees long and includes all manner of screenwriters, award-winning authors, and, yes, actors.

Other nominees include authors of the most popular books of 2024, such as Percival Everett for James, Ta-Nehisi Coates for The Message, Liz Moore for The God of the Woods, and Attica Locke for Guide Me Home. The awards ceremony announcing the winners will take place on April 25th at the USC Campus, right before The L.A. Times Festival of Books. Below is a sampling of those nominated.
