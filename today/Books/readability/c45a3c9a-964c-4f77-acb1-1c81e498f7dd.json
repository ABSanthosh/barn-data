  "description": "Grace Hastings feels as if she’s clawed her way to the role of marketing manager for a London dating app called Fate, struggling with imposter syndrome every step of the way. Meanwhile, she writes off her workplace rival Eric Bancroft’s effortless rise as a result of his popularity, family name, and good looks. When the upcoming launch of a new kind of dating app forces them together—and with a promotion dangling for one of them—Grace and Eric set aside their frequent jabs for the sake of their research and hopefully a successful launch. The new app has an unusual focus on in-person experiences, pairing up compatible users and sending them on curated dates. But before it can launch, Grace and Eric are asked to assess each experience—from hikes to cooking classes to yoga—as if they were two people going on the date themselves. Grace is a frustrating character; though she frequently tells herself that she’s worked hard to get where she is and deserves her position, outwardly she acts like a doormat. Her boss frequently takes advantage of her, and it’s only through Eric’s encouragement that she gains confidence and begins setting boundaries. Her journey would have felt more impactful if she’d mustered the courage to stand up for herself rather than relying on a love interest to be the catalyst for change. The opposites-attract romance is cute, albeit a bit slow until nearly the end of the book. The litany of inventive dates is what propels the book forward, as the reader looks forward to seeing what sort of adventure Eric and Grace will be subject to next.",

  "text": "THE THINGS WE LEAVE UNFINISHED by Rebecca Yarros ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 23, 2021 A charming dual-timeline romance about learning from past mistakes. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 11 Our Verdict GET IT In Yarros’ latest romance novel, a young woman hires a handsome but infuriating writer to complete her late great-grandmother’s half-finished book. After her marriage to a Hollywood producer ends in high-profile divorce, 28-year-old Georgia Stanton returns to her childhood home in Colorado. When she arrives at the house where she was raised by her great-grandma—the famous romance author Scarlett Stanton—she finds her mother, Ava, lying in wait. Georgia is in possession of the only unfinished manuscript that her deceased relative left behind, and her own mom wants her to sell the rights so they can get some cash. Georgia succumbs to the pressure and enters a deal in which another author will finish the book’s second half. The manuscript tells Scarlett’s life story, including how she found, and lost, her one true love. Georgia feels strongly that the finished novel must reflect the true events of Scarlett’s life, as difficult as they may have been. Unfortunately, the publishers hire Noah Harrison, a stubborn writer at the height of his career, who has his own fictional vision for the novel’s ending. As Noah and Georgia butt heads, each of them researches Scarlett’s history in England during World War II. As they learn more about Scarlett and Jameson Stanton, the fighter pilot she loved, Georgia and Noah must navigate their own increasingly complicated relationship. With two equally engrossing storylines, this book will draw in even seasoned romance readers. As the story jumps between past and present, the author also alternates present-day perspectives between Georgia and Noah, moving deftly between her characters’ distinct voices. The relationships are well developed, and the love that Scarlett felt for Jameson is especially palpable. Along with the sweetly romantic themes, the book explores several heftier topics, including personal ambition, grief, family discord, and self-esteem. The story has a few digressions that do little to advance the plot, but the main characters are sufficiently engrossing that readers will want to stick with them to the end. A charming dual-timeline romance about learning from past mistakes.
