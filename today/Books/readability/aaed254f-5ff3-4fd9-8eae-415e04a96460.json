  "description": "The author invites readers on a “journey of self-recovery where [they’ll] know with every molecule within [them] that [they] are worthy.” Sánní discusses her training in practices like Neuro-Linguistic Programming and her experience working as a personal coach for women. She also details her firsthand experience with challenges like finding oneself in a “self-imposed prison of negativity.” In this work, the author encourages her audience to discover new conceptions of themselves. Readers are advised to examine what types of thoughts they give their time to and to take a look at their pasts through the perspective of an inner child. The journey is not always easy; to embrace one’s inner child, one must “come face to face with her and really see her.” Chapters end with actionable steps, like journaling from question prompts such as, “What are ten things that you love about yourself?” Sánní writes from a faith-based, Islamic perspective—there are occasional quotations from the Qur’an, such as a verse about repentance that acts to remind readers that “past mistakes don’t define us if we choose for them not to.” The text progresses in a friendly, conversational style (the author often addresses the reader directly as “my lovely”). Sánní emphasizes that “you, and only you, have control of your thoughts and feelings; and only you have control over whether you’ll allow your past to define your future.” Self-help readers will have likely encountered some of the book’s advice before; concepts like journaling and learning to say no (even if “saying ‘no’ is a new realm for you”) are standard fare for the genre. Still, the welcoming tone for specifically Muslim women helps to set the book aside from similar works. Ultimately, the author’s warmth shines through as she wholeheartedly guides her readers to new versions of themselves.",

  "text": "ROSE BOOK OF BIBLE CHARTS, MAPS AND TIME LINES by Timothy Paul Jones ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 1, 2005 Worthwhile reference stuffed with facts and illustrations. A compendium of charts, time lines, lists and illustrations to accompany study of the Bible. This visually appealing resource provides a wide array of illustrative and textually concise references, beginning with three sets of charts covering the Bible as a whole, the Old Testament and the New Testament. These charts cover such topics as biblical weights and measures, feasts and holidays and the 12 disciples. Most of the charts use a variety of illustrative techniques to convey lessons and provide visual interest. A worthwhile example is â€œHow We Got the Bible,” which provides a time line of translation history, comparisons of canons among faiths and portraits of important figures in biblical translation, such as Jerome and John Wycliffe. The book then presents a section of maps, followed by diagrams to conceptualize such structures as Noah’s Ark and Solomon’s Temple. Finally, a section on Christianity, cults and other religions describes key aspects of history and doctrine for certain Christian sects and other faith traditions. Overall, the authors take a traditionalist, conservative approach. For instance, they list Moses as the author of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) without making mention of claims to the contrary. When comparing various Christian sects and world religions, the emphasis is on doctrine and orthodox theology. Some chapters, however, may not completely align with the needs of Catholic and Orthodox churches. But the authors’ leanings are muted enough and do not detract from the work’s usefulness. As a resource, it’s well organized, inviting and visually stimulating. Even the most seasoned reader will learn something while browsing. Worthwhile reference stuffed with facts and illustrations.
