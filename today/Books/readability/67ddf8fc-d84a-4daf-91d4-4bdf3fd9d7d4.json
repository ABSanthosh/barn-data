Buy on Amazon Koncolos Witches by Muge Direr Release Date: March 16, 2025 Koncolos Witches is a dark, psychological thriller steeped in trauma, obsession, and schizophrenia.

Don’t they remember people lapsing into comas back then? And those people always awoke…didn’t they? Buy on Amazon The Missing Half by Ashley Flowers Release Date: May 6, 2025 Nicole “Nic” Monroe is in a rut. At twenty-four, she lives alone in a dinky apartment in her hometown of Mishawaka, Indiana, she’s just gotten a DWI, and she works the same dead-end job she’s been working since high school, a job she only has because her boss is a family friend and feels sorry for her. Everyone has felt sorry for her for the last seven years, since the day her older sister, Kasey, vanished without a trace. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
