These mysteries and thrillers blur the lines between hunter and hunted, as secrets unravel and the watchers become the watched. Every character has something to hide, and every revelation leads to a darker one. These books will keep you second-guessing everything until the final, brutal truth drops. Every Little Thing (Hart’s Ridge Book 12) by Kay Bratt Release Date: May 5, 2025 A fairytale wedding in Mexico. An exclusive resort. A black-tie ceremony overlooking the sea. Everything is supposed to be perfect. But when the bride goes missing the morning after her wedding, paradise turns into a nightmare. Her new husband is frantic, her father is desperate, and the celebration is thrust into a whirlwind of fear and suspicion. Buy on Amazon Happy Wife by Meredith Lavender \u0026 Kendall Shores Release Date: June 24, 2025 Nora Davies doesn’t exactly fit in to Winter Park, Florida, where old-guard Floridians mix with the tax-fleeing coastal elite. Twenty-eight and barely making ends meet working at a country club, Nora feels like she’s going nowhere fast. Enter Will Somerset: a prominent forty-six-year-old lawyer, father to a teenage daughter, and recently divorced. The two set Winter Park’s social scene agog when they fall in love and marry after a whirlwind Cinderella-style courtship. Buy on Amazon Don’t Let Him In by Lisa Jewell Release Date: June 24, 2025 Nina Swann is intrigued when she receives a condolence card from Nick Radcliffe, an old friend of her late husband, who is looking to connect after her husband’s unexpected death. Nick is a man of substance and good taste. He has a smile that could melt the coldest heart and a knack for putting others at ease. But to Nina’s adult daughter, Ash, Nick seems too slick, too polished, too good to be true. Without telling her mother, Ash begins digging into Nick’s past. What she finds is more than unsettling… Buy on Amazon A Happy Marriage by A. R. Torre Release Date: June 24, 2025 Los Angeles homicide detective Dinah Marino may have a complicated relationship with her family, but her psychiatrist husband, Joe, makes her feel safe, secure, and happy. She couldn’t want for a more loving or trusting man. But throughout their ten-year marriage, she’s been keeping a secret from him—a secret she’d take to the grave. Buy on Amazon The President’s Shadow by James Patterson \u0026 Richard DiLallo Release Date: June 24, 2025 For over 150 years, Lamont Cranston, and his alter ego, The Shadow, have possessed an array of mental and physical powers: scientific skills, shape-shifting ability, and mind control. When a series of deadly natural disasters strike the planet, immediately set out to identify who’s responsible… Buy on Amazon The Alpha’s Seer by Sadie Sears Release Date: May 28, 2025 Chelsea Reed has always had the gift of seeing the future. It’s a gift—and a curse. When she foresees the deadly fate of Dr. North Fowler, a brilliant surgeon and powerful wolf shifter, she knows she must warn him. But North, a man of logic and reason, dismisses her warning, skeptical of her visions and their supernatural nature. Buy on Amazon zaida Recommended Posts",
