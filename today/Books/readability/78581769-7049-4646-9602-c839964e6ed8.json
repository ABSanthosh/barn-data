  "description": "After Ophelia’s father dies unexpectedly, she leaves Austin and moves back to New River, North Dakota, to live with her aunt Cherice and uncle Janus; her mother’s identity has always been a mystery. Still grieving, high school senior Ophelia, who’s Black, meets new people and tries to settle in, though she starts to realize that her family may be harboring some secrets. When a series of unusual dreams plagues Ophelia and her racially diverse group of friends, they soon discover that they’ve each been given the power of a different Greek god. As they’re learning what this means, they learn from a mysterious messenger that not only are they in danger, but the future of humankind is as well—and they’re the only ones who can help. Armed with this information, they set off on a series of quests to stop a total apocalypse. Janae’s writing style is compelling but occasionally moves too rapidly, not allowing readers to fully digest the new information she’s introduced. Additionally, while fans of similar contemporary fantasies based on Greek mythology might enjoy this story and its many nods to classic tales, the lore, which contains many moving pieces, is difficult to follow at times.",

  "text": "IF HE HAD BEEN WITH ME by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 1, 2013 There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head. The finely drawn characters capture readers’ attention in this debut. Autumn and Phineas, nicknamed Finny, were born a week apart; their mothers are still best friends. Growing up, Autumn and Finny were like peas in a pod despite their differences: Autumn is “quirky and odd,” while Finny is “sweet and shy and everyone like[s] him.” But in eighth grade, Autumn and Finny stop being friends due to an unexpected kiss. They drift apart and find new friends, but their friendship keeps asserting itself at parties, shared holiday gatherings and random encounters. In the summer after graduation, Autumn and Finny reconnect and are finally ready to be more than friends. But on August 8, everything changes, and Autumn has to rely on all her strength to move on. Autumn’s coming-of-age is sensitively chronicled, with a wide range of experiences and events shaping her character. Even secondary characters are well-rounded, with their own histories and motivations. There’s not much plot here, but readers will relish the opportunity to climb inside Autumn’s head.   (Fiction. 14 \u0026 up) Pub Date: April 1, 2013 ISBN: 978-1-4022-7782-5 Page Count: 336 Publisher: Sourcebooks Fire Review Posted Online: Feb. 12, 2013 Kirkus Reviews Issue: March 1, 2013",
