  "description": "Jessamine Bricker has a history of succeeding even in the worst of circumstances. When her teen mother opted out of raising her, Jess’ Nana Blanche “clipped coupons like a fiend” to pay her tuition at Wren Hill Day School for Young Ladies, where blue-collar Jess rubbed elbows with Nashville’s old-money princesses. Jess went on to nurture her upper-class connections at tony Harrow University, parlaying them into a three-year stint working for one of the city’s “most feared wedding planners.” Realizing that spoiled young women with more money than sense might crave more than a single day of indulgence, she opens Bricker Consultants, helping wealthy young men create over-the-top proposals to delight their prospective brides. Working with grooms-to-be when the real clients are, of course, the brides is a tricky business that Jess handles with exceptional finesse. Still, Trenton Tillard IV provides a special challenge. Trenton’s already proposed to Diana Helston, but without the spectacle the social media influencer feels her Helston LuxeGram brand deserves. So Diana calls in Jess to guide Trenton into a more appropriate “Will you…?” Diana spirits Jess away to Golden Ash spa for a week of yoga, facials, and proposal planning. Unfortunately, the getaway also includes weird lights in the woods, corpses, and a police investigation. The silver lining is Golden Ash chef Dean Osbourne and his wonderfully quirky family, who offer Jess a tantalizing glimpse of life outside the perils of princess-pleasing.",

  "text": "BATTLE MOUNTAIN by C.J. Box ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 25, 2025 Middling for this stellar series, which makes it another must-read, preferably in one sitting. Unbeknownst to each other, Wyoming Fish and Game Warden Joe Pickett and outlaw falconer Nate Romanowski embark on equally urgent pursuits that converge in a way neither of them suspects. Nate, who’s been off the grid ever since his wife, Liv, was killed in a fire intended to kill him too in Three-Inch Teeth (2024), has sworn vengeance on murderous conspirator Axel Soledad. After shooting several of Soledad’s hirelings, he joins forces with his friend and fellow Special Forces vet Geronimo Jones, who’s tracked him down, to chase his quarry deep into the woods. Governor Spencer Rulon, meanwhile, has pressed Joe into service once again to find veteran hunting guide Spike Rankin and his new assistant, Mark Eisele, who just happens to be Rulon’s son-in-law. Although nobody’s heard from the men for two days, the governor doesn’t want his wife and daughter to know they’re missing, and that means not alerting the media or the local sheriff, who’s no fan of Rulon’s anyway. Readers who’ve already seen Rankin and Eisele overpowered and imprisoned by a mysterious crew they ran into while they were setting up for the elk hunting season will assume that Soledad is behind their kidnapping as well. But Box will keep everyone guessing about exactly how Soledad and the ragtag military cult he’s gathered around him plan to confront the military-industrial complex he’s persuaded them is a clear and present danger. You know you’re in for a wild ride when Joe, saying goodbye to Marybeth, his long-suffering wife, promises her, “I’ll do my job and not cross the line.” Middling for this stellar series, which makes it another must-read, preferably in one sitting.
