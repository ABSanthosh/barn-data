Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. Guess Who’s Back After shuttering in 2020, BookCon, the reader-focused convention originally conceived as a companion to the now-defunct BookExpo professional conference, is making a comeback. Scheduled for April 18-19, 2026 at New York’s Javits Center, the “wholly reimagined event” promises author apperances, book signings, workshops, panels, and even crafting zones aimed at “bringing our online world into a real-world space.” Details remain TBA, but I think it’s fair to assume that, given the fan-service-meets-marketing fever dream vibe of fan conventions, we’ll see a lot of BookTok faves, big-budget summer titles, photo-friendly special editions, and, yes, probably some influencer activations. What are publishers prioritizing and how do they conceptualize what readers want? Event and speaker announcements will offer an interesting glimpse. That’s Gonna Leave a Mark A round of slow claps for Katy Waldman for boldly entering the Frey (I’ll see myself out) with a review of Next to Heaven that declares “James Frey’s new cancelled-guy sex novel is as bad as it sounds.” Though Frey’s 2006 downfall was the result of fabricating parts of A Million Little Pieces, Waldman notes that “he appears to identify with the #MeToo malcontents and to have adopted the gender politics and postures of that tribe.” Charming. The plot centers on a swingers’ party among a group of people who are even more bored than they are wealthy, whom Waldman describes as “a swarm of status signifiers stuffed ungrammatically into a Burberry trench coat.” Yikes. And while she gives him credit for writing that is occasionally “endearingly excitable,” she also clocks Frey’s fondness for single-sentence paragraphs that “suggest that he’s experiencing a kind of cognitive paper jam.” The hits start coming and they don’t stop coming. Sometimes a thoroughly negative review is a real public service, and this one just might be the headline of the year. Don’t miss your chance to win a $200 Books-A-Million gift card! Enter the sweepstakes today. You can’t win if you don’t enter. Listen Up Over at The Guardian, Fiona Sturges highlights the 10 best audiobooks for summer listening, with a refreshing range of older titles, recent releases, and genre variation. I rarely revisit books, but Tom Lake and James were both stellar when I read them in print, and the possibility of experiencing them through audio performance is pretty compelling.
