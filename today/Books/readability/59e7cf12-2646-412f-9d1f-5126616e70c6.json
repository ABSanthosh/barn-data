  "text": "The opening round of the 2024 Goodreads Choice Awards started November 12th and ended November 24th. Now, the final round of voting has begun, and it runs until December 1st. The winners are announced December 5th. There are books in 15 categories to vote for: Fiction, Historical Fiction, Mystery \u0026 Thriller, Romance, Romantasy, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Horror, Debut Novel, Audiobook, Young Adult Fantasy, Young Adult Fiction, Nonfiction, Memoir, and History \u0026 Biography. The categories have changed slightly from last year: Romantasy has stuck around, but Humor has been replaced with Audiobook. The Goodreads Choice Awards is the most blatantly a popularity contest of all the year-end awards: you don’t need to have read all the books in a category to vote for the “best” one. In fact, you don’t even need to have read the book you’re voting for. Still, it makes for a good snapshot of the books getting the most attention at this point in time.",
