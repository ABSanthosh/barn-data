  "description": "The author opens the book questioning the meaning of her own life while beginning to craft her own story. The work chronicles her time as a child in South Korea, where she was born into a family with a harsh father whose income was significantly affected by the hardships of World War II and the Korean War. As a savvy college student, her older sister, Soya, helped her secure a future in New York City. When her father died and her mother sold her Korean home, her mother and her young siblings moved to Queens. After working for Lord \u0026 Taylor and Pan American, Angell met Adam, a native New Yorker, who became her husband. They resided in New York and raised their family, including the two children the couple have together, Carla and Ryan. When the children were young, the family moved to Dubai, where Adam established a law firm and the author discovered a passion for designing and building furniture. Times changed, and the family returned to New York. Angell goes beyond a typical immigration narrative and writes about what happens when immigrant families change while residing in new places (“The only option was to adapt and rediscover the meaning of self-existence with adjusted expectations”). She recounts family challenges and dramas that are somewhat universal, further building a connection with the reader. The book also offers some stunning descriptions of Korean culture, New York City, and the fondly remembered times the family spent in Dubai. While this personal narrative is intriguing, the sections set in the present detract a bit from the story—the remembrance sections work better to move the narrative forward. The book also has a great deal of summary and “telling” rather than “showing” what happened; the text lacks scenes that bring poignant events and their significant emotional impacts to life. Still, this is an enjoyable memoir that tells a story that’s both unique and universal.",

  "text": "LOVE, PAMELA by Pamela Anderson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 31, 2023 A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 33 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The iconic model tells the story of her eventful life. According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her. A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through.
