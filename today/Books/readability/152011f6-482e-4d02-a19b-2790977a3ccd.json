  "description": "Growing up in 1920s Brooklyn, Augusta Stern had two heroes. First, her father, Solomon Stern, a well-respected pharmacist. Second, her great-aunt Esther, who moved in with the Sterns after Augusta’s mother died and deals in medicinals in a less conventional way. Watching her great-aunt brewing healing concoctions in the kitchen in the middle of the night after seeing her father measuring out dosages and counseling patients in the back of his drugstore during the day, Augusta dreams of becoming a pharmacist herself. And she does just that, for decades, until a hospital employee figures out that Augusta, pushing 80, has doctored her records to show that she’s in her 60s. Forced to retire, Augusta begrudgingly moves to a retirement community in Florida, and on her first morning there runs into the last man she ever wanted to see: Irving Rivkin, her father’s former delivery boy and her first love. Irving is delighted to see Augusta, whom he lovingly/annoyingly calls by her childhood nickname, Goldie, but this feeling is certainly not mutual. The complicated history between the erstwhile lovers is slowly uncovered as Loigman alternates Augusta’s present with her past. A hefty dose of theatrics bordering on the soap-operatic frequently makes the story hard to swallow. That said, Augusta and Irving’s love story is charming without being saccharine, and Augusta’s tongue-in-cheek wit combined with her renewed hopefulness makes her the perfect unexpected heroine for new beginnings: “Oh, how she wanted to be that woman again—a woman who, yes, had suffered losses, but whose heart had not yet been broken beyond repair.”",

Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 522 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller Hoover’s (November 9, 2015, etc.) latest tackles the difficult subject of domestic violence with romantic tenderness and emotional heft. At first glance, the couple is edgy but cute: Lily Bloom runs a flower shop for people who hate flowers; Ryle Kincaid is a surgeon who says he never wants to get married or have kids. They meet on a rooftop in Boston on the night Ryle loses a patient and Lily attends her abusive father’s funeral. The provocative opening takes a dark turn when Lily receives a warning about Ryle’s intentions from his sister, who becomes Lily’s employee and close friend. Lily swears she’ll never end up in another abusive home, but when Ryle starts to show all the same warning signs that her mother ignored, Lily learns just how hard it is to say goodbye. When Ryle is not in the throes of a jealous rage, his redeeming qualities return, and Lily can justify his behavior: “I think we needed what happened on the stairwell to happen so that I would know his past and we’d be able to work on it together,” she tells herself. Lily marries Ryle hoping the good will outweigh the bad, and the mother-daughter dynamics evolve beautifully as Lily reflects on her childhood with fresh eyes. Diary entries fancifully addressed to TV host Ellen DeGeneres serve as flashbacks to Lily’s teenage years, when she met her first love, Atlas Corrigan, a homeless boy she found squatting in a neighbor’s house. When Atlas turns up in Boston, now a successful chef, he begs Lily to leave Ryle. Despite the better option right in front of her, an unexpected complication forces Lily to cut ties with Atlas, confront Ryle, and try to end the cycle of abuse before it’s too late. The relationships are portrayed with compassion and honesty, and the author’s note at the end that explains Hoover’s personal connection to the subject matter is a must-read. Packed with riveting drama and painful truths, this book powerfully illustrates the devastation of abuse—and the strength of the survivors.
