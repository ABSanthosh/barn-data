  "description": "A married man (generously called Adonis) engages in various sexual escapades with a parade of different women. Readers begin the story knowing that Adonis has died, and the author uses a variety of different formats to tell the story of his downfall. These include poetry, short prose, quotes (some of which are in French), and scripts (for both screen and stage). Each section is paired with a particular song that is meant to “run parallel to the works but not in real time, not in sync.” These songs are listed in small blocks throughout, while a separate companion book titled Crystalline Green includes a playlist with additional poems, plays, and song tracks that accompany Adonis’ journey. The songs range from mainstream (“Run This Town” by JAY-Z) to more obscure (“A Forest” by Clan of Xymox). Characters and scenarios throughout both volumes include the mundane (employees working at an office) and the fantastical (God massaging someone’s feet; the Devil surfing). Booras occasionally crafts some truly thought-provoking passages: “This is why I prefer foreplay to sex. This is why I write more than I live.” Unfortunately, there’s not a relatable character to be found; Adonis’ immaturity is downright alienating. While Thaïs, his married colleague and “true love” is in the hospital, for example, Adonis explains that he cheated on her because, “You were sick.” Intense eroticism (“I penetrate myself / so I may feel what you feel”) alternates with performative introspection (“Have I not invented this pain? / This cock that bends / toward sadness / like a flower made heavy by rain?”). This results in a text that’s essentially an overblown ode to maleness. The experimental form is unique—but, like its main character, the book does little to endear itself to readers.",

  "text": "THE ALCHEMIST by Paulo Coelho \u0026 translated by Margaret Jull Costa ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 1, 1993 Coelho's placebo has racked up impressive sales in Brazil and Europe. Americans should flock to it like gulls. Coelho is a Brazilian writer with four books to his credit. Following Diary of a Magus (1992—not reviewed) came this book, published in Brazil in 1988: it's an interdenominational, transcendental, inspirational fable—in other words, a bag of wind.   The story is about a youth empowered to follow his dream. Santiago is an Andalusian shepherd boy who learns through a dream of a treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. An old man, the king of Salem, the first of various spiritual guides, tells the boy that he has discovered his destiny: \"to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.\" So Santiago sells his sheep, sails to Tangier, is tricked out of his money, regains it through hard work, crosses the desert with a caravan, stops at an oasis long enough to fall in love, escapes from warring tribesmen by performing a miracle, reaches the pyramids, and eventually gets both the gold and the girl. Along the way he meets an Englishman who describes the Soul of the World; the desert woman Fatima, who teaches him the Language of the World; and an alchemist who says, \"Listen to your heart\" A message clings like ivy to every encounter; everyone, but everyone, has to put in their two cents' worth, from the crystal merchant to the camel driver (\"concentrate always on the present, you'll be a happy man\"). The absence of characterization and overall blandness suggest authorship by a committee of self-improvement pundits—a far cry from Saint- Exupery's The Little Prince: that flagship of the genre was a genuine charmer because it clearly derived from a quirky, individual sensibility.   Coelho's placebo has racked up impressive sales in Brazil and Europe.
