  "description": "After his brush with death, Charlie Cantling hires Benjamin Gould, an agent of the powerful Byrne and Company, to investigate what happened and uncover the truth. The Goulds, it turns out, have a long history with the Cantlings; Benjamin spent summers at the Cantlings’ house as a youth, so he’s naturally wary when Charlie asks him to investigate whether his wife and adult children were responsible for the attempt on his life. The culprit could be Charlie’s daughter Melanie, who makes clear that she’s willing to use illegal substances for her own gain, or it might be his son, Theo, whose erratic behavior makes his motivations very difficult to read. Maybe it’s daughter Ann, for whom both Benjamin and his brother, Jody, have complex feelings. However, Benjamin eventually learns that the already-thorny situation is even more complex than he thought. As Jody notes to Benjamin early on, “You might have had a scholarship to Yale, but you don’t know shit about Charlie Cantling.” Orr’s novel relies heavily on maintaining a mysterious atmosphere and nearly everyone is a suspect to some degree; Benjamin quickly finds that everyone has their guards up, and for very good reason. The stakes in this story involve inheritance money, of course, but also who gets to control the next generation of the Cantling legacy. As things clarify over the course of this exciting tale, however, astute readers get opportunities to pick up on oddities that will unlock the mystery. Some of these readers, though, may find the ending to be somewhat contrived; in its attempts to surprise, the narrative finally falls into familiar tropes and patterns, employing obvious red herrings and foreshadowing.",

  "text": "TO DIE FOR by David Baldacci ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 12, 2024 Fast-moving excitement with a satisfying finish. The feds must protect an accused criminal and an orphaned girl. Maybe you’ve met him before as protagonist of The 6:20 Man (2022): Ex-Army Ranger Travis Devine, who’d had the dubious fortune to tangle with “the girl on the train,” is now assigned by his homeland security boss to protect Danny Glass, who's awaiting trial on multiple RICO charges in Washington state. Devine has what it takes: He “was a closer, snooper, fixer, investigator,” and, when necessary, a killer. These skills are on full display as the deaths of three key witnesses grind justice to a temporary halt. Glass has a 12-year-old niece, Betsy Odom, and each is the other’s only living relative—her parents recently died of an apparent drug overdose. The FBI has temporary guardianship of Betsy, who's a handful. She tells Travis that though she’s not yet 13, she's 28 in “life-shit years.” The financially well-heeled Glass wants to be her legal guardian with an eye to eventual adoption, but what are his real motives? And what happens to her if he's convicted? Meanwhile, Betsy insists that her parents never touched drugs, and she begs Travis to find out how they really died. This becomes part of a mission that oozes danger. The small town of Ricketts has a woman mayor who’s full of charm on the surface, but deeply corrupt and deadly when crossed. She may be linked to a subversive group called \"12/24/65,\" as in 1865, when the Ku Klux Klan beast was born. Blood flows, bombs explode, and people perish, both good guys and not-so-good guys. Readers might ponder why in fiction as well as in life, it sometimes seems necessary for many to die so one may live. And what about the girl on the train? She's not necessary to the plot, but she's a fun addition as she pops in and out of the pages, occasionally leaving notes for Travis. Maybe she still wants him dead.  Fast-moving excitement with a satisfying finish.
