  "description": "First published in France, this graphic version of Karr’s 1998 novel retains both the plot and the big, openhearted spirit of the original. The cleanly drawn art adds evocative glimpses of wide prairies and close-up views of vividly expressive faces. After learning that turkeys on sale for 25 cents in Missouri go for five dollars 800 miles away in Denver, Simon Green borrows the money for a substantial flock from his wise and encouraging schoolteacher and boldly sets out. Memorable as the premise is, the cast is even more so, led by a lad who never did well in school but nonetheless proves resourceful enough to cope with rustlers (including his own ne’er-do-well father!) on top of daunting natural hazards. Simon’s joined by two strong, resilient young women—Lizzie Hardwick, who’s just buried her entire family, and Jo Ballou, who’s escaping slavery—both of whom make active contributions to the enterprise’s eventual success. Most characters present white, though Jo is Black; they encounter a group of Pottawattomie who offer them guidance, along with a squad of bored, trigger-happy soldiers.",
