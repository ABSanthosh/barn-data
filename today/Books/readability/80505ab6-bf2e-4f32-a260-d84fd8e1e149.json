  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Bluff? Most people can relate to having an issue in their neighborhood that causes conflict and turmoil, and many communities are dealing with the impact of eroding shorelines. A friend of mine had this happen to her home and I thought it would be an interesting backdrop for a murder mystery. Then I added in a toxic marriage to make the stakes higher, which was purely fiction, so the protagonist would be desperate to leave. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Bluff, what would they be? “Fight Song” by Rachel Patten. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite genre to read is mystery and thriller, mostly psychological thrillers, but I enjoy the occasional rom-com or women’s fiction, like a Taylor Jenkins Reid novel. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I am judging the Best Thriller contest for International Thriller Writers, so I have a TBR list that is piled very high! Because I’m assigned the books, until February, I don’t have much time for anything else. Let’s just say I’m reading the best of the best in my genre. Damn, these writers are good! What scene in your book was your favorite to write? There’s a scene where Kate wakes up at the edge of the bluff in her nightgown in the drizzling rain, unsure of how she got there. Turns out, she was a sleepwalker as a kid, and it started up again. I thought, what could I possibly do to make her situation more treacherous? And the sleepwalking came to me. It’s a fun scene, gothic and visceral. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I like to write in the dark, when everyone in my house is asleep. It’s when the stories and scenes come to me. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Carpe Diem. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? If you think you see the warning signs of a toxic relationship, get help. Don’t doubt yourself or think you are reading too much into it, because it usually starts slowly. Trust your own judgement, and if something feels off, take action. Tell a friend or family member.
