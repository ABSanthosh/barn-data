A year ago, I tier ranked all the sapphic books I’ve read, back when Our Queerest Shelves was on Substack. Since it’s no longer accessible, I thought I’d repost it and add in the dozen or so sapphic fantasy books I’ve read since then. So, here’s the updated version! Before I started writing Our Queerest Shelves — before Book Riot’s first post, even — I have been devouring sapphic books and reviewing them on my blog, the Lesbrary. In those 15 (!) years, I’ve read a lot of queer women books. So, I thought I’d try tier ranking all the sapphic books I’ve read by genre, starting with fantasy. This includes middle grade, YA, and adult fantasy, as well as fantasy graphic novels. A few disclaimers before I start: this is just my personal opinion. Plenty of my “No thank you” books are ones other people love. They just aren’t my taste. I’ll also note that these are my thoughts about these books right now. Some of them I might have loved right after reading them, but I no longer remember anything about them. Others I may have struggled to get through, but I still think about and appreciate them now. Also, when I say “sapphic,” I mean any book with a sapphic main character, so not all of these have an F/F romance. Enough preamble! Here is my ultimate ranking of all the sapphic fantasy books I’ve ever read: Exclusive content for All Access members continues below.
