Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. The Kids Are All Right Elizabeth Foster is one of the three student activists featured in the new documentary Banned Together, which captures the aftermath of a 2022 book ban in Beaufort, SC and the greater context of book banning efforts nationwide. In a terrific new piece for Teen Vogue, Foster recounts how she fought censorship in her hometown, and won. She and her fellow student activists get it. The book-banning movement is about something so much bigger than books. The same movement started by attacking Critical Race Theory as a proxy for targeting Black and brown students. Queer and transgender students — like my own brother — were added to the list of demonized identities as far-right extremists came after their stories in schools and libraries. And now the Trump administration is coming after higher education by utilizing unconstitutional fear tactics to dismantle DEI programs and deport international students who challenge its policy positions. I had a chance to see Banned Together recently before interviewing the producers for the Book Riot Podcast, and I can’t recommend it highly enough. May these bold young people’s efforts succeed. Everything You Need to Know About Emily Henry It feels like there are really just two seasons in publishing these days: Emily Henry is about to have a book out, and Emily Henry just put a book out. In the run-up to her latest, Great Big Beautiful Life, which hits shelves next week, the New York Times offers a TL;DR guide to the reigning queen of rom-coms. If you’ve been watching the phenomenon from the sidelines and wondering what the big deal is or whether the books might up your alley, this should do the trick.
