  "description": "Atara wears a crown everywhere she goes—in fact, her name even means crown. One day, her mom reads her a book about Purim, and Atara sees herself in Queen Esther; while Esther hid her Jewish identity, for a long time Atara never told her parents she was really a girl. Just as Esther’s crown made it clear that she was a queen, Atara’s crown gives her a sense of assurance about her identity. In drama class, Atara is even cast as Queen Esther in the Purim play. The show is a hit. But when Atara forgets her crown at home the next day, she must summon her inner confidence. The book’s full-color, pastel illustrations are reminiscent of newspaper comic strips, with rounded, squiggly lines. The dyslexia-friendly text appears separately from the images. Though the writing is purposeful and at times clunky, it’s wonderful to see a Purim story that centers a trans protagonist; many young people will identify with both Atara and Esther. The book has no endnotes about the holiday, so adults may want to pair this offering with an informational text. Atara and her mom have tan complexions and curly brown hair. Queen Esther has brown skin; the Persian King Ahasuerus is light-skinned.",

  "text": "CARPENTER'S HELPER by Sybil Rosen ; illustrated by Camille Garoche ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 16, 2021 Renata’s wren encounter proves magical, one most children could only wish to experience outside of this lovely story. A home-renovation project is interrupted by a family of wrens, allowing a young girl an up-close glimpse of nature. Renata and her father enjoy working on upgrading their bathroom, installing a clawfoot bathtub, and cutting a space for a new window. One warm night, after Papi leaves the window space open, two wrens begin making a nest in the bathroom. Rather than seeing it as an unfortunate delay of their project, Renata and Papi decide to let the avian carpenters continue their work. Renata witnesses the birth of four chicks as their rosy eggs split open “like coats that are suddenly too small.” Renata finds at a crucial moment that she can help the chicks learn to fly, even with the bittersweet knowledge that it will only hasten their exits from her life. Rosen uses lively language and well-chosen details to move the story of the baby birds forward. The text suggests the strong bond built by this Afro-Latinx father and daughter with their ongoing project without needing to point it out explicitly, a light touch in a picture book full of delicate, well-drawn moments and precise wording. Garoche’s drawings are impressively detailed, from the nest’s many small bits to the developing first feathers on the chicks and the wall smudges and exposed wiring of the renovation.
