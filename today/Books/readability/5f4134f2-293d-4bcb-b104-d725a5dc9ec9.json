  "description": "As is true for any new parent, Brown’s life changed immensely with the birth of her first child, Lily.She initially found it hard to maintain routines that had once been easy, but the adjustment period seemed to be going as expected. Then she received an unexpected call from her doctor, reporting that her baby had tested positive for the genetic disorder phenylketonuria, which prevents the breakdown of a particular amino acid, which, in turn, results in developmental disabilities and seizures. It’s a disorder that usually appears in one in 10,000 births in the United States, and according to the author’s calculations, the likelihood of a geneticist, like her, having a baby with this rare genetic disorder is about one in 100 million. In the wake of this revelation, Brown reflected on her life leading up to that moment, processing her complex feelings on reproductive procedures, as well as grief, acceptance, sadness, and joy. This work balances a compelling mix of personal experience, emotional exploration, and scientific knowledge. Although the book initially follows the thread of Brown’s memories, it’s effectively expanded by her research. For example, her discussions of fertility and pregnancy are initially introduced due to their connection to the author’s personal experience, but the multifaceted sections grow until they’re informative essays, revealing, in great depth, the broader implications of these topics and how they touch the lives of many others. Amid specific, practical discussions of caring for children with PKU, for example, she tells stories of many others, including famous names such as Nobel Prize–winner Pearl S. Buck and entertainer Dale Evans, who were also mothers of children with genetic disorders. Frequently, the book refreshingly reminds readers how all lives are intertwined.",

  "text": "THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY MOVING THROUGH GRIEF WITH GRIT, GRACE, AND GRATITUDE by Nicole Avant ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 17, 2023 Some of Avant’s mantras are overstated, but her book is magnanimous, inspiring, and relentlessly optimistic. Memories and life lessons inspired by the author’s mother, who was murdered in 2021. “Neither my mother nor I knew that her last text to me would be the words ‘Think you’ll be happy,’ ” Avant writes, \"but it is fitting that she left me with a mantra for resiliency.” The author, a filmmaker and former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas, begins her first book on the night she learned her mother, Jacqueline Avant, had been fatally shot during a home invasion. “One of my first thoughts,” she writes, “was, ‘Oh God, please don’t let me hate this man. Give me the strength not to hate him.’ ” Daughter of Clarence Avant, known as the “Black Godfather” due to his work as a pioneering music executive, the author describes growing up “in a house that had a revolving door of famous people,” from Ella Fitzgerald to Muhammad Ali. “I don’t take for granted anything I have achieved in my life as a Black American woman,” writes Avant. “And I recognize my unique upbringing…..I was taught to honor our past and pay forward our fruits.” The book, which is occasionally repetitive, includes tributes to her mother from figures like Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton, but the narrative core is the author’s direct, faith-based, unwaveringly positive messages to readers—e.g., “I don’t want to carry the sadness and anger I have toward the man who did this to my mother…so I’m worshiping God amid the worst storm imaginable”; \"Success and feeling good are contagious. I’m all about positive contagious vibrations!” Avant frequently quotes Bible verses, and the bulk of the text reflects the spirit of her daily prayer “that everything is in divine order.” Imploring readers to practice proactive behavior, she writes, “We have to always find the blessing, to be the blessing.” Some of Avant’s mantras are overstated, but her book is magnanimous, inspiring, and relentlessly optimistic.
