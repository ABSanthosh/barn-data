  "description": "In a distant-future Australia, Ferren has led the human Residuals in resisting the Humen, powerful artificial beings that have been taking unwitting Residuals into their military service. Now the Humen prepare to face off against the hosts of Heaven, a fight that Ferren and others anticipate will end in the Humen’s defeat. It seems the Humen have a new leader: an “evil angel” who zips across the sky in a flying ship. Hoping to align themselves with God’s messengers, the Residuals turn to Miriael, a warrior angel “shot down” from Heaven who’s now essentially a hybrid, part-spiritual and part-physical. If she can convince Heaven’s forces to join with humans (“What’s stopping Heaven saying yes to an alliance? Why are they taking so long about it?”), then maybe they can take down the Humen once and for all. Harland focuses this final installment of his fantasy series on action. The set pieces are memorable—Miriael, along with Ferren’s sister Shanna, witness angels and Humen clash; myriad Residuals flee their enemy in the midst of an intense hailstorm; and the lengthy, riveting climax is searing. While the text includes occasional recaps covering prior volumes, the appreciation of some character dynamics relies heavily on readers’ knowledge of the earlier books. Plenty of story unfolds in this novel, however, as one character’s demand to oversee the Residuals’ assembly sparks contempt and another’s subdued romantic feelings beget petty jealousy. Tension steadily builds as the Humen work on an “unimaginably huge construction” for a purpose not immediately apparent. The author rounds out this brisk finale with appearances from archangels, Miriael’s “visionary dreams,” and a wholly satisfying wrap-up.",

  "text": "IF ONLY I HAD TOLD HER by Laura Nowlin ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 6, 2024 A heavy read about the harsh realities of tragedy and their effects on those left behind. In this companion novel to 2013’s If He Had Been With Me, three characters tell their sides of the story. Finn’s narrative starts three days before his death. He explores the progress of his unrequited love for best friend Autumn up until the day he finally expresses his feelings. Finn’s story ends with his tragic death, which leaves his close friends devastated, unmoored, and uncertain how to go on. Jack’s section follows, offering a heartbreaking look at what it’s like to live with grief. Jack works to overcome the anger he feels toward Sylvie, the girlfriend Finn was breaking up with when he died, and Autumn, the girl he was preparing to build his life around (but whom Jack believed wasn’t good enough for Finn). But when Jack sees how Autumn’s grief matches his own, it changes their understanding of one another. Autumn’s chapters trace her life without Finn as readers follow her struggles with mental health and balancing love and loss. Those who have read the earlier book will better connect with and feel for these characters, particularly since they’ll have a more well-rounded impression of Finn. The pain and anger is well written, and the novel highlights the most troublesome aspects of young adulthood: overconfidence sprinkled with heavy insecurities, fear-fueled decisions, bad communication, and brash judgments. Characters are cued white. A heavy read about the harsh realities of tragedy and their effects on those left behind.
