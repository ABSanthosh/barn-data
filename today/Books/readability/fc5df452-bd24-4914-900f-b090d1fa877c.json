  "description": "After Ellis’ best friend, Lora, disappears from Clearwood Home for Orphans, the only clue is Lora’s bookmark, upon which she’d written the phrase “The Forests of the Night.” Soon after, Ellis is assigned as guardian to new resident Pip, who doesn’t speak. Both girls feel a strong connection to the massive Ghost Tree—the fossilized remains of the only tree that didn’t rot away in the Blight. Ellis even hears the tree talking to her. After she and Pip see a huge, birdlike creature pecking at the tree, the girls are sent away to a summer camp, where kids are forced to mine an energy source that powers evil scientist Mother Dear’s creations. Dealing in “bio-hybridization, paleo-genetics, robotics, [and] artificial intelligence” as part of her plan to rule the world by replacing nature, Mother Dear must destroy the last natural space on Earth: the forests of the night. If Ellis and Pip can’t get there first, all will be lost, but luckily, they have the Ghost Tree on their side. The book’s very slow first half lays a minimal foundation for the book’s overall mystery. Persistent readers may feel rewarded in the second half, which features more clarity and exciting plot elements. Ellis has little agency throughout, mostly doing as she’s told, which makes for a largely unengaging narrative. Most characters are cued white.",

  "text": "BEYOND MULBERRY GLEN by Millie Florence ; illustrated by Astrid Sheckels ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 7, 2025 An absorbing fantasy centered on a resilient female protagonist facing growth, change, and self-empowerment. Awards \u0026 Accolades Our Verdict GET IT In Florence’s middle-grade fantasy novel, a young girl’s heart is tested in the face of an evil, spreading Darkness. Eleven-year-old Lydia, “freckle-cheeked and round-eyed, with hair the color of pine bark and fair skin,” is struggling with the knowledge that she has reached the age to apprentice as an herbalist. Lydia is reluctant to leave her beloved, magical Mulberry Glen and her cozy Housetree in the woods—she’ll miss Garder, the Glen’s respected philosopher; her fairy guardian Pit; her human friend Livy; and even the mischievous part-elf, part-imp, part-human twins Zale and Zamilla. But the twins go missing after hearing of a soul-sapping Darkness that has swallowed a forest and is creeping into minds and engulfing entire towns. They have secretly left to find a rare fruit that, it is said, will stop the Darkness if thrown into the heart of the mountain that rises out of the lethal forest. Lydia follows, determined to find the twins before they, too, fall victim to the Darkness. During her journey, accompanied by new friends, she gradually realizes that she herself has a dangerous role to play in the quest to stop the Darkness. In this well-crafted fantasy, Florence skillfully equates the physical manifestation of Darkness with the feelings of insecurity and powerlessness that Lydia first struggles with when thinking of leaving the Glen. Such negative thoughts grow more intrusive the closer she and her friends come to the Darkness—and to Lydia’s ultimate, powerfully rendered test of character, which leads to a satisfyingly realistic, not quite happily-ever-after ending. Highlights include a delightfully haunting, reality-shifting library and a deft sprinkling of Latin throughout the text; Pit’s pet name for Lydia is mea flosculus (“my little flower”). Fine-lined ink drawings introducing each chapter add a pleasing visual element to this well-grounded fairy tale. An absorbing fantasy centered on a resilient female protagonist facing growth, change, and self-empowerment.
