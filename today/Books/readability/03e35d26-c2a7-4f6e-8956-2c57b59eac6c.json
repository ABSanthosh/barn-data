I have to admit that we’re a week into the second Trump presidency and I already feel overwhelmed. Let me bring you behind the curtain a bit: this is the place where I usually do paid subscriber-exclusive content for the Our Queerest Shelves newsletter. But all I can think about is the transphobia that this administration has already been spouting, and my heart is breaking for everyone affected. I want to promote queer books more than ever, especially trans and nonbinary books, but it feels wrong to put anything about them behind a paywall. And at the same time, this newsletter depends on paid subscribers. I can’t ignore that if I want Our Queerest Shelves to continue.I don’t know what to do in the next four years. But here’s the messy compromise I’m doing today. I’m going to tell you five of my favorite books by nonbinary authors, which are also each about nonbinary people. Then, behind the paywall, I’ll tell you about why I liked them so much. That way, if you’re not a paid subscriber, you can still look them up. These are just a few of my favorite nonbinary books. There are so many incredible books out there by and about nonbinary people that explore that galaxy of constellations that gender can be—because I don’t need to tell you that there are more than two genders, despite what any bigots in power may claim. These range from nonfiction about gender to a cozy magical YA novel set at a bakery to a harrowing horror novel.All Access members can read on for more about each of these.
