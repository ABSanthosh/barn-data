  "text": "09 Oct 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Luck and Love in 1902? The idea for the story began twenty two years ago when I learned of the 100th anniversay of the eruption of Mount Pelee in Saint-Pierre Martinique, which, in two minutes, killed 30,000 people. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Luck and Love in 1902, what would they be? Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On”. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite reading genre is historical fiction, which has spurred me to write this historical romance. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Sheltering Angel: A Novel Based on a true story of the Titanic by Louella Bryant, and Daughters of the Resistance by Lana Kortchik. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Their escape from Saint-Pierre. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I simply become somewhat possessed and determined to write what I’m feeling. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I have two: “Information does not travel in a straight line” and “Nothing will ever be accomplished if all objections must first be overcome”. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? When one door closes, another door opens.
