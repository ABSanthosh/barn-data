  "text": "20 Nov 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write The Scarlet D? After writing my last book, Long Enough to Love You, I received much feedback that older, more mature women are underrepresented in romance. The story of second chances later in life seems rarely written about. The Scarlet D is a story of second chances in life and love. But Scarlet is a little different. She is the anti-woman scorned, which flies in the face of what we often believe about women and divorce. I like writing about strong women who defy societal stereotypes and attempt to move forward with conviction. It’s sometimes messy, but it’s real. As someone who went through a divorce, I like having that voice and perspective. And this is a much lighter story than the last one. It was a lot of fun to write. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Scarlet D, what would they be? I have two original songs for this book! Thanks to the magic of AI, I input the two parts of this book, which were meant to be songs, Stuck and Shattered Pieces, and created music. They’re on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/kirsten-pursell  What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Historical fiction is my favorite genre to read. I love it when authors have the creative license to use history as a backdrop for their storytelling. I plan to write in that genre one of these days. And, of course, I love a good romance. What books are on your TBR pile right now? My TBR pile includes The Women by Kristin Hannah and Tom Lake by Ann Patchett. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I had so much fun writing this book. It’s hard to pick just one scene. I loved how Scarlet’s friendship with Missy evolved. Their interactions were fun and authentic. But the fundraiser event was a beautiful moment but also potentially catastrophic. Balancing that was fun. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I do not. I have few habits when it comes to writing. No rituals. I will send myself emails if inspiration strikes when I’m away from my computer. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Be true to yourself by being unapologetically you. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I want readers to walk away cheering for love and second chances, regardless of age. Being open to possibility even when you’re older is a gift. Ultimately, I hope readers will enjoy the story for what it is: a story.
