  "description": "At the age of 19, the author took a job as a dental assistant to the man who would become her romantic partner. Robert, or “Tosh”—the name he would take when he became a disciple of Rajneesh—was 27 and married, with a young daughter. Still, the two soon became lovers, until Rudell realized Tosh had no plans to leave his wife. Deciding to move on, she married another man and had a son, Gavin. But that marriage broke up, and four years after first meeting him, Rudell went back to work with Tosh, who was now separated from his wife. She and Tosh were kindred souls, both seeking a higher spirituality. In 1981, when Tosh was invited to be the dentist for a new commune called Rajneeshpuram, established in the Oregon desert, they joined the leader Bhagwan’s followers. They remained for several years, until Bhagwan was arrested and deported to India. In 1988, now married, the couple left the cult and moved to Kauai, where an old sailing vessel, the Elixir, awaited them (“she was the biggest boat in the yard and in far worse shape than the photos we’d seen”). Their goal was to rebuild the boat over a six-month period; the project took five years. Rudell uses the years in Kauai as the geographical anchor for a complex memoir that shifts back and forth through time. As the author works on the boat, she ruminates on the commune, sharing an uncensored, visceral portrait of life within the cult—the good, the bad, and the very ugly. The narrative is also a detailed account of boat restoration, full of minutia about refurbishing every piece of wood, sail, line, and piece of brass; these segments are both compelling and exhausting. Most riveting are the sections recounting the perilous journey across the Pacific as the crew navigated the Elixir through storms and roiling seas, with Tosh deathly seasick throughout the entire voyage.",

  "text": "LOVE, PAMELA by Pamela Anderson ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 31, 2023 A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 40 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The iconic model tells the story of her eventful life. According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her. A juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through.
