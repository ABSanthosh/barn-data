  "description": "After being charged with assault for breaking the nose of his high school’s bullying star quarterback with a soda can, Sam is remanded to a juvenile holding facility. He’s initially outraged to be assigned Anne of Green Gables as required reading by Mrs. Martinez, his teacher at the facility, which is nicknamed Blue Gables for the color of its roof. Still, he knows that being his best self for the six weeks until his court date can help him avoid serious legal consequences, so he reluctantly starts reading. In its pages, Sam finds another strong-willed, misunderstood young person who aches for a stable home—and shares his red hair. With gentle prodding from supportive adults and a perceptive roommate, he also catches glimmers, through Anne’s resilience and persistence, of a better way forward. Walters acknowledges his intent to pay homage to a novel that has “transcended countries, cultures, time, and place,” and he slips quotes from L.M. Montgomery’s original into his narrative. The conclusion feels true to the original classic’s spirit more than this story’s relatively gritty events or tone but nonetheless delivers the tough, vulnerable protagonist to a sweet but unlikely fate that most readers will find thoroughly well deserved and satisfying.",

  "text": "THE SCHOOL FOR GOOD AND EVIL From the School for Good and Evil series , Vol. 1 by Soman Chainani ; illustrated by Iacopo Bruno ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 14, 2013 Rich and strange (and kitted out with an eye-catching cover), but stronger in the set pieces than the internal logic. Chainani works an elaborate sea change akin to Gregory Maguire’s Wicked (1995), though he leaves the waters muddied. Every four years, two children, one regarded as particularly nice and the other particularly nasty, are snatched from the village of Gavaldon by the shadowy School Master to attend the divided titular school. Those who survive to graduate become major or minor characters in fairy tales. When it happens to sweet, Disney princess–like Sophie and  her friend Agatha, plain of features, sour of disposition and low of self-esteem, they are both horrified to discover that they’ve been dropped not where they expect but at Evil and at Good respectively. Gradually—too gradually, as the author strings out hundreds of pages of Hogwarts-style pranks, classroom mishaps and competitions both academic and romantic—it becomes clear that the placement wasn’t a mistake at all. Growing into their true natures amid revelations and marked physical changes, the two spark escalating rivalry between the wings of the school. This leads up to a vicious climactic fight that sees Good and Evil repeatedly switching sides. At this point, readers are likely to feel suddenly left behind, as, thanks to summary deus ex machina resolutions, everything turns out swell(ish). Rich and strange (and kitted out with an eye-catching cover), but stronger in the set pieces than the internal logic.
