  "description": "The orphaned Malcolm lives in Mrs. McCardle’s Home for Children and is apprenticed to Jack Alexander, a clockmaker and inventor. Malcolm’s good friends with Jack’s son, Peter, and is a regular visitor to the Alexander home, where Peter’s aunt also lives. The novel unfolds around two intertwining and mysterious misfortunes that strike the family: a strange illness that Peter succumbs to, followed by Jack’s murder. Mahoney explores the world of Edinburgh’s first generation of female physicians through the character of Dr. Fiona MacIsaac, who plays a prominent role in Peter’s care and is present when Malcolm discovers Jack’s body in a locked church tower. When Malcolm takes up Jack’s interrupted quest to help Peter, Dr. MacIsaac provides a crucial piece of the puzzle—an item that may lead to a healing serum. Malcolm’s sleuthing leads him all over the city and offers insights into the fascinating and intricate worlds of early-20th-century medicine and clockmaking. This mystery, which features a white-presenting cast, will appeal to readers who enjoy historical settings, intriguing puzzles, and some element of danger. The author brings to life the richly evoked Edinburgh through descriptive writing as well as its residents’ speech patterns.",

  "text": "HOW TO SPEAK DOLPHIN by Ginny Rorby ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 26, 2015 Dolphin lovers will appreciate this look at our complicated relationship with these marine mammals. Is dolphin-assisted therapy so beneficial to patients that it’s worth keeping a wild dolphin captive? Twelve-year-old Lily has lived with her emotionally distant oncologist stepfather and a succession of nannies since her mother died in a car accident two years ago. Nannies leave because of the difficulty of caring for Adam, Lily’s severely autistic 4-year-old half brother. The newest, Suzanne, seems promising, but Lily is tired of feeling like a planet orbiting the sun Adam. When she meets blind Zoe, who will attend the same private middle school as Lily in the fall, Lily’s happy to have a friend. However, Zoe’s take on the plight of the captive dolphin, Nori, used in Adam’s therapy opens Lily’s eyes. She knows she must use her influence over her stepfather, who is consulting on Nori’s treatment for cancer (caused by an oil spill), to free the animal. Lily’s got several fine lines to walk, as she works to hold onto her new friend, convince her stepfather of the rightness of releasing Nori, and do what’s best for Adam. In her newest exploration of animal-human relationships, Rorby’s lonely, mature heroine faces tough but realistic situations. Siblings of children on the spectrum will identify with Lily. If the tale flirts with sentimentality and some of the characters are strident in their views, the whole never feels maudlin or didactic. Dolphin lovers will appreciate this look at our complicated relationship with these marine mammals.
