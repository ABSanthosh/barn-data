  "description": "“Peering down / on the beings below,” Boxer writes anthropomorphically, a pine cone hangs for 40 years out of harm’s way, until a wildfire’s heat melts the resin that glues it together, and seeds are released to shower down to the ash-covered ground. “It wasn’t an end,” she concludes. “From the fire, / life / unfolds. / Green / and new / and ready / to begin.” As she explains in a reflective afterword, lodgepole pines are just one of several fire-dependent types of flora and fauna, reminding readers that we find our strength through adversity; like that pine cone, “we might find we were made for this very moment.” In the illustrations, small woodland creatures nest in branches or browse beneath them until a red tide of flames sweeps in. A season or so later, the ground is green again, and in a final scene, the smiling animals are back, going about their business amid piney seedlings. As a very basic introduction to serotinous trees (that is, those that can delay reproducing until certain specified conditions are met), this will do. But she uses the term serotinous without fully defining it; to judge from that rather oblique closing note, the author seems to have something more metaphorical in mind anyway. Even older audiences may be left wondering just what “moment” she means, though.",

  "text": "A PLACE FOR RAIN by Michelle Schaub ; illustrated by Blanca Gómez ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 12, 2024 Enticing and eco-friendly. Why and how to make a rain garden. Having watched through their classroom window as a “rooftop-rushing, gutter-gushing” downpour sloppily flooded their streets and playground, several racially diverse young children follow their tan-skinned teacher outside to lay out a shallow drainage ditch beneath their school’s downspout, which leads to a patch of ground, where they plant flowers (“native ones with tough, thick roots,” Schaub specifies) to absorb the “mucky runoff” and, in time, draw butterflies and other wildlife. The author follows up her lilting rhyme with more detailed explanations of a rain garden’s function and construction, including a chart to help determine how deep to make the rain garden and a properly cautionary note about locating a site’s buried utility lines before starting to dig; she concludes with a set of leads to online information sources. Gómez goes more for visual appeal than realism. In her scenes, a group of smiling, round-headed, very small children in rain gear industriously lay large stones along a winding border with little apparent effort; nevertheless, her images of the little ones planting generic flowers that are tall and lush just a page turn later do make the outdoorsy project look like fun.
