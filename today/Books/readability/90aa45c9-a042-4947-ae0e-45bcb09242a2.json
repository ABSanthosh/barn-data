  "description": "The story of the main character, Susan, begins before she is born. Susan, as a soul (with the name of Soonam), makes the decision to incarnate on Earth. Her arrival occurs in 1947. Even though this is a choice on her part, she often wonders as a child what exactly she’s doing on the planet. By 1969, she’s married and living in Japan. A few years later, she’s divorced and residing in New York City, where she digs into topics such as the unconscious and God energy. These subjects lead her to the eminent psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Jung’s work will play a major role in her life. The narrative follows Susan over the decades as she spends time in different relationships, earns a Ph.D. in psychology, and adopts a daughter named Charlotte. Throughout it all, the author examines concepts such as intuition and astral projection, which she further develops for readers with suggested exercises. For instance, if they want to enlist the help of their unconscious, they can focus on a “spontaneous fantasy” and observe it closely. As Susan navigates both the changing times and “the ego’s willfulness,” she has much to uncover. The excavating isn’t always easy; at one point, she reflects how, at the end of a relationship, she wishes she could receive a refund for the last 10 years. Plunket’s story skillfully illustrates how humans are “complicated beings with a lot going on.” Much of the tale’s appeal comes from seeing how Susan deals with this complexity during her wide-ranging spiritual odyssey. But the ambitious memoir can be dry at times. Assertions such as “Joy is the state of mind which creates the frequency to allow your desires to manifest” tend to be clunky rather than revelatory. Still, Plunket does a fine job of balancing Susan’s practical world and the dreamier aspects of her existence.",

  "text": "GREENLIGHTS by Matthew McConaughey ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 20, 2020 A conversational, pleasurable look into McConaughey’s life and thought. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 28 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller All right, all right, all right: The affable, laconic actor delivers a combination of memoir and self-help book. “This is an approach book,” writes McConaughey, adding that it contains “philosophies that can be objectively understood, and if you choose, subjectively adopted, by either changing your reality, or changing how you see it. This is a playbook, based on adventures in my life.” Some of those philosophies come in the form of apothegms: “When you can design your own weather, blow in the breeze”; “Simplify, focus, conserve to liberate.” Others come in the form of sometimes rambling stories that never take the shortest route from point A to point B, as when he recounts a dream-spurred, challenging visit to the Malian musician Ali Farka Touré, who offered a significant lesson in how disagreement can be expressed politely and without rancor. Fans of McConaughey will enjoy his memories—which line up squarely with other accounts in Melissa Maerz’s recent oral history, Alright, Alright, Alright—of his debut in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused, to which he contributed not just that signature phrase, but also a kind of too-cool-for-school hipness that dissolves a bit upon realizing that he’s an older guy on the prowl for teenage girls. McConaughey’s prep to settle into the role of Wooderson involved inhabiting the mind of a dude who digs cars, rock ’n’ roll, and “chicks,” and he ran with it, reminding readers that the film originally had only three scripted scenes for his character. The lesson: “Do one thing well, then another. Once, then once more.” It’s clear that the author is a thoughtful man, even an intellectual of sorts, though without the earnestness of Ethan Hawke or James Franco. Though some of the sentiments are greeting card–ish, this book is entertaining and full of good lessons. A conversational, pleasurable look into McConaughey’s life and thought.
