  "description": "Kinsey’s taut novel tells a straightforward story, but it’s the voice that stands out most. The note of regret its narrator takes when recalling a woman named Asha hints that the story we’re about to hear won’t be a happy one. “I was afraid if I thought about her, her voice would wake up on the inside of my mind,” the narrator declares—but soon enough he begins to tell the story of how he and Asha fell in love. At the time the book opens, the protagonist is 29 and has been working in tree removal for the last 11 years. He’s immediately taken when he meets Asha, who would like to become a therapist one day and has a penchant for belly dancing. Before long, the couple is expecting a child, and much of the book covers how these two fiercely independent people reckon with impending parenthood. There’s an immediacy to Kinsey’s prose that makes scenes like one of the narrator and Asha trying to catch a gar stand out. But there are hints of something bleaker below the surface: The narrator’s temper flares up at times, and he misgenders his opponent after an arm-wrestling match. Asha and the narrator’s child dies in the womb, which leads both of them into deep depression. “I was thinking of it like a miscarriage, but it wasn’t the same as a miscarriage,” the narrator muses. Things get bleaker from there, with the couple facing financial precarity before things reach points of tragedy and redemption. The book is uneven, but its mournful voice is hard to shake.",

  "text": "THE WEDDING PEOPLE by Alison Espach ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 30, 2024 Uneven but fitfully amusing. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 18 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Betrayed by her husband, a severely depressed young woman gets drawn into the over-the-top festivities at a lavish wedding. Phoebe Stone, who teaches English literature at a St. Louis college, is plotting her own demise. Her husband, Matt, has left her for another woman, and Phoebe is taking it hard. Indeed, she's determined just where and how she will end it all: at an oceanfront hotel in Newport, where she will lie on a king-sized canopy bed and take a bottle of her cat’s painkillers. At the hotel, Phoebe meets bride-to-be Lila, a headstrong rich girl presiding over her own extravagant six-day wedding celebration. Lila thought she had booked every room in the hotel, and learning of Phoebe's suicidal intentions, she forbids this stray guest from disrupting the nuptials: “No. You definitely can’t kill yourself. This is my wedding week.” After the punchy opening, a grim flashback to the meltdown of Phoebe's marriage temporarily darkens the mood, but things pick up when spoiled Lila interrupts Phoebe's preparations and sweeps her up in the wedding juggernaut. The slide from earnest drama to broad farce is somewhat jarring, but from this point on, Espach crafts an enjoyable—if overstuffed—comedy of manners. When the original maid of honor drops out, Phoebe is persuaded, against her better judgment, to take her place. There’s some fun to be had here: The wedding party—including groom-to-be Gary, a widower, and his 11-year-old daughter—takes surfing lessons; the women in the group have a session with a Sex Woman. But it all goes on too long, and the humor can seem forced, reaching a low point when someone has sex with the vintage wedding car (you don’t want to know the details). Later, when two characters have a meet-cute in a hot tub, readers will guess exactly how the marriage plot resolves. Uneven but fitfully amusing.
