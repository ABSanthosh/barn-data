  "description": "A scientific experiment goes horribly wrong, unleashing destruction on Betelgeuse, New Mexico, and U.S. Army Capt. Gabriel Rodriguez and Dr. Tamarind “Tam” Sinclair are among the few survivors. Now, demonic monsters prowl suburban streets and a mysterious illness wreaks havoc on the human populace. Joined by a fellow traumatized survivor, whom they nickname Ripley (as a specific nod to the classic SF/horror thriller Aliens), and with a host of improvised weapons and stolen camping equipment, the pair set out on a potentially futile mission to deliver information that could rescue the planet from disaster. The trio encounter strange predators, roving gangs, and new friends in this first installment of Joaquín’s ongoing series. It has a compelling premise that combines multiple genres, delivering SF apocalypse-horror by way of HBO’s dramatic TV series Chernobyl. The novel ends on a cliffhanger after a promising start, but its greatest asset is its skillful character development. Gabriel and Tam are likable and endearing, and their banter makes for an enjoyable read. Ripley is an extremely strong character—she isn’t merely a damsel in distress, nor is she a one-dimensional, no-nonsense fighter, and her emotional complexity makes her all the more realistic and human. The novel’s weak point, however, is its portrayal of a developing romance between Gabriel and Ripley, which feels forced and sometimes grinds the narrative to a halt. However, the various players and their relationships will certainly evolve in future installments. All in all, readers who like post-disaster fiction with plenty of action and engaging characters are likely to enjoy this end-times tale.",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 264 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
