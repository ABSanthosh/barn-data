  "text": "02 Jul 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write When Grifters Come Calling? Encounters with grifters in the community I live in, people who fool enough people into believing they are legit, on the up and up, but in reality, they’re only after other people’s money. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I’m open to most genres. I love to read good mysteries, but I’m open to just about anything that’s well written. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Educated by Tara Westover, and The Storyteller by Jodi Picoult. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I don’t want to spoil the surprise, but I can say that it was a revelation that takes place in a bank. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Not really. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Not exactly, but after all these years on the planet, I’ve learned to let go of the stress and not get too worked up when things don’t go the way I envision. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? How strong Madeline is, mentally, emotionally, and physically.
