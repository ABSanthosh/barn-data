  "description": "Ellesmere Island, the second-closest landmass to the North Pole, is home to some of the world’s most intriguing species. The wild, snow-white Arctic wolves residing there have captivated renowned wolf researcher L. David Mech for 25 years, and they sustain the reader’s attention as well. Generally speaking, wolves are difficult for researchers to study up close, largely due to their well-deserved fear of humans who have hunted them for centuries. Mech himself had mostly observed wolves from helicopters prior to his time on Ellesmere, stating, “I increasingly realized how truly unique this opportunity was for learning about wolves in a way that my previous decades of study had never come close to….I was now gaining the kind of personal knowledge of these wild creatures that one absorbs about their pets by simply living with them.” What makes the wolves on Ellesmere so special is their unfamiliarity with and lack of fear of humans, which allows for intimate, up-close interactions. Mech’s account follows his decades of study, as he observes the wolves through summer after summer, witnessing changes in their environment and behavior. His groundbreaking work paved the way for other researchers and documentarians, as he became a steward to these wolves and their trusting nature. The book is sprinkled with delightful photos of pups, yearlings, and adult wolves, along with anecdotes and heartwarming moments that make it a joy to read. Deeply moving and richly described, the book makes it clear that one does not need to be a scientist to find these wolves fascinating.",

  "text": "THE BACKYARD BIRD CHRONICLES by Amy Tan ; illustrated by Amy Tan ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 23, 2024 An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds. A charming bird journey with the bestselling author. In his introduction to Tan’s “nature journal,” David Allen Sibley, the acclaimed ornithologist, nails the spirit of this book: a “collection of delightfully quirky, thoughtful, and personal observations of birds in sketches and words.” For years, Tan has looked out on her California backyard “paradise”—oaks, periwinkle vines, birch, Japanese maple, fuchsia shrubs—observing more than 60 species of birds, and she fashions her findings into delightful and approachable journal excerpts, accompanied by her gorgeous color sketches. As the entries—“a record of my life”—move along, the author becomes more adept at identifying and capturing them with words and pencils. Her first entry is September 16, 2017: Shortly after putting up hummingbird feeders, one of the tiny, delicate creatures landed on her hand and fed. “We have a relationship,” she writes. “I am in love.” By August 2018, her backyard “has become a menagerie of fledglings…all learning to fly.” Day by day, she has continued to learn more about the birds, their activities, and how she should relate to them; she also admits mistakes when they occur. In December 2018, she was excited to observe a Townsend’s Warbler—“Omigod! It’s looking at me. Displeased expression.” Battling pesky squirrels, Tan deployed Hot Pepper Suet to keep them away, and she deterred crows by hanging a fake one upside down. The author also declared war on outdoor cats when she learned they kill more than 1 billion birds per year. In May 2019, she notes that she spends $250 per month on beetle larvae. In June 2019, she confesses “spending more hours a day staring at birds than writing. How can I not?” Her last entry, on December 15, 2022, celebrates when an eating bird pauses, “looks and acknowledges I am there.” An ebullient nature lover’s paean to birds.
