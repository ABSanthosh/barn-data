Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more.This is the most prestigious prize for literature translated into English, and an out-and-out goldmine for book lovers like me who spend most of their time traipsing Anglophonia. Of these, I have only heard of Solenoid. I like to pick a few of these to try (or at least pick up and look at and think about trying). Early contenders for me: Reservoir Bitches, Under the Eye of the Big Bird, and There’s a Monster Behind the Door. Wonder Boys at 30A very warm appreciation of both the movie and film of Michael Chabon’s Wonder Boys, from a literary citizen of Pittsburgh itself. I agree with Simon that both incarnations of Wonder Boys are underappreciated and have a lot to offer readers and writers alike. This is pre-Iron Man Downey along with a “what is this guy’s ceiling?!” performance from Tobey Maguire. McDormand is tough and welcoming all at once, more than match (much more some might say) for Michael Douglas’ shambling, erudite, and lost Grady Tripp. I fee a re-watch in the offing.

Apply for The National Book Foundation Teacher Fellowship I like to highlight opportunities that might be a little less well-known. And this one was unknown to me before this morning. The National Book Foundation (NBF) Teacher Fellowship supports and celebrates 6th–12th grade teachers who use innovative methods to make reading for pleasure a part of their students’ school day experience. The NBF Teacher Fellowship aims to: Support classroom activities that have a direct impact on the development of students as lifelong readers Celebrate and highlight creative and effective models for independent reading instruction Connect more young people with great literature through National Book Award–honored titles As part of the Fellowship, teachers develop or continue an initiative that promotes reading for pleasure in their classroom, incorporate National Book Award–honored titles into their curriculum, and collaborate with other Fellows through participation in a professional learning community, including an in-person convening in New York City. Applications are due February 28th (so real soon) and come with a $3000 stipend and a $2000 book budget. Forward this to someone who might be a candidate. Maybe you are one yourself. An Open Letter to John Lithgow: Please Walk Away From Harry PotterDanika Ellis writes an open letter to John Lithgow about what it means for him to take on the role of Albus Dumbledore in HBO’s forthcoming mega remake:That’s why I’m writing to you today, asking for you to walk away from your role in Harry Potter. Your name lends credence to the adaptation, and by extension, it helps to grow JK Rowling’s platform to further her crusade against trans people’s rights. Stepping away would send a message to trans young people that they matter more than a fantasy franchise. It would align with the values you’ve shared throughout your career, both in interviews and in your performances.",
