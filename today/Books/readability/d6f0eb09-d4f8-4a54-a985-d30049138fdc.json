  "text": "Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. Fairly quiet on the books news front today (and I would expect it to be this way for awhile for reasons you can probably guess and are feeling yourself.

I bet some people will be into this.” Today In Books Newsletter Sign up to Today In Books to receive daily news and miscellany from the world of books. Thank you for signing up!
