  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write A Donga Is Not What You Think It Is? I had a story about a couple that wasn’t a romance novel. These are always hard to classify. I wanted it to be realistic in every sense but I also wanted them to win—ultimately, I mean. These are people who have a history but have been out of touch and because of circumstances, make this quantum leap of faith. Most of the time this would never work. I saw it differently. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of A Donga Is Not What You Think It Is, what would they be? That old Bill Withers song “Just The Two Of Us”. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? My favorite genre to read is biography, especially about people who have no visual record. You don’t need a biography to understand Dr. King. You do to understand Lincoln. There is conjecture and opinions in these things, of course, but it all begins with data and I like to see the research done. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I always feel a little awkward when asked this. I do not read when I’m writing and I’ve been writing steadily for the past few years. The last book I read is The Five about the victims of Jack the Ripper. It’s hard to explain. I’m single-minded when I’m writing. I watch sports or documentaries to give my brain a break. One day I’ll take a couple of years off and catch up on my reading. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? These two people are separated one Christmas. The guy, Mark, falls off the steps and hurts his ankle. There’s some dark comedy surrounding this event and it becomes the impetus for revelations. Kind of out of the blue. I still enjoy reading it. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I work on a reclining loveseat with my laptop literally in my lap. There is a cupholder between the seats and I have coffee in my Yeti. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? I should say no and leave it. I don’t have a motto or quote and I couldn’t express my philosophy in so few words. I suppose a mantra I use is Yet. One word. I have not had a breakthrough book. I’ve had good reviews and positive feedback but I haven’t developed an audience for any of my books that was sufficient to generate enough word-of-mouth to achieve critical mass. I don’t write in the same genre. My books are all over the place. But when I release a book and sales just trickle in I tell myself Yet. It hasn’t happened yet. It’s the only way I can keep going. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? You don’t have to be a Hallmark character to win. You can prevail by devoting yourself to something–and that includes a relationship. Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly.",
