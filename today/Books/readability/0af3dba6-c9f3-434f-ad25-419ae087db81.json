View All posts by Community We can never have too many Jane Austen adaptations. A new Sense and Sensibility movie is on the way, and now, it has its star: Daisy Edgar-Jones will play Elinor Dashwood. Daisy Edgar-Jones starred in Normal People and On Swift Horses and also appeared in Where the Crawdads Sing: a career built on book-to-screen adaptations! Sense and Sensibility is being adapted by Focus Features and Working Title Films, who also teamed up for Pride \u0026 Prejudice (2005) and Emma (2020). The 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is well loved by Jane Austen fans, while the 2020 adaptation of Emma was divisive. It will be interesting to see what tone they strike with Sense and Sensibility. The movie is being directed by Georgia Oakley, best known for writing and directing the BAFTA-nominated Blue Jean, and the script was written by Diana Reid, author of Love \u0026 Virtue, Seeing Other People, and Signs of Damage. No other actors have been cast, and the release date has not been announced. You can find out more at The Hollywood Reporter and Glamour.
