  "text": "James Cameron To Adapt Joe Abercrombie’s The Devils In Between Avatar Movies It takes a lot for me to devote a spot to adaptation news anymore, but James Cameron, who movie-per-movie might be the most successful director of all time (check the tape and fight me), adapting a horror novel makes the grade: “How do I describe ‘The Devils?’ A sharply witty horror adventure? An epic battle between good and evil except most of the time you can’t tell which is which? A twisted, stylish, alt-universe middle-ages romp, where your best hope of survival is the monsters themselves? This is Joe Abercrombie in absolute peak form, opening up a whole new world and an ensemble of delicious new characters.” At this point, Cameron is only set to co-write the screenplay with Abercrombie, but with no director announced it is hard not to assume that Cameron isn’t at least considering getting behind the camera for it. Horror is huge in theaters and one of the fasting growing book genres, but I can’t help but wonder if the box-office success and critical adulation of Sinners might have turned Cameron’s head. He clearly has horror-action bona fides, maybe some the greatest of all time, but at the very least the run Coogler’s modern masterpiece is having would give confidence to someone taking on The Devils. Speaking of Horror Masters… We have copies of Stephen King’s new book, Never Flinch to give away. Go here to enter for your chance to win it. Deal of the Day Yesterday’s mention of a great ebook deal was rare for TIB, but dangit if there isn’t something on sale today that bears mentioning. The Night Circus in our Hall of Fame for read-alike requests and a go-to general purpose recommendation ourselves. It has a cult following (I might even have a jacket. Or a button? Not sure where cults are at with swag these days) that adores the sense of place, the love story, the world-building, and if you are audiobook person, all-time narration by the incomparable Jim Dale. So yea, it’s worth $1.99 to give a go.",
