  "description": "The Glory Peak Ski Resort is founded in 1966 by Bill Macklemore, a World War II veteran–turned–ski instructor who developed a site near Fortooth into a premier skiing destination (it is said that “Fortooth was one of those towns where reality was far more potent than myth”). His devotion to his business is so all-encompassing that his wife, Suzanne, leaves him, taking along their son, Bobby. Fast forward a few decades: Bill is expanding the ski resort, and Bobby is married to a woman named Annabelle. Bobby does not approve of the way Bill is expanding the ski runs, and the local Indigenous Le’Echuwanna people aren’t happy, either. Annabelle and Bobby have a daughter named Clover, who is the company’s presumed heir, but things change when her grandmother, Nanny A, a former professor, strident feminist, and shrewd businesswoman, arrives. Family obligations bring Nanny A to town, but business interests keep her there: She bands together with her daughter’s former lover, Gunther (a German skier and videographer), to take his company Wolfehaus into the stratosphere as Clover’s inheritance (if she even wants it) and the family legacy hang in the balance. Abrams’ small but remarkable cast of characters occupy a world in the Pacific Northwest that is a sight to behold. The towering achievements, business acumen, and grand ambition on display make for an engrossing story about family that is as grounded as it is lofty. All is not perfect at the foot of the mountain, and the difficult relationships are characterized with compelling emotional detail. Family legacy is key in this novel, but there are some literal cliffhanger moments that keep the story exciting. The narrative is told out of chronological sequence, but the author’s gift for storytelling keeps everything in sync.",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
