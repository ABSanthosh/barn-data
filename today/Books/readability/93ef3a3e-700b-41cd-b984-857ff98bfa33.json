  "description": "The story begins by likening words to people: specifically, the way each word is unique and lovely just the way it is. Every word does something no other word can, and when different words meet, “Words are like kids / Who see each other / And begin to play.” The author underscores the anxiety words can produce and acknowledges the way we sometimes can’t find the right ones and say the wrong thing: “Words can feel shy / And hide when we need them.” Some words are angry and frightening in some contexts, and in others, the same words can heal by naming the things that are scary. Davis-Gibbon notes that speaking the truth with words is brave and commendable. Berry’s whimsical pencil-and-watercolor illustrations abound with hidden words disguised as characters and objects. Readers will enjoy looking for all the words buried in the full-page pictures; flower, for example, is depicted using blooming plants in a garden. This balance of text and images will undoubtedly delight kids, and the presentation of the text makes for an easy read. The narration retains its accessibility and clarity as it builds gradually from words to simple metaphors to the emotional consequences of words to the ending, which tackles the complex notion of speaking out and speaking one’s truth.",

  "text": "HELLO WINTER! by Shelley Rotner ; photographed by Shelley Rotner ‧ RELEASE DATE: Oct. 16, 2018 A solid addition to Rotner’s seasonal series. Bring on summer. Rotner follows up her celebrations of spring and autumn with this look at all things winter. Beginning with the signs that winter is coming—bare trees, shorter days, colder temperatures—Rotner eases readers into the season. People light fires and sing songs on the solstice, trees and plants stop growing, and shadows grow long. Ice starts to form on bodies of water and windows. When the snow flies, the fun begins—bundle up and then build forts, make snowballs and snowmen (with eyebrows!), sled, ski (nordic is pictured), skate, snowshoe, snowboard, drink hot chocolate. Animals adapt to the cold as well. “Birds grow more feathers” (there’s nothing about fluffing and air insulation) and mammals, more hair. They have to search for food, and Rotner discusses how many make or find shelter, slow down, hibernate, or go underground or underwater to stay warm. One page talks about celebrating holidays with lights and decorations. The photos show a lit menorah, an outdoor deciduous tree covered in huge Christmas bulbs, a girl next to a Chinese dragon head, a boy with lit luminarias, and some fireworks. The final spread shows signs of the season’s shift to spring. Rotner’s photos, as always, are a big draw. The children are a marvelous mix of cultures and races, and all show their clear delight with winter. A solid addition to Rotner’s seasonal series. Bring on summer.
