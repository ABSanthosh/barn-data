  "description": "Seven years ago, Nate Durant weighed over 300 pounds and was deeply unhappy. After getting bariatric surgery and slimming down, he’s resolved to dedicate himself to working extra hard at whatever he tries, whether it’s writing, DJing, podcasting, or doing stand-up comedy. His wife Cynthia has also lost a dramatic amount of weight, but through rigorous exercise. While her husband throws himself into work to keep them financially afloat, Cynthia is at a loss for what to do next in her career. She’s been struggling to find work as a substitute teacher for the past three years and is feeling the strain of their lack of time together—Nate is busy as the sole provider. Nate’s fear of returning to his previous weight prevents him from seeing just how much he’s overworking himself. When he sees a familiar face while scrolling through an online porn site, he becomes obsessed with verifying the person’s identity. She turns out to be a woman named Stephanie, a former coworker with whom he lost touch years ago. Nate reconnects with her on social media (“He had no idea why he was obsessing over this picture of her”). The two start up a correspondence, setting off a chain of events that threatens the very foundation of his marriage. Smith tackles the evergreen question of how to keep a stale marriage alive while beset by such common adult problems as unemployment, changes in physical appearance, and diverging interests. The narrative leans more to the dramatic side, with the romance taking a backseat to the brewing marital turmoil. Both Nate’s and Cynthia’s insecurities are well rendered, though their pre-marriage romance isn’t as convincing. In some of their scenes together they read as stiff, robotic strangers instead of a longtime married couple, and their dual perspectives don’t add much to the story—they’re too similar to each other on the voice level. However, the relatable themes and the plot’s steady pace will carry readers over most of these flaws.",

  "text": "THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 1, 2004 Heartfelt, yes, but pretty routine. Life lessons. Angie Malone, the youngest of a big, warm Italian-American family, returns to her Pacific Northwest hometown to wrestle with various midlife disappointments: her divorce, Papa’s death, a downturn in business at the family restaurant, and, above all, her childlessness. After several miscarriages, she, a successful ad exec, and husband Conlan, a reporter, befriended a pregnant young girl and planned to adopt her baby—and then the birth mother changed her mind. Angie and Conlan drifted apart and soon found they just didn’t love each other anymore. Metaphorically speaking, “her need for a child had been a high tide, an overwhelming force that drowned them. A year ago, she could have kicked to the surface but not now.” Sadder but wiser, Angie goes to work in the struggling family restaurant, bickering with Mama over updating the menu and replacing the ancient waitress. Soon, Angie befriends another young girl, Lauren Ribido, who’s eager to learn and desperately needs a job. Lauren’s family lives on the wrong side of the tracks, and her mother is a promiscuous alcoholic, but Angie knows nothing of this sad story and welcomes Lauren into the DeSaria family circle. The girl listens in, wide-eyed, as the sisters argue and make wisecracks and—gee-whiz—are actually nice to each other. Nothing at all like her relationship with her sluttish mother, who throws Lauren out when boyfriend David, en route to Stanford, gets her pregnant. Will Lauren, who’s just been accepted to USC, let Angie adopt her baby? Well, a bit of a twist at the end keeps things from becoming too predictable. Heartfelt, yes, but pretty routine.
