Welcome to Today in Books, our daily round-up of literary headlines at the intersection of politics, culture, media, and more. ALA Names New Head of Public Policy and Advocacy The American Library Association has named Lisa Varga as the new associate executive director of its Public Policy and Advocacy office. Varga, who has served as the executive director of the Virginia Library Association for the last 15 years, will lead the office’s work to promote the freedom of information and advocate for libraries and library workers. During her time at the VLA, she quintupled the organization’s membership, increased revenue, and “defeated four bills in the Virginia General Assembly in 2024 and 11 bills in the 2023 session which would have impacted intellectual freedom for students.” As a resident if Virginia, I’m grateful for work, especially these last few years as the state has become one of the top sites of book banning attempts.
