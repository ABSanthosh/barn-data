  "description": "Fifteen months after cult leader Patrick Nye ended his group’s hostage-taking at a theatrical gala by detonating bombs that killed 43 people, the case is ready to go to trial—with one hitch. John Horner, a senior advocate to the Crown Prosecution Service, needs someone to comb through the material that’s been excluded from the mountain of evidence to be presented in court to make sure that none of it is relevant, potentially complicating or weakening the case and risking its dismissal. The task falls to Eve Wren, who’s been working for the CPS since getting canned from a Shropshire law firm when the senior colleague she blew the whistle on blamed her for his mistakes. So, this time, Eve has every motive to be extra careful. If only that were equally true of DCS Seth Strutton, the senior investigating officer, and DS Gary Lees, the officer in charge. In the absence of their firm support, Eve soldiers on, sifting through box after box of potential evidence, unaware that a series of flashbacks to the fatal event are providing more and more information that would be incredibly useful to her. At length she discovers a burner phone that can’t be accounted for by any tallies of the phones used by the group or their victims, and the messages on that phone, which originally sound pretty bland, turn out to be damning. It’s right around then that Eve’s troubles begin to intensify to a boiling point.",

  "text": "TO DIE FOR by David Baldacci ‧ RELEASE DATE: Nov. 12, 2024 Fast-moving excitement with a satisfying finish. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 15 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller The feds must protect an accused criminal and an orphaned girl. Maybe you’ve met him before as protagonist of The 6:20 Man (2022): Ex-Army Ranger Travis Devine, who’d had the dubious fortune to tangle with “the girl on the train,” is now assigned by his homeland security boss to protect Danny Glass, who's awaiting trial on multiple RICO charges in Washington state. Devine has what it takes: He “was a closer, snooper, fixer, investigator,” and, when necessary, a killer. These skills are on full display as the deaths of three key witnesses grind justice to a temporary halt. Glass has a 12-year-old niece, Betsy Odom, and each is the other’s only living relative—her parents recently died of an apparent drug overdose. The FBI has temporary guardianship of Betsy, who's a handful. She tells Travis that though she’s not yet 13, she's 28 in “life-shit years.” The financially well-heeled Glass wants to be her legal guardian with an eye to eventual adoption, but what are his real motives? And what happens to her if he's convicted? Meanwhile, Betsy insists that her parents never touched drugs, and she begs Travis to find out how they really died. This becomes part of a mission that oozes danger. The small town of Ricketts has a woman mayor who’s full of charm on the surface, but deeply corrupt and deadly when crossed. She may be linked to a subversive group called \"12/24/65,\" as in 1865, when the Ku Klux Klan beast was born. Blood flows, bombs explode, and people perish, both good guys and not-so-good guys. Readers might ponder why in fiction as well as in life, it sometimes seems necessary for many to die so one may live. And what about the girl on the train? She's not necessary to the plot, but she's a fun addition as she pops in and out of the pages, occasionally leaving notes for Travis. Maybe she still wants him dead.  Fast-moving excitement with a satisfying finish.
