After nearly 400 episodes of their instant-sensation podcast, Glennon Doyle, Abby Wambach, and Amanda Doyle are publishing a book by the same name. We Can Do Hard Things: Answers to Life’s 20 Questions is due out May 6 from The Dial Press. Inspired by one very difficult year of life, the We Can Do Hard Things book aims to provide a “guidebook for being alive—to help fellow travelers find their way through life.” Glennon’s compasses are her sister, Amanda, and her wife, Abby. Recently, in the span of a single year, Glennon was diagnosed with anorexia, Amanda was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Abby’s beloved brother died. For the first time, they were all lost at the same time. So they turned toward the only thing that’s ever helped them find their way: deep, honest conversations with other brave, kind, wise people. With We Can Do Hard Things, the Doyle sisters and Wambach have synthesized wisdom from friends, family, and 118 “wayfinders,” including Kate Bowler, Roxane Gay, Ashley C. Ford, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Cheryl Strayed, Jane Fonda, and Stephanie Foo, among others. The book is available for pre-order now, and the authors will hit the rode this spring for a 10-city tour.",
