  "text": "30 Oct 2024 If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of The Shadows of Erathal (The Legends of Evorath Book 1), what would they be? “Simple Man” by Lynard Skynard would make a great theme song for Jaldor. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Philosophy, but fantasy is in close second. I’d even go as far as to say that I prefer fantasy, but studying philosophy helps flesh out worlds more completely. What books are on your TBR pile right now? Too many to list! What scene in your book was your favorite to write? Choosing one scene seems so unfair to all the others! But if I have to pick one in the moment, I’d say the scene towards the beginning when George, Sarah, Artimus and Savannah are gathering for a celebratory lunch. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) Just put on some good music and write. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? George Sand said: “Art for art’s sake is an empty phrase. Art for the sake of truth, art for the sake of the good and the beautiful, that is the faith I am searching for.” If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? This is only the beginning for Evorath. Whatever you might feel about the world, just know that the lore is so much deeper and the worldbuilding will only get bigger as the next series releases.
