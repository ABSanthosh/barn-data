  "description": "Sacco uses words and illustrations to document stories: He’s a self-described comics journalist. He has combined both forms to great effect in numerous works of graphic nonfiction, including Palestine and Safe Area Goražde, that tell of overseas conflicts. One monumental wordless work, The Great War, depicts the first day of the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Sacco returns to the subject of the Mideast in his latest book, a slim overview of Israel’s recent invasion of Gaza. The urgency of the project is evident in a short introduction in which he writes of beginning it after a friend in Gaza pleaded with him to “plz raise the voice up against these crimes.” Sacco’s answer: “So here, my friend, for whatever it’s worth, I ‘raise the voice up.’” That he does. The book is an impassioned polemic against Israel’s devastating response to the raid of Oct. 7, 2023, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were slaughtered by Hamas fighters. “The scale of the deaths of Israeli civilians left me horrified,” Sacco writes. So, too, did Israel’s retaliation, which has killed tens of thousands of people. “I was only theoretically prepared for the worst,” he continues. “The reality of the assault on Gaza…was almost beyond my comprehension.” Unlike Sacco’s earlier works that feature on-the-ground reporting—the testimony of ordinary citizens imbuing the pages with power—this book is more of a visual op-ed, his scathing critique of the U.S. and Israel accompanied by caricatures of President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and biblical-style language: “The way was greased for the Righteous Rampage that smote the People of Darkness.” Elsewhere, he writes, “America had just invented Kinder, Gentler Genocide. The patent is pending.”",

  "text": "KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON THE OSAGE MURDERS AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI by David Grann ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 18, 2017 Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 66 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2017 New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller National Book Award Finalist Greed, depravity, and serial murder in 1920s Oklahoma. During that time, enrolled members of the Osage Indian nation were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world. The rich oil fields beneath their reservation brought millions of dollars into the tribe annually, distributed to tribal members holding \"headrights\" that could not be bought or sold but only inherited. This vast wealth attracted the attention of unscrupulous whites who found ways to divert it to themselves by marrying Osage women or by having Osage declared legally incompetent so the whites could fleece them through the administration of their estates. For some, however, these deceptive tactics were not enough, and a plague of violent death—by shooting, poison, orchestrated automobile accident, and bombing—began to decimate the Osage in what they came to call the \"Reign of Terror.\" Corrupt and incompetent law enforcement and judicial systems ensured that the perpetrators were never found or punished until the young J. Edgar Hoover saw cracking these cases as a means of burnishing the reputation of the newly professionalized FBI. Bestselling New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn't stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann's crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs. Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.

Bestselling \u003ci\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/i\u003e staff writer Grann (\u003ci\u003eThe Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession\u003c/i\u003e, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn\u0026#39;t stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann\u0026#39;s crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n                                        Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n                                \n\n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePub Date:\u003c/b\u003e April 18, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eISBN:\u003c/b\u003e 978-0-385-53424-6\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePage Count:\u003c/b\u003e 352\u003c/p\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePublisher:\u003c/b\u003e Doubleday\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eReview Posted Online:\u003c/b\u003e Feb. 1, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                         \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKirkus Reviews Issue:\u003c/b\u003e Feb. 15, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
