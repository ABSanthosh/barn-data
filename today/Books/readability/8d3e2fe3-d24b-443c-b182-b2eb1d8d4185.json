  "description": "Two big-eared rodents—Pépin, who wears a blue bow tie, and Cosette, who sports a pink flower—accompany Grand-mère to the museum, where they gaze at Hawkins’ cartoonish interpretations (or MousterWorks) of well-known paintings by Edward Bannister, Johannes Vermeer, Claude Monet, and others. The enthralled Cosette eagerly engages with the art, imagining the scents and sounds the subjects might be experiencing, while Pépin’s more concerned with tracking down cheese. While readers will enjoy picking out the adorable rodents interspersed throughout the MousterWorks—a mouse is tucked into bed alongside the youngster in Rosa Bonheur’s Child and Cat, for instance—they won’t get that much out of the paintings themselves. The brief, plotless text provides no historical context or discussion of the pieces; readers curious about the performance depicted in Miyagawa Choshun’s Ryukyuan Dancers and Musicians, for instance, will need to go elsewhere to learn more. And though the MousterWorks are cute enough, alterations in composition, facial expressions, and color scheme mean that readers won’t get the full emotional effect. An author’s note includes a link to a website comparing the MousterWorks to the originals, while endpapers list the names and birth and death dates of the artists.",

  "text": "WHAT THE ROAD SAID by Cleo Wade ; illustrated by Lucie de Moyencourt ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 23, 2021 Inspiration, shrink wrapped. From an artist, poet, and Instagram celebrity, a pep talk for all who question where a new road might lead. Opening by asking readers, “Have you ever wanted to go in a different direction,” the unnamed narrator describes having such a feeling and then witnessing the appearance of a new road “almost as if it were magic.” “Where do you lead?” the narrator asks. The Road’s twice-iterated response—“Be a leader and find out”—bookends a dialogue in which a traveler’s anxieties are answered by platitudes. “What if I fall?” worries the narrator in a stylized, faux hand-lettered type Wade’s Instagram followers will recognize. The Road’s dialogue and the narration are set in a chunky, sans-serif type with no quotation marks, so the one flows into the other confusingly. “Everyone falls at some point, said the Road. / But I will always be there when you land.” Narrator: “What if the world around us is filled with hate?” Road: “Lead it to love.” Narrator: “What if I feel stuck?” Road: “Keep going.” De Moyencourt illustrates this colloquy with luminous scenes of a small, brown-skinned child, face turned away from viewers so all they see is a mop of blond curls. The child steps into an urban mural, walks along a winding country road through broad rural landscapes and scary woods, climbs a rugged metaphorical mountain, then comes to stand at last, Little Prince–like, on a tiny blue and green planet. Wade’s closing claim that her message isn’t meant just for children is likely superfluous…in fact, forget the just. Inspiration, shrink wrapped.
