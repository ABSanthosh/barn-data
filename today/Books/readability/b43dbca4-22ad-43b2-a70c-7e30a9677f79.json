  "text": "What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Moroccan Sunset: Dawn of a New Beginning (Annie’s Journey Book 4)? When I was first writing Beyond the Sea, the first in the ANNIE’S JOURNEY series, there was a political intrigue mounting and I was highly suspicious El Amir, the mysterious Moroccan with the mesmerizing golden eyes, would have a sinister side. I couldn’t do it and his character was peeled back layer by layer through the first three books, revealing a man who is bound to the honor of his cultural traditions, a patron of the arts, and an avid conservation philanthropist. He had given up the chance for love with Annie because of honoring his tradition and I was so excited to give him a chance at love. But it could not be an ordinary dutiful Arab bride that he knew would not ignite the same passion he felt for Annie. With Elena Al Farooq, I found someone who could make him believe that love and tradition could go hand in hand. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of Moroccan Sunset: Dawn of a New Beginning (Annie’s Journey Book 4), what would they be? Queen – “I Want to Break Free”. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love to read romance and women’s fiction, but also books with mysterious circumstances. I don’t write romcoms, but I love to write about young women going through loss or tragedy and how they get through it on their way to romance. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I am currently reading Danielle Steel’s Palazzo. I would love to read Matt Haig’s The Life Impossible and Abraham Verghese’s The Covenant of Water. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? There are a few, but I particularly like the scene where El Amir is about to excercise his falcon. It is the first time Elena asserts herself, shocking everyone, especially El Amir. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I pace while I speak the scene out loud like I am listening to the characters and I keep at it until the dialogue sounds right. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? No matter what the culture of someone I meet, especially in my travels, I try to smile, treat them with respect and offer a few kind words. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? Throughout the multicultural series, there is a consistent theme that people from different backgrounds, upbringing and traditions can not only get along but accept each other for the treasure they are. The friendship formed between Sarah and Elena, who seemingly come from such diverse backgrounds, is a good example of how inside they were quite similar. The characters feel real. They struggle; they push limits; they seek love; and they learn from the others around them. I am hopeful readers will take away some small piece of wisdom about co-existing with one another, no matter the culture.
