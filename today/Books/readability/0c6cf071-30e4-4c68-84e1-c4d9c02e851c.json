  "text": "04 Mar 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write North Country? North Country is a stand alone womens fiction/speculative fiction novel that follows four women on an adventurous mission to the isolated North Country. It exists in the same universe as my adult series, Pirates of New Earth and has characters that series readers will recognize. I have always known that my protagonist, Kat Wallace, needed to return to the land of her birth to settle some old scores. I also wanted to deal with the issue of chronic illness that affects so many people and I wanted to put together two women who have very different ideas about friendship and loyalty. The inspiration for this book comes from the same place as all my other inspiration: seeing how women cope with trauma and how they work through the issues and relationships that challenge them. If you had to pick theme songs for the main characters of North Country, what would they be? Kat: “Girl from the North Country” by Bob Dylan Carisa: “It’s Not Over Yet” by King \u0026 Country Diamond: “Pocketful of Gold” by American Authors Flossie: “Real Friends” by Camila Cabello What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? Oh, I can’t pick a favorite because I love many books across many genres. Cozy mysteries, action, adventure, romance, fantasy, and of course speculative fiction. What books are on your TBR pile right now? So many, the ones I can see from where I am writing include: Grey Wolf by Louise Penny, Broken Sky by M.K. Osmun, and The Road of Bones by Demi Winters. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I loved the Carisa/sky goddess scene. It was fun to write and so empowering for the character. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? My publishing imprint is Sooner Started Press from one of my favorite expressions: Sooner started, sooner done. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? That we all have strengths and we all can both rise to an occasion and change to meet it if we wish.
