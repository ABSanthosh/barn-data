  "description": "The author writes that when he first attempted to grapple with the fact that his young daughter, Mackenzie, had a degenerative medical condition, he read the Book of Job. When he realized that he needed more than simply an account of unjust suffering, he says, he moved on to Ecclesiastes, noting that the book “doesn’t concern itself much with matters of salvation, heaven, or eternity. Ecclesiastes wants to know how to live now on this planet, even when conditions are less than ideal.” The Old Testament is by an unknown author who claims to record the teachings of King Solomon, and it states, right at the beginning of the Common English Bible translation, that life is “perfectly pointless.” In this memoir, Potter unpacks this and other mysteries while sharing anecdotes from his own life, from his difficult childhood in California to the decades of palliative care that he and his wife have given their daughter. With a sincere declaration of faith and an equally sincere desire to move beyond platitudes, the author seeks out a nuanced vision of life’s purpose in the ancient lines of Scripture. Potter elucidates the text with skill, sympathizing with readers’ confusion and admitting to puzzling over biblical passages himself: “Does fine oil signify wealth?” he asks about Ecclesiastes 7:1 (“A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death better than the birthday”). “If so, is [Solomon] saying that your reputation is worth more than money? Is he using a poetic image to imply that a bad name is like cheap smelly oil? Or is he just comparing two completely unrelated things as a literary way of grabbing our attention and making us read carefully?” Whether the insights originate with Solomon or an anonymous scribe, Potter manages to wring from them worthy advice for those struggling to make sense of life’s sometimes-unbearable burdens.",

  "text": "TANQUERAY by Stephanie Johnson \u0026 Brandon Stanton illustrated by Henry Sene Yee ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 12, 2022 A blissfully vicarious, heartfelt glimpse into the life of a Manhattan burlesque dancer. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 89 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller A former New York City dancer reflects on her zesty heyday in the 1970s. Discovered on a Manhattan street in 2020 and introduced on Stanton’s Humans of New York Instagram page, Johnson, then 76, shares her dynamic history as a “fiercely independent” Black burlesque dancer who used the stage name Tanqueray and became a celebrated fixture in midtown adult theaters. “I was the only black girl making white girl money,” she boasts, telling a vibrant story about sex and struggle in a bygone era. Frank and unapologetic, Johnson vividly captures aspects of her former life as a stage seductress shimmying to blues tracks during 18-minute sets or sewing lingerie for plus-sized dancers. Though her work was far from the Broadway shows she dreamed about, it eventually became all about the nightly hustle to simply survive. Her anecdotes are humorous, heartfelt, and supremely captivating, recounted with the passion of a true survivor and the acerbic wit of a weathered, street-wise New Yorker. She shares stories of growing up in an abusive household in Albany in the 1940s, a teenage pregnancy, and prison time for robbery as nonchalantly as she recalls selling rhinestone G-strings to prostitutes to make them sparkle in the headlights of passing cars. Complemented by an array of revealing personal photographs, the narrative alternates between heartfelt nostalgia about the seedier side of Manhattan’s go-go scene and funny quips about her unconventional stage performances. Encounters with a variety of hardworking dancers, drag queens, and pimps, plus an account of the complexities of a first love with a drug-addled hustler, fill out the memoir with personality and candor. With a narrative assist from Stanton, the result is a consistently titillating and often moving story of human struggle as well as an insider glimpse into the days when Times Square was considered the Big Apple’s gloriously unpolished underbelly. The book also includes Yee’s lush watercolor illustrations. A blissfully vicarious, heartfelt glimpse into the life of a Manhattan burlesque dancer.
