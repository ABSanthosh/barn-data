  "description": "Moocow Meadows is famous for its milk, thanks to prize cows Ma and Pa Moocow. Two of their daughters—Eliza B. and Clara Bell—produce award-winning milk, but dungaree-wearing Molly Mae proves unable to produce it at all. Molly Mae is upset until her chicken friend, C.K. Doodle, encourages her to pursue other interests. She tries painting, dog walking, singing, accounting, and other things, all with a lack of aptitude. In the end, though, she proves a dab hand at mixing milkshakes—so Moocow Meadows becomes renowned for “having the best milk AND milkshakes in town.” Kirchgasser tells a simple, uplifting story with a can-do positive outlook. Molly Mae’s sadness comes from within, rather than being imposed upon her by others, and Moocow Meadows is a vibrant, happy place—as effectively depicted through swathes and splashes of color depicting emotion. Attema-Welte brings the story to life with busy cartoon illustrations, mostly across double-page spreads and at the greenish-purple end of the color spectrum. The images—featuring droopy trees, milkshake messes, strawberries, and sprinkles—are especially delightful in their use of texture. Human characters are portrayed with various skin tones.",

  "text": "PETE THE CAT'S 12 GROOVY DAYS OF CHRISTMAS by James Dean ; illustrated by James Dean ‧ RELEASE DATE: Sept. 18, 2018 Pete’s fans might find it groovy; anyone else has plenty of other “12 Days of Christmas” variants to choose among Pete, the cat who couldn’t care less, celebrates Christmas with his inimitable lassitude. If it weren’t part of the title and repeated on every other page, readers unfamiliar with Pete’s shtick might have a hard time arriving at “groovy” to describe his Christmas celebration, as the expressionless cat displays not a hint of groove in Dean’s now-trademark illustrations. Nor does Pete have a great sense of scansion: “On the first day of Christmas, / Pete gave to me… / A road trip to the sea. / GROOVY!” The cat is shown at the wheel of a yellow microbus strung with garland and lights and with a star-topped tree tied to its roof. On the second day of Christmas Pete gives “me” (here depicted as a gray squirrel who gets on the bus) “2 fuzzy gloves, and a road trip to the sea. / GROOVY!” On the third day, he gives “me” (now a white cat who joins Pete and the squirrel) “3 yummy cupcakes,” etc. The “me” mentioned in the lyrics changes from day to day and gift to gift, with “4 far-out surfboards” (a frog), “5 onion rings” (crocodile), and “6 skateboards rolling” (a yellow bird that shares its skateboards with the white cat, the squirrel, the frog, and the crocodile while Pete drives on). Gifts and animals pile on until the microbus finally arrives at the seaside and readers are told yet again that it’s all “GROOVY!” Pete’s fans might find it groovy; anyone else has plenty of other “12 Days of Christmas” variants to choose among .
