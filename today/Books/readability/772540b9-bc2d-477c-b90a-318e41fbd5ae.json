We’re officially through the Best Books of 2024 season and into Most Anticipated Books of 2025 season. Goodreads hasn’t wasted any time: they posted a series of most anticipated books by genre on January 1st, when most of us were still sleeping off New Year’s celebrations. Let’s take a look at their round-up of the most anticipated sci-fi and fantasy books of 2025. Get ready to preorder some of the biggest and buzziest SFF books of 2025, or place your library holds now to skip the queue. These are, at least theoretically, the sci-fi and fantasy books that the most users have added to their Want-To-Read shelf. Notably, Goodreads has separated Romantasy into its own list, though Science Fiction, Fantasy, and YA SFF all share one list. Many of the most anticipated titles are sequels, like Emily Wilde’s Compendium of Lost Tales (Emily Wilde #3) by Heather Fawcett, Four Ruined Realms (The Broken Blades #2) by Mai Corland, and One Way Witch (She Who Knows #2) by Nnedi Okorafor. Others are new releases from big name authors, like Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil by V.E. Schwab and Katabasis by R.F. Kuang. There are a few debuts that have broken onto this list, though, like Samantha Sotto Yambao’s upcoming cozy fantasy Water Moon. Here are some of the most anticipated sci-fi and fantasy books of 2025, according to Goodreads.
