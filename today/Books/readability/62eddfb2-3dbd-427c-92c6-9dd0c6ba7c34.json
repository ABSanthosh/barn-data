  "description": "Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but in this tense novel, the temper of 25-year-old Rudy Hodgens is red-hot as he seeks payback from his stepparents for evicting him from the house where he lived for two decades. When Rudy was in kindergarten, his mom died in a car crash; she had been married at the time to Iraq War veteran Mitchell, who was not Rudy’s biological father. A year after the accident, Mitchell married Debra, who became an instant mother to Rudy. Now Debra sobs as her deadbeat stepson packs up and leaves by court order, but Mitchell stews—Rudy has had multiple chances to turn his life around. Before Rudy leaves, he steals a Glock from Mitchell’s collection of guns, ammo, and fancy knives. Rudy tries to sell the Glock to a local thug he knew as a child, but seeing the gun reminds the potential buyer of all the weapons in Rudy’s family’s basement. Rudy also commits “domestic terrorism” by sneaking into the house at night to scare the easily frightened Debra while Mitchell works his overnight shift as a security guard. To make Debra feel safer, Mitchell helps her buy a pistol and (because he loves her) a gun bag in a “pink camouflage pattern.” But is Debra the “wimpy little woman” she appears to be? Complicated, marginalized characters converge in this edgy narrative that zips quickly along. The author excels at writing about people with both minor and major flaws, stashing secrets in each character’s backstory. Lies unfold, revenge is plotted, and suspense builds quickly to a satisfying ending. Well-observed details enrich the story, such as descriptions of the coffeeshop fireplace “that looks warm and cozy, but doesn’t actually emit any heat” and “the sleety snowfall that’s studding the front stoop.”",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 219 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
