  "description": "Every culture has myths, stories passed down throughout history to make sense of the world. For the author, a Venezuelan businessman, writer, and political analyst, myths are also crucial to how a population conceives and protects democracy. His bilingual (English and Spanish) book arranges, in 13 sections, pieces of visual art (including paintings, comics, and photography) and corresponding text with the goal of shifting “old recognizable stories in contemporary form to illustrate in a familiar manner modern ideas” in an “an exploration of humanity’s longing for liberty.” Some pairings have direct symmetry, such as the myth of Pandora’s box accompanied by a prose piece from Pandora’s perspective about unleashing “hate, pain, sickness, famine, war, division, [and] strife” upon humanity. But Rangel eagerly plays with form: A Zeus vignette takes the form of a news article; another reads as a scene in a screenplay with Sandro Botticelli; a third uses an internal memo within a conservative political party with less-than-subtle descriptions of a candidate resembling Donald Trump. One of the most arresting sections is a gruesome comic, with an epigraph by former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, that uses a zombie apocalypse as metaphor for how citizens pay the price for political apathy and extremism, with text like “He yanks our will. I’M HUNGRY! We are his will, he tells us so” to drive the point home. The ease with which Rangel weaves ideas and struggles from centuries and millennia past into the present political landscape, both in the United States and the world beyond, has a chilling effect. But like hope, left at the bottom of Pandora’s box, there is still the feeling that we can move forward, if only we heed our past.",

  "text": "INVENTING REALITY STORIES WE CREATE TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING by Jeffrey Schrank ‧ RELEASE DATE: March 13, 2020 A shrewd and comprehensive study of the importance of reality construction in human life. Awards \u0026 Accolades Our Verdict GET IT A writer offers a wide-ranging exploration of the nature and role of storytelling in human society and psychology. In his book, Schrank takes a broad look at the many pivotal roles stories play in what he refers to as “Normalworld.” Tales, he contends, are the tools people use in their ongoing “Reality Construction Project.” They use stories to construct their shared reality and then explain it to themselves. This project is fundamental to human nature, the author argues: “This seemingly effortless ability to wing it, to make up a story on the fly, is part of our survival toolkit. We experience confabulations as reality, not as stories.” Schrank conceives of this faculty as a defining aspect of humans, who at all times make up and tell tales by instinct about everything (“We are all confabulists,” he writes). He maintains that when these stories diverge from actual reality, humans very often prefer to go on believing the tales instead. In the course of his book, he explores several of these stories and examines their reality versus their various confabulations. Delving into perception studies and visual cognition, he examines subjects ranging from popular political positions to widespread disinformation campaigns, always striving to differentiate between perception and storytelling. For example, he dissects what may be the most dramatic example of confabulation: the prevalence of conspiracy theories, where humans take what they know and use it to tell stories that explain what they don’t know. “Our perception,” he writes, “is a game of fill-in-the-blanks.”Throughout the work, Schrank is a calm, methodical guide to subjects that often tend to raise readers’ hackles (his section on the nature of immigration in the United States, for instance, methodically differentiates between what Americans believe, what they’d like to believe, and what is actually true). His ruling contention is that humans “seek connections and patterns to use as building blocks in our story creation,” and he’s cleareyed about both the positives and the negatives of the phenomenon. One of the foremost negatives connected to serial confabulation is what’s called the Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people’s ignorance about a subject (based on the stories they tell themselves) has an inverse relationship to their confidence about that same topic. As Schrank puts it, “Incompetence masks the ability to recognize the incompetence.” The omnivorous nature of his curiosities is the book’s most consistently surprising and enjoyable element; he can move with ease from investigating the nature of acoustics (and audio illusions) to the human tendency to invest all kinds of inanimate objects and processes with personalities. These and other subjects (whether or not plants feel pain, for instance) take on new elements of interest when examined through the lens of storytelling. And throughout the volume, the author is mindful of the perils inherent in this habit of spinning yarns. “The more an answer feels right to you, the more certain you are of its correctness,” he writes in one of his many reflections on the insidious process of confirmation bias. “We use this feeling of rightness as evidence of accuracy.” Storytellers of all kinds will be captivated by every page. A shrewd and comprehensive study of the importance of reality construction in human life.
