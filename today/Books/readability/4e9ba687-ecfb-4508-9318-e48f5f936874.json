These sweeping sci-fi stories blend cosmic stakes with raw human emotion because even at the edge of the universe, love and hope refuse to die quietly. Overmorrow (The Overmorrow Rites Book 1) by Lancelot Schaubert Release Date: June 24, 2025 A magical monster named Oblivion kidnaps Ellie’s elder brother. She believes Oblivion wants to use her brother as a backup memory, a backup hard drive. She encounters Overmorrow – a magical rain that wakes up normal New Yorkers to the wonder and horror. But Oblivion makes them forget: if we forget our monsters, they’re free to eat us whole. Buy on Amazon The Incomer (Kirkglen Guild Book 1) by Paula Harmon Release Date: July 1, 2025 Rose moves to remote Kirkglen while a cure is found for her werewolf brother, Simon. But no one will let them hide. Emmeline of the local Guild, then the mysterious Sky, and then Rob, a local musician, seem determined to uncover their secrets. As life becomes increasingly sinister, Rose begins to wonder: does the Guild want them to leave, or die? Buy on Amazon The Pilot (The Last Horizon Book 4) by Will Wight (Author) Release Date: July 1, 2025 “Sheep, sheep, sheep…I have bad news for you. It’s finally my turn.” Solstice, the secret organization running the Galactic Union, has made an enemy of The Last Horizon. Soon, they will regret it. Varic and Omega have a plan to infiltrate and destroy Solstice’s leaders, removing another threat to the galaxy. Compared to the apocalyptic monsters the crew has faced in the past, this opponent should be simple. Buy on Amazon Ghoul Summer (A Witch on the Rocks Cozy Mystery Book 11) by Lily Harper Hart (Author) Release Date: July 1, 2025 A day at a Tampa festival brings laughter and questions for Hali Waverly and Gray Hunter.

Buy on Amazon Etherious: Originator (The System’s Descent: Etherious Book 4) by Emes Release Date: July 1, 2025 With the Locus of Power behind him, Arthur has bested stronger enemies than most will ever face. He thought he was returning to peace, but the System law had been broken. Alien races walk the land before their time, and they have his name on their lips. His power means he is feared. His blood makes him a target. Has humanity been betrayed? Buy on Amazon A Thousand Li: the Fourth Wall by Tao Wong Release Date: July 1, 2025 The half-Immortal tyrant of Cai has been defeated, but at a devastating cost. Wu Ying has sacrificed both his chance at immortality and his greatest treasure. Now, gravely injured and with his cultivation path shattered, he has to rebuild with the help of his friends.
