  "text": "24 Dec 2024 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Verwaist aus Missbrauch? The story behind this story is the love of money. Multiple things have inspired me to write this book, one being the growing materialistic mindset in society today, and another being early illustrations I have drawn while they were not yet turned into a book. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I have multiple genres I enjoy reading, such as religion and spirituality, fantasy themes, and sometimes mild horror. These are often similar to the genres I write, or they may all be formed into one in my writing. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? I enjoyed writing many scenes in my book, but my favorite to write was the chapter when the protagonist, King Miserabelaherzeria, returns to his adopted daughter, Dorothea, as an angelic ghost and tells her the peace he has finally found in heaven, where there are no riches or gold. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I do not have many quirky writing habits, but one way I often triggered my inspiration and imagination was listening to my favorite music, mainly symphonic rock and metal. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? The only philosophy I live by is the Christian faith, which I think is much more than a philosophy. If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? I want my readers to remember many things after reading my book, but I have to say the main thing I want them to know is that Jesus loves them, and suffered and died for them. He offers them a gift greater than fame and riches, and this gift alone can truly provide pure happiness, and it is his love and an eternal life with Him.
