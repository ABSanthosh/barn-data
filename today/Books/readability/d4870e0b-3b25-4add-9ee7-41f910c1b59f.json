  "description": "The story begins with biblical figures Isaiah and Micah delivering prophecies. Isaiah is depicted as a drunkard whose prophecies are intentionally ambiguous, while Micah communicates mostly with a group of cats. The latter learns of Isaiah’s prophecy of a virgin birth and tries to one-up him by predicting that the birth will be in Bethlehem. Joseph is a humble carpenter from Nazareth, while Mary is a strong-willed young woman sent to that town by her parents to separate her from her rebellious friend, Vashti. Mary and Joseph develop a romantic relationship, and as they travel to Bethlehem for the Roman census, they anticipate the disapproval of Mary's strict, religious parents. When they arrive, they meet “The Keeper,” a 103-year-old innkeeper who helps Mary bring her child into the world in a stable. Mary’s father, Jerome, and the High Priest join forces and convince drunken shepherds to spread a fabricated story about an angelic visitation and coerce the Wise Men to proclaim the miracle of Jesus’ birth. Soon, Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus leave Bethlehem to escape the ensuing chaos. As the family settles into their journey, they reflect on the strange events that have shaped their lives; the story concludes in a modern setting. Burkland’s satirical recasting of the New Testament account of Jesus’ origins is most successful in its humorous character descriptions, as when it paints Jerome as “a noodle of a man with…rapidly receding hair that looked as though a handful of thin, lethargic worms had been indiscriminately dumped on top of his tiny head.” The dialogue is similarly clever, as it offers critiques of the era’s conventions, as when Mary’s mother, Elisheba, says to her daughter: “You may be a grown woman of fourteen, but you are in my house.” Devout Christian readers will take issue with some aspects of the tale, but overall, it offers a humorous departure from the original text that many readers will enjoy.",

  "text": "THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: July 1, 2004 Heartfelt, yes, but pretty routine. Life lessons. Angie Malone, the youngest of a big, warm Italian-American family, returns to her Pacific Northwest hometown to wrestle with various midlife disappointments: her divorce, Papa’s death, a downturn in business at the family restaurant, and, above all, her childlessness. After several miscarriages, she, a successful ad exec, and husband Conlan, a reporter, befriended a pregnant young girl and planned to adopt her baby—and then the birth mother changed her mind. Angie and Conlan drifted apart and soon found they just didn’t love each other anymore. Metaphorically speaking, “her need for a child had been a high tide, an overwhelming force that drowned them. A year ago, she could have kicked to the surface but not now.” Sadder but wiser, Angie goes to work in the struggling family restaurant, bickering with Mama over updating the menu and replacing the ancient waitress. Soon, Angie befriends another young girl, Lauren Ribido, who’s eager to learn and desperately needs a job. Lauren’s family lives on the wrong side of the tracks, and her mother is a promiscuous alcoholic, but Angie knows nothing of this sad story and welcomes Lauren into the DeSaria family circle. The girl listens in, wide-eyed, as the sisters argue and make wisecracks and—gee-whiz—are actually nice to each other. Nothing at all like her relationship with her sluttish mother, who throws Lauren out when boyfriend David, en route to Stanford, gets her pregnant. Will Lauren, who’s just been accepted to USC, let Angie adopt her baby? Well, a bit of a twist at the end keeps things from becoming too predictable. Heartfelt, yes, but pretty routine.
