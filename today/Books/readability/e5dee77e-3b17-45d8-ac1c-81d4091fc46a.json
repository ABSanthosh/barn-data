  "description": "Big is a dream who towers over all the other dreams in his town. In this story, they all have only two goals: to find their matching person and to help them realize their dream; when they’re successful, the dreams turn blue. As other, smaller dreams match up with their people, Big finds himself left alone, without a dreamer. He searches across town, but most people either ignore him or are intimidated by his giant size—but he continues his quest, ignoring the fact that others tease him, and refusing to quit. Over the course of this book, Sirls flips the common idea of people not giving up on dreams, offering a refreshing take that makes for an enthralling tale: “But Big was a dream / and everyone knows / that dreams never give up.” San Vicente’s whimsical cartoon illustrations help make this book stand out even further; most of the drawings are grayscale with only a few intentionally colored objects. The few spots of color give the story’s events and ultimate outcome a uniquely dramatic effect.",

  "text": "LITTLE BLUE TRUCK'S SPRINGTIME From the Little Blue Truck series by Alice Schertle ; illustrated by Jill McElmurry ‧ RELEASE DATE: Jan. 2, 2018 Uncomplicated fun that sets readers up for the earlier, more-complicated books to come. Little Blue Truck and his pal Toad meet friends old and new on a springtime drive through the country. This lift-the-flap, interactive entry in the popular Little Blue Truck series lacks the narrative strength and valuable life lessons of the original Little Blue Truck (2008) and its sequel, Little Blue Truck Leads the Way (2009). Both of those books, published for preschoolers rather than toddlers, featured rich storylines, dramatic, kinetic illustrations, and simple but valuable life lessons—the folly of taking oneself too seriously, the importance of friends, and the virtue of taking turns, for example. At about half the length and with half as much text as the aforementioned titles, this volume is a much quicker read. Less a story than a vernal celebration, the book depicts a bucolic drive through farmland and encounters with various animals and their young along the way. Beautifully rendered two-page tableaux teem with butterflies, blossoms, and vibrant pastel, springtime colors. Little Blue greets a sheep standing in the door of a barn: “Yoo-hoo, Sheep! / Beep-beep! / What’s new?” Folding back the durable, card-stock flap reveals the barn’s interior and an adorable set of twin lambs. Encounters with a duck and nine ducklings, a cow with a calf, a pig with 10 (!) piglets, a family of bunnies, and a chicken with a freshly hatched chick provide ample opportunity for counting and vocabulary work. Uncomplicated fun that sets readers up for the earlier, more-complicated books to come.
