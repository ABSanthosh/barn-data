  "text": "Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead series is a favorite at Book Riot: we even named it one of the best book series of all time. Needless to say, there’s a lot of excitement around here for the news about an upcoming Martin Scorsese adaptation. Gilead was published in 2004 and won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, but this is the first time it will be appearing on screen. The final book in the quartet, Jack, came out in 2020. The series will be developed by Apple Original Films, and Martin Scorsese will be a writer, producer, and director, alongside Killers of the Flower Moon director Todd Field. The first Gilead movie being produced is based on the second book in the series, Home. It will star Leonardo DiCaprio.",
