  "description": "Joan Baez Smith, nicknamed “Baezy” (“rhymes with daisy”), is very excited about her upcoming birthday present. Her physicist mother has used her connections to allow her to pass through a Time Insertion Protocol portal to go back to Bethel, New York, in 1969 to see the famed Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Not only will Baezy get to see Joan Baez perform, but she’ll also get to meet her distant relative, Kelly Jean Adams, whose mathematical genius set the world on the path to the future utopia in which Baezy lives. In a flash, Baezy travels from December 13, 2101, to August 15th, 1969, falling right into the path of Jack Warren, the best friend of Baezy’s great-great-great-grandmother. She meets Kelly’s traveling group and introduces herself as Sarah Sandoval, an alias that the Time Insertion Protocol employees found for her. As Sarah, Baezy gets to enjoy the music of Woodstock, the food of the time period, and the kindness of strangers brought together by the one-of-a-kind event. However, she didn’t expect that she wouldn’t get along with her ancestor, and that she’d find herself falling in love with Jack. In this offbeat time-travel novel, readers and music lovers alike will delight in the Woodstock-set scenes, as well as all the references to famous musicians who played there, including Baezy’s namesake: “Sarah jumped to her feet when Joan began belting the chorus, her voice washing over the crowd clear and strong.” Overall, this book is both a nostalgic and occasionally critical ode to the 1969 music scene and an SF novel about a futuristic society altering the flow of the past, and it manages to weave the two elements together in an entertaining way. The specific focus on the Woodstock music festival gives this novel a unique spin that genre aficionados are likely to enjoy.",

  "text": "DEVOLUTION by Max Brooks ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 16, 2020 A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 224 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Are we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006). A zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene. A tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.
