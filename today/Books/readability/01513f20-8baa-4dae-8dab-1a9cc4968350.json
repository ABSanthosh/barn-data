Barnes and Noble has announced its winner for the 2024 Book of the Year, and it’s James by Percival Everett. The announcement page says, “We’ve bent your ear about James all year, and for good reason. […] You may think you know Huck Finn, but how well do you know Jim? Flip the script on an American classic as Huck Finn steps to the side and Jim takes center stage in a powerful, and often very funny, story of family, home and freedom.” In response to the win, Percival Everett said, “As my teenagers would say, ‘Cool.’ This honor is unexpected and quite amazing. B\u0026N has already done a remarkable job selling my novel and now this. To have the novel in front of so many readers is what all of us want. Thank you.” In addition, Barnes and Noble selected two more categories for their book of the year: Best Gift Book of the Year, which went to The Backyard Bird Chronicles by Amy Tan, and Best Children’s Book of the Year, which went to Impossible Creatures by Katherine Rundell.
