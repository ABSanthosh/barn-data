  "description": "“At home, my confidence shows, / at home, my bravery glows.” But when the young narrator is out and about, everything changes. Interacting with other kids at the park is “a big task.” “I try to play, I try to shout, / but my brave voice just won’t come out!” Though the protagonist looks forward to school, upon arrival, “fear replaces my words, and my legs start to shake.” When the teacher asks a question, the child’s “glow” is nearly extinguished. But the narrator is comforted by Mum and Dad’s repeated reassurance: “It’s OK to feel upset, / my brave muscles haven’t grown fully just yet.” As the narrator practices “brave talking” at the park, a restaurant, and more with the help of a special present, those muscles gradually strengthen: “My glow stays bright even though my voice is still small, / each time I am brave, / I feel 10 feet tall!” Reinforcing the emotionally descriptive rhyming text, Baykovska’s expressive cartoon illustrations sympathetically convey the contrast between the talkative exuberance the narrator displays at home and the sadness and anxiety experienced in public. The narrator and the rest of the family have tan skin; background characters are racially diverse. Backmatter includes tips and resources on selective mutism for caregivers.",

  "text": "ON THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN by Tish Rabe ; illustrated by Laura Hughes ‧ RELEASE DATE: June 21, 2016 While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of... Rabe follows a young girl through her first 12 days of kindergarten in this book based on the familiar Christmas carol. The typical firsts of school are here: riding the bus, making friends, sliding on the playground slide, counting, sorting shapes, laughing at lunch, painting, singing, reading, running, jumping rope, and going on a field trip. While the days are given ordinal numbers, the song skips the cardinal numbers in the verses, and the rhythm is sometimes off: “On the second day of kindergarten / I thought it was so cool / making lots of friends / and riding the bus to my school!” The narrator is a white brunette who wears either a tunic or a dress each day, making her pretty easy to differentiate from her classmates, a nice mix in terms of race; two students even sport glasses. The children in the ink, paint, and collage digital spreads show a variety of emotions, but most are happy to be at school, and the surroundings will be familiar to those who have made an orientation visit to their own schools. While this is a fairly bland treatment compared to Deborah Lee Rose and Carey Armstrong-Ellis’ The Twelve Days of Kindergarten (2003), it basically gets the job done.
