  "description": "Today, Al Jolson (1886-1950) is famous mainly as the star of 1927’s The Jazz Singer, the first feature-length synchronized-sound film. More specifically, he’s famous for singing its showstopper, “My Mammy,” in blackface, a performance that would be unthinkable today. But in his heyday, Jolson was the best-paid entertainer on Broadway (earning $5,000 weekly at one point). In Bernstein's thoughtful account, the author of Out of the Blue (2003), China 1945 (2014), and other works, doesn’t diminish blackface’s offensiveness, but he strives to give it some meaningful context in terms of Jolson’s life and Jewish American entertainers more generally. “In enlightened, post-civil-rights-movement America,” Bernstein writes, “blackface has come to be like the swastika and the N-word, banned from public spaces. But at the time that Jolson adopted it, it was taken for granted; it was a sort of stock image, a cliché.” Born in a Lithuanian shtetl as Asa Yoelson, Jolson arrived in America hungry to assimilate and was performing onstage by the time he was 12. At the start of the 20th century, Jolson was part of a wave of Jewish Americans leading an incursion into American culture, playing leadership roles in theaters and film. It’s often forgotten that The Jazz Singer, based on a short story and play by Samson Raphaelson, was inspired by Jolson’s own story: a young Jewish cantor torn between the allure of Broadway spotlights and the demands of his family’s faith. Within that plot, Bernstein finds a rich allegory not just for Jolson’s life but for the experience of Jews in America “who came nearly to dominate American popular culture, remaking themselves and remaking the country in the process.” It’s not a full-dress Jolson bio, but some elements—particularly his abusiveness toward women—are glossed over.",

  "text": "KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON THE OSAGE MURDERS AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI by David Grann ‧ RELEASE DATE: April 18, 2017 Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 53 Our Verdict GET IT Kirkus Reviews' Best Books Of 2017 New York Times Bestseller IndieBound Bestseller National Book Award Finalist Greed, depravity, and serial murder in 1920s Oklahoma. During that time, enrolled members of the Osage Indian nation were among the wealthiest people per capita in the world. The rich oil fields beneath their reservation brought millions of dollars into the tribe annually, distributed to tribal members holding \"headrights\" that could not be bought or sold but only inherited. This vast wealth attracted the attention of unscrupulous whites who found ways to divert it to themselves by marrying Osage women or by having Osage declared legally incompetent so the whites could fleece them through the administration of their estates. For some, however, these deceptive tactics were not enough, and a plague of violent death—by shooting, poison, orchestrated automobile accident, and bombing—began to decimate the Osage in what they came to call the \"Reign of Terror.\" Corrupt and incompetent law enforcement and judicial systems ensured that the perpetrators were never found or punished until the young J. Edgar Hoover saw cracking these cases as a means of burnishing the reputation of the newly professionalized FBI. Bestselling New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn't stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann's crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs. Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.

Bestselling \u003ci\u003eNew Yorker\u003c/i\u003e staff writer Grann (\u003ci\u003eThe Devil and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession\u003c/i\u003e, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn\u0026#39;t stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann\u0026#39;s crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by dozens of period photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n                                        Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n                                \n\n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePub Date:\u003c/b\u003e April 18, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eISBN:\u003c/b\u003e 978-0-385-53424-6\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePage Count:\u003c/b\u003e 352\u003c/p\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePublisher:\u003c/b\u003e Doubleday\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                        \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eReview Posted Online:\u003c/b\u003e Feb. 1, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                         \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKirkus Reviews Issue:\u003c/b\u003e Feb. 15, 2017\u003c/p\u003e\n                                    \u003c/div\u003e\n                                \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                                \n\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \n                                \n                            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
