View All posts by Kendra Winchester There are few things that I love more than reading nonfiction books with incredible prose. I lose myself in underlining, annotating, and thinking through ideas in the text. Sometimes I read a sentence and just think, “Wow, what a sentence!” Here are a few books that I just adored reading and think have some especially noteworthy prose.Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval by Saidiya Hartman Saidiya Hartman writes incredibly beautiful prose. She tells the story of the Black women she read about who were mentioned in passing or who appeared unnamed in photographs. She investigates their lives, researches their pasts, and invites readers to bear witness to these women all too often lost from history. These women come alive on the page in such a beautiful way. This book is incredibly captivating and intricately crafted. Enjoying what you’re reading?

Conditional Citizens: On Belonging in America by Laila Lalami Lalami’s essays examine her experience moving to the U.S. from Morocco in hopes of pursuing the American Dream. She’d heard so much about the success one could achieve in America. But when she finally arrives in America and as she follows her path to U.S. citizenship, she begins to rethink her initial assumptions. She starts to think that the American Dream is really only available for certain kinds of immigrants. Lalami is an incredible prose stylist with such sharp observational skills. I love how she crafts each essay to be its own unique gem, but they all add to the overarching theme of the collection.
