  "text": "19 Feb 2025 What’s the story behind the story? What inspired you to write Empire of Temptation (New York State of Mafia Book 1)? I wanted to set a dark mafia story in a small town located in the Hudson Valley, New York. My previous series, the Kings of Italy, featured North American women who ended up in Italy with Italian dons. So this series is the reverse, with Italian dons ending up in North America. What’s your favorite genre to read? Is it the same as your favorite genre to write? I love dark romance and historical romance. What books are on your TBR pile right now? I am catching up on the recent Jessa Kane releases while I anxiously await the new Nikki Sloane. What scene in your book was your favorite to write? The dinner scene in New York’s Little Italy, because I brought in some characters from the previous series. It’s always fun to bring in old characters in a new story. Do you have any quirky writing habits? (lucky mugs, cats on laps, etc.) I play nature sounds as white noise when I write, so you might hear the sound of a rain forest or waterfall coming from my office. Do you have a motto, quote, or philosophy you live by? Write the book you’d want to read! If you could choose one thing for readers to remember after reading your book, what would it be? “Wow, that book was really HOT.” Buy The Book Sign up for our email and we’ll send you the best new books in your favorite genres weekly. meghan Recommended Posts",
