  "description": "The unnamed, single narrator works in journalism in New York City, covering topics large and small, local and national, in an editor-enforced“Plain-Jane…styleless” style, which makes her feel a hack. She has two roommates: Leon, a friend since childhood, and Susannah, a poet and e-commerce support staffer; another longtime pal, Ruth, shares the up and downs of her marriage and caring for her baby. Lonely and adrift, she doesn’t feel comfortable with her father (who’s remarried), her well-meaning but casually cruel mother, or her crowded rental apartment. She attends parties filled with people she doesn't know, has brief interactions with passing strangers, and tries to find love. Although other characters haphazardly bounce into and out of the narrative, her love interests receive the most attention—particularly Simon, a musician and paralegal with endearing and frustrating traits. The narrative is composed mostly of brief sketches of sensation, emotion, and action with no clear narrative thread, which gives the work an ethereal feel. Lewis skillfully wields sparse language to highlight the daily mundanities of navigating friendships, romantic relationships, and work, and also addresses the complexities of abortion. Occasionally, the sparsity gives way to beautiful imagery: “The river outside the window was motion and light, liquid hues like still-wet paint.” Small sensory details also breathe life into scenes: “Back at the house, my father’s trees bend in the curve of the wine glasses as I set the table.” Scenes of sex and flirtation appear often, as though the narrator wants to be reassured of her desirability; she also regularly highlights the technological changes rushing through society, as when a child thinks that “Don’t forget to subscribe!” means goodbye.",

  "text": "THE NIGHTINGALE by Kristin Hannah ‧ RELEASE DATE: Feb. 3, 2015 Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner. Hannah’s new novel is an homage to the extraordinary courage and endurance of Frenchwomen during World War II. In 1995, an elderly unnamed widow is moving into an Oregon nursing home on the urging of her controlling son, Julien, a surgeon. This trajectory is interrupted when she receives an invitation to return to France to attend a ceremony honoring passeurs: people who aided the escape of others during the war. Cut to spring, 1940: Viann has said goodbye to husband Antoine, who's off to hold the Maginot line against invading Germans. She returns to tending her small farm, Le Jardin, in the Loire Valley, teaching at the local school and coping with daughter Sophie’s adolescent rebellion. Soon, that world is upended: The Germans march into Paris and refugees flee south, overrunning Viann’s land. Her long-estranged younger sister, Isabelle, who has been kicked out of multiple convent schools, is sent to Le Jardin by Julien, their father in Paris, a drunken, decidedly unpaternal Great War veteran. As the depredations increase in the occupied zone—food rationing, systematic looting, and the billeting of a German officer, Capt. Beck, at Le Jardin—Isabelle’s outspokenness is a liability. She joins the Resistance, volunteering for dangerous duty: shepherding downed Allied airmen across the Pyrenees to Spain. Code-named the Nightingale, Isabelle will rescue many before she's captured. Meanwhile, Viann’s journey from passive to active resistance is less dramatic but no less wrenching. Hannah vividly demonstrates how the Nazis, through starvation, intimidation and barbarity both casual and calculated, demoralized the French, engineering a community collapse that enabled the deportations and deaths of more than 70,000 Jews. Hannah’s proven storytelling skills are ideally suited to depicting such cataclysmic events, but her tendency to sentimentalize undermines the gravitas of this tale. Still, a respectful and absorbing page-turner.
