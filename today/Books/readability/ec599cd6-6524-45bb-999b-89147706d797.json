  "description": "Libby Casey, who runs a design business, is inexplicably drawn to a colonial house for sale. She thinks moving there may be the change she needs, as she’s still in the home where she lived with her beloved husband, Ray, who died only 18 months earlier. She’s not at her new home for long before strange things begin to happen: A chair scrapes across the floor in the dead of night, and a glove, which her border collie mix Buck had found, mysteriously moves. These are just the first of many similar incidents, all of which Libby soon attributes to a ghost, likely the former homeowner from back in the 18th century. She dives into the estate’s history assisted by a diary excerpt and her eccentric neighbor, who may be psychic (the woman dismisses labels). Libby will do whatever she can to get rid of this ghost so that she (and maybe the spirit, too) can live in peace. McGroarty zeroes in on the bright cast, providing enriching details; Libby still mourns her lost husband and has trouble sleeping. As the ghost seemingly takes over her life, she deals with assorted reactions: Her amiable business partner, Harry, is supportive, but her friend Diana, sadly, tends to question Libby’s unsettling experiences (“I just think you might need a rest”). Though the ghostly occurrences are more curious than frightening, a concurrent plotline set in the 1700s turns increasingly dark. Along with the alternating plotlines, Libby’s concise narration keeps everything moving at a steady clip as she inches closer to revealing secrets, including one of her own. The wrap-up is wholly satisfying for every character, both present and past.",

  "text": "NEVER FLINCH by Stephen King ‧ RELEASE DATE: May 27, 2025 Even when King is not at his best, he’s still good. Awards \u0026 Accolades Likes 212 Our Verdict GET IT New York Times Bestseller Two killers are on the loose. Can they be stopped? In this ambitious mystery, the prolific and popular King tells the story of a serial murderer who pledges, in a note to Buckeye City police, to kill “13 innocents and 1 guilty,” in order, we eventually learn, to avenge the death of a man who was framed and convicted for possession of child pornography and then killed in prison. At the same time, the author weaves in the efforts of another would-be murderer, a member of a violently abortion-opposing church who has been stalking a popular feminist author and women’s rights activist on a publicity tour. To tell these twin tales of murders done and intended, King summons some familiar characters, including private investigator Holly Gibney, whom readers may recall from previous novels. Gibney is enlisted to help Buckeye City police detective Izzy Jaynes try to identify and stop the serial killer, who has been murdering random unlucky citizens with chilling efficiency. She’s also been hired as a bodyguard for author and activist Kate McKay and her young assistant. The author succeeds in grabbing the reader’s interest and holding it throughout this page-turning tale of terror, which reads like a big-screen thriller. The action is well paced, the settings are vividly drawn, and King’s choice to focus on the real and deadly dangers of extremist thought is admirable. But the book is hamstrung by cliched characters, hackneyed dialogue (both spoken and internal), and motives that feel both convoluted and overly simplistic. King shines brightest when he gets to the heart of our darkest fears and desires, but here the dangers seem a bit cerebral. In his warning letter to the police, the serial killer wonders if his cryptic rationale to murder will make sense to others, concluding, “It does to me, and that is enough.” Is it enough? In another writer’s work, it might not be, but in King’s skilled hands, it probably is. Even when King is not at his best, he’s still good.
