Oprah has announced that her book club pick for March 2025 is Dream State by Eric Puchner, which came out today. Here’s how Oprah’s Book Club describes it: Set in the days before a summer wedding at a lake house in Montana, the relationship between Cece and Charlie—the bride and groom-to-be—is tested after his best friend, Garrett, who’s officiating the upcoming nuptials, meets Cece. What happens next not only changes the trajectory of their lives, but also the lives of the next generation. Spanning fifty years, “Dream State” is an exquisite examination of the important relationships we have in our lives—love, marriage, friendship, and how life can turn out so differently than we expected. We promise you: it’s the kind of book you won’t want to put down written by an award-winning author who is truly a master storyteller.  Eric Puchner and Oprah discuss the book in a podcast hosted by Starbucks. In it, the two discuss his inspiration for the novel, writing a “different kind of marriage story,” male friendship, grief, parenting, and more. It’s available on YouTube as well as Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other podcast apps. Today In Books Newsletter Sign up to Today In Books to receive daily news and miscellany from the world of books.
