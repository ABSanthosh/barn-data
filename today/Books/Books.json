    "title": "FAMILY WEEK",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sarah-moon/family-week/",
    "description": "After a quartet of 4-year-olds built a block tower together at a Drag Queen Story Hour during Provincetown’s Family Week, their parents—an interracial, interfaith (Asian/white and Jewish) lesbian couple, an interracial, interfaith (Black/white and Jewish) gay couple, and a single lesbian mother (presumed white)—all decided to vacation together henceforth. But this Family Week, they’re bringing more emotional baggage than luggage. Milo (who’s academically gifted as well as trans) and his twin sister, Lina, are struggling with Milo’s upcoming departure for a fancy boarding school. Avery is heartbroken over her fathers’ impending divorce and the forthcoming baby sibling (Daddy’s new female partner is pregnant). Meanwhile, Mac, who’s been attending summer school to avoid repeating seventh grade, is just trying to figure out what he’s good at, especially in comparison to the gifted and people-pleasing Milo. With each weekday forming its own chapter, this short book packs in a lot and relies on overwhelmingly long sentences; as a result, the characters, conflicts, and emotions end up feeling rushed and underexplored. The breathless pace also means that each family feels more like a rough sketch rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Milo and Lina are biracial (Asian and white), Avery’s biracial (Black and white), and Mac presents white.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/suzanne-selfors/rosey-stink-badger-2-willows-woods/",
    "description": "While housesitting for her grandmother, young Willow has been dealing with some of the grosser items on her to-do list, like shoveling manure. She’d rather invite a friend over for a sleepover, but her pal Sam Squirrel (introduced in the series opener) is tied up with school. But before Willow can start cleaning the chicken coop, the birds erupt into chaos with the appearance of a rude queen bee who loves stealing other people’s homes. The only known beekeeper in the Quiet Woods is an allegedly fearsome stink badger. Determined to solve her own problems without calling in Mother Nature, Willow sets out to find the stink badger and oust the queen and her swarm from the coop before it’s too late. Her journey is gently amusing as she discovers strengths (like a gift for songwriting), confronts weaknesses (her practically nonexistent sense of direction), and figures out ways to resolve conflicts. Finally, when everyone else is too afraid, Willow must ignore (literal) warning signs to ask for expert help. Along the way, she makes a misunderstood friend. Though older readers may find the story’s resolution a bit predictable, all will enjoy getting to know the charmingly self-aware Willow as Selfors drops in a few hints about her backstory. Spotlight illustrations showcase adorably anthropomorphized animals. Willow is depicted with paper-white skin and described as having silver hair.",
