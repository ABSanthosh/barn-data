    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/nate-bargatze/big-dumb-eyes/",
    "description": "“This book is never trying to say anything even close to important,” writes comedian Bargatze, whose following has been blowing up lately thanks to a couple of well-received Saturday Night Live appearances—a surprise, perhaps, given his G-rated approach to comedy. Yet Bargatze, a native Tennessean, does dig a little deeper into important territory here, writing, for instance, that his paternal grandparents were alcoholics, the grandmother “basically what these days they’d call abusive,” unforgiving of his father’s speech impediment. Happily for his father, though, a sympathetic teacher got him interested in reading—and in magic, which led to comedy. There aren’t many family dynasties in stand-up, but Bargatze didn’t mind when his father opened for him once and killed, even though “I told him he couldn’t be too funny.” Bargatze writes affectingly of his beloved younger sister, working the Men in Black franchise deftly into one episode and a lovely little bit of pop culture into another (it would ruin the fun to say much more except that it concerns a dog and a certain all-girl group from way back when). Much of Bargatze’s approach onstage and here is observational, and he has a good eye for the goofy detail, recounting growing up in a town whose police force existed “for one reason, and that was to give people speeding tickets” and professing amazement that, in his adopted home of New York, people cleaned up after their dogs “every single time the dog did its business!” Bargatze is right that “the world of books is in the same place as it was before I entered it,” yet he turns in a pleasingly genial narrative all the same.",

    "title": "LESSONS FROM MY TEACHERS",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sarah-ruhl/lessons-from-my-teachers/",
    "description": "For playwright Ruhl, life has been a history of teachers. From her parents, through her kindergarten and school years, through college and graduate school, to professional life, Ruhl learns from everyone. She shows us how even the smallest moment can instruct, how a child can teach a parent, and how true creativity demands a willingness to learn. This is a memoir of brief anecdotes, told by a master storyteller. “Every Saturday, when I was a child, my father would take me to breakfast at Walker Brothers Pancake House, a place out of time in the suburbs of Chicago, full of stained glass and massive Dutch pancakes. My father taught me a new word every week. The ritual was holy to me. He would tell me the etymology, along with the word, so I could remember it.” In college, she meets a great Classicist, and he remains a presence in her life: “someone who opened his home to his students; someone who thought the ancients had something compelling to tell us about how to live life now, how to face grief now. On a stone building on campus, these words are etched: ‘Speak to the past and it shall teach thee.’” Eventually, Ruhl learns the greatest lesson: that we must, in the end, become our own best teachers—that what we learn from others is not content, knowledge, facts, or frameworks but a way of living. “I think that the best teachers secretly choose to keep teaching because they want to learn their whole lives long—and they know teaching is their best chance of learning.” Anyone who learns and teaches will find affirmation in this book.",
