    "description": "The first entry, “A Gringo Died Today,” kicks things off in a village in Guatemala. As the title suggests, the dead body of a foreigner is discovered on a beach; the story of how that dead body came to be there is one that lands a local in some serious trouble. In “The Eagle of the Desert,” an Englishman named Archie labors at an unpleasant yoga retreat in a Mexican desert run by a disagreeable American who calls himself Eagle. (Archie was present when the events of “A Gringo Died Today” occurred; he felt he needed to “get over something awful that happened on the beaches of Guatemala.”) “Teatime at the Cricket” takes the reader to England, where trouble ensues at a usually low-key Sunday cricket match. In “Whose Story?,” someone from that cricket match has a story to tell of an adventure in Greece—but the storyteller isn’t entirely truthful about his own actions. In “True Colours,” a businessman named Zach with an eye on becoming the new mayor of Oakland, California, is quite pleased with a new flag he is flying outside his home. Throughout the collection, the stories introduce knowable, nuanced characters. They come to life on the page, from Eagle, with his “long greying hair tied into a bun,” to Zach, who feels his flags say “more about him than words ever could.” In “Teatime,” Davies excels not only at describing the people involved but also at providing details about the sport at the heart of the story. (“Everyone says cricket is so slow but when you’re scoring it’s the fastest thing in the world.”) Occasionally, the outcomes prove predictable; for instance, it is clear from the get-go that the protagonist of “Whose Story?” will probably not amount to much of a hero. Nevertheless, the ways in which the stories intertwine add an additional level of intrigue to an already compelling cast of characters.",

    "title": "THE FIRST HOMOSEXUALS",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jonathan-d-katz/the-first-homosexuals/",
    "description": "Born out of the editors’ desire to “redress a long history of disinterest, ignorance, and/or active censorship around questions of gender and sexuality in art history and museum culture,” this lavish book by queer art historians Katz and Willis accompanies an exhibition at Wrightwood 659 in Chicago. It’s a project composed of a wide array of educative, informative, and opinionated essays alongside visually striking artwork illuminating the origin of queer identity evolving in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The representation of queer culture by a variety of talented artists and writers is on exquisite display; the book captures a period immersed in the struggle for greater queer visibility through the art of its era. Among the book’s more than 300 images—including paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photographs—are works by Berenice Abbott, Jean Cocteau, Thomas Eakins, and John Singer Sargent. A series of intellectually astute essays examines the origins of the word “homosexuality,” lesbian visibility in the arts, and the emergence of gender nonconformity in both the East and the West in the second half of the 19th century. The essays, many by culture experts, additionally analyze how the earliest artistic articulations of gender, sexuality, transgender identity, and same-sex desire and relationships would bloom into an emerging queer revolution of visibility, representation, and change. Organized geographically, provocative (frequently explicit) drawings, oil paintings, sculptures, and accompanying text vibrantly tell the story of a forgotten age in emerging queer history and how art became an escape and a method of survival for burgeoning homosexual populations across the globe.",
