    "description": "Lewis and Richardson, both of the British Museum, were inspired to assemble this book by the BBC TV series Digging for Britain, which describes the exploits of two English hobbyists who scour the countryside with their metal detectors. Readers will not regret looking it up. Organic objects decay (mostly); stone and bone survive; metals are a mixed bag. Amateur searchers, with or without detectors, find bottle caps, discarded toys, and metal scraps. Less often, items from distant times turn up—buttons, bullets, arrowheads, coins, jewelry, tools, and weapons. Almost no one finds a treasure trove or “hoard,” but “almost no one” among thousands of searchers produces a steady stream of bonanzas that will dazzle readers poring over the hundreds of crisp images. People on this island seemed to love burying stuff, and even Stone Age inhabitants had a taste for gold and knew what to do with it. Gold does not decompose, but it’s an exception, and most of the text describes efforts to find, extract, clean, reassemble, decipher, and interpret long-buried relics. Despite the lovely images, this book alone should not be anyone’s introduction to prehistoric Britain. The authors deliver a short summary of the era at the beginning of each chapter but stay focused on the objects themselves: the finders’ experience as well as that of the landowners. Rich hoards have sold for immense sums to private collectors, but precious metals and “treasures” belong to the nation, and public-spirited owners donate what they find.",

    "description": "Sabrina Finkelstein is juggling library school, part-time work at a branch of the New York Public Library, and a geriatric roommate she adores. Marcia Haber is a spry, independent 72. The two met on an intergenerational app meant to match seniors who could use a hand around the house with young people who could use a break on rent. When her grandson, Adam, is laid off from his job in Philadelphia, he comes to stay with Marcia and Sabrina. He’s hot, passionate about books, and excited to connect with his grandmother. Adam’s father had broken off contact with Marcia years ago when she came out as bisexual, and Sabrina doesn’t mind having Adam crash on the sofa, because it gives Marcia a chance to reconnect with her grandson. Soon, the chemistry between Sabrina and Adam is palpable, aided by their two-person YA book club, and the close quarters make for a steamy buildup. Then, returning from a disastrous first date, Marcia nearly catches Sabrina and Adam in a steamy make-out session. Sensing how this might complicate their housing situation, they decide to keep things platonic. But after Marcia has a minor health scare, her doctor suggests that living with two young people is causing her undue stress, and she asks Adam to move out. Adam—unbeknownst to his grandmother—tells Sabrina he thinks she should be the one to leave, and their hot secret romance turns into a competition to prove who’s the best fit for their septuagenarian roommate. This forced-proximity romance is a cozy homage to intergenerational friendships, New York City, romance novel fandom, and grand gestures. As romantic leads, Adam and Sabrina are compelling, and the occupational and financial uncertainty faced by single 20-somethings is very real, but readers might just find that the secondary story of Marcia’s foray into senior dating on the apps is what they stick around for.",
