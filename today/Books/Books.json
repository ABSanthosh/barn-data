    "description": "After a quartet of 4-year-olds built a block tower together at a Drag Queen Story Hour during Provincetown’s Family Week, their parents—an interracial, interfaith (Asian/white and Jewish) lesbian couple, an interracial, interfaith (Black/white and Jewish) gay couple, and a single lesbian mother (presumed white)—all decided to vacation together henceforth. But this Family Week, they’re bringing more emotional baggage than luggage. Milo (who’s academically gifted as well as trans) and his twin sister, Lina, are struggling with Milo’s upcoming departure for a fancy boarding school. Avery is heartbroken over her fathers’ impending divorce and the forthcoming baby sibling (Daddy’s new female partner is pregnant). Meanwhile, Mac, who’s been attending summer school to avoid repeating seventh grade, is just trying to figure out what he’s good at, especially in comparison to the gifted and people-pleasing Milo. With each weekday forming its own chapter, this short book packs in a lot and relies on overwhelmingly long sentences; as a result, the characters, conflicts, and emotions end up feeling rushed and underexplored. The breathless pace also means that each family feels more like a rough sketch rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Milo and Lina are biracial (Asian and white), Avery’s biracial (Black and white), and Mac presents white.",

    "description": "Callie is grieving both her mother, who died three years ago, and everything she left back in London after her father moved them to the mountains of Northern Ireland. Her life is further upended when a house mysteriously crash-lands in her garden before turning invisible. The house’s desperate owner, magician Winnifred Potts, asks Callie for help. Winnifred was using a magic substance known as Wanderdust to move her home, but something went wrong, and the Wanderdust scattered. Winnifred can’t leave her house, so Callie must look for the Wanderdust. She enlists her new friend Sam, but before they can start searching, they discover the cause of the disaster: Callie’s homesickness was so severe that it repelled the magic, jeopardizing both Winnifred and her house. After the guilt-ridden Callie attempts to use Winnifred’s magic to return to London, her efforts only make the situation more dire. But Callie’s sudden revelations about friendship and home help her as she decides to put things right, leading to a disappointingly rushed climax. Though the fantastical elements are intriguing, they feel overshadowed by the heavy-handed moral (“Home isn’t a place…Home is the people”). Playful illustrations are interspersed thoughtfully, breaking up the text for younger readers. Callie and Sam are light-skinned, while Winnifred has box braids and is depicted with darker skin.",
