    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jerome-sueur/natural-history-of-silence/",
    "description": "An eco-acoustic researcher at the Natural History Museum in Paris, Sueur has long been listening to the sounds of the earth, animals, and humans. Inspired by the work of the late Canadian soundscape composer R. Murray Schafer and Bernie Krause, a soundscape ecologist and author of The Great Animal Orchestra (2012), Sueur has traveled on “acoustic quests” to remote French forests and distant jungles in South America. One place he visits, the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the Alps, prohibits noise in a surrounding zone of silence—as mandated by a 1975 decree. With humor and passion, Sueur describes his fascination with flora, fauna, dinosaurs, and genetics. One might call Sueur a sophisticated listening machine who sought the absence of sound and noise and discovered that, in fact, “sound and noise are everywhere.” He writes, “Silence is by no means an emptiness or a negation. It is rich and contains information essential to animal communication and to the structuring of natural systems. It is a contested resource and a space to be filled.” Helen Morrison’s translation preserves the vitality and charm of Sueur’s original French text. “Making noise is exhilarating,” he acknowledges. “Who has not experienced a certain sense of power on a moped, a motorbike, in a car or a boat travelling at speed and defying the passing of time?” And yet Sueur hopes we can cut out the “acoustic waste” in our lives and “reintroduce natural sounds”—of crickets, frogs, owls, and any number of creatures. And of plants and trees in the forest that, as he beautifully puts it, “become the instruments and musicians of the wind.”",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/h-doug-matsuoka/the-seventh-partita-a-novel-in-the-form-of-a-ricercare/",
    "description": "Kaden Dave Oshima is a musicologist and “old crackpot musician” (he’s in his mid-60s) living in Honolulu. In his own words, he leads an “uncertain existence of contemplation” in which he ponders “morality, truth, ecstasy, and clear understanding from this world.” He is a devotee of Bach’s incomparable music and believes that in addition to the composer’s six partitas, all published in 1731, there must be a seventh, unpublished one—Kaden reasons that the structure of the six known partitas indicates a concluding seventh in F major. Unsurprisingly, his attention is gripped when he is contacted by a man named James Zhao, who explains that his younger sister Susan, an accomplished violinist, has vanished—and that he has reason to believe that she possessed Bach’s missing piece of music. In this mesmerizing work, Kaden is given a chance to find the composition he passionately imagines and whose absence he grieves like a lost lover. (“Fortunately, he is called master because he was so prolific, and what survives serves to make us mourn what is lost.”) The author’s knowledge of the relevant music is simply magisterial, and Kaden’s passion is infectious—one could not read this book without wanting to listen to Bach’s work. At the heart of this arresting narrative is the question of what it means to properly preserve the works of artistic masters (modern interpretations of Bach “do not preserve Bach for humanity, they destroy it”). Matsuoka’s writing is eccentrically absorbing; readers are pulled into a world where art reigns supreme and its passionate adoration is the prime mover.",
