    "title": "JOB JUNKY",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rudy-ridolfo/job-junky/",
    "description": "Ridolfo started working when he was only 12 years old, manning the counter at his parents’ grocery store, the humble beginning to an extraordinarily long, diverse list of jobs. Before he broke into show business as an actor and an indie filmmaker, he had no choice but to support himself with a “lifetime of phantom jobs,” which amounted to 40 years of disposable positions. In this brief memoir, fewer than 100 pages long, he reflects on nearly 50 of the most eventful ones, each presented as a comic (and sometimes dramatic) anecdote. While he worked jobs in his eventual profession—actor, screenwriter, even an actors workshop instructor—he filled plenty of random roles: lumberyard worker, martial arts teacher, and night club manager, to name a small sampling. In one particularly entertaining vignette, he describes working as a translator for someone appearing in court who pretended he was unable to speak English (“Sorry. I don’ understand… issa not true”). From this wry tale emerges a thoughtful refection on the nature of transitory employment. Ridolfo was rarely fired—maybe half a dozen times—because he never presented himself as too good for a job (he’d adopted his mother’s “unspoken gracious undertone”). Also, he was buoyed by his own professional aspirations: “Then again, I was at an advantage because I believed that I was going to create something that I was pursuing so it was a lot easier for me to detach myself because I was driven by something else.” This is an admirably candid, astute remembrance, one that should captivate anyone stuck in the waiting room of a dead-end job, planning for something more.",

    "title": "THE HEART IS MEAT",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-backus/the-heart-is-meat/",
    "description": "Through an unfolding series of raw moods and memories, author Backus transports himself back to 1983, when, as a young man out of college, he’d just arrived in Manhattan from Indiana, driving his dead grandmother’s 1968 Chevy Caprice to work at a pork-packing company with dreams of becoming a writer. His mundane work of meat processing is made entertaining courtesy of a dramatically animated crew of Vietnam veterans and local aggressive bruisers with names like Big Ed, Dinky Peter, Manny the Spic, Jersey City Johnny, and “pre-Vietnam era” Gummy. Also keeping him afloat and awake are afternoons fueled by a carefully calibrated combination of speed and heroin, though the speed made him “aggressive and profane and prone to street incidents with strangers.” Together with his exasperatingly tolerant girlfriend, Maya, in their East Village apartment with four cats, he works days and parties nightly, stumbling home dodging junkies and homeless encampments and fending off campy, brazen sex workers. Across random adventures with friends, family, colorful inner-city dwellers, and new job opportunities, the memoir reads like transgressive fiction as Backus dizzyingly re-creates scene after scene of pure 1980s Manhattan, immersing the reader into a forgotten early-AIDS era in New York history filled with music, queer leather biker bars, bathroom-stall meth snorting, sweaty disco dance floors, and conceptual art shows. The author concludes two years later, in 1985, when AIDS has begun ravaging the queer community and his relationship is dissolving. A bittersweet epilogue written in 2013 catches up with his former co-workers and reflects on the dwindling vitality evident across the Big Apple. Using a cleverly depicted, vivid blend of atmosphere and attitude, Backus reaches back decades to a twitchy era of drug-soaked reality to deliver a uniquely raw, significant slice of life in exacting detail.",
