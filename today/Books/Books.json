    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/forest-mcmullin/shooting-at-shadows/",
    "description": "Photojournalist Ethan McGuire takes pictures of those on the fringes of society: tattoo artists, cock fighters, spiritualists, burn victims. His current job has him tagging along with a group of white supremacists staging a rally in the Finger Lakes town of Geneva, New York. Ethan chooses this subject in part because he’s disturbed by the casual racism that permeates the suburbs of Rochester, where his daughters—10-year-old Mary and teenage Kath—live with his ex-wife, Robin. The photo shoot doesn’t go quite as planned—the skinheads are overwhelmed by protestors and, in an attempt to save one of the younger racists from getting beaten with a baseball bat, Ethan winds up striking a protester in the head with his camera. Due in part to this temporary confusion in loyalties, Ethan decides to pursue the skinheads project deeper. “The story isn’t simple because racism isn’t simple, people aren’t simple,” he tells his photo agent. “I haven’t figured out whether these are monsters wearing effective disguises or there’s a bit of a monster inside all of us.” Little does Ethan know, but he hasn’t even met the real monsters yet—the kind who rob banks and commit murders…and sometimes carry badges. McMullin documents Ethan’s journey with photographic precision, as here, where he describes a trip to a gun dealer: “Spread out on the table were the parts of a rifle…It appeared new and the oily metal surfaces were shiny in the clear morning sun. Unlike the clarity of the day, the young people looked a little bleary eyed, but still listened and watched with as much concentration as they could muster.” Though set in 2010, the novel feels particularly timely, and the perpetually zoomed-in Ethan serves as a compelling guide to this extremist subculture. One hopes that McMullin has further adventures planned for his unlikely hero.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sofie-wells/the-tales-of-charlie-wags-wells/",
    "description": "Charlie Wags is a small and fluffy brown dog who lives in a house with a lovely garden. He’s a very ordinary dog aside from his love of travel and his unique ability to wag his tail and teleport to brand-new fabulous locations. Today, Charlie has decided on Paris, and with a little wag, he’s off to the Louvre. Charlie goes to see the Palace of Versailles, takes a boat ride on the Seine, and marvels at the Eiffel Tower as it glitters beneath the nighttime sky. He even has time to stop at a cafe for some pastry delicacies (“a taste of Paris in each treat!”). Wells and Barclay tell a very gentle and sweet story. Sjöström’s illustrations are beautifully rendered in watercolors; in a unique touch, the texture of the watercolor paper is visible underneath the images. Much care was taken to create fully realized backgrounds for Charlie’s adventures. The text includes pronunciation guides for the French attractions on each page, though it may be difficult for beginning readers to decode the cursive writing. After the story’s conclusion, readers will find more information about each place Charlie visited in Paris.",
