    "description": "Trying to forget a violent encounter with a serial killer, Arista settles into her new home in Sedona, Arizona. The New-Agey town seems like a good fit. Interested in magic, she works at a shop called Cosmic Prisms that sells items like crystals and candles. Living with her Aunt Bethie, the co-leader of a coven, Arista learns witchcraft. It’s unclear what supernatural abilities Arista possesses, but she practices reading auras and randomly channels Bethie’s dead grandfather. Still, Arista misses many aspects of her former home in Boulder Creek, California: the pines and redwoods, ex-boyfriend Shane, and her mountain house, built by Bethie’s grandpa. Forever casting a dark shadow over Arista’s life is her Uncle Fergus. Reuniting with the parents who seemingly abandoned her, Arista learns they only wanted to hide her from Fergus’ malevolence. But their sacrifice may have been in vain. Arista’s mother is near death, and Fergus hasn’t given up. Bethie’s coven decides Arista should return to her Boulder Creek house to release the ghost inside her. Meanwhile, Fergus, in possession of Bethie’s family athame (ceremonial blade), pursues his deepest obsession: killing Arista to transfer her magical abilities to himself. Dodd’s second installment of a trilogy opens with a winding drive and crash on a mountain road and maintains a fast and twisty momentum throughout, yet the pace slows down enough for well-rounded character development. Arista, appearing to be positive and upbeat, also exhibits grief, searing anger, and a self-hatred that she sometimes allows “to sink its sharp teeth into her.” The always-intriguing cast includes Arista’s irritating but sassy co-worker Stevie, artist Mr. Tessay, and an eerie child, Soonsil, emitting growls while hugging a plushie. Sedona’s and Boulder Creek’s landscapes are vividly drawn, though it’s clear which one Arista prefers. Sedona’s natural monuments are “overbearing, like emotionless godheads” while Boulder Creek’s “lush evergreen” trees are “majestic…yet so full of life.” The gripping book ends on a cliffhanger, setting up the final installment.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jeanne-theoharis/king-of-the-north/",
    "description": "For decades, biographers have focused on Martin Luther King Jr.’s successful leadership in the South while suggesting that his Northern activism failed because it lacked direction and local support. Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, upends this narrative by painstakingly documenting King’s relentless and impassioned battles against Northern discrimination and police brutality, an effort that had its origins in his experiences as a graduate student in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Author of The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks (2013), Theoharis also presents a fully developed picture of Coretta Scott King’s activism, both in tandem and apart from her husband, whom she met as a student in Boston. Neither of the Kings forgot the racism they encountered as students in the North, and they worked with local organizers to address it throughout their lives. Yet time and time again the same white Northern politicians who praised King’s civil rights work in the South either fell silent or became combative when King turned his attention to the systemic racism of the North. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley did everything in his power to stop civil rights progress in the city and defended his white neighbors who “threw rocks, eggs, and firecrackers” at civil rights marchers as “fine people, hard-working people.” The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and other mainstream news outlets often ignored or actively refuted King’s accusations of Northern racism, creating a documentary history that has shaped King’s legacy ever since. By looking beyond these sources, Theoharis depicts a complex, radical King whose fight against Northern racism alternately inspires and infuriates.",
