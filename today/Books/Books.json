    "description": "“Dear Cutie: You are invited to the annual Pig Town Party,” reads the invitation that floats through the narrator’s mail slot. The child, tan-skinned with triangular black pigtails, a cartoonishly square jaw, and dots for eyes, agrees that she is a cutie, but she has many questions, not the least of which is, “Where is Pig Town?” The porcine mail carrier whom she asks for directions darts through a hole in a hedge, and when the girl follows, she ends up in a town populated entirely by anthropomorphic pigs. When the child finds the eponymous party in full swing, all the pigs seem to be in costume. What’s more, pigs keep complimenting her costume, even though she isn’t wearing one, just her regular blue dress. When Cutie is announced as the winner of the costume contest, the child wonders if there’s been a mistake. That’s when the real Cutie, a pig wearing an identical blue dress, appears and demands her rightful prize, a huge chocolate cake; this has all been a case of mistaken identity. But the child refuses to back down. Marked by droll humor in both the text and the images, this farcical tale stars a protagonist with outsize expressions and a big personality. The satisfying resolution sees the mischievous youngster get her just deserts.",

    "description": "This exploration of the achievements of scientist Frederick Banting doesn’t explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes until the glossary and never mentions gestational or other types of diabetes at all. And some readers may be put off by descriptions of how his research involved removing pancreases from healthy dogs, especially given the author’s earlier, insistent references to Banting’s youthful love of farm animals. What does come through clearly, however, is his stubborn persistence (following a late-night Eureka! moment about a new approach) in working with colleagues to find a way to isolate the pancreatic hormone he eventually dubbed “insulin,” as well as the laudable altruism that led him to pass up big bucks and give away the formula with the titular comment. Along with an indignant complaint about the unjustly high cost of insulin today, the author leaves readers with simple descriptions of the nature of Type 1 diabetes and the mechanism of insulin. In the simply drawn illustrations, the small bottles of medication, the green blood sugar indicators floating above the heads of joyful former patients, and even the lab dogs are depicted with smiling faces. Though major figures are white, brown faces mingle with lighter ones in most of the other lab and outdoor group scenes.",
