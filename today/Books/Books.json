    "description": "It’s 1952, and a project of so-called “Urban Renewal” is in full swing in Bronzeville, Chicago’s predominantly Black neighborhood. With Jim Crow laws still in effect, the government is using the power of eminent domain to destroy the community, forcing families out of their homes. However, the novel’s plot centers mainly on a lost family heirloom—a small silver piece with Hebrew markings. Steve Feinberg, a white Jewish boy from Hyde Park, and Jesse Owens Trimble—a Black youngster from Bronzeville known around the neighborhood as “Sass,” due to his “smart mouth,” as Steve puts it—live very different lives. They’re connected through Mattie, Sass’ mom who works at the ticket counter at the Calumet Theater, which is owned by Mister Nate, Steve’s grandfather. The two leave the theater to search for the “silver thing” after Mister Nate loses it and unjustly accuses Sass of stealing it and they end up traveling all over the city. Later reunited by chance in high school, Steve and Sass’ shared love of jazz has them joining an a cappella group together, eventually leading them into the orbit of alto sax player and notorious gangster Mister Lucky. Intriguingly, the work goes on to explore how Chicago’s 1950s jazz scene served as an extension of the local civil rights movement. Sass’ troublesome older brother, Isaiah, known as “Nubby,” works for Mister Lucky running numbers, bringing trouble into his loved ones’ lives. The richly developed characters, including Dora, an aging Sunday school teacher who works for the Feinbergs as a maid, and Ezell, a boy with a stutter who has a natural ability to defuse conflict, are among the book’s strengths. Throughout the story, Joseph frequently reminds readers how socioeconomic factors influence how people interact with the world. The cast is large and diverse, and their often charming, relatable interactions will draw readers deeply into the story.",

    "description": "Thirty years ago, Dani Duprie, having spotted an unknown woman giving her the once-over, persuaded her husband, Bill, to pack up their 10-year-old daughter and pull up stakes yet again for an undisclosed but very urgent reason. The mysterious circumstances of their departure from the Cliff House still have the locals buzzing, but the buzz hasn’t reached Serena Winters, the well-known author of 11 Layne Farraday mysteries, until after she’s settled in the Cliff House. “Settled” may not be the best word, since she’s greeted by a series of anonymous messages beginning with “LEAVE TOWN NOW” and then escalating in their threats. When housekeeper Wanda Stockwell accuses her of moving to Cliff House in order to exploit the Dupries’ disappearance, Serena takes this as a karmic invitation to dive into the case with Seaton Point police Chief Jack Beaumont, who’s at least equally interested in her. All the while, Gray’s been shuttling repeatedly into the past to follow the fortunes of bad-girl Ruby Bryant, tossed out of her old home back in 1983 because she refused to accept her mother’s latest lover, who seemed to have an eye on her as well. Eventually the two narratives come together in a way that will surprise only newcomers to the genre. In fact, the biggest limitation in this propulsive mystery is a distinct lack of mystery. It’s nice to report, however, that Serena’s latest opus gets well underway.",
