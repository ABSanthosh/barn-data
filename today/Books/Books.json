    "description": "Carl Box calls it “a bit of mischief” when he learns that Aunt Lillian has left him land in France upon her apparent death. He doesn’t want to travel at all, much less for someone he barely knows, and what little he does know of his aunt suggests she was estranged from the family for unclear reasons. When he arrives in Paris, he does all of the right things; he goes to her apartment and searches for information. After retrieving her ashes, Carl learns three things about his aunt: She is, in fact, alive; she’s being pursued by a mysterious killer; and she’s been smuggling KGB documents from Moscow to Paris to use as leverage to free her lover from wrongful imprisonment in a psychiatric institution. She has, along with faking her own death, selected her nephew to lend credibility to this ruse, but once he becomes a suspect in her murder, Lily gets him to help her gather information and escape certain death. Graham folds these larger-than-life events together masterfully, using humorous dialogue and specific details to bring readers into the world and make it real. Her vivid descriptions make easy work of picturing each situation and place: “Billy had taken to his Prussian blue dog bed like an overwrought lady in a Victorian melodrama.” Likewise, Graham does a remarkable job of building suspense throughout her novel, and each section comes with both new questions and answers, continually giving readers fresh developments to ponder. Additionally, the cast’s voices infuse levity and personality into the text. For example, in response to Carl revealing that the police suspected him to be Lily’s killer, she replies nonchalantly: “‘But of course you didn’t,’ she said soothingly while spooning potatoes onto [Carl’s] plate.” These parts swirl together to create a striking balance of excitement, humor, and sincerity, perfect for anyone seeking a lively, twisty adventure.",

    "description": "Before she met bank CEO Jack Davis in 2013, Emma Davis was an up-and-coming software developer who built and sold her own successful company. During their 10-year marriage, he used nearly all the money she’d earned on failed investment opportunities. After Emma learns that Jack is having an affair with a restaurant server he met during one of their family dinners, he leaves her. Now that he’s gone, she has no income, no emotional support, and no idea what to do next. She takes a low-level tech job and loses whatever standing she had in the community. “What I desperately wanted was to stop loathing myself so much,” she narrates. “Rotten mother. Horrible at relationships. Pathetic career. Fat. Alone. And just plain scared.” Then creative writing professor Evy Hanover moves into Emma’s small suburban hamlet of Belmont, New York, and the pair strike up an instant and intense friendship. Evy seems to be just what Emma needs in her life; she convinces Emma to hire a divorce attorney, to stand up to Jack, to use some dating apps, and to live healthier. However, the future isn’t quite as bright as Evy makes it seem, and once Emma learns about the secret that Evy’s keeping, she questions whether their friendship will be enough to see them through. Emma’s first-person perspective effectively gives Wright’s novel a lighthearted and conversational tone, and it’s filled with humorous dating mishaps, clever gripes about dieting, and several slapstick moments. It initially presents as a fun, quick read; however, it later delves into some darker territory, including topics such as eating disorders, mental illness, and profoundly abusive relationships—each of which are described with greater nonchalance than readers may feel they deserve. The story is also weighed down by excessive detail that does little to move the plot forward, and some characters are rendered in such exaggerated fashion that they lack nuance.",
