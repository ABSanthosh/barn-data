    "title": "THE REVENGE PARADOX",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/regina-buttner/the-revenge-paradox/",
    "description": "Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but in this tense novel, the temper of 25-year-old Rudy Hodgens is red-hot as he seeks payback from his stepparents for evicting him from the house where he lived for two decades. When Rudy was in kindergarten, his mom died in a car crash; she had been married at the time to Iraq War veteran Mitchell, who was not Rudy’s biological father. A year after the accident, Mitchell married Debra, who became an instant mother to Rudy. Now Debra sobs as her deadbeat stepson packs up and leaves by court order, but Mitchell stews—Rudy has had multiple chances to turn his life around. Before Rudy leaves, he steals a Glock from Mitchell’s collection of guns, ammo, and fancy knives. Rudy tries to sell the Glock to a local thug he knew as a child, but seeing the gun reminds the potential buyer of all the weapons in Rudy’s family’s basement. Rudy also commits “domestic terrorism” by sneaking into the house at night to scare the easily frightened Debra while Mitchell works his overnight shift as a security guard. To make Debra feel safer, Mitchell helps her buy a pistol and (because he loves her) a gun bag in a “pink camouflage pattern.” But is Debra the “wimpy little woman” she appears to be? Complicated, marginalized characters converge in this edgy narrative that zips quickly along. The author excels at writing about people with both minor and major flaws, stashing secrets in each character’s backstory. Lies unfold, revenge is plotted, and suspense builds quickly to a satisfying ending. Well-observed details enrich the story, such as descriptions of the coffeeshop fireplace “that looks warm and cozy, but doesn’t actually emit any heat” and “the sleety snowfall that’s studding the front stoop.”",

    "title": "THE LITTLE LOST LIBRARY",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ellery-adams/the-little-lost-library/",
    "description": "As the owner of Miracle Books, Nora Pennington occasionally offers shop-at-home services to her customers. In Lucille Wynter’s case, she takes it a step further, bringing books to the reclusive woman and sitting with her in her sparsely furnished “boot room,” where they share tea and Lorna Doones. When Lucille fails to appear one day, a worried Nora calls her, only to hear a faint “Help me. Please!” from Lucille’s landline. Following the instructions her boyfriend, Sheriff Grant McCabe, once gave her for kicking a door in, Nora breaks in, only to find Lucille dead and Wynter House filled floor to ceiling with rotting food, trash, and books, books, books. Lucille has left Nora a letter thanking her for her visits and entrusting her with a special book written by Lucille’s father, Hugo Wynter. The volume contains a woodblock engraving of a set of bookshelves and a poem about a little lost library. Each verse contains cryptic clues that Nora hopes will help her figure out how Lucille could have lost a library and perhaps even help Nora find it. Lucille’s children, Harper, Beck, and Clem, commission Nora’s friend Bea, an antique dealer, to help clear out their mother’s house, and Nora uses the time while Bea is decluttering to follow the clues in the poem. In the meantime, McCabe tells her that Lucille wasn’t killed in a fall but was strangled. Nora's search for the lost library and her quest to find Lucille’s killer intersect, but chance plays as great a role as sleuthing in their solution. The grim ending reveals a sad history that strips all the joy from Nora’s efforts.",
