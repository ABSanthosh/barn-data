    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/marian-crotty/near-strangers/",
    "description": "There are no spectacles in these stories, and they are all the better for it. The characters, many of them queer, are familiar, well meaning, and flawed. The conflicts they face range from universal to less common, including first heartbreak, rocky transitions into adulthood, losing an infant, and surviving sexual assault. \"Halloween\" centers on high school senior Jules and her whirlwind romance, amid crushed toppings and sticky counters, with frozen yogurt–shop co-worker Erika, a college student. Advised by her kooky grandma Jan, Jules learns that while the most thrilling connections are not always the healthiest, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stick around to see what happens. The title story features 73-year-old Betsy, a volunteer for an organization that provides support to survivors in the aftermath of rape, and 23-year-old survivor Lenna. Though Betsy does not identify as a “do-gooder kind of person” and only began volunteering after her therapist suggested it would help her cope with estrangement from her only child, her compassionate presence lays the groundwork for connection between two lonely people. In \"Dear Matt,” Caroline, newly graduated from law school and recovering from a breakup, implores her new brother-in-law to help her sister, Ella, forgive her after an explosive fight triggered by the clashes between Matt and (now) Ella’s Mormon beliefs and Caroline’s sexuality. While this story isn't as tight as some of the others, the letter format adds some nice variety to the collection, and the line “I realized this was her real and actual life, the one she wanted and meant to keep” is a gratifying distillation of a theme that runs through the book. Crotty repeatedly signals that it is not just all right, but good, to realize your perception of someone is fundamentally misaligned with their perception of themself; her characters make confident assumptions, feel surprised, back up, and reacquaint themselves with one another, becoming wiser and more tolerant with each misjudgment and readjustment.",

    "description": "Kadsa Abasi’s Grandpa Edoje wants her to care as much as he does about finding his homeland; he’s searched across the continent of Africa for a way back. During their exploration of a cave in Chad, he at last finds a portal that will allow him to return to Marut. Grandpa Edoje, who’s said “she’d make a good godtalker,” gives Kadsa a large crystal. But Kadsa, whose father is dead, starts researching her mother—and she discovers troubling information that implicates her grandfather in the events that led to their separation. Before they can be reunited, however, Kadsa spies something frightening as she gazes into the crystal: Grandpa Edoje appears to be fighting with a shaman they met in the cave. She returns to the site of the portal, where the shaman tries to take the crystal from her. In the subsequent struggle, Kadsa ends up in Marut, a world that’s struggling under the Dark Enchantment of Akwanshi, a power-hungry priestess—and some see Kadsa as their long-awaited source of salvation. The story’s worldbuilding and action sequences are engaging, although the uneven character development detracts from the narrative. Nevertheless, genre fans will find much to enjoy.",
