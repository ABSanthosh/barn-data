    "description": "A group of hunter-gatherers is endangered by murderous timbermen in the Brazilian rainforest. Above the Arctic Circle, an old Inuit woman takes her skeptical, indolent “grandson” to a remote old village (from which oil companies uprooted them) to enact an obscure ritual. Both use ancestral memories to summon help from an advanced extraterrestrial civilization of color-shifting, somewhat reptilian humanoids of about 8 feet in stature who call themselves the Indigo. Eons ago, interstellar Indigo explorers were awestruck by Earth’s unparalleled biodiversity and beauty and left such safeguards behind to protect the planet. The two distress signals prompt the aliens’ return in massive ships that intimidate even the Earth’s superpowers. Meeting with a few chosen human representatives (including the U.S. president), the Indigo are horrified at the state of Earth, now beset by pollution, species extinctions, unsustainable economic development, war, and other existential threats. The Indigo give humanity one year to reverse the failing state of the world; meanwhile, they will remain as noninterfering “Observers.” Some Indigo opinion-leaders grow quite fond of humanity’s arts and music; others harbor no affection for the predatory apes and begin a grim judgment process. A radical-environmentalist spin on Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood’s End (1953), Nebra’s narrative will find favor with those who have fantasies of captains of industry and world leaders being brought to account by a galactic Greenpeace for crimes against nature: “Dolphins in terror, surrounded by humans with an enclosing net and frantically writhing and rolling in a red sea, the blood of their family. A Hawksbill turtle, grotesquely deformed by the plastic ring slowly choking it. The hillside shorn of its trees, the fertile soil pointlessly pouring away in streams with every rain.” The polemical material is balanced by fairly nuanced characterizations (including developing nation indigenes, too often idealized by sympathetic writers as unspoiled, cardboard Edenic angels), good pacing, and a final act that is fairly unputdownable.",

    "title": "INFIDELITY RULES",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/joelle-babula/infidelity-rules/",
    "description": "When it comes to getting involved with men, independent Quinn, a gorgeous, green-eyed, 6-foot-tall redhead, has one unshakeable rule: They have to be unhappily married, with no kids. (After all, she’s no homewrecker.) Having sworn off marriage after two failures, only hot sex and romance with no expectations on either side does it for Quinn. (The fact that she’ll eventually have to pay for her cavalier disregard for the wives of her short-term lovers hardly comes as a surprise, but the author’s audacious twist on the inevitable comeuppance does, thankfully leaving her hero’s spiky, bright spirit undimmed.) Quinn’s eventual realization that her determined, no-strings approach to relationships has consequences begins when Marcus, “the one whose mere presence zaps my appetite, flushes my cheeks and makes me want to giggle like a schoolgirl mooning over her first crush,” walks into the upscale restaurant where Quinn is the wine- and food-savvy sommelier. “I love the magic that happens when a great glass of wine pairs perfectly with a dish,” she says. “It’s lusty and romantic…. It’s akin to the ideal relationship, fleeting but swoon-worthy.” Perfect though he seems, if Marcus isn’t married, Quinn will have to go with her second choice, a handsome, married, infidelity newbie. The author’s lavish descriptions of clothes, gourmet meals, and wine—some chapters open with a description of enticing menu offerings—and the characters’ nearly exclusive focus on hormone-charged relationships make for an engaging rom-com Sex and the City vibe. When she can no longer ignore the messy realities of her affairs, it takes time for Quinn to get past her defensive reaction and face a difficult decision: “I don’t feel guilty. I didn’t make any vows,” she says. The author doesn’t let her off the hook, but the off-the-wall result satisfies, and humor and a light touch are ever-present (Quinn’s blind date with a picky vegetarian at her Italian mother’s bountiful, nonvegetarian dinner table is a kick).",
