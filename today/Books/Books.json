    "description": "Five years ago, in 1984, Viktoria made a horrible mistake—during a moment of distraction, she let her 5-year-old sister disappear in the bog behind their house, a place where such events are common. Now Anna has returned, but she hasn’t aged. She can’t explain where she’s been, and the bog seems to call her back. With the oracle cards she carries as a guide, 16-year-old Vik desperately tries to figure out what to do while navigating turmoil with her closest friend, Liis, and facing the hostile villagers, who turn on her family. Although the Estonians’ language and culture have survived decades of Soviet oppression—which is loosening—some people are more interested in assimilating with Russians. The influence of Vik’s maternal uncle Silver, who supports the Soviet way of thinking and runs the government asylum just outside of town, looms large. In this politically astute story filled with skillfully incorporated background information about a fascinating and complex historical period, Vik’s quest authentically and thoroughly incorporates her struggles with OCD and complex PTSD (which Griffis explains in a mental health note but aren’t diagnosed in-world). Liis has a limb difference, and Vik’s mother has PTSD, too. This gripping, deeply human, and eerie mystery has parallels to current events that will provoke readers to think.",

    "description": "Mark Smeaton is born into inauspicious circumstances; his father is a poor carpenter, which, for most, would set one’s destiny in stone. However, he’s also a prodigiously talented musician—a composer, singer, and lutenist—and becomes a court musician for the king, who admires his abilities. He impresses Anne Boleyn as well, a beautiful woman of “silken faultlessness” who becomes the monarch’s second wife, and as her star rises, so does his. However, after Anne falls out of favor with the king, his own status is threatened, and he finds himself ensnared in a plot, manufactured by the king’s cunning chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, to discard her. Meanwhile, Mark engages in an imprudent flirtation with Anne’s cousin Madge Shelton, who lives in a rarefied world that no amount of success would ever allow him to enter—a predicament he grasps with both sadness and pragmatic resignation, captured intelligently by author Johnson: “I wasn’t a friend of the king. I was a lowborn commoner who was perhaps exceptionally skilled in music. In the eyes of the world, my worth had barely changed even with my new duties and responsibilities.” The story is told from the perspectives of both Madge and Mark, and she also resolutely accepts that their love is a mere “fairy tale.” The author astutely depicts a seedy world in which “politics seeped into every act”; even as Mark becomes famous and wealthy, Mark realizes the precariousness of his fortune, and the way in which he is “floating above a cesspool of terror and death.” The protagonist is a real historical figure, though little is known about him, which makes him a perfect point of departure for a dramatic and engrossing reimagining of history. It’s an era that both historians and novelists have extensively covered, but Johnson’s work remains an original and worthwhile effort.",
