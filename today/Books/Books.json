    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/renee-d-bondy/nondisclosure-2/",
    "description": "Growing up a Catholic schoolgirl in 1970s Ontario, the nameless protagonist of Bondy’s debut novel does just about everything that's expected of her, from joining the choir to helping out the priest at the rectory with various tasks. The narrator knows she’s no standout, and she likes it that way: “I’d always been quiet…I wore quiet like a woolen shawl, protective and comforting.” But it is perhaps this very lack of remarkableness that makes her a target for the pedophile priest—”Father Feeler”—at her parish. Years later, after she's found her calling by opening up her home as a hospice for gay men dying of AIDS—who were mistreated, or failed to be treated, at traditional hospitals and banned from seeing their partners or friends—other victims of the priest begin to come forward. As the narrator weighs whether or not to join them in telling her story, she learns the insidious power that secrets have to fracture families and communities—as well as how healing might be possible. In the novel’s afterword, Bondy reveals the novel’s inspiration as a real-life case out of Chatham, Ontario, and her desire to explore the lesser-known stories of female victims of church abuse. The necessity for home hospice networks for AIDS patients in the 1980s was also, sadly, very real. Bondy’s decision to juxtapose the two scenarios gives the novel much of its power. But the nameless protagonist—who sometimes shifts into the plural first person—seems designed to be a kind of everywoman for victims and so never develops a vivid personhood of her own, undoing some of Bondy’s intentions to move and outrage the reader through the power of fiction.",

    "title": "THE ONE WEEK WRITING WORKSHOP",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/karin-adams/the-one-week-writing-workshop/",
    "description": "The author has spent over a decade teaching her writing method to a variety of audiences, helping to prompt procrastinators or aspiring writers who don’t know how to get started. The steps cover topics including generating ideas; developing characters, settings, and plots; and drafting and revision. Each day’s agenda begins with “warmups,” moves on to a core activity, and concludes with “stretches.” Readers are encouraged to begin with a clean slate, but they can also work on a project already in progress. The most helpful days are the fifth and seventh, when participants are expected to start some actual writing and to learn how to close-read and revise. The final section has suggestions on how to use the method beyond the initial brainstorming and kick-starting phase. The activities are all explained clearly and no doubt will prove easy to execute. The strengths of the workbook are its clarity, simplicity, and flexibility; writers who just need a nudge can use a few of these exercises in the space of an hour, while others may devote a week or more to completing all of the tasks comprehensively. This is a nuts-and-bolts guide to competently beginning a manuscript—there is no focus on the deep contemplation and insight that transform writing into meaningful art. The program is designed to elicit a sense of accomplishment, so there is a danger that the workshop itself can stand in for the creative product; more optimistically, these steps can help writers to embrace the joy of the process along with the end result. Adams is present as a guide and coach, reflecting on her own experiences and journey through the steps (“what’s worked best for me in frustrating times of ‘nothing is coming to me!’ is learning something new that also keeps my hands busy”), but she is never intrusive. This primer is most appropriate for new and amateur fiction writers, but anyone may glean a few helpful tips.",
