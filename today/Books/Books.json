    "description": "Spice Abrams has both a tail and a tale to tell. This “spicy” cat declares to readers that cats predate humans on the evolutionary timeline and are thus the key to humanity’s growth and success. Conveniently, human records are unreliable, but Spice is ready to share the truth of the matter—and in rhyming couplets, no less. Back when humans were nomadic, cats lived in colonies that took an interest in these strange, bipedal creatures and showed them how to settle down. “‘There’s work involved. No, please don’t cry. / We’ll show you how, but you must try.’ // By watching how a cat survives, / the people soon improved their lives.” Of course, the humans could barely feed themselves, so cats taught them to hunt and fish, inventing the fishing rod because people didn’t have sharp claws. Table manners, personal hygiene, and even the roundness of the Earth follow suit. Spice’s story extends across space and time from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance all the way to a future where cat astronauts bounce around the moon waiting for a new world to explore. No matter where or when, Spice assures readers, cats push humans to be their very best. Abrams’ follow-up to Silly Cat and Friends Make Believe (2023) is a silly stand-alone alternate history that may amuse cat lovers, particularly those in elementary school. This historical romp provides a disclaimer as to its truthfulness (or lack thereof), but its emphasis on the emotional bond between humans and their pets stands the test of time. Her sentences flow smoothly, as does the story, though things do become somewhat repetitive as cats solve every issue that crops up with no difficulty. Vagreti’s illustrations are expressive and portray a variety of people with different skin tones—though, like much of the history, most of them are white.",

    "description": "It is the fifth century C.E. Shifra and her husband, Benjamin, both hail from Alexandria, Egypt, but have spent the last 30 years in Milan, always wary of the pressure put on Jews like themselves to convert to the regnant faith of Christianity. They maintain their beliefs, but after Benjamin, a physician, is beaten to death one night out of a prejudicial contempt for his religion, Shifra is faced with a terrible choice: Bishop Marolus demands that she finally become a Christian or face a tax on her estate so steep it will leave her all but penniless. She defiantly stands her ground, but life for her in Milan becomes all but unbearable—Shifra is also physically assaulted for being Jewish—so she moves back to Alexandria to live with her younger brother, Akiva, a secretary to Orestes, the Roman governor of upper Egypt and an influential man. In this powerful moral drama, Shifra sadly discovers that Akiva’s success depends upon his own conversion to Christianity, and he strongly encourages her to follow suit. Meanwhile, Shifra’s servant, Dacia, struggles to maintain her religious identity as well—raised an Arian Christian, she is seen as a heretic by the Nicene Christians who make up the majority. The author meticulously portrays the depth of Shifra’s moral predicament—she could continue to worship as she pleases in private, if only she would renounce her faith publicly (“Sometimes dissembling is the price of survival”). However, such a disavowal seems to her like a betrayal of both her ancestors and Benjamin, who is considered by Bishop Marolus to be “forever lost, doomed to eternity in Hell.” Maddox rigorously reconstructs the historical setting and its political and cultural tensions. This is a gripping blend of astute historical commentary and literary drama.",
