    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/laura-smetana/my-love-for-you-is-like-the-night-sky/",
    "description": "This book opens in a similar manner to the author/illustrator’s Kirkus-starred earlier work, My Love for You Is Like a Garden (2023), with its titular sentence, followed by nonrhyming text—this time, inviting readers to imagine affection on a scale of the vastness of space. As an adult and a child (both portrayed as pale-skinned) sit together on what appears to be a grassy hill, they look up at the night sky as the text describes love with evocative phrases. The last book featured a lot of real-world sensory description, and there’s understandably less of that this time—one can’t touch stars or smell planets—but it still manages to be engaging by using star-watching similes, including “as radiant as a meteor shower” and “as dependable as the phases of the moon.” An illustrated glossary encourages readers to go back and find various objects, and a solar system diagram and moon-phase chart add helpful information. Again, the real star of this book (no pun intended) is Smetana’s imagery, which combines watercolor and collage. Although the stars, planets, and galaxies are somewhat less complex than the last book’s flowers, they are beautiful, with intricate compositions reminiscent of Eric Carle’s work.",

    "title": "THE GALES OF ALEXANDRIA",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ehab-elgammal/the-gales-of-alexandria/",
    "description": "As the story begins, the protagonist’s father Omar takes on the unenviable task of combing through his recently deceased son Nasser’s journal searching for confirmation of his alleged ties to terrorism. The narrative then moves to the past: Growing up in Alexandria, Egypt, in the 1980s and ’90s, Nasser El-Mohammedi is raised by Omar in an uncommonly secular fashion. An esteemed professor, Omar schools his son using his extensive personal library, and when Nasser comes of age, he falls in with a small group of brilliant friends who go on to study engineering. Their sisters and girlfriends become part of the group, too, and when two members of the cohort leave for America to pursue graduate studies, it is with heavy hearts for those they leave behind. Nasser, on the other hand, is confronted at his graduation by a long-lost uncle, who tells him he needs to come South because it is finally time to visit his mother’s real grave. Once there, Nasser discovers that his mother (who died when Nasser was a child) lived a life of immense secrecy and estrangement from her family due to her insistence upon pursuing a secondary education. When Nasser learns that Omar has lied about Nasser’s mother’s radical past for years, Nasser’s own latent radicalism is inflamed. America is rocked by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, setting the table for a new era of danger, radicalization, and division among Nasser’s once-bulletproof friend group. Elgammal’s novel is deeply felt and richly detailed, vividly capturing the gravity of the circumstances in which his characters find themselves: “Still, he hated the horrible helpless feeling that had seized him—history was happening, people were suffering and dying two miles from where they were sitting, and they couldn’t think of a single useful thing to do.” Some readers may wish to spend longer periods with a single character—Elgammal jumps perspectives regularly—but the shifting POV effect creates a rich texture that helps to separate the novel from its peers.",
