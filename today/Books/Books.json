    "description": "Jake Taylor has just lost his boyfriend of six years, Tom, in a car accident. In addition to being the love of his life, Tom was the primary breadwinner, and Tom’s sister—who blames Jake for Tom’s death—quickly evicts him from Tom’s apartment. The mourning, middle-aged Jake is forced to move back in with his elderly mother and father, the latter of whom is slipping quickly into Alzheimer’s. Vicky Harper is a Black, trans introvert whose workaholic tendencies have elevated her to the position of senior partner at her law firm. She prefers to keep people at arm’s length, and her “self-curated Ice Queen reputation” means she can usually “make do with nodded greetings and avoid the casual chit-chat.” When she receives an anonymous voice message threatening her over one of her cases, however, she realizes how vulnerable she truly is. Lucy Penrose, one of Jake’s oldest friends, is wrapped up in planning her wedding to her Canadian boyfriend Colin after a whirlwind romance. Unfortunately, her father—a famed author and television host known for uncovering scams—is suspicious of Colin’s intentions and demands a prenup. What’s more, it seems like Colin’s family may have ties to the Canadian far right. As the three characters’ stories overlap and intertwine, an enemy emerges that threatens not only the them but potentially all of British society. Fanning’s prose is simple but filled with deeply human moments, like when Jake goes out to visit his father in his tool shed after the man has been found wandering the town. “He might not know who you are,” his mother warns him. “It doesn’t mean he’s forgotten. Not really.” The three main characters are not quite as engaging as the plots that surround them, but the stakes are such that the reader is happy to root for them as they attempt to outwit their antagonists.",

    "title": "BREAKING THE ENGAGEMENT",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-shambaugh/breaking-the-engagement/",
    "description": "Shambaugh, professor of Asian Studies at George Washington University, writes that America, the dominant power until recently, has always felt a sense of exceptionalism. This conviction that America’s way of doing things had universal appeal seemed affirmed by its spectacular Cold War victory over the USSR, but this simply set the country up for disappointment when an increasingly powerful China began to feel its oats. The first two of nine lucidly written chapters deliver an expert if often painful chronological account of the experience of eight presidents who served since America recognized “Communist China” in 1979 and aimed to modernize, liberalize, and socialize it. Under the illusion that free-market reforms would relax its oppressive autocracy, American leaders brushed off the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and remained optimistic until 2009, when President Obama made an official visit and received rude treatment that was “intentional and not consistent with how previous American presidents had been treated.” The relationship went downhill, especially after Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, and China became increasingly repressive at home and belligerent abroad. Although its repressive system was inconsequential to President Trump, and he admires Xi, his administration was dominated by China hawks, who matched its truculence. Minus the bombast, the Biden administration continued this policy. “Engagement” was in tatters. Reaching the present day at the halfway point, Shambaugh reveals why he is not a historian but a political scientist, with four chapters delving deeply into government policy, strategy, and debates with generous use of statistics, acronyms, speeches, and actions from a huge cast of characters, NGOs, and think tanks, many unfamiliar to readers. The final chapter delivers sensible advice on how to deal with a newly assertive China. Apparently composed before the second Trump administration took office, it seems a dead letter.",
