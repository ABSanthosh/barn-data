    "description": "Software engineer and product manager Wilensky surveys fundamental aspects of modern society that he feels are desperately in need of a rethink. Chief among them, he asserts, is an educational system that teaches children nothing but conformism and soon-to-be-forgotten factoids; instead, he argues, instructors should stimulate kids’ curiosity and creativity, teach them critical thinking skills, and raise them to be “thinking machines” who “reason reflexively.” Wilensky also condemns religious belief as the fountainhead of irrationality, intolerance, conflict, and so much “false and often foul doctrine” that “religious inculcation…of young children is equivalent to child abuse.” To counter such conformism, he recommends “changing the environment” so that everything children are exposed to “reflects in some way a worldview embracing science and reason, while at the same time rejecting religion and belief in the supernatural.” The author also takes issue with one-person-one-vote democracy, which he says yields a “mediocracy” in which ignorant people are manipulated into electing corrupt hacks. Wilensky presents his opinions in lucid, plainspoken, but high-minded prose: “It may sound obvious, but we need to make a conscious effort at every turn of our lives to be more virtuous, compassionate human beings.” He offers some engaging explanations of complex concepts, such as the Darwinian evolution of human moral intuition and the falseness of unfalsifiable arguments, and he explores some imaginative potential reforms, such as teaching all kids chess and debate skills to sharpen their wits. Sometimes, though, Wilensky’s drive to optimize society launches into dystopian notions that many readers will perceive as incompatible with freedom, such as a requirement to obtain a parenting license to have children and an elitist electoral system in which a so-called superb class of voters, who score high on critical-thinking tests, have votes that count more than those of people the author calls “subpar.” Such ideas are likely to strike readers as alienating and even frightening.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alexander-wood/building-the-metropolis/",
    "description": "Between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, writes Wood, historian of American architecture and urbanism, New York City “grew into one of the world’s largest, most important, and dynamic cities.” Roughly 1 million buildings—an astonishing number—went up in the city during that period. In his deeply informed and informative account, Wood describes how population growth and a robust economy gave rise to a large and sophisticated construction industry. He deftly describes the numerous and complex arrangements that provided much-needed office buildings, homes, factories, railway stations, bridges, streets, and subway lines. We read, often in detail, about large construction firms, building trade associations, the mechanics of tunnel construction, labor unions, architectural offices, and wrecking companies. Wood introduces us to government workers and officials such as Thomas F. Gilroy (head of the city’s Department of Public Works in the 1890s) and labor organizers such as Morris Rosen. After the city consolidated in 1898, Wood extends his gaze beyond Manhattan’s skyscrapers to the lower-density outer boroughs. Throughout, he attends to the many conflicts between business and labor over the length of the workday, safety, and wages; contractor competition for private commissions and lobbying for public works projects; and city government efforts to manage the corruption, labor unrest, noise and disruption, and the regulatory demands of building activity. For those fascinated by urban development (particularly construction and particularly in New York City), reading this substantial history is time well spent. What primarily matters to Wood, however, are facts. Consequently, he refrains from any attempt at a more general understanding of building construction. In the last chapter, after a brief summary, the story simply ends.",
