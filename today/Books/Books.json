    "description": "Forty-year-old Jaycee Grayson, fresh from a stint in the Betty Ford rehab center after having been fired from her job at a big-name Hollywood studio, is about to embark on a new adventure. Her older sister Meredith Grayson-O’Cochlain, a high-powered attorney, has negotiated a contract for Jaycee to be the new executive producer and vice president of global entertainment at Wonderful Girls, a successful manufacturer of lifelike dolls that reflect individual personalities and aspirations. The company, run primarily by women, was founded by the now semi-retired Happy Lindstrom. It has recently been sold for a fortune to a Japanese company but still maintains its headquarters in Littleburgh, Wisconsin. “Pulled by this strange and wonderful concept of female unity,” Jaycee heads to Wisconsin, where she discovers a workplace brimming with an intoxicating sweetness that belies the back-stabbing manipulations of Wonderful Girls’ venomous staff. Amply funded by a new termination agreement with the Hollywood studio hammered out by Meredith, Jaycee buys a house in Littleburgh reportedly built by the late architect Frank Lloyd Wright for his mistress. Once she settles in, it does not take long for her to discover that duplicity runs rampant below Wonderful Girls’ saccharine surface; bad-mouthing and sabotage lurk around every corner. Sipos writes with wit, introducing a large cast of quirky characters hiding a trove of backstories and deceptions. The dialogue is filled with sharply focused sarcasm, and Jaycee, who narrates the tale, is a feisty protagonist relentlessly trudging through a chaotic swamp of miscreants. Abel Dreaux, the village police chief, adds a bit of offbeat romance, and the aging Happy Lindstrom proves to be a delightful, surprising powerhouse. The relationship between Jaycee and Meredith provides some needed poignancy, as does the developing friendship between Jaycee and the gently rebellious Mennonite couple that tends to her culinary and gardening needs. Even so, acerbic humor is never more than a paragraph or two away.",

    "description": "Trying to forget a violent encounter with a serial killer, Arista settles into her new home in Sedona, Arizona. The New-Agey town seems like a good fit. Interested in magic, she works at a shop called Cosmic Prisms that sells items like crystals and candles. Living with her Aunt Bethie, the co-leader of a coven, Arista learns witchcraft. It’s unclear what supernatural abilities Arista possesses, but she practices reading auras and randomly channels Bethie’s dead grandfather. Still, Arista misses many aspects of her former home in Boulder Creek, California: the pines and redwoods, ex-boyfriend Shane, and her mountain house, built by Bethie’s grandpa. Forever casting a dark shadow over Arista’s life is her Uncle Fergus. Reuniting with the parents who seemingly abandoned her, Arista learns they only wanted to hide her from Fergus’ malevolence. But their sacrifice may have been in vain. Arista’s mother is near death, and Fergus hasn’t given up. Bethie’s coven decides Arista should return to her Boulder Creek house to release the ghost inside her. Meanwhile, Fergus, in possession of Bethie’s family athame (ceremonial blade), pursues his deepest obsession: killing Arista to transfer her magical abilities to himself. Dodd’s second installment of a trilogy opens with a winding drive and crash on a mountain road and maintains a fast and twisty momentum throughout, yet the pace slows down enough for well-rounded character development. Arista, appearing to be positive and upbeat, also exhibits grief, searing anger, and a self-hatred that she sometimes allows “to sink its sharp teeth into her.” The always-intriguing cast includes Arista’s irritating but sassy co-worker Stevie, artist Mr. Tessay, and an eerie child, Soonsil, emitting growls while hugging a plushie. Sedona’s and Boulder Creek’s landscapes are vividly drawn, though it’s clear which one Arista prefers. Sedona’s natural monuments are “overbearing, like emotionless godheads” while Boulder Creek’s “lush evergreen” trees are “majestic…yet so full of life.” The gripping book ends on a cliffhanger, setting up the final installment.",
