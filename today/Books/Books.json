    "title": "DISPATCHES FROM THE COUCH",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/stacey-hettes/dispatches-from-the-couch/",
    "description": "The author suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Mr. Jay, a next-door neighbor and trusted family friend. The assaults began before the Hettes started kindergarten and continued for years. The psychological fallout from such “capital-T Trauma” was profound—as an adult, the author became a relentless workaholic, precluding genuine intimacy or authentic friendship with others. In fact, the aftermath of her trauma, more than the abuse itself, turned out to be the deepest and most abiding source of her pain, a terrifying insight conveyed by the author with admirable candor and lucidity in this affecting memoir. Years later, after earning a doctorate in neuroscience and becoming assistant dean of a prestigious pre-med program, a colleague’s “dyspeptic rant” and a fellow dean’s mealy mouthed response to it prompted Hettes to reveal to her colleagues that she was the survivor of sexual abuse. Reeling from yet another episode of “revictimization,” the author sought the help of a therapist, Piper Manna, determined to overcome the “mountains of self-revulsion, hatred, and shame” her tormentor had left her with. Hettes’ writing verges on the poetic as she describes the heartbreaking fear that her suffering is permanent: “Perhaps, our pasts are not words on a page, but rather tattoos on our minds and hearts. Thus, we are marked—as abused, as violated, as victimized—with ink that permeates every tissue layer.” The narrative is bolstered by Manna’s fascinating insights into the human psyche and the author’s expert knowledge of the human brain (she fascinatingly details the strain her self-castigation put on her limbic system). While often challenging to read, given the grim nature of the abuse, the memoir includes moments of humor and hope, and it is inspiring to chart Hettes’ journey from despair to a degree in “self-studies.”",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/elias-cold/the-duke-steals-hearts-other-body-parts/",
    "description": "Aulkendale City, known as “the Sore of the Southern Continent,” is home to drinking establishments, wealthy nobles, and a red tent community of vagrants and outcasts. Phyllis, who later goes by Phillip, has an uncanny, unexplained ability to snatch people’s body parts without killing them. The angsty 17-year-old usually runs around with Lucent, a nearly-400-year-old grifter, haunted by the death of his sister, who stays alive by stealing the life force of others. Adeline, a dancer at the Bourbon Rose, has been kidnapped and gruesomely murdered (but later reanimated); her brother, Wycliff, also 17, is desperate to know what happened to her. The story—told through the first person in the case of Phillip and the third person for other point-of-view characters—has stakes that are complex and convoluted. The cast members’ emotional motivations, Phillip’s especially, are directly explained to readers rather than revealed through more intriguing or satisfying means, and the casual approach to worldbuilding makes it difficult to remain fully immersed in the world. The characters’ skin is various shades of white (Phillip) and brown (Adeline, Wycliff, and Lucent) that don’t seem to map onto any real-world racialized categories. Phillip’s gender transition is realized through the fantasy world’s magical means rather than referencing existing trans and queer communities or language; certain of his character traits may cue neurodivergence to some readers.",
