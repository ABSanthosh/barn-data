    "description": "Her account fueled by the murder of a 16-year-old girl in Detroit, Neely opens with appalling statistics: Black girls and women make up 7% of the U.S. population, but “they were three times more likely to die by homicide compared to white females.” The violence has a certain circularity: law enforcement agencies assume that those Black girls and women brought the crimes onto themselves through drug use or prostitution. Chillingly, they’re considered less than human, whence Neely’s title, “used as a classification in homicide cases comprising victims whom police view as having little to no value as human beings.” When the crimes are investigated, the police are often in a hurry to find a perpetrator—and often an innocent person goes to jail while the real perpetrators, often serial criminals and murderers, get away with it; knowing this, those real perpetrators have little incentive not to commit further crimes. In the case of that 16-year-old, decades passed before the true killer was tried and sentenced and the wronged man freed. “Had Detroit police valued the life of Michelle Kimberly Jackson, Eddie Joe Lloyd would not have lost eighteen years of his life to prison, the deaths of other potential victims would have been prevented, and the families of those victims would be spared the unbearable pain of losing a loved one,” Neely charges. That all this happened speaks, she adds, to systemic racism, a habit of mind that even Black officers buy into. Neely concludes with the thoughts that greater advocacy for those forgotten women is needed and that cold cases are often opened through citizen action and, more recently, podcasts that demand accountability.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alexandra-vasti/earl-crush/",
    "description": "Those in London society who have met Miss Lydia Hope-Wallace know her only as a painfully shy, absurdly wealthy spinster. That’s because almost no one knows that she’s also responsible for the radical pamphlets published by her anonymous alter ego, “H,” on topics like universal suffrage and the right to divorce—not even the Earl of Strathrannoch, with whom H has been corresponding for several years. As a result, things are a bit awkward when she sneaks north to Scotland to propose to the Earl, only to find, when she arrives at his castle, that he actually doesn’t know Lydia or H, and someone else has been writing to her under his name. Arthur Baird, the earl, quickly realizes that his brother, Davis, has been masquerading as him. Though in her embarrassment Lydia tries to escape, the unexpected chaos of a stampeding herd of zebras provides her with a chance to reconsider, and she decides to help Arthur figure out the mystery behind his brother’s behavior. They are almost immediately attracted to each other, and though Arthur is loathe to get involved with a woman he thinks belongs to his brother, circumstances soon lead them to pretend to be newlyweds, which leads to a series of red-hot encounters and allows both to imagine what it might be like to actually marry. This sequel to Ne’er Duke Well (2024) brings more political intrigue and suspense to the world of the woman-run Belvoir’s Library, with a similar heat level and comedic sensibility. Though the plot is a bit disjointed, the almost-slow-burn chemistry between Arthur and Lydia—and the scorching scenes that follow—keep the pages turning. With the help of a lovely Scottish backdrop (and accents), Vasti’s fans, as well as those looking for a post-Bridgerton story, will be pleased.",
