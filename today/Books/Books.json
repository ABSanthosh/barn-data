    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michelle-kicherer-1/sexy-life-hello/",
    "description": "After she’s caught in a compromising situation, California teacher Jane is unceremoniously fired. She then applies for the “types of jobs that [won’t] check a record.” Fortunately, she finds one—a couple (including a popular writer of airport novels) takes her on as nanny to their 10-month-olds Franny and Zooey. Then, Jane gets a reply to another application; porn actor Lola hires her to communicate with her fans, engaging in generally salacious cyberchats as “Lola” to persuade clients to pay for premium content. That’s something Jane can do during Franny and Zooey’s naptime. While these unfiltered online conversations are relatively new territory for Jane, she’s an unexpected natural at sexting. Certainly, she doesn’t want the twins’ mothers knowing what she does during some of her nannying hours, but she soon comes to the frightening realization that someone may have caught on to her surreptitious side-gig. Kicherer deftly satirizes modern pornography and porn addiction—Jane easily handles multiple chats using generic responses that don’t dissipate the mesmerized clients’ sexual energy. Jane finds the activity “curious,” but it gradually turns into a routine, and she doesn’t really consider the implications of the X-rated written content until later. The author’s concise and often irreverent prose pulls no punches—the cyberchats engage in topics that will make some readers blush and others cringe. At the same time, the story deftly contrasts these pornographic conversations with Jane caring for two infant twins who are oblivious to all that she’s typing on her laptop. A darker aspect of the porn job slowly and effectively creeps in; interacting with faceless usernames may seem harmless, but there’s a chance one of these individuals knows too much. The ending, which suits the overall tone, won’t likely be forgotten.",

    "description": "Daemicke links a teacher’s childhood gift of The Secret Garden to the community gardens that Grace Lee Boggs (1915-2015) later planted in empty lots around Detroit with the aid of young volunteers. The author characterizes her subject as “a gardener not only of plants but also of minds.” Lin echoes that theme in emblematic tableaux that follow Boggs through early troubles finding work “because she was Chinese” and leadership of the Workers Party to grassroots initiatives like the “Detroit Summer” program. She had such close associations with Malcolm X and the Black Power Movement that her FBI file wrongly dubbed her “Afro-Chinese.” She spent decades involved in both local and larger causes and makes a final appearance here speaking to a diverse circle of youthful “solutionaries” (as she called them) about “art, the earth, and change, challenging them to turn ideas into action.” Daemicke brings home the reality that the struggle for civil rights, particularly for Asian Americans, has been long and tragic with a quick closing reference to Vincent Chin, victim of a hate crime in 1982. The narrative ends with hopes of making the world a “healthier, kinder, and more just place for everyone.”",
