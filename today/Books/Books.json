    "description": "Lisa Owens, whose fiance’s death was never solved because of police ineptitude, became a cop, in large part, to make sure that others never experienced the pain and uncertainty that she did. Now she’s an overworked homicide detective whose boss is desperately trying to get her to focus on developing a personal life, apart from her career. Owens does take time off—and uses it to investigate the brutal killing of her best friend, Dorothy Jensen, a beloved mentor who was her middle school teacher years earlier. The retired educator lived in a condo on Stypman Island, a haven for people escaping the cold winters of the northern United States, where she was found beheaded with her eyes and tongue cut out. The meticulous Owens eventually joins forces with local cop Kim Witherspoon, whose law enforcement experience has been nothing short of nightmarish, as she’s been forced to work for a sexist, antigay, and morally bankrupt chief of police. The two women soon discover that Owens’ best friend’s murder is linked to drug trafficking, blackmail, and multiple other deaths. Numerous noteworthy elements fuel Foley’s narrative, including an impressively diverse cast of secondary characters, including a politician with twisted sexual proclivities, a naïve marine biologist, and a sleazy realtor. They effectively flesh out the multilayered mystery, and the author also explores environmental issues, such as global warming and marine plastic pollution, with subtlety and compassion. Infrequent moments of social commentary add brass-knuckle impact, as well: “He’s greedy, he doesn’t believe in climate change, he’s a racist, a misogynist, and he’s homophobic…He’s like half the men in Florida.”",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lindsay-oneill/the-two-princes-of-mpfumo/",
    "description": "O’Neill, a University of Southern California historian, excavates the story of two East African princes who boarded a British ship with the intention of traveling to London, only to be sold into slavery in Jamaica. After years of enslavement, the princes persuaded a lawyer to help them regain their freedom, setting up the next stage of their journey to London and then, finally, back home to Mpfumo, in present-day Mozambique. As O’Neill follows the two men, she shines a light on the lesser-known British slave trade in East Africa and Madagascar and the troubling, naïve, and conflicting interests of the British East India Company, Royal African Company, and Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. O’Neill’s thoughtful and extensive research is apparent, but information about the princes themselves is limited by the sparse and problematic archival record. O’Neill, acutely aware of the bias implicit in the extant European sources, seeks to reclaim the princes’ agency by questioning her sources and using speculation to “recreate [the princes’] reactions to certain events.” This approach is generally effective but falters when O’Neill speculates about the reasons that one of the princes took his own life before returning home to Mpfumo. Throughout, O’Neill relies on historical context to stand in for the missing details of the princes’ lives. Readers will better understand the complex moral, racial, and trade networks the princes traversed, but much about the princes themselves—even their given names—remains obscured.",
