    "description": "The story begins by likening words to people: specifically, the way each word is unique and lovely just the way it is. Every word does something no other word can, and when different words meet, “Words are like kids / Who see each other / And begin to play.” The author underscores the anxiety words can produce and acknowledges the way we sometimes can’t find the right ones and say the wrong thing: “Words can feel shy / And hide when we need them.” Some words are angry and frightening in some contexts, and in others, the same words can heal by naming the things that are scary. Davis-Gibbon notes that speaking the truth with words is brave and commendable. Berry’s whimsical pencil-and-watercolor illustrations abound with hidden words disguised as characters and objects. Readers will enjoy looking for all the words buried in the full-page pictures; flower, for example, is depicted using blooming plants in a garden. This balance of text and images will undoubtedly delight kids, and the presentation of the text makes for an easy read. The narration retains its accessibility and clarity as it builds gradually from words to simple metaphors to the emotional consequences of words to the ending, which tackles the complex notion of speaking out and speaking one’s truth.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michelle-olson/emily-was-so-embarrassed-tales-from-the-craft-box/",
    "description": "Emily, an anthropomorphized button the color and texture of a strawberry, is happy dancing and twirling her blue ribbon in the privacy of her craft-box bedroom. Her friend Becky, a yellow button, enters them both in a talent show, but Emily doesn’t want to dance in public—she’s very anxious about making a mistake (“I might mess up”). But she agrees, for Becky’s sake. They practice hard, and once they’re on stage together, Emily is able to perform…until she trips on her ribbon and falls down. Luckily, Becky keeps singing. Emily picks herself up and restarts her routine. After the show, her button friends all congratulate her and ask her to teach them dancing. Olson tells Emily’s story through simple prose and exquisitely staged photographs depicting actual google-eyed buttons with wire legs and arms. The scenes are ingenious in their composition, incorporating motion shots (note especially Emily’s ribbon dances, and the juggling tableau on Page 14), setting-appropriate repurposings (such as pencils for bench seats), a mixture of artfully focused close-up and establishing shots, and copious background details to contextualize the button protagonists. Emily is a relatable character and her trepidation will resonate with many a budding young performer. That she actually does mess up is an astute plot development, teaching kids to embrace the doing and sharing of what they love—not to overvalue being perfect at it.",
