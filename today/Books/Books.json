    "description": "Wren Goldsmith is a 12-year-old Beast Saver whose mission is to protect Beasts in need with the help of a Companion Beast named Tolstoy—a doglike creature who can change size at will and has fur that functions as armor. Wren is confident, skilled, quick-thinking, and eager to prove his abilities as a new Saver. The plot revolves around Wren and Tolstoy’s mission to the Pomm Islands, where formerly peaceful Beasts are going on rampages. The cause of the unrest seems to be parasites infecting the creatures, which drive them to violence. Wren must subdue a massive Beast called a coral cow, which is ordinarily a caretaker of the coral reefs. Later, the tween encounters twins Maxie and Vega, who are part of a mysterious group known as the Scavengers; they work for a larger, unknown entity that’s likely involved in illegal activity. Wren, Tolstoy, and their ally, Lieutenant Tang, investigate as they aim to restore order to the islands; however, the mystery behind who’s responsible for the chaos remains unsolved, hinting at future adventures. Overall, Upton’s story is marked by energetic pacing and action-driven plot development, and it feels well-suited for its target audience of young readers. The characterization leans heavily on familiar archetypes, with Wren as the brave hero, Tolstoy as the loyal sidekick, and the bickering twin antagonists, who embody their roles with lines such as “It’s so unfair. Just because you were born two minutes early—” The characters’ relationships are central to the narrative, and the author highlights trust and teamwork throughout. Upton’s prose style is simple yet vivid, with imaginative descriptions of Beasts and dynamic action scenes, and the dialogue snappily propels the plot forward.",

    "description": "Colt has a secret identity. By day, he’s a seemingly ordinary child, but when the neighborhood needs his help, he transforms into Neigh Kid—dressed in a horse mask, a red cape, and nothing else. He envisions himself as a majestic hero, galloping through streets on a mission to save a lost pet. However, the humorous reality is that he’s a scantily clad child dashing away from his loving parents, who are desperately trying to get him to put on clothes. Colt’s playful antics are sure to elicit laughter from kids and adults. However, the overarching, serious message of the story is one of bravery. Although elementary school–age children will find the text accessible, adults may need to explain occasional wordplay: “A cat: lost. A street: crossed. Colt: tossed.” Moraes’s full-color cartoon illustrations strategically and cleverly cover the protagonist’s nudity with a well-placed falling leaf or a flick of his cape. Colt and his family are depicted with pale skin, and his neighbors are portrayed with brown skin tones. A list of objects is included at the end for readers to spot in the illustrations, making each read an interactive experience.",
