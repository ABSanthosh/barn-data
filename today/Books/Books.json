    "description": "Libby Casey, who runs a design business, is inexplicably drawn to a colonial house for sale. She thinks moving there may be the change she needs, as she’s still in the home where she lived with her beloved husband, Ray, who died only 18 months earlier. She’s not at her new home for long before strange things begin to happen: A chair scrapes across the floor in the dead of night, and a glove, which her border collie mix Buck had found, mysteriously moves. These are just the first of many similar incidents, all of which Libby soon attributes to a ghost, likely the former homeowner from back in the 18th century. She dives into the estate’s history assisted by a diary excerpt and her eccentric neighbor, who may be psychic (the woman dismisses labels). Libby will do whatever she can to get rid of this ghost so that she (and maybe the spirit, too) can live in peace. McGroarty zeroes in on the bright cast, providing enriching details; Libby still mourns her lost husband and has trouble sleeping. As the ghost seemingly takes over her life, she deals with assorted reactions: Her amiable business partner, Harry, is supportive, but her friend Diana, sadly, tends to question Libby’s unsettling experiences (“I just think you might need a rest”). Though the ghostly occurrences are more curious than frightening, a concurrent plotline set in the 1700s turns increasingly dark. Along with the alternating plotlines, Libby’s concise narration keeps everything moving at a steady clip as she inches closer to revealing secrets, including one of her own. The wrap-up is wholly satisfying for every character, both present and past.",

    "description": "It’s 2212, and 17-year old Earther Weslie has won the Interplanetary Alliance Life Support Bot competition for her bot named ILSA, or Individualized Life Support Assistant unit 001. The prize is a first-class ticket on luxury starship The Boundless, scheduled to embark on its maiden voyage to Mars, a five-week trip. In this future, the elite live in a life-sustaining environment on Mars, while the lower classes mine the Earth for resources and work in factories. Weslie’s mother works for Dalloway Technologies, the sponsor of the bot contest. In a rush to the ship, Weslie crashes into Jupiter Dalloway, the young heir to the Dalloway company. Jupiter is only the heir because his older sister recently died, and he wants nothing to do with the company, preferring artistic pursuits to technological ones. On the voyage, the two are thrust together repeatedly, leading to ample romantic tension between them as they’re continuously at odds thanks to their vastly different backgrounds. Because she won the contest, Weslie is given a room on the first-class deck. She is shocked and disgusted by the extravagance of the wealthy Mars inhabitants while on Earth, she and her mother struggle to survive. She is looked down upon by the other first-class passengers, and is even questioned by staff more than once about what she’s doing in first class. As in James Cameron’s Titanic, the romantic lead can’t resist the tension despite their difference in class and the expectations of Jupiter’s family. Starling slips in many Titanic references, although the novel will still be thrilling to any who haven’t seen it. Starling manages to make a critique of classism romantic and thrilling, with high stakes and heavy swoons. Weslie and Jupiter are both assumed white, but the supporting cast is ethnically diverse.",
