    "description": "In his debut novel, the author introduces readers to his bass-playing FBI agent, Gus Wheeler, who’s in the prime of his career, working as a field agent in Boston and pursuing his musical interests in a touring band. His newest case involves two longtime friends, murdered in quick succession in (fictional) Kendalton, Massachusetts. Gus and his partner, Vanessa Lambert, head up there just in time to examine the second crime scene, where they discover a surprising signature from the killer—an old photo of a girl, Rebecca Munroe, who died by suicide as a teenager some years ago. When Gus and Vanessa ask the victims’ friend group about Rebecca, they’re met with clear deception, as the women claim they barely knew her. Gus, a small-town native himself, knows this can’t possibly be true in a place the size of Kendalton. The narrative shifts, then, to spend time with each of the women in the group, and readers come to learn about their unique history as childhood friends. They also find out that Rebecca was no stranger to these girls, and that her death is not as straightforward as it initially seemed. As Gus and Vanessa scramble to find the killer and uncover secrets, the murderer’s rampage goes on. Although conventions of the genre abound in Dingle’s novel—the requisite will-they, won’t-they between FBI agents, the one evil friend who pushes the others into complicity—the action is well paced enough to keep readers turning the pages. The prose is occasionally striking, such as when it addresses the very act of writing itself: “And it was with this feeling of apprehension, of loss, that she stared at the blank page that would, at some point, contain the words that, woven together, would become the eulogy.” Fans of classic mysteries and FBI thrillers in particular will be happy to race this one to the finish line.",

    "description": "Irish poet and novelist Rooney creates a well-researched account of the eventful, peripatetic life of journalist, photographer, and fiction writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach (1908-42). The strong-willed, glamorous daughter of a wealthy Swiss silk-manufacturing family, Schwarzenbach grew from a young tomboy into a daring, ambitious, yet troubled woman. To Thomas Mann, the restless Annemarie seemed a “rebel angel.” In a family that supported the Nazis, she was violently opposed. Her controlling mother, who had a 30-year relationship with a prominent female opera singer, could not countenance Annemarie’s lesbian liaisons. Distancing herself from her mother, Rooney asserts, became her life’s work. Rooney chronicles Schwarzenbach’s love affairs; her marriage of convenience to a French diplomat, which afforded her a coveted diplomatic passport; and her friendships, the most enduring of which was with Mann’s children Klaus and Erika. Klaus, a frequent travel companion, introduced her to the gay underworld of Berlin, rife with drugs. By 1932, she was a morphine addict. Psychologically fragile, she was in and out of psychiatric clinics, attempted suicide, and taxed the patience of friends with her overwhelming neediness, as she spiraled deeper into addiction and alcoholism. Writing and traveling, Rooney asserts, served her as “lodestones in time of crisis”: reporting, photojournalism, and even archaeological digs took her through Europe—Paris, Venice, Zurich, Nice—and the Middle East, Persia, Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, and the Balkans; she traveled to the U.S. three times. During her last trip there, in 1940, she met the newly hailed young novelist Carson McCullers, who became besotted with her, an attraction that was not reciprocated. Despite her mother’s burning her letters and diaries, Rooney mines ample German, French, and English sources to inform a thorough biography.",
