    "description": "Devon Paige has made a grave misstep: She was caught mid-kiss with Bentley Preston, husband of her employer Julianna. Devon has worked hard to build up her clientele as a personal chef in Boston, but Julianna Preston is quick to get the word out, and soon Devon is fired from all her contracts but one. At loose ends, she accepts a job offer as dining services director at the Rockwood boarding school in New Hampshire, desperate to get away from all the attention. When Devon arrives in New Hampshire, there is a surprise waiting for her: a blast from the past in the form of history and government teacher (and soccer coach) Kyle Holling. Back in 2007, Devon spent one romantic night with Kyle, then never saw him again. Kyle is now divorced and available, and their attraction has not gone away. Bouchard’s romance trundles along at a good speed. In the course of the story, the author touches on questions of whether there is ever room for second chances in romance and what to do when life throws you a curveball. Devon is entirely relatable in the position in which she has found herself, if not necessarily for how she got there. While her chemistry with a paramedic called Heath seems anything but natural—it’s a placeholder romance from the start—her big-sisterly relationship with basketball player David Anders, who remains her only client after her initial indiscretion, is a welcome side plot that shows the caring nature of her character. The glimpse into the world of boarding-school gossip is also fun (Devon observes, “Apparently, I had fled one scandal-ridden situation for another one”), avoiding predictable tropes about going from the big city to a small town. Bouchard does not settle for a one-dimensional story, and the romance fares better because of it.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lori-pappas/the-magic-of-yes/",
    "description": "The journey begins with taking responsibility for one’s present circumstances, regardless of any past hardships. The author differentiates between being a victim (a temporary state out of one’s control) and having a victim mentality (using painful experiences for pity or as an excuse). Readers learn about the importance and types of boundaries (physical, emotional, and intellectual) as well as dysfunctional relationship dynamics like codependence, enmeshment, and avoidance. Per Pappas, being the “curious entrepreneur of your own life” involves saying yes, embracing creativity, observing, and collaborating. Two questions (“What if?” and “Why not me?”) allow one to challenge the status quo and consider new possibilities, while another question (“What’s in it for me?”) can help one understand another’s motivation. The author demonstrates the importance of cross-cultural learning, empathy, and getting out of one’s comfort zone with examples from her time in Ethiopia’s South Omo Valley working with Indigenous communities. Other practices that the author recommends for improving the quality of life include embracing authenticity, choosing joy, and investing in healthy social relationships (romantic or otherwise). Pappas concludes with a wise-woman mantra that calls upon open-mindedness, connection, compassion, and curiosity to foster personal growth and collective well-being. The author’s DREAM (Desire, Reflect, Explore, Acknowledge, and Mantra) model (referenced at the end of each chapter) provides a unique structured framework for transformation that readers can use to apply the lessons to their lives. While Pappas is brave and vulnerable in sharing difficult details from her past, the retelling of events outweighs the actionable advice. Some of the book’s tips, like embracing fear, getting comfortable with failure, and practicing mindfulness and meditation are well-trod material in the self-help space. Other advice, like repeating “peace, love, harmony” three times when an unwanted thought pops up, may be too simplistic for those struggling with complex problems.",
