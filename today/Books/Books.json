    "description": "Activist and historian Edmonds began to research the life of her great-great-grandfather, Jefferson Lewis Edmonds, in 2009, inspired by her father to “care for our archive, the value of it.” Like much else in Black history, that archive was scattered and incomplete: Edmonds hit the documentary trail at home in Los Angeles but traveled to Ghana to fill in missing pieces of the story. “I didn’t have an end plan. All I knew was that I had to go,” she writes. Jefferson, as she calls him, was less concerned with the ancestral homeland: As he wrote in 1910 in the newspaper he founded, The Liberator, “It has been fully 200 years since our ancestors left Africa, so we have lost track of whatever right or title to any property they may have held.” Instead, Jefferson maintained, African Americans were truly Americans, deserving of the full citizenship rights that had been frustrated by the failure of Reconstruction. In that light, Jefferson, born in slavery in the Deep South, counseled that Black Americans would do well to abandon the region and make, in his instance, for Los Angeles, where The Liberator would come to enjoy a subscriber base of nearly half the city’s African American population: Jefferson believed strongly that the community needed not just jobs and homes, but also “a record of their lives.” He strongly advocated for land ownership and entrepreneurship, no easy task even in California, which had Jim Crow laws of its own. Edmonds’ narrative is conversational in tone and sometimes wanders, but it makes an important point that the stories that each Black American family has gathered need “a home and an advocate,” and ideally a font for many more such books.",

    "description": "Gwendolyn Richards bickers with her mother on a regular morning as the family is preparing to begin another day. With roosters crowing in the yard and Gwen’s dad getting ready for a humdrum shift at the nearby sugar factory, mother and daughter share local news until Gwen’s best friend, Sharon, arrives to walk with Gwen to school. Along the way, Sharon teases Gwen about Lenwell Turnbull, a classmate who’s clearly smitten with Gwen (“Even Ms. Bridgewater probably see how all you looking at each other on de landing when you tink nobody watching”). As the story unfolds, readers are treated to flirtatious high school moments between Gwen and Lenwell, complete with note-passing and meaningful glances across classrooms. Gwen grows closer to Lenwell just as her mother begins to fall ill with a disease; the deeper her feelings grow for Lenwell, the sicker her mother becomes, and the correlation is confusing for Gwen. Everything comes to a head when Gwen’s father hatches an unexpected plan to secure Gwen’s future, one that seems to leave no room for Lenwell. Told from Gwen’s perspective throughout, the narrative follows her daily life, which consists primarily of days at school and at home. While the scenes can begin to feel repetitive—the pacing lags as each day bleeds slowly into the next—the author does an admirable job of showing how a teenage crush can grow into a deeper and more meaningful relationship. The story also thoughtfully explores the ways in which adolescents continue to look to their parents for guidance, alternately mirroring, resisting, and ultimately growing through those relationships. While the book would have benefitted from additional setting details to help ground the reader in time and place, the Caribbean-English dialogue adds a rich, authentic voice to this unhurried tale. What the story lacks in suspense it makes up for with emotional nuance and thematic depth, tackling issues such as caregiving, young love, and finding happiness in the shadow of loss.",
