    "description": "When Ahamed arrived in suburban Boston in 1970, she felt “an acute sense of disappointment,” she writes. “What were these quaint, old-fashioned houses doing in the land that had sent men and rocket ships to the moon?” The silence of her new home made her long for the noise and liveliness of her native India. In the ensuing decades, her opinions changed—so much so that she was inspired to write a book about her adopted country and to explore the contributions that Indian Americans have made to American culture and society. Ahamed chose to focus on three fields: tech, medicine, and public policy. Each section of the book features interviews and profiles of Indian American leaders, including Sun Microsystems founder Vinod Khosla, author and neurosurgeon Atul Gawande, and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Most of the leaders Ahamed profiles are men; the exceptions are Haley, as well as sisters and businesswomen Chandrika Tandon and Indra Nooyi, who share a chapter. While several of the interviews present fascinating insights into the characters of these high-profile people—for example, legal scholar Neal Katyal discusses how taking improv classes improved his performance arguing in front of the Supreme Court—the book lacks overall coherence, jumping between leaders without drawing sufficient connections between their attitudes and histories. Ahamed’s implicit definition of success seems to involve amassing degrees from elite institutions and becoming wealthy, an approach that not only reinscribes the model minority myth, but also is debunked by interviewees like Surgeon General Vivek Murthy.",

    "description": "Fifteen-year-old Dominic Cantrell is focused on baseball, getting his license, the school play he’s (reluctantly) acting in, and spending time with his two best friends, Farhad Shirvani and Mia Stark. That is, until Farhad’s family’s drugstore is burgled and vandalized in what is clearly a hate crime, and the girl Dom is dating turns out to have a complicated connection to a recent murder. These events push Dom into the role of a young Sherlock Holmes, tailing a car at night, recruiting his friends to observe suspicious interactions, and landing himself in extremely dangerous situations. The story moves along quickly, but this pace comes at the expense of details such as robust character development and descriptions. Farhad’s dad is from Pakistan, but this information doesn’t appear until a third of the way into the book (Dom and Mia are white). Deeply important conversations about racism, hate crimes, and depression arise, but the characters discuss the subjects only shallowly. Some of the teenspeak feels inauthentic and cliched. Ultimately, the novel deals with a very adult mystery disappointingly, merely scratching the surface of what could have been a more nuanced, believable story.",
