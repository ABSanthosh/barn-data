    "description": "In 1926, a man named Robert Thomas and a male friend, both Black, had to fight off a white female usher, white manager, and six riot officers to be allowed to take the orchestra seats they had purchased rather than be banished to the balcony at Harlem’s Loew’s Victoria Theatre. This was just one of many incidents in the early 20th century in which Black New Yorkers, no strangers to racist treatment, endured discrimination and violence while trying to attend one of the city’s theaters. In this well-written work, Lopez “traces Black film culture in New York City from its origins in the early twentieth century to its firm establishment in the 1930s,” defining Black film culture as “Black New Yorkers’ interactions with cinema and surrounding institutions, not necessarily the cinematic output itself.” In illuminating chapters, she describes the alternative venues Black audiences had to locate when established theaters proved inhospitable; the “young Black girls’ and women’s moviegoing experiences” and the fear that their attendance led to “promiscuity, criminality, and incorrigibility”; the battles that Oscar Micheaux, “the most successful Black filmmaker in the first half of the twentieth century,” had to wage to get his “racially charged” films approved by censors; the attempts by film operators to unionize; and the pioneering reporting of Black journalists, particularly at the New York Age, to call attention to the “connections between racist cinema and its proprietors and the debilitating effects of racism on Black New Yorkers.” The writing is sometimes dry, but Lopez brings this sorry period to life by recounting memorable moments, as when she notes the 1930 incident of the projection booth at the Renaissance Theatre crashing down onto the patrons below, a tragedy that would have been worse if the projectionists hadn’t turned off the projector first and prevented a fire.",

    "title": "THE PERSUASION GAME",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/chad-lewis/the-persuasion-game/",
    "description": "Although candidate Donald Trump “vowed to drain the influence peddling swamp in Washington, DC,” author Lewis asserts in the book’s introduction, “he did the exact opposite” as president. Particularly egregious is the administration’s intermingling of corporate and foreign interests, which, the author says, benefited many with access to the Oval Office. As an advisor to the president, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ran a “parallel version of the State Department,” according to Lewis, which leveraged his connections to develop ties with regimes in Turkey, Russia, and Venezuela. The author asserts that Guiliani and his associates skirted regulations that had been in place since the 1930s passage of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and adopted autocratic tactics inside the American political system. Per the book’s convincing analysis, the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection was a “natural outcome of the never-ending persuasion games that occurred during Trump’s presidency,” as the administration effectively created an alternate reality via disinformation that played upon his supporters’ worst fears and biases. Lewis, a global traveler who once resided in Russia, writes that he first noticed early signs of what he deemed to be Russian interference in American politics after seeing social media accounts parrot “Putin’s talking points” with “English grammar mistakes common for Russian speakers.” Although the author doesn’t hold back on its critiques of Trump administration tactics, his book’s main strength is its painstaking research, which yielded more than 3,000 endnotes. There’s also a laudable dedication to accessibility, as readers unacquainted with the nuances of contemporary geopolitics will find this book’s explanations clear and concise. To that end, Lewis supplements his engaging narrative with a wealth of charts, reproductions of primary sources, textbox vignettes, and other visual elements. A comprehensive timeline of cited administration connections to Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela appears in a useful appendix.",
