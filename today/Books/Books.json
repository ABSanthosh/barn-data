    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/valerie-van-clieaf-1/copper-mountain/",
    "description": "Alex, a Secwépemc First Nations PI, formerly with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, is called in to investigate the attempted murder of Max King, a lawyer involved in bringing suits against mining interests, and Max’s girlfriend, Rose Barlow. Max and Alex are both members of the redz, a secret network of Indigenous people who are helping to coordinate “White Paper Blizzard,” an international, coordinated attempt to bring lawsuits against companies whose ecological degradation is jeopardizing individuals’ “right to a healthy environment.” At the outset, Max’s assailants dump him near the entrance of one of the rare earthmines his group is targeting. His mother calls on Alex to investigate, and the private eye, along with a former Mountie colleague, a couple of local detectives, and the redz work together to unravel a complex situation that involves an organized crime ring, competing corporations, and others who would have a lot to lose from mine closures. Over the course of the novel, Van Clieaf spins a plot that’s ambitious and engaging, even if it sometimes stretches the limits of credibility. The writing style is sometimes a bit flat or clinical, which makes it hard for readers to get a grasp on some of the secondary characters. A few, however, such as mob goon Frank McGiver, are vivid, over-the-top characters that genre fans are likely to recognize and appreciate. The story also addresses the processes of rare earth mining with clarity, and it’s at its strongest when it explores the nuances of complex social and political issues.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/meenakshi-ahamed/indian-genius/",
    "description": "When Ahamed arrived in suburban Boston in 1970, she felt “an acute sense of disappointment,” she writes. “What were these quaint, old-fashioned houses doing in the land that had sent men and rocket ships to the moon?” The silence of her new home made her long for the noise and liveliness of her native India. In the ensuing decades, her opinions changed—so much so that she was inspired to write a book about her adopted country and to explore the contributions that Indian Americans have made to American culture and society. Ahamed chose to focus on three fields: tech, medicine, and public policy. Each section of the book features interviews and profiles of Indian American leaders, including Sun Microsystems founder Vinod Khosla, author and neurosurgeon Atul Gawande, and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Most of the leaders Ahamed profiles are men; the exceptions are Haley, as well as sisters and businesswomen Chandrika Tandon and Indra Nooyi, who share a chapter. While several of the interviews present fascinating insights into the characters of these high-profile people—for example, legal scholar Neal Katyal discusses how taking improv classes improved his performance arguing in front of the Supreme Court—the book lacks overall coherence, jumping between leaders without drawing sufficient connections between their attitudes and histories. Ahamed’s implicit definition of success seems to involve amassing degrees from elite institutions and becoming wealthy, an approach that not only reinscribes the model minority myth, but also is debunked by interviewees like Surgeon General Vivek Murthy.",
