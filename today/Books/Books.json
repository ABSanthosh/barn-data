    "description": "Barry Swanson, a 70-year-old widower, moves into Blue Loon Village, a senior living center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the insistence of his daughter. He’s not entirely ready to give up on living an active life, but he’s also not one to rock the boat. His attitude changes, though, when he discovers that his old high school girlfriend, Beth, is living in the same residence. Beth is as lively as ever, and she quickly recruits him for some serious boat-rocking—with little concern for potential legal consequences. When they discover that their neighbor’s granddaughter is a victim of domestic abuse, they make a plan to kidnap and terrorize the husband to scare him straight. The mission is a success, so the pair hit the road to enact more DIY justice: They rob a shipment of Spam and distribute it to unhoused people; they pick up Jenny Callahan from Des Moines, who’s on the run from an abusive husband, and she becomes their sidekick; and all three later get caught in a mass shooting during which Barry makes good use of a can of Spam. Later adventures send them to Florida, and toward a final showdown. Overall, Essen delivers a smart, gripping read that adults of any generation will enjoy, but it’s likely to appeal particularly to readers around the same age as the gray-haired heroes. Its overriding message that people of any age can make a difference in the world has universal appeal. The novel never takes itself too seriously, and it’s chock full of funny moments, despite the sometimes-dark subject matter. The book will also be a great fit for animal lovers, as the gang helps many creatures, including alligators, on their journey; Barry’s beloved leopard gecko, Gertrude, is effectively a member of the team. The narrative does simplify some issues surrounding vigilante justice, but few readers will object to the Silver Squad’s courage, even when they’re on the wrong side of the law.",

    "description": "Parker Hanson is a New Hampshirite and former investigative reporter now doing PI work. But sitting long hours on stake-outs without falling asleep requires a “generous amount of caffeine,” which (“along with a poor family history”) factored into Parker’s recent heart attack before his 45th birthday. On a current case, when he’s not watching baseball or going to cardiac rehab, Parker is shadowing Mark Bowman, deputy chief of staff in Governor Jack Gordon’s office.  Mark’s wife Brooke, an attractive woman in her mid-30s, hires Parker to find out if her suddenly distant husband is having an affair. “If he is, then he’s an idiot,” Parker thinks. But when trailing Mark, Parker sees him get into a woman’s car. Then a truck intentionally hits the couple’s car, engulfing it in flames, and the truck driver flees. Mark and the woman—who turns out to be Parker’s former co-worker, reporter Maggie Malone—are dead. Parker noses around the newspaper and talks to Maggie’s roommate, discovering that the journalist was investigating a private forest management concern called Tree Kings that had been awarded a state contract by the Gordon administration; a government IT staffer discovered that Tree Kings’ bid for the contract had been tampered with after the submission deadline, and Mark wouldn’t let the matter rest. The writing is crisp, but the plot is predictable. Still, Parker is an engaging character, one to root for. The theme of fatherhood weaves through the narrative; another thread follows Parker’s recovery efforts after his heart attack (the camaraderie at cardiac rehab fleshes out the protagonist). Baseball references pepper the text, but there’s no need to italicize them—or such other emphasized comments as “Good question.” The late-stage introduction of the sweet bloodhound Minerva is a welcome extra.",
