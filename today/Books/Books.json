    "description": "Ethan Moll is the very definition of an eligible bachelor: He’s handsome and charming, hails from a wealthy family, and is a rising star as a digital-marketing recruiter at Integrated Business Solutions.When he’s found stabbed to death in the shower in his Kentucky home, some suspecthis ex-girlfriend, Gabbi Edwards, who was openly distraught when he left her. Jenna,the fiancée of Ethan’s best friend, Ross, is absolutely convinced that Gabbi is the killer. Gabbi does seem a bit flighty as an enthusiast of whatever is the most fashionable spiritual movement of the moment; she runs a fitness coaching website and diagnoses herself a “Highly Sensitive Person.” However, Det. Lindy D’Arnaud is not so sure, as she keeps uncovering other possibilities; Ethan, for example, has mounting money problems, and he works for a shady and possibly criminal boss. Meanwhile, Lindy and her wife, April, manage a queer relationship in Pleasant Springs, a small town in conservative Kentucky that’s “smack dab in the middle of nowhere.” Their lives become more complicated when Jeff, April’s former college friend, decides to return to town, as he may be interested in establishing a relationship with his biological child. Years ago, he’d donated sperm so that Lindy and April could have a daughter. Nothing in Bradley’s absorbing novel is simple; indeed, the plot is as complex and as unpredictable as life itself, though it never feels convoluted. Instead, the author renders the mystery, and the everyday lives that surround it, with admirable clarity. The book’s characterization is its strongest suit, with each detailed portrait as fully realized as the next: “I swear to God, all Gabbi ordered was a cup of hot water with a lemon, a fruit cup and one—count it, one—scrambled egg white. I mean, who eats like that?” Overall, this is a captivating story on multiple levels.",

    "description": "“The responsibility for the nation and people of Tibet was placed upon me the moment I was recognized as the Dalai Lama at the age of two.” When he became Tibet’s leader at 16, the year Chinese soldiers swarmed into the formerly independent nation, he entered into numerous discussions with Mao Zedong (“truly unlike anyone I had met”), Zhou Enlai (“clever and smooth-talking”), and other Communist leaders, one of whom warned him that should he flee because Tibet would meet the same fate as Hungary, freshly crushed by the Soviets. When it became apparent that Mao intended to absorb Tibet as a strategic buffer and as part of the symbolic restoration of “territories that had once been part of the Manchu Qing empire,” the Dalai Lama went into exile and, as he notes, has never since been able to return to his native land. “Mao probably realized that with me gone out of Tibet,” he writes, “China would struggle with the question of legitimacy both of their authority and their presence in Tibet. He was right.” Today, he adds, the regime of Xi Jinping is bent on assimilating Tibet, suppressing religious practices, and removing children to Mandarin-speaking boarding schools. Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama still finds hope for Tibet in the roiling undercurrents of Chinese society—the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989, for example, which, he holds, by no means “marks the end of the Chinese people’s quest for greater freedom, dignity, and democracy.” A surprising discovery is that the Dalai Lama has long been willing to leave Tibet within the People’s Republic of China, but with control over its own internal affairs and a democratic government.",
