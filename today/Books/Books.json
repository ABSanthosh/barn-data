    "description": "Gwendolyn Richards bickers with her mother on a regular morning as the family is preparing to begin another day. With roosters crowing in the yard and Gwen’s dad getting ready for a humdrum shift at the nearby sugar factory, mother and daughter share local news until Gwen’s best friend, Sharon, arrives to walk with Gwen to school. Along the way, Sharon teases Gwen about Lenwell Turnbull, a classmate who’s clearly smitten with Gwen (“Even Ms. Bridgewater probably see how all you looking at each other on de landing when you tink nobody watching”). As the story unfolds, readers are treated to flirtatious high school moments between Gwen and Lenwell, complete with note-passing and meaningful glances across classrooms. Gwen grows closer to Lenwell just as her mother begins to fall ill with a disease; the deeper her feelings grow for Lenwell, the sicker her mother becomes, and the correlation is confusing for Gwen. Everything comes to a head when Gwen’s father hatches an unexpected plan to secure Gwen’s future, one that seems to leave no room for Lenwell. Told from Gwen’s perspective throughout, the narrative follows her daily life, which consists primarily of days at school and at home. While the scenes can begin to feel repetitive—the pacing lags as each day bleeds slowly into the next—the author does an admirable job of showing how a teenage crush can grow into a deeper and more meaningful relationship. The story also thoughtfully explores the ways in which adolescents continue to look to their parents for guidance, alternately mirroring, resisting, and ultimately growing through those relationships. While the book would have benefitted from additional setting details to help ground the reader in time and place, the Caribbean-English dialogue adds a rich, authentic voice to this unhurried tale. What the story lacks in suspense it makes up for with emotional nuance and thematic depth, tackling issues such as caregiving, young love, and finding happiness in the shadow of loss.",

    "title": "A SONG FOR OLAF",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jennifer-boulanger/a-song-for-olaf/",
    "description": "The author begins the story of her beloved brother in 1993 with the striking observation that, even though they were both grown adults now, the AIDS virus has shrunk her brother’s body, leaving him “lost in the folds of an over-washed, white hospital gown.” When they were children in 1969, Olaf (as Boulanger lovingly called him) was a vivacious performer and source of joy in their household in Utica, New York. His departure for college—though the school was a mere 30-minute drive away—felt like an epic tragedy to Boulanger and her parents. By the mid-1980s, Boulanger had become a teacher with two children and Olaf had gone on to live in Chicago and Atlanta with his beloved partner, Teddy—it was during a visit that Teddy first spoke of trouble with his stomach. Suddenly, years of news reports and Olaf’s own vague references to something happening among his friends became disturbingly real to the author as Teddy’s illness progressed rapidly to full-blown AIDS. (“It could be just pneumonia,” Boulanger says to her brother about his lover, desperately trying to prolong the inevitable affirmation that AIDS had come into their family’s lives. “People get it all the time.”) Then Boulanger spotted a mulberry-colored spot on her brother’s back that she describes as “gaping” and “raw.” In devastating scenes reminiscent of classic AIDS-focused dramas like Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, Boulanger walks readers through her brother’s slow decline and his various hospital stays throughout the early 1990s before his death from the disease.With each indelible scene in the memoir’s second half, Boulanger digs into the unsettling mix of horror, love, political complexities, humor, and immense sadness that AIDS created. The imagery she crafts from her memories is raw and immensely powerful—readers will surely feel that they were in the room with her, seeing rows of “ashen-faced men with skeletal bodies reclined, their bony knees pointing upward sharply.” Her memoir is overflowing with these tiny details that pack a tremendous emotional punch. Boulanger’s movement through several time periods feels a bit wobbly at first, leaving readers with some basic questions about the family’s history, but by the time she reaches her and Olaf’s adulthood, she is in complete, impressive command of the narrative. So many elements are left simmering quietly in the background, like the rising media interest in AIDS and the subtle, almost imperceptible homophobia that she saw around Olaf. The result is an engrossing, almost suspenseful story, even if readers know how it will end. There is plenty of joy throughout, as well—Boulanger perfectly captures the siblings’ pure excitement for life as young people, and shows how Olaf maintained it, in some ways, until the very end. Her smart epilogue makes a compelling comparison between Covid-19 and AIDS, calling out the dangers of misinformation, isolation, and lack of empathy. Fortunately for readers, Boulanger shows she has plenty of empathy and wisdom to spare.",
