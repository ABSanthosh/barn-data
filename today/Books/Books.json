    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/joel-wuthnow/chinas-quest-for-military-supremacy/",
    "description": "Wuthnow and Saunders, of the Institute for National Strategic Studies, emphasize that just as the 2008 Olympics marked China’s emergence as a global heavyweight, the recent military demonstrations against Taiwan symbolize a new era for the People’s Liberation Army. It’s stronger, more modern, and more confident today, yet there remain intrinsic flaws that neither technology nor money will solve. American soldiers swear allegiance to the Constitution, the PLA to the Communist Party. Almost all officers and many lower ranks are Party members, and political indoctrination takes up a major part of their time even after basic training. Mao Zedong’s word was law until his death in 1976, when, following the disastrous Cultural Revolution, his successors aimed to clean up the mess he left. Few deny their success, which included reforming the PLA, although that remains a work in progress. The authors remind readers that authoritarian states must pay especially close attention to their military, whose professionals, like soldiers everywhere, look down on civilians. They add that, during its early decades, the military budget was not a top priority, and the PLA continued its tradition of raising money by commercial activity, which institutionalized a great deal of corruption. They recount 50 years of efforts to modernize as well as shrink the army and rein in the three negative consequences of party-army relations—autonomy, corruption, and ideological divergence. They conclude that it has been largely successful, although the PLA remains a quasi-independent self-policing organization. Along the way, readers will learn more Chinese acronyms, Chinese bureaucratic maneuvering, technical details, and scholarly military minutiae than they want to know, but they will also receive genuine insights into the transformation of this former shambling empire into a global superpower and rival.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/topper-jones/oceano-beach-bedlam-a-thad-hanlonbri-de-la-guerra-/",
    "description": "Thad Hanlon, surfer and certified public accountant, has just opened a private investigation business in the Five Cities area of the California Central Coast. He and his new partner, attorney and martial artist Bri de la Guerra, are both reeling from the deaths of their significant others three years ago—and both are eager to get their agency off the ground by landing an inaugural client. A case arrives just in the nick of time, right outside the Land Cruiser out of which Thad and his 3-year-old son are currently living: Krystle Dudamel, a former exotic dancer from Bakersfield, is looking for her missing 14-year-old son Mobius, a surfing prodigy known around the Pismo Pier as Moby Dude. “The kid was respectable for a 14-year-old but very aggro,” narrates Hanlon. “Always snaking some local’s swell and cutting them off. Being hyper-aggressive in the water is not the best way to win friends and influence people.” Could Mobius’ disappearance be linked to the murder of a local gang member, whose body was recently disinterred from the Oceano Beach sand? Hanlon and Bri will have to find out…that is, if they ever want to secure a second client. Jones’ prose effectively conveys Hanlon’s laid-back attitude, and the plot features a number of entertaining, surfer-specific elements, as when Hanlon finds a message encoded in a pile of boards: “They were stacked helter-skelter, the top side of the boards facing up. No serious surfer would do that. Leave boards in direct sunlight for the wax to melt. Strange. Had to be a cipher. Had to be some kind of message.” Neither Hanlon nor Bri appearto be particularly haunted by their losses, but it may simply be that the book’s lighthearted tone has little space for mourning. Instead, Jones delivers a proper beach read, both in form and content.",
