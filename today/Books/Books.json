    "title": "BIG BLUE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jq-sirls/big-blue/",
    "description": "Big is a dream who towers over all the other dreams in his town. In this story, they all have only two goals: to find their matching person and to help them realize their dream; when they’re successful, the dreams turn blue. As other, smaller dreams match up with their people, Big finds himself left alone, without a dreamer. He searches across town, but most people either ignore him or are intimidated by his giant size—but he continues his quest, ignoring the fact that others tease him, and refusing to quit. Over the course of this book, Sirls flips the common idea of people not giving up on dreams, offering a refreshing take that makes for an enthralling tale: “But Big was a dream / and everyone knows / that dreams never give up.” San Vicente’s whimsical cartoon illustrations help make this book stand out even further; most of the drawings are grayscale with only a few intentionally colored objects. The few spots of color give the story’s events and ultimate outcome a uniquely dramatic effect.",

    "title": "REIKI IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/m-lori-torok/reiki-in-integrative-medicine/",
    "description": "The author, an integrative healthcare practitioner, takes readers on a journey through the ins and outs of reiki, framing it as a method of healing and rejuvenation—and not, she clarifies, as a kind of religious belief. Reiki, a Japanese term meaning “universal life energy,” is a “non-invasive relaxation technique,” the author says, intended to help the body, mind, and spirit align in a state of peak health. Although users of reiki often do so on a regular basis, there’s no limit to how frequently it can be practiced, the author says. Much of what Torok discusses are the practicalities of the reiki experience, such as the various options available during a session—during which the subject may either be lying down or seated, for example—and the physical sensations that one may expect, such as temperature changes, tingling, and so on. She also delves into how to find a legitimate practitioner, as reiki is not federally licensed in the United States, and she suggests questions to ask before booking a session. The author’s information comes from various sources, including cited scientific studies, books, anecdotes about clients, and Torok’s personal experiences. Readers who are already familiar with reiki are not likely to find anything new or particularly helpful in this guide, but for beginners, it offers a trove of information. Starting with thorough explanations of what reiki is, it logically segues into the hows and whys of an often misunderstood practice. Its subject matter covers the basics in largely straightforward terms, although some passages feel less well defined, as when the author notes that reiki practitioners work with the “metaphysical experience of vibrational frequency and the healing potential of unconditional love.” Still, Torok’s warm tone and straightforward delivery ultimately make for an engaging read for anyone who’s considered reiki therapy.",
