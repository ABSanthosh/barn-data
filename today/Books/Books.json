    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/debra-k-every/deena-undone/",
    "description": "Deena Bartlett cares for her dying, elderly Aunt Agatha at Wilshire Rehab Center. She has long had a tumultuous relationship with her cantankerous aunt, but Deena—partly fueled by the facts that her own parents were both dead by the time she was 25 and that Agatha is the only living relative she has left— attempts to do her part. When Wilshire’s mysterious old cleaning woman, Jadwiga, warns her to “take care…She is coming for you,” Deena soon finds herself facing a nightmarish set of attacks seemingly designed to take out her five senses, one by one: “The hum rose higher in pitch, piercing the stale, hot air. Deena threw her hands over her ears hoping to block it out—which was when she discovered it wasn’t coming from the room. It was coming from inside her head, growing louder and higher, throbbing against her temples, pressing against her eyes until it felt as if they would burst from their sockets.” Deena seeks help from Jadwiga, who reveals that Agatha made a deal with the Sensu, an ancient creature who feeds off Deena’s senses in exchange for curing Agatha. After each attack, Deena is left with a mark somewhere on her body for five days before the Sensu moves on to the next sense. When Deena is branded with the last Tactu (touch) mark, her life will end. To stop the relentless attacks, Deena must discover the truth behind her aunt’s bargain before it’s too late.Every has crafted a genuinely spooky tale that relies less on body horror and more on the slow and patient buildup of moody suspense—an approach that fans of Grady Hendrix and Stephen King will surely welcome. The gore is never gratuitous as the tension slowly mounts and Deena uncovers the family secrets that have made her a marked woman. That’s not to say the book doesn’t have some absolutely stomach-churning moments, especially when it comes to the twisted old Agatha: “With a satisfying sense of release she pulls off her fingers, one by one, and drops them into the lake, watching the blood turn the water black. As each finger sinks it expands, becoming a formless, irregular mass floating just below the surface. She gazes at them as a mother would her children, her need for a legacy finally satisfied.” The dialogue mostly feels natural, with only a few missteps—such as the repeated appearances throughout the novel of a disembodied voice intoning “I’ve got you now,” a catchphrase that tends to come across as more “campy Wicked Witch” than legitimately creepy. The author manages to infuse her solid horror story with larger themes—including motherhood, grief, youth, and death—that lend Deena an added layer of depth while raising the stakes of her emotional and physical journey. The novel’s eerie, open-ended conclusion is reminiscent of classic horror novels and movies that manage to satisfy even as they unsettle.",

    "description": "After Count Lucian Cross is driven from his castle by vampire hunters, Vrykolakas, the god of vampires, turns him back into a human as part of a revenge plot. In his mortal form, Lucian, who’s cued white, can compete in the “marriage games” and court the future duke, all the while secretly sussing out which of the noteworthy families of the men and women also in the competition have connections to the monster hunters. If he’s successful in his tasks, Lucian will be rewarded with the return of his immortality—and more power than ever. Being human brings a slew of emotions that Lucian didn’t foresee, though, and he finds himself making friends, regretting past actions, and developing unexpected romantic feelings. Propelled by unfolding mysteries and shifting alliances, this story gets off to a slow start as Ferraro introduces the large cast, which is diverse in race and sexual orientation, and sets the scene. Patient readers are rewarded in the latter half, however, when the action and drama amp up. In the world of this story, which is set in England during a time reminiscent of the Regency era, racism and homophobia are nonexistent, allowing the tension to focus on the clash between humans and monsters. The side characters are mostly forgettable, but Lucian is a captivating romantic hero.",

    "description": "First published in France, this graphic version of Karr’s 1998 novel retains both the plot and the big, openhearted spirit of the original. The cleanly drawn art adds evocative glimpses of wide prairies and close-up views of vividly expressive faces. After learning that turkeys on sale for 25 cents in Missouri go for five dollars 800 miles away in Denver, Simon Green borrows the money for a substantial flock from his wise and encouraging schoolteacher and boldly sets out. Memorable as the premise is, the cast is even more so, led by a lad who never did well in school but nonetheless proves resourceful enough to cope with rustlers (including his own ne’er-do-well father!) on top of daunting natural hazards. Simon’s joined by two strong, resilient young women—Lizzie Hardwick, who’s just buried her entire family, and Jo Ballou, who’s escaping slavery—both of whom make active contributions to the enterprise’s eventual success. Most characters present white, though Jo is Black; they encounter a group of Pottawattomie who offer them guidance, along with a squad of bored, trigger-happy soldiers.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lynda-cohen-loigman/the-love-elixir-of-augusta-stern/",
    "description": "Growing up in 1920s Brooklyn, Augusta Stern had two heroes. First, her father, Solomon Stern, a well-respected pharmacist. Second, her great-aunt Esther, who moved in with the Sterns after Augusta’s mother died and deals in medicinals in a less conventional way. Watching her great-aunt brewing healing concoctions in the kitchen in the middle of the night after seeing her father measuring out dosages and counseling patients in the back of his drugstore during the day, Augusta dreams of becoming a pharmacist herself. And she does just that, for decades, until a hospital employee figures out that Augusta, pushing 80, has doctored her records to show that she’s in her 60s. Forced to retire, Augusta begrudgingly moves to a retirement community in Florida, and on her first morning there runs into the last man she ever wanted to see: Irving Rivkin, her father’s former delivery boy and her first love. Irving is delighted to see Augusta, whom he lovingly/annoyingly calls by her childhood nickname, Goldie, but this feeling is certainly not mutual. The complicated history between the erstwhile lovers is slowly uncovered as Loigman alternates Augusta’s present with her past. A hefty dose of theatrics bordering on the soap-operatic frequently makes the story hard to swallow. That said, Augusta and Irving’s love story is charming without being saccharine, and Augusta’s tongue-in-cheek wit combined with her renewed hopefulness makes her the perfect unexpected heroine for new beginnings: “Oh, how she wanted to be that woman again—a woman who, yes, had suffered losses, but whose heart had not yet been broken beyond repair.”",

    "description": "Today, Al Jolson (1886-1950) is famous mainly as the star of 1927’s The Jazz Singer, the first feature-length synchronized-sound film. More specifically, he’s famous for singing its showstopper, “My Mammy,” in blackface, a performance that would be unthinkable today. But in his heyday, Jolson was the best-paid entertainer on Broadway (earning $5,000 weekly at one point). In Bernstein's thoughtful account, the author of Out of the Blue (2003), China 1945 (2014), and other works, doesn’t diminish blackface’s offensiveness, but he strives to give it some meaningful context in terms of Jolson’s life and Jewish American entertainers more generally. “In enlightened, post-civil-rights-movement America,” Bernstein writes, “blackface has come to be like the swastika and the N-word, banned from public spaces. But at the time that Jolson adopted it, it was taken for granted; it was a sort of stock image, a cliché.” Born in a Lithuanian shtetl as Asa Yoelson, Jolson arrived in America hungry to assimilate and was performing onstage by the time he was 12. At the start of the 20th century, Jolson was part of a wave of Jewish Americans leading an incursion into American culture, playing leadership roles in theaters and film. It’s often forgotten that The Jazz Singer, based on a short story and play by Samson Raphaelson, was inspired by Jolson’s own story: a young Jewish cantor torn between the allure of Broadway spotlights and the demands of his family’s faith. Within that plot, Bernstein finds a rich allegory not just for Jolson’s life but for the experience of Jews in America “who came nearly to dominate American popular culture, remaking themselves and remaking the country in the process.” It’s not a full-dress Jolson bio, but some elements—particularly his abusiveness toward women—are glossed over.",

    "title": "YOU CAN CULTURE",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tobias-sturesson/you-can-culture/",
    "description": "The author opens his nonfiction debut with a concise account of his own traumatic past: The Christian community to which he and his parents belonged gradually devolved into a cult from which all three of them had to struggle to extract themselves. “How could an organization seemingly driven by a noble mission become so toxic?” he asks when reflecting on these events (and broadening them to form the basis of this book). “How did I, someone who perceived myself as an ethical and values-driven leader, become complicit in psychological abuse?” Sturesson proposes and explicates a series of habits and practices to allow leaders to take ownership, take action, and become a part of positive change, always with the reminder that “it’s not about framing yourself as the hero.” The habits are generally broad and simple, detailed under headings like “Get Humble” or “Get Integrity.” The author’s elaborations (“values cannot give us all the answers. However, they should help us wrestle with vital questions about priorities, decisions, and behaviors”), drawn from his own experiences as well as the writings of well-known motivational books like Stephen Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989) or Victor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning (1946), are laid out with illustrations and bullet points. These elements, conveyed by Sturesson’s light, highly readable prose style, make the book a refreshing reminder of the basics of both responsible corporate culture and ethical interpersonal dealings. When the author writes things like “By focusing first on what you have the ability to control or influence, you will be much better positioned to help bring positive change,” Sturesson is teaching his readers about compassionate self-control in ways that effectively blend the fields of business motivation and self-help.",

    "description": "When Los Angeles train station authorities force open two leaking, putrid-smelling trunks, the dismembered female bodies they find horrify them. Yet what leaves them especially aghast is the idea that Ruth Judd, the pretty young woman who presents a claim ticket for the trunks, could possibly be involved in what clearly appears to be murder. Notaro carefully reconstructs the Depression-era period in which this real-life crime took place and presents a sympathetic portrayal of Ruth, who manages to walk out of the baggage claim but is quickly identified as a suspect. In the narrative that follows the bodies’ discovery, Notaro alternates a chronicle of the hunt for Ruth with sections told from her point of view that reveal her motivations. A painful youth, marriage to a drug-addicted WWI veteran named Doctor, and a forced abortion at Doctor’s hands form the cornerstones of her troubled personality. She developed a lifelong obsession with the baby she lost and delusions that the child still lives. After Ruth and Doctor were temporarily separated, she eventually wound up in Phoenix, where she fell in love with Jack, a married—and unscrupulous—businessman. He got her a job at a clinic, which led to her friendship with the two lesbians who became the murder victims. As complex as it is deftly crafted—weaving newspaper accounts and letters written by the real-life Ruth within a compelling fictional web—this is a pulse-pounding, page-turning, heartbreaking account of the misunderstood woman behind a sensational news story that gripped a nation.",

    "description": "Headstrong 14-year-old Lizzie Novis refuses to believe that her mother, a U.S. embassy clerk who was working in Poland, is dead. After fleeing from her grandmother—who’s attempting to bring her back to America—Lizzie locates her 19-year-old brother, Jakob, a Cambridge mathematician who’s stationed at the clandestine British intelligence site called Bletchley Park. Hiding from her grandmother’s estate steward, Lizzie becomes a messenger at Bletchley Park, ferrying letters across the grounds while Jakob attempts to both break the ciphers generated by the German Enigma machines and help his sister face the reality of their mother’s likely fate. With a suspicious MI5 agent inquiring about Mum and clues and codes piling up, the siblings, whose late father was “Polish Jewish British,” eventually decipher the truth. Shared narrative duties between the siblings effectively juxtapose the measured Jakob with the spirited Lizzie. Lizzie’s directness is repeatedly attributed to her being “half American,” which proves tiresome, but Jakob’s development from reserved to risk-tolerant provides welcome nuance. The authors introduce and carefully explain a variety of decoding methodologies, inspiring readers to attempt their own. A thoughtful and entertaining historical note identifies the key figures who appear in the book, such as Alan Turing, as well as the real-life bases for the fictional characters. Interspersed photos and images of ephemera help situate the narrative’s time period.",

    "description": "“Call me Herman.” Such a commandment could come from only one writer, Herman Melville, who stands at the center of Fresán’s narrative. Occupying much of that space, too, albeit in sometimes spectral form, is Melville’s father, Allan Melvill (the -e a typo that his son, the victim of a bureaucrat’s pen, stuck with, even as, later in the novel, he notes ruefully that his obituary in Harper’s Monthly Magazine, where several of his stories appeared, will render his name as Henry). Allan, born to a Scottish family famed for “swords and shields and maces brandished in the name of savage monarchs whose castles were just giant stones,” is frequently revisited at a climacteric moment, when, desperately poor, he walks across an iced-over Hudson River to return to his starving family. It’s an image that haunts the grown-up Herman, who, Fresán conjectures, cast his father as a confidence man on a paddle wheeler, a lowly sailor on a whaling ship, an indifferent clerk who refuses to do his job. “It turns out to be almost as exhausting and distressing to trace his downward spiral as, I suppose, it was for my father to know himself pursued and persecuted,” Herman sighs. Fresán imagines Melville’s life as a quiet repudiation of his father’s, who was so proud that he refused to allow his wife, Herman’s mother, to borrow money from her aristocratic family. In the end, though, Allan accompanies his son’s every waking moment and haunts his dreams: “The ice is the unknown,” Herman, that great explorer of mysterious places and mores, says. Fresán’s fictional evocation of Melville’s youth is as convincingly realized as Frederick Busch’s The Night Inspector (2000), which neatly bookends it.",

    "description": "Living together in a drafty house, pale-skinned siblings Beatrice and Magnolia are opposites in many ways. Short, wide Beatrice is happy and curious, whereas lanky Magnolia is cranky and tyrannical. One day Beatrice ventures into the nearby forest and meets Bog Myrtle, a giant, gray-skinned spider woman who’s deeply committed to protecting the forest and is known for turning people into flies and eating them. She gives Beatrice some of her magic silk. With the help of the spiders that live in their home, Beatrice turns the silk into a soft, warm sweater for Magnolia. Greedy Magnolia sees an opportunity to make money by creating and selling more sweaters; she exploits Beatrice and the house spiders until her cruelty is no longer tolerated. With its short text and many simple, expressive, and attractive full-page illustrations, this book will entice young readers. Older kids, however, will likely have a better understanding of its sometimes challenging vocabulary and themes of sustainability and labor rights. These thought-provoking topics are smartly woven in as the story maintains a sharp humor and folktale feel throughout. The sisters epitomize the classic folktale binary of good and evil, and it’s wonderfully satisfying when they each get what they deserve at the end, all infused with a slightly twisted sense of humor.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ben-mezrich/the-mistress-and-the-key/",
    "description": "In Philadelphia, a construction supervisor inspects a large underground space beneath a worksite and finds a mid-18th-century laboratory filled with beakers, oil lamps, hand cranks—and his two dead co-workers sitting in chairs. Then he’s attacked and killed by a man looking for an engraving of a kite and a key. Thus begins this oddball thriller whose characters seek a philosopher’s stone that will turn lead into gold. Mezrich loads the text with historical references to the likes of Paul Revere, Ben Franklin, Mozart, and Catharine Ray, one of Ben’s actual lady friends. He also offers new twists on the stories of the Liberty Bell and Franklin's famous experiment with a kite and a key. Present-day protagonists Nick Patterson and Hailey Gordon are in Boston on the run from the law, suspects in a string of art thefts including the big 1990 heist at the Gardner Museum. Nick is a nonviolent ex-con who gets his gunshot wound stitched up in the basement of a seedy dentist and later survives an encounter with the humongous Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Boston Museum of Science. Hailey faked her high-school records to gain admission to MIT and excelled there as a grad student in applied math while she paid her bills by counting cards. In the opposite corner is the evil La Nadie—Spanish for The Nobody—who looks so ordinary that no one notices her until it’s too late. She works for the Family, which has ambitions both dastardly and grandiose. The frequent twists in this zany and well-researched story will keep the reader entertained and informed. If you’ve ever lain awake wondering about the Statue of Liberty’s innards, or how many rivets Gustave Eiffel used in the construction of his eponymous iron tower in Paris, or how a particular Mozart composition looks on an oscilloscope, Mezrich puts those and many more questions to rest. The ending hints at a sequel, which would be most welcome.",

    "description": "Hollinghurst's seventh novel features a narrator who, like his creator, is about 70: David Win—the dark-skinned son of a British woman and a man she met while working as a typist in Burma after World War II—was raised by his mother on her own in provincial England. The story opens with a fairly recent event: the death of Mark Hadlow, a mentor whose family offered a scholarship that allowed David to attend an elite prep school from the age of 13 in the early 1960s. Along with the challenges he faced there due to his race and class, he was often targeted by Hadlow's son Giles, a bully who we know has grown up to be a right-wing member of parliament in the era of Brexit, even now \"tearing up our future and our hopes.\" The first half of the book relies on what Win calls his \"famous memory\" to unfold the story of his adolescence—one brilliant section is set during a seaside holiday when his head whips back and forth between a good-looking Italian waiter, the men on the beach in their bathing suits, and his dressmaker mother and her customer Mrs. Croft, funder of this vacation, now revealed to be much more than a friend. The expansive architecture of this book fluidly slips you from one phase of David's life to the next, examining the ups and downs of his acting career and his love affairs—and then suddenly there's an ending you will likely find yourself reading several times so you can fully take in its subtlety, power, and emotion.",

    "description": "Yellowstone, writes Gettysburg College environmental studies professor Wilson, “is remarkably distant from just about everywhere and everyone else in the continental United States.” For all that, it draws 4 million visitors a year. It was always remote, little settled by Indigenous people until relatively recently. Early on, an American explorer with a background in geology, a junior Army officer named Gustavus Cheyney Doane, recognized that Yellowstone was a vast caldera formed by ancient volcanic action; by Wilson’s reckoning, the “largest recorded eruption in human history,” that of Indonesia’s Mount Tambora, blasted out just 6% of the volcanic debris that Yellowstone’s last eruption did—and, as catastrophists are fond of pointing out, Yellowstone is long overdue for another. Wilson’s early explorers made for a hardy breed, though strange: The Sioux who encountered one geologist at work must have thought he was crazy for carrying a backpack full of stones, and they left him alone for it—adds Wilson, “In human cultures across the world, mental illness (real or imagined) is often cause for compassion rather than hostility.” Although cattle ranchers and miners resisted the effort, Yellowstone finally became a national park, helped along in the end, Wilson reckons, by a strain of 19th-century Romanticism that held that nature “offered humans a path to moral and spiritual well-being and deserved respect for its own sake.” Surprisingly, magnate John D. Rockefeller, as Wilson shows, was highly instrumental in protecting the park. Bedeviling park naturalists then and now was how to balance human visitation with protection for wild animals, who today include restored populations of wolves, grizzly bears, bison, and other creatures.",

    "description": "Rather than construct narratives for their 20 randomly ordered selections, Pintos and Iannuzzi toss pithy fact bits and spot images across each spread around a full body portrait, with inconspicuous arrows here and there to link related items. Though at least systematic when it comes to providing range maps, typical sizes and weights, conservation status, and like basics, several entries may leave readers struggling to decode statements—for instance, the rat’s “predatory instinct is activated only when hungry.” Readers may also be left wondering why only about 3,000 electric eel young are born when the female lays roughly 17,000 eggs. The stylistic art is arresting, making vibrant use of texture to depict patterns on the Indian cobra, the Tasmanian devil, and the panther. Brief descriptions of the various animals ramp up the drama: The eagle is “silent and powerful,” while the heron’s “beak never misses.” A final note on food chains headed “Everybody Hunts” (herbivores may take rightful umbrage) closes out an informative if somewhat disorganized survey of the “red in tooth and claw” set. The only human figures are small silhouetted bodies or body parts included to show scale.",

    "description": "As the Baxter Police Department’s chief of detectives, Delia Mariola has seen many victims of violence. But few of them rival Case Dixon, a high school kid who wandered away from a local hangout utterly incapable of fending for himself and wasn’t seen till three days later, when he was found strangled to death after prolonged torture. Everybody in town—from Case’s father, a lumberyard owner on the board of Baxter’s Chamber of Commerce, to police commissioner Vern Taney—thinks it would be just great if Case’s nasty schoolmate Bard Henry, who’s threatened him repeatedly and was seen just outside the spot he disappeared from, did time for his murder. But even after they arrest the youth, neither Delia nor Blanche Weber, the detective in charge of the case, thinks Bard could have planned or executed a crime that required this much foresight. And they’re right. The real murderer was Johnny-Boy Witten, an assassin currently calling himself Paul Ochoa, who loves his work so much that he passes the time in torture killings while he’s waiting for a chance to tag Theo Diopolis, the autoworker he’s been hired to kill. Professional as he is, Johnny-Boy narrowly misses his chance to put down Diopolis. Now the pressure is on him to make good on his contract even as Delia and Blanche dig up evidence of a much wider ring of civil servants and cops in their own department. The results are as suspenseful as they are ultimately predictable.",

    "description": "After Ophelia’s father dies unexpectedly, she leaves Austin and moves back to New River, North Dakota, to live with her aunt Cherice and uncle Janus; her mother’s identity has always been a mystery. Still grieving, high school senior Ophelia, who’s Black, meets new people and tries to settle in, though she starts to realize that her family may be harboring some secrets. When a series of unusual dreams plagues Ophelia and her racially diverse group of friends, they soon discover that they’ve each been given the power of a different Greek god. As they’re learning what this means, they learn from a mysterious messenger that not only are they in danger, but the future of humankind is as well—and they’re the only ones who can help. Armed with this information, they set off on a series of quests to stop a total apocalypse. Janae’s writing style is compelling but occasionally moves too rapidly, not allowing readers to fully digest the new information she’s introduced. Additionally, while fans of similar contemporary fantasies based on Greek mythology might enjoy this story and its many nods to classic tales, the lore, which contains many moving pieces, is difficult to follow at times.",

    "description": "A bespectacled, pigtailed waffle has trouble making decisions. Even if the choices at hand aren’t that important, she, well, waffles. For Waffle, “most decisions feel big and forever.” Her indecisiveness has consequences. Taking too long to pick out a pair of socks results in Waffle being late for school. When she dawdles at the ice cream counter, nearly all of the flavors eventually run out. So Waffle devises a plan: She selects a school outfit from her closet with her eyes closed. Oops: She’s picked out beachwear. She tries copying what everyone else is doing and asking all her friends for guidance (“I’ll mix all their ideas together…so I don’t have to decide”); neither approach works. Eventually, looking through her telescope gives Waffle her best idea: She learns to narrow down choices to make them manageable. Along the way, Waffle picks up a few tips. Getting more information can be helpful in the process, as is the knowledge that sometimes “either choice is fine” and “many decisions aren’t forever.” This sympathetic, bibliotherapeutic story, written by a clinical pediatric neuropsychologist, will resonate with children who have problems making decisions. Parents will appreciate both the narrative and the closing note, the latter providing clear, useful guidance and tips for caregivers. The images of anthropomorphic foodstuffs—with cartoonishly large bodies perched atop skinny legs—leaven a serious topic.",

When Mom starts dating Seth, her behavior grows even more erratic, culminating in her abruptly taking a vacation with him—and leaving Reed and Beatrice alone. As weeks pass, and their food and money dwindle, Reed fears Mom won’t return. How will he pay the rent—or the $5,000 deposit for the scoliosis surgery that could improve Beatrice’s life? His solutions are lucrative but illegal—if he’s caught, Beatrice could be taken away. To pull off his schemes, he’ll have to enlist the help of Helena Shaw…the childhood friend he feels betrayed him terribly. Though some plot elements may require suspending disbelief, Hayden, who has SMA himself, effectively explores grief, neglect, and complex family dynamics. While Beatrice’s care drives much of the plot, and her precocious hacking skills prove convenient, the tender, frank bond she has with Reed prevents her from being merely a plot device. Reed and Helena’s recovering relationship offers thought-provoking insights into privilege and what makes a family. Though Reed’s mom’s depression and neglect are addressed rather late in the novel, leaving little room for readers to process the topics, the author realistically acknowledges that healing and forgiveness are neither instant nor easy. Most characters read white.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/thom-hartmann/the-hidden-history-of-the-american-dream/",
    "description": "Progressive radio host and self-identified “Boomer” Hartmann takes aim at the “Reagan Revolution,” arguing that since the 1980s, gains in the stability and social infrastructure around a growing middle class were intentionally reversed. He notes sharp distinctions between his own working-class upbringing and the paucity of opportunities facing young people today, directly due to Republican gaming of the system. He argues, “They’ve been trying to undo or reverse FDR’s New Deal ever since it was put into place in the 1930s,” while tartly predicting that younger generations are finally “waking up from the fog of BS Republicans have been crop-dusting over us since 1981.” Such occasional venting comes linked to facts: “When Reagan came into office, for example, a bit over 60 percent of all income in the United States went to middle class families; by 2020 that number had collapsed to 42 percent. Meanwhile, the income of the top 10 percent of Americans went from 29 percent in 1981 to over 50 percent today.” Punchy chapters move through subtopics including the rise of student debt, the affordable housing crisis, Americans’ medical debt burden, and more—establishing for each a narrative of fundamental protections being rolled away following the 1980s. Current activism leads to a guardedly optimistic conclusion: “The zoomers may be able to lead a rebirth of the American Dream—if enough of us from all generations get involved.” Hartmann marshals evidence well to support his sometimes heated assertions and concludes each chapter with progressive proposals to address the damage he charts, always emphasizing, “It’s going to take major and radical action to stop and then reverse the Reagan Revolution.”",

    "description": "After bullets shatter her living room windows, killing her police officer father, high school junior Kate’s life changes forever. As he lies dying, Dad gives her a piece of paper, issuing a cryptic warning: “Don’t read it…Don’t show anyone. Burn it.” Kate does get rid of the paper—but only after reading it. When she and her mom are allowed back in the house to collect some possessions, she stumbles upon $250,000, stashed in her guitar case. Fearing that her father was a thief, she hides the cash in a safe place. When Kate’s mom is offered a spring semester teaching position at a private school for competitive athletes in Vermont, the change feels like a respite from the trauma. Kate quickly settles into her new environment and even falls for a handsome skier named Ryan. But when people involved in her dad’s murder investigation wind up dead, Kate realizes that she’s in grave danger and must act. The novel’s pacing is a bit bumpy, ranging from slow to frenetic, but the payoff at the end is worth it. The characters are sympathetic and likable, and the development of the protagonists, who are coded white, is solid. Kate and Ryan’s whirlwind relationship is a testament to the power of first love.",
