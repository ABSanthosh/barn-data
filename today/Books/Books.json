    "description": "The Ollivaros family, late for a flight, sprints through an Atlanta airport. As teenager Nachton, younger sisters Amélie and Cécilie, and baby brother Ewan run through Gate 3, they enter the mysterious interdimensional portal right next to it. The kids land in Overtwixt, a group of nilands (floating islands) connected by bridges—an entire realm that sits between parallel worlds. “The Guide,” a centaur-like “centman,” greets the kids and insists that, as humans, they have the ability to oppose this world’s only other human, the Vizier, who’s seized power in Overtwixt. The siblings choose their “paths” from options that the Guide gives them, each with a corresponding role to play and quest to complete. Amélie, for example, as the Empress, “must build trust and loyalty” among the various races in Overtwixt, from the gnomen to the merpeople. The Vizier, meanwhile, is destroying bridges to trap people in this world, including the bridge to the Ollivaros children’s home. This opening series installment teems with impressive worldbuilding: Akers introduces the nilands and supporting characters without saturating the narrative in details. It helps that nearly all of the Overtwixt beings are recognizable fantasy types, including the horselike eqmen, female unicorns, and dragonlike drachmen. The kids have striking personalities; energetic 5-year-old Ewan has a distinctive speech impediment (calling someone named Berserker “Bazooka”), and foolhardy Nachton incessantly complains about being a not-so-active “Loremaster.” While action scenes occasionally crop up, this story primarily consists of Nachton and the others plotting to confront the cloaked-in-black Vizier, who makes relatively few appearances. Still, the exciting final act concludes with a worthy cliffhanger. Lewis’ sketchy illustrations boldly define myriad individuals; most of the images are akin to profile pics.",

    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/terri-parlato/watch-your-back-2/",
    "description": "After a short prologue that finds Nathan Liddle helpless “as a bug on its back” and expecting to be killed at any moment by his beautiful wife, Eve Thayer, a psychiatrist, the story flashes back three weeks to the couple’s strained marriage. While their new baby, Rosewyn, is the proverbial bundle of joy, her needs and bouts of ill health add strain to their relationship. So does Nathan’s careless extramarital affair with a free-spirited woman named Nicole. A parallel plot thread follows Det. Rita Myers and her handling of multiple local crimes. The two threads converge when Rosewyn is kidnapped from the home of babysitter Barbara Singleton. For a while, suspicion falls on Donald Barry—a disgruntled patient of Eve’s—and his wife, Gail, but some strange additional twists widen the circle of suspects. The surprise return of the baby doesn’t solve the original crime; it just deepens the mystery. Parlato’s thriller is breezy but a bit muddled, full of feints, shadowy suspicion, and an 11th-hour murder. Short chapters ricochet among the first-person perspectives of Eve, Nathan, and Rita, making for a quick read and giving the illusion of pace. Both Eve and Rita commiserate about their jobs and their struggles to achieve the elusive work-life balance, Eve with her old friend Rachel and Rita with her brother Danny. The overall effect resembles a Lifetime thriller: half skillfully executed soap opera, half diffuse whodunit.",
