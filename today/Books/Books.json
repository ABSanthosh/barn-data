    "description": "The Wizard of Oz and its adaptation, The Wiz, are employed as metaphors for the caregiving experience in this self-help book. The author is a registered nurse and tells us that much like landing in Oz, assuming a caregiving role involves “all sorts of new customs, expectations, relationship dynamics, challenges, and personal insecurities to navigate. And it can feel like everyone knows the landscape but you.” The book is meant to evoke the proverbial yellow brick road, leading readers “home” in a sense. Divided into six sections, the book covers how to map a path forward, cultivate self-love and compassion, embrace acceptance, harness the power of intuition, adapt in the face of change, and find joy amid challenges. Green recommends delegating tasks based on one’s strengths and drafting a personal mission statement to create achievable goals. To foster a positive mindset, the author advises treating yourself like a friend and emphasizes the importance of working through grief, anger, trauma, and anxiety. Green offers strategies for overcoming human and circumstantial roadblocks, such as pausing for reflection or connecting with those facing similar challenges. Asking for what you want, like Dorothy did with the wizard, is among Green’s pithy Oz-referencing communication tips. Green also explores the symptoms of resilience fatigue and strategies to overcome it and concludes with encouragement for finding inner joy. This comprehensive book combines anecdotes, reflection exercises, goal-setting prompts, and practical strategies to help readers create a personalized roadmap toward authentic and healthy caregiving. Readers seeking increased self-awareness will appreciate the ample opportunities for written reflection. The book’s design, including charts, section dividers, and shaded text boxes, makes for an engaging reading experience. The Wizard of Oz metaphor is appropriate for the most part but doesn’t strengthen the author’s often generic advice, like taking up shopworn self-help activities like journaling and mindfulness. High-gloss AI-generated images of glamorous people feel jarringly out of sync with the vintage Hollywood aesthetic and a caregiving audience.",

    "description": "In the time she’s not spending wrangling her 6-year-old twins, Taylorsford Library director Amy Muir is busy with an arts festival and the premiere performance of her husband Richard’s new dance company. The Friends of the Library association has invited true-crime author Maureen Dryden to speak at their book sale; her best-known book claims to have solved the still officially unsolved murder of a woman named Beverly Baron. Maureen is accompanied to town by her assistant, Sean Gordon, along with Terrell Temkin and Mindy LaSalle, podcasters collaborating on her new book, an anthology of cold cases including the disappearance of low-level drug dealer Edward Jaffe from the Taylorsford area. She tells her audience that her research has turned up a couple of names—Delbert Frye and Karl Klass—and asks whether anyone knows them. That request will have fatal consequences. Frye is a recluse who still lives in the area, and Klass, a former drug dealer, has transformed himself into wealthy art dealer Kurt Kendrick. Kurt is a friend of the Muirs and Amy’s Aunt Lydia, whose first husband, a famous artist, was Kurt’s close friend in their youth. When Maureen is found dead in her hotel room, the sheriff, suspecting that her death may be connected to the cold case, asks Amy to research Jaffe. Maureen’s book on the Baron murder accused a man named Allen Cardullo, who then died by suicide, opening the possibility of a revenge killing. Amy’s investigation leads to threatening notes and reveals unwelcome connections to her own family.",
