    "title": "WAR ON GAZA",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/joe-sacco/war-on-gaza/",
    "description": "Sacco uses words and illustrations to document stories: He’s a self-described comics journalist. He has combined both forms to great effect in numerous works of graphic nonfiction, including Palestine and Safe Area Goražde, that tell of overseas conflicts. One monumental wordless work, The Great War, depicts the first day of the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Sacco returns to the subject of the Mideast in his latest book, a slim overview of Israel’s recent invasion of Gaza. The urgency of the project is evident in a short introduction in which he writes of beginning it after a friend in Gaza pleaded with him to “plz raise the voice up against these crimes.” Sacco’s answer: “So here, my friend, for whatever it’s worth, I ‘raise the voice up.’” That he does. The book is an impassioned polemic against Israel’s devastating response to the raid of Oct. 7, 2023, in which more than 1,200 Israelis were slaughtered by Hamas fighters. “The scale of the deaths of Israeli civilians left me horrified,” Sacco writes. So, too, did Israel’s retaliation, which has killed tens of thousands of people. “I was only theoretically prepared for the worst,” he continues. “The reality of the assault on Gaza…was almost beyond my comprehension.” Unlike Sacco’s earlier works that feature on-the-ground reporting—the testimony of ordinary citizens imbuing the pages with power—this book is more of a visual op-ed, his scathing critique of the U.S. and Israel accompanied by caricatures of President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and biblical-style language: “The way was greased for the Righteous Rampage that smote the People of Darkness.” Elsewhere, he writes, “America had just invented Kinder, Gentler Genocide. The patent is pending.”",

    "title": "DICK TRACY",
    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alex-segura/dick-tracy-vol-1-1/",
    "description": "Set in 1947, Tracy is a recent war veteran and the youngest cop ever to make detective in “The City.” He’s still struggling to come to grips with the horrors he experienced while in battle. After a crime reporter and an alderman are among those gunned down during an apparent robbery at a diner, Tracy investigates and discovers that the killings are tied to a complex conspiracy. The detective vows to identify the people behind the horrific crime, which included more than a dozen murders, and he eventually joins forces with the late alderman’s daughter, Tess Trueheart, and old war buddy Pat Patton, who’s looking for answers regarding his brother’s mysterious death. Patton’s also looking into the disappearance of numerous war veterans who worked as laborers on an ambitious waterfront development project. Ignoring directives from his chief, Tracy and company continue to dig, and soon find themselves the targets of numerous underworld thugs; Tommy gun–powered violence ensues. Borges’ masterful ability to convey a gritty, hardboiled atmosphere in action-packed, blood-splattered, and visually stunning illustrations is an obvious strength, as is Segura and Moreci’s talent for intricate, deeply developed, and emotionally intense storytelling, largely through dialogue. Tracy and Patton’s war flashbacks, and their current inability to seamlessly reassimilate into society, are particularly powerful: “One day they give you a gun, they tell you to go kill people. Then they take the gun away. They tell you the war’s over. But for some men, it’s not that easy.”",
