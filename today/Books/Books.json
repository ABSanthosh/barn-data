    "link": "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/melissa-simonye/surviving-southwood-avenue-a-story-of-family-secrets-and-resilience/",
    "description": "Columbus, Ohio, 1920: Stella Miller’s mother Clara is prone to unpredictable behavior, on one occasion pulling a pistol on the local druggist when he refuses to offer his products to her “on loan.” Clara abandons the family without explanation when Stella is only 4 years old, though Stella has a faint memory of her mother being forcibly driven off by her father and one of his friends. Stella’s father then sells the family home and moves the children into a dreary boarding house on Southwood Avenue. “The pillars were dirty,” notes Stella. “The house was a dingy gray color with peeling white trim. It looked unwelcoming. When we walked up the steps for the first time, I felt like we were trespassing on someone else’s property.” While their father works, the children are placed in the care of their landlady, Mrs. Spangler, whose cruelty and negligence leads to Stella’s sexual abuse at the hands of the woman’s teenage son. To survive, Stella clings to her siblings—who are sometimes helpful, sometimes not—and tries to grow into a woman more equipped to deal with the world than the tortured Clara was. At its best, the author’s observant prose contains brilliant, psychologically revealing details, as here when Stella’s father stops by to visit them at the boarding house: “I studied his melancholy face while Mrs. Spangler prepared supper. He suddenly looked different to me. He looked smaller. He looked weak for the first time. I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed the back of it. He smelled like fresh soap.” The author reveals in the preface that the novel is based on the experiences of her grandmother, and the book sits uncomfortably between biography and fiction, with much of the meandering story related in summary form rather than as dramatized scenes. Simonye includes a section that delves into Clara’s backstory, highlighting some parallels between mother and daughter, but the intense focus on the tragedies in Stella’s life makes for a somewhat grueling reading experience.",

    "description": "“Raised as a white person” in southern Brazil, Howard University professor Araujo is determined to include in her account both Latin America and those regions from which enslaved Africans were kidnapped. Synthesizing primary sources and other historians’ findings, she works her way from West Africa and West Central Africa, through the Middle Passage, to the Americas, then back again. As she contrasts the experiences of bondspeople across time and space, she takes care to explore the lives of enslaved women and to highlight enslaved people’s persistent efforts at resistance. Encouraging readers to understand suicide, infanticide, and celebration as expressions of resistance, Araujo argues that “bondspeople were protagonists of their own emancipation.” Araujo’s  writing can sometimes be dry, but this does not diminish the importance of her work. The facts alone are staggering; among them: “More than 4.8 million enslaved [people] landed on Brazilian shores…nearly ten times more than [in] the United States.” Seeing Nat Turner’s Rebellion of 1831 alongside Tacky’s Revolt in Jamaica in 1760 and the Malê Revolt in Brazil in 1835 helps readers understand the scope of enslaved people’s armed resistance. Also astonishing is the range of sources from which Araujo and her colleagues glean information: In addition to slave narratives and oral tradition, she cites Inquisition records, enslaved people’s wills, and a particularly revealing 1684 Portuguese law regulating conditions on slave ships, among a wealth of other documents.",
