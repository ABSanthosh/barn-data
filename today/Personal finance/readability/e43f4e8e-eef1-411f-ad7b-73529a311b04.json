These platforms allow you to complete small, simple tasks like taking surveys, testing apps, watching videos, or performing data entry, all from the comfort of your home. Whether you’re… Looking for the best microtask websites to make extra money? Microtask websites are a great way to make some quick, extra money without any long-term commitment. These platforms allow you to complete small, simple tasks like taking surveys, testing apps, watching videos, or performing data entry, all from the comfort of your home. Whether you’re looking for a flexible way to make money during your downtime or just want to earn a little extra cash on the side, micro tasks can be a good fit. Microtask websites have been one of my favorite ways to make extra money because they’re easy to fit into my day, whether I have just a few minutes or a whole afternoon to spare. Best Micro Task Websites Below are the best microtask websites to make extra money. 1. Swagbucks  Swagbucks is a popular rewards site that lets users earn extra money by performing different tasks. Once you’re finished completing tasks, you can redeem your points for gift cards or cash via PayPal. There are different ways to make money with Swagbucks including: Surveys Watching videos Searching the web using their search engine Shopping online Referring friends My sister has earned over 100 free Amazon gift cards from being active on Swagbucks over the years, so I know it’s real! If you join Swagbucks through my referral link, you will receive a $10 bonus. 2. Freecash Freecash is an online platform where you can earn money by completing a wide variety of tasks such as online surveys, signing up for services, downloading apps, watching videos, playing games, and more. Once you’ve earned enough points, you can redeem rewards for gift cards, PayPal cash, cryptocurrency, and more. To maximize earnings, check the site daily for new surveys and other earning opportunities. You can also invite friends and family to Freecash to earn even more points. My sister (the owner of the site you are reading right now), actually just made $302 playing a game on her phone in just one week through Freecash recently. She did it all on her own schedule and it was super easy! Click here to sign up for Freecash. Recommended reading: 23 Best Game Apps To Win Real Money 3. Amazon Mechanical Turk  Amazon Mechanical Turk (also known as MTurk) is a platform where people can complete small tasks such as data entry, transcription, image tagging, surveys, audio transcription, and more. They call these tasks human intelligence tasks (HITs). You can choose tasks that match your skills and interests so you can complete jobs faster. Each of the small jobs will show the reward amount, the estimated completion time, and the requestor’s approval rating. These details will help you decide if the job is worth the time. MTurk is a unique platform because you can filter out jobs by reward amount, time allotted, and other criteria to find the best job for you. To make the most money with Amazon Mechanical Turk, choose jobs with higher rewards and also think about the time to complete them. This platform is not known for paying the highest, but the jobs are flexible, which is nice. 4. Clickworker Clickworker is one of the best micro job websites and they list micro jobs with tasks including writing, translating, researching, data entry, data collection, mystery shopping, and more. To get started, create an account on the Clickworker website. Clickworker requires users to complete assessments to gather data on the skills users have to match them with appropriate tasks. You can also look for different micro task jobs on Clickworker. Jobs include text creation, categorization, copy editing, proofreading, surveys, web research, and app testing. Focus on accuracy so you can get the highest rating possible so you can get more task opportunities. 5. Fiverr  Fiverr is an online job freelance marketplace where you can find gigs in categories like writing, graphic design, designing websites, video editing, search engine evaluation, annotation, research studies, help with social media platforms, and programming. Fiverr lets you set up gigs for services you sell so people can reach out to you for hire. In each gig posting, you should include details like: Description of your services and skills Pricing structure Any pictures that you may have of your previous work When starting on Fiverr, it may help to have competitive pricing so you land more jobs and get reviews. This will help you get more jobs in the future. You can withdraw Fiverr earnings to your bank and PayPal once you’ve reached the minimum withdrawal amount. 6. Kashkick Kashkick is a platform where people can earn extra money by completing different tasks like taking surveys, watching videos, browsing the web, and more. It is one of the best microtask websites for beginners because you don’t need any experience. When completing surveys, it’s important to provide honest answers and accurate information. If you have inconsistent answers across surveys, this can lead to disqualification from future surveys and reduce your chances of landing micro tasks on Kashkick. You can sign up for Kashkick here. 7. Microworkers  Microworkers is a crowdsourcing platform where people can make money completing small tasks. Tasks on the Microworkers platform include: Data mining Image transcription Content moderation Testing Surveys Transcription Translation Once your account is set up, you can browse different jobs on the platform that match your skills and interests. Each task will include details such as pay, time required, and task instructions. Each task comes with instructions and it’s important to read these carefully to ensure you complete the job correctly. New tasks are added regularly so it’s a good idea to regularly check the platform to look for new micro jobs. 8. Appen  Appen is a global platform that has part-time, freelance, and short-term projects that can be done remotely. Once you create an account, you can browse through project listings and apply for jobs that match your skills and interests. Certain jobs may require you to pass a qualification test before you can start a job. Micro tasks on Appen include image labeling, transcription, data categorization, and more. You can also complete surveys to make extra money. 9. TaskRabbit  TaskRabbit is a gig platform that connects workers with tasks individuals need help with. These tasks can include: Moving Cleaning Painting Home repairs Mounting Outdoor help For example, I have a friend who recently needed help putting together a piece of furniture. They found someone on TaskRabbit who came to their house and put together the furniture for them. The person got paid, and then left – that was the whole task. To get started, create an account with TaskRabbit and fill out your profile with details such as your skills, experience, and the type of tasks you can do. You can also set up certain services you’re skilled in such as home repair, painting, outdoor work, etc. Your next step will be determining your rate. Check out other profiles in your area doing similar work as you and see what they are charging. This will give you an idea of how to be competitive and stand out from others. Set up notifications in your area to get alerts of new jobs in your town. 10. PeoplePerHour  PeoplePerHour is a platform for freelancers to find jobs. Jobs and micro tasks include: Digital marketing Web design Writing Social media Branding SEO Illustration To get started finding jobs on PeoplePerHour, create an account and include a professional photo of yourself, a catchy headline, your hourly rate or project pricing, and a detailed description of your work experience. Once your profile is set up, you can apply for projects and submit proposals to jobs. In your proposal, you’ll share details like a brief intro about yourself, why the client should choose you for the job, relevant experience, and your rate and timeline for the project. 11. Gigbucks  Gigbucks is a gig marketplace where people can hire out and list services. As a gig worker, you can create a listing and share detailed information about yourself and your work. In this listing, you’ll share information like your skills, experience, rates, and examples of your work history. Here are some tips to be successful on Gigbucks: Set competitive prices on projects Maintain good communication with clients (make sure to respond to any messages you get!) Complete high-quality work and meet deadlines Request reviews from clients 12. Freelancer  Freelancer is a site that connects freelancers with clients who need help in areas like graphic design, writing, programming, and marketing. As a freelancer, you create your own listing on Freelancer which will show your experience, skills, and work history. You can also use the Freelancer platform to look for new job listings. If you find a job you like, you can submit a proposal. In the proposal, you’ll share important information like an introduction to yourself, relevant work history, as well as budget and timeline. Your proposal should stand out and make the client want to pick you over anyone else. 13. UserTesting  UserTesting is a site that pays people to test out different things for companies. As a tester, you’ll provide feedback on websites, apps, and other digital products. Once you sign up, you’ll be asked to complete a qualification test to make sure you meet the requirements for certain tasks. Once your profile is set up, you can browse available tests. Some tasks may include navigating a website to provide feedback on usability and functionality. Other jobs include testing apps and providing feedback on user experience and features. To complete tasks on this site, you’ll need a computer, and some tasks require a webcam and microphone. I have used UserTesting in the past to have my website evaluated. The person just spends minutes looking through a site, gives their honest feedback, and then moves on to the next task to get paid for. 14. Zeerk Zeerk is a website where people can sign up for small tasks like surveys or assisting with graphic design, marketing, Pinterest, SEO, and other online tasks. Jobs on Zeerk typically pay between $4 and $200. You can also get paid on Zeerk for watching advertisements and videos. Zeerk pays out via PayPal, direct bank transfer, and gift cards. 15. Respondent  Respondent is a user-testing website that pays people to do exactly that – test things. This platform connects people with companies for market research and user testing. You can also earn money by sharing your opinions in surveys and experiences on various topics. Once your account is set up, you can look for different studies or surveys and even filter these jobs out based on your location, interests, and other criteria. If you find a study you like, apply for it. If you qualify for the study, you’ll be invited to participate and have all the details and instructions sent to you. 16. Scribie  Scribie is a website that pays people to transcribe all kinds of things like lectures, conference calls, YouTube videos, and documentaries. To make money with Scribie, you first need to pass a transcription test on their website. This test involves transcribing an audio clip. Accuracy and formatting are very important here, so be aware of that. If you pass the transcription test, you’ll then be able to look for job opportunities on the platform. Scribie typically pays between $5 to $25 per audio hour, and the pay depends on how hard the task is that you are doing. For example, easy-to-understand audio files with high-quality audio will pay less than audio that is hard to understand or has poor sound quality.

I’ve personally found work through Upwork and have found it to be high-paying as well (as long as you find the right jobs). You can find jobs in topics like graphic design, making websites, digital marketing, virtual assisting, and more. Jobs are posted all the time and share important information like pay, time needed, etc. With Upwork, it’s important to build a strong profile to make you stand out from other people. Your profile should include relevant work history and even examples of your past work. For example, if you’re a website designer, you may want to show images of websites you’ve designed. You can even get people to review you on your Upwork profile, even if they don’t actively use Upwork themselves. These reviews will really make you stand out from the crowd. 18. ySense ySense is similar to sites like Swagbucks in that you can make money by filling out surveys, trying out new products or services, signing up for websites, and watching videos. Ysense also has a daily checklist of different tasks you can do to make extra money. You can get paid via PayPal, gift cards, and direct bank transfers, so there are many options for payment. 19. Slice the Pie Slice the Pie pays you for answering questions with your honest opinion. You’ll review things like music, clothing, and other creative content. To get started, you’ll need to create a profile on Slice the Pie and share basic information about yourself as this will help Slice the Pie determine what kind of tasks to assign you. This platform primarily focuses on reviewing music, so you may get assigned jobs where you listen to music and review it. The more thoughtful and specific your answer is, the higher the rating you’ll get, which can help you land more jobs. Recommended reading: 11 Best Ways To Get Paid To Listen To Music 20. InboxDollars InboxDollars pays you for completing micro tasks like filling out surveys, shopping, and playing games. InboxDollars works by companies paying InboxDollars for consumer input. So the company will have a survey that they want people to fill out, InboxDollars will list this survey on their site, and users will fill it out with their honest opinions. Most surveys pay between $.50 and $5 and take anywhere from 3-25 minutes to complete. Some surveys pay $10 and $25 if you match the demographic they are looking for. InboxDollars has paid out over $80 million to users for doing different tasks, and they are well known in the industry. You can sign up for InboxDollars here. Frequently Asked Questions Below are common questions asked about using micro job websites to make extra money. What is a micro task website?  A microtask website is a platform where you can complete small tasks and get paid. Tasks may include data entry, surveys, transcription, image tagging, testing apps, playing games, and answering surveys. Microtask websites are used by both small and large companies to outsource work. What is the best micro job site? There are many microtask sites out there. The best microtask website will depend on the skills you have and the type of tasks you enjoy doing, along with the payment methods you prefer, and the availability of work in your region. The most popular micro job sites include Amazon Mechanical Turk, Swagbucks, Freecash, Fiverr, and Clickworker. Is microtasking legit? Is microtasking worth the time? Microtasking is generally legitimate and many reputable platforms are looking to fill real micro jobs. However, there are some important things to know and realize. For example, there are more well-known and reputable microtask websites to choose from such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Freecash, Swagbucks, and Clickworker. For others, I recommend that you read reviews of whichever microtask website you’re choosing to see what others have to say about the platform, such as looking at reviews on Trustpilot.  It’s also important to know that the pay for micro tasks is usually low and earning a steady income from this tends to require a lot of effort and time. Overall, microtask sites can be worth it if you’re looking for flexible, low-commitment work, but it might not be suitable for your primary method of income or if you are looking to make a lot of money. How much money can you make with microtask websites? While you most likely can’t get rich with microtask websites, you can earn a few dollars to around $20 an hour with microtask websites (sometimes more!). How much you earn depends on which microtask website you choose, your skills, the time you dedicate to the task, and your efficiency. I do think it’s important to focus on higher-paying tasks to make the job worth your while.

The best microtask website will depend on the skills you have and the type of tasks you enjoy doing, along with the payment methods you prefer, and the availability of work in your region.

For others, I recommend that you read reviews of whichever microtask website you’re choosing to see what others have to say about the platform, such as looking at reviews on Trustpilot. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also important to know that the pay for micro tasks is usually low and earning a steady income from this tends to require a lot of effort and time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, microtask sites can be worth it if you’re looking for flexible, low-commitment work, but it might not be suitable for your primary method of income or if you are looking to make a lot of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much money can you make with microtask websites?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you most likely can’t get rich with microtask websites, you can earn a few dollars to around $20 an hour with microtask websites (sometimes more!).
