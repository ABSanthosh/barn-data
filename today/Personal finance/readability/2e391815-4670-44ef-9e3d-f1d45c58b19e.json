  "text": "Hyatt just released its annual update to the World of Hyatt award program. Effective March 25, 2025, a total of 151 properties are changing categories, with 118 properties moving up a category and 33 properties moving down. The higher the category, the more points an award night costs. These category changes may also impact the ability to use a World of Hyatt free night certificate earned from milestone rewards or the World of Hyatt Credit Card.While the changes aren’t as bad as we’ve seen in years past, some popular redemption options are now becoming more expensive. Here’s what to know about the 2025 World of Hyatt update.You have time to book and saveThe new pricing will apply to award reservations made on or after March 25, 2025. Bookings made before that date will lock in today’s price if the property is moving to a higher category (including combined points and cash redemptions). If a property shifts to a lower category after your reservation is made, you’ll receive an automatic refund for the difference in points between the new and old price. Unlike other loyalty programs that make unannounced changes, Hyatt updates its award chart at roughly the same time each year, giving members time to react before the update takes effect. If you’re considering an award stay at one of the properties in an increasing category, it may be worth making a speculative booking and then cancel if your plans don’t work out. You’ll get your points back assuming you adhere to the cancellation policy of the property you book.Popular locations are becoming more expensive…Hotels in Japan were hit particularly hard by these changes, with nine of the country’s 24 Hyatt properties seeing a category increase. It's another indicator that Japan remains a popular destination for travelers in 2025.Additionally, 11 hotels will increase from a category 4 to a category 5, meaning you’ll no longer be able to use a category 1-4 free night certificate at these properties, including the:Hyatt Centric The Liberties Dublin.Hyatt Regency Vancouver.Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile.Hyatt Regency Hong Kong.Hyatt Regency Koh Samui.Hyatt Regency Tokyo.Hyatt House Tokyo Shibuya.The Bellevue Hotel.Hyatt Place Fort Worth Historic Stockyards.Hyatt Regency Newport Beach.Hyatt Regency Orlando International Airport.Similar to booking with points, you can make a speculative reservation with a free night certificate at one of these (current) category 4 hotels and receive your certificate back if you cancel. Just be aware of the certificate expiration date, as Hyatt won’t extend certificates.The award price will also be increasing for seven all-inclusive properties throughout the Caribbean and Latin America.See the full list of Hyatt properties changing award categories this year.… but it’s not all bad newsAward stays will now be cheaper at the 33 properties moving to a lower category. In particular, the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa is dropping from a category 7 to a category 6, which could save you 5,000 points per night during your stay in paradise. You’ll also be able to use your category 1-4 free night certificate from your World of Hyatt Credit Card or the milestone rewards program at the six hotels moving from a category 5 to a category 4.Another positive is that Hyatt is retaining an award chart in its current form and individual properties are simply shifting within the chart. Maintaining an award chart is important because it allows a consumer to know what a free night will cost during standard and peak periods. By comparison, loyalty programs like Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy shifted from an award chart to dynamic pricing, where the number of points fluctuates based on the cash price and demand for the hotel. That can make it more challenging to plan award redemptions, since it’s hard to know how many points you need to save to book a stay.Top photo courtesy of Hyatt.How to maximize your rewards",
