  "text": "Source: The College Investor Yes, you can refinance an already refinanced student loan again. There are no limits to how many times you can refinance your student loans. In fact, private student loans are typically good candidates to refinance if you can lower your interest rate because they don't charge origination fees or prepayment penalties.It's important to note that some lenders may have their own rules, but that doesn't stop you from shopping your student loans to other lenders. For example, Earnest doesn't allow you to refinance with Earnest again within 6 months or your loan origination. However, you can always check other lenders for their rates. Pros And ConsThe primary benefit of refinancing your student loan again is the potential for savings of a lower interest rate. If interest rates have dropped since your last refinancing, or your credit and/or income has improved, you might qualify for a better loan.  A lower interest rate can lower your monthly payments and the total amount you pay over the life of the loan.However, refinancing a student loan can have downsides. First, this article is specifically about refinancing an already refinanced student loan. This assumes that you already have a private loan. If you have a federal loan, refinancing typically doesn't make sense since you lose access to federal benefits (like income-driven repayment, loan forgiveness, and more). Related: Student Loan Consolidation vs. RefinancingTimingAs we mentioned earlier, timing of your student loan refinance can matter if you want to stick with the same lender. For example, Earnest only allows you to refinance with them every 6 months.However, timing also matters for the broader interest rate environment. As the Federal Reserve lowers the Fed Fund Rate, it's expected that most student loan lenders will also follow.A good rule of thumb if you have already refinanced your student loan is to continue to check interest rates every 6 months to see if it makes sense to refinance again. People Also AskCan You Refinance A Student Loan A Second Time?Yes, you can refinance a student loan a second time (or as many times as you want).Is There A Penalty For Refinancing A Student Loan?Student loans do not have a prepayment penalty or origination fees, so there is no penalty for refinancing a student loan.Is It A Good Time To Refinance My Student Loan Again?It depends. It's always a good time to refinance if you can lower your interest rate. Your interest rate will depend on your credit score, income, and the loan amount you want to refinance. If you are a highly qualified borrower, you should always be shopping loan rates to compare your options.Related Articles Robert Farrington is America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America’s Student Loan Debt Expert™, and the founder of The College Investor, a personal finance site dedicated to helping millennials escape student loan debt to start investing and building wealth for the future.
