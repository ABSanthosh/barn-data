From managing finances to settling accounts and notifying agencies, there’s no easy way through it—but there is a path forward.Knowing who to contact can ease both the emotional and financial strain. Many organizations are equipped to help you access survivor benefits, update records, and avoid costly legal issues down the road.Here are 10 essential organizations you should contact immediately after your spouse passes away—and why each one matters.Organizations For Spousal Death1. Social Security Administration (SSA)The Social Security Administration should be one of your first calls. If your spouse was receiving benefits, those payments must stop immediately to avoid overpayment, which you could be required to repay.At the same time, you may be eligible for survivor benefits based on your spouse’s earnings. These can include a one-time $255 death benefit, monthly survivor benefits if you’re 60 or older (or 50+ if disabled), and benefits for dependent children under age 18 (or up to 19 if still in high school).You’ll need to provide your spouse’s Social Security number, date of death, and marriage certificate. Call SSA directly at 1-800-772-1213 or visit your local office in person.2. Your Spouse’s Employer or Former EmployerIf your spouse was employed or retired with benefits, their employer should be contacted quickly. They can help you access a final paycheck or unused vacation payout, life insurance provided through work, retirement accounts or pension distributions, health insurance updates (such as COBRA coverage for surviving spouses), and union benefits or survivor assistance programs.HR departments may also provide death benefit forms and assist in closing out work-related matters. If your spouse was retired, the company may still manage pension or health benefit plans that affect you.3. Life Insurance CompaniesIf your spouse had one or more life insurance policies, contact each company to begin the claims process. Have the following ready:A certified copy of the death certificatePolicy number(s)Identification and proof of relationshipPayouts can help cover funeral expenses and medical bills or serve as income replacement. The sooner you file, the sooner you can ease financial burdens. If you’re not sure which company holds the policy, check old paperwork and safe deposit boxes, or consult your financial advisor or insurance agent.4. Your Spouse’s Bank(s) and Credit UnionsNotify all financial institutions your spouse had accounts with, even if they were joint accounts. Doing this prevents unauthorized transactions, allows for the transfer or closure of accounts, may help identify automatic payments that need to stop, and ensures proper titling of accounts (especially those with “Payable on Death” clauses).If you were listed as a joint account holder, you’ll likely retain access. If not, the bank may freeze the account until probate is complete. Bring the death certificate and your ID when visiting in person. Also, monitor account activity closely to protect against fraud or identity theft.5. Insurance Companies (Other Than Life)Beyond life insurance, your spouse may have held:Auto insuranceHomeowners or renters insuranceHealth insuranceLong-term care insuranceContact these providers to update policies, remove your spouse’s name, and inquire about refunds or premium changes. If your name wasn’t on the policy, you might need to show proof of shared ownership or residency. Keep in mind that failing to update these policies can result in confusion or denied claims later on.Image source: Unsplash6. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)You’ll need to contact the DMV to handle vehicle ownership and registration issues. In many states, this includes transferring titles to your name, updating insurance information, canceling your spouse’s driver’s license, and removing your spouse from shared registrations.Bring a copy of the death certificate, your marriage license, and identification. Check with your state’s DMV website for exact requirements. Though it may seem minor, failing to update car records can cause issues with future insurance claims or legal ownership disputes.7. Credit BureausTo help prevent identity theft—a surprisingly common risk after someone dies—notify the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion).  Request a credit freeze or flag your spouse’s report as “deceased.” This helps protect their identity and prevents criminals from opening new accounts in their name.You should also monitor your own credit report in the months following their death to ensure no unusual activity appears, especially if you shared joint accounts.8. Credit Card CompaniesClose or update any credit cards in your spouse’s name. If you were a co-signer, you may still be responsible for the balance. Authorized users, however, are typically not liable unless the account is jointly owned.Have a certified death certificate and account number ready. While you’re at it, cancel any recurring charges your spouse may have set up on those cards, such as streaming subscriptions or gym memberships. This is also an ideal time to reassess your credit profile and determine whether you should consolidate or close unused accounts.9. Mortgage and Loan ProvidersIf you shared a mortgage, car loan, or personal loan with your spouse, contact the lenders to inform them of the death. You’ll want to update the loan to your name if appropriate, ask about payment assistance or forbearance options, and submit documentation for life insurance that may cover the loan balance.Missing payments, even during a grieving period, can quickly damage your credit. Communicate early to explore hardship options or survivor protections. In some cases, loans may be forgiven depending on the terms and insurance coverage.10. Estate Attorney or Probate CourtIf your spouse had a will or trust, you’ll need to contact their attorney or begin the probate process. Even if your spouse had minimal assets, legal oversight helps avoid disputes and ensures correct asset distribution. An estate attorney can assist with interpreting the will or trust, handling real estate transfers, settling outstanding debts, and navigating state-specific probate laws.If your spouse died without a will, the court will decide how to distribute assets under intestate laws, which vary by state. Involving a professional can reduce confusion and delay during an already difficult time.Help Take The Stress Off YourselfNavigating the aftermath of a spouse’s death is deeply emotional and administratively overwhelming. While there’s no easy way through it, knowing which organizations to contact first can reduce unnecessary stress, prevent financial pitfalls, and help you begin the healing process.Many of these steps require official documentation, so make multiple certified copies of the death certificate early on. Consider keeping a checklist to track which calls you’ve made and which documents you’ve submitted.Remember: You don’t have to do everything at once, and you don’t have to do it alone. Reach out to trusted friends, family, or professionals when you need support.Have you or someone you know gone through this process?
