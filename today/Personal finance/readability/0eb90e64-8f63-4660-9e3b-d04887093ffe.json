  "description": "With the state of the world changing so rapidly, Lesley is struggling to accept that “this time isn’t different.” Does the past still reliably inform the present in the face of major decisions today? An anonymous caller and her husband want to achieve financial independence through real estate within 10 years. Is it better to pay off existing mortgages or prioritize buying more rentals? Melanie feels duped by the FICO credit scoring system. She’s doing all the right things, but her credit score is still moving in the wrong direction. What’s going on here? Former financial planner Joe Saul-Sehy and I tackle these three questions in today’s episode. Enjoy!",
