  "text": "New Capital One Venture X Business cardholders can now get a supercharged sign-up bonus of up to 350,000 miles.This bonus offer has two parts: The standard offer of 150,000 miles after spending $30,000 in three months. Plus, you can get an additional 200,000 miles if you spend $200,000 in six months.The Capital One Venture X Business Card was already an outstanding option for business travelers. While the $200,000 spend requirement is the highest we’ve seen on a business credit card offer — so is the 350,000 miles bonus.Benefits of the Venture X BusinessThe limited-time offer is the big selling point here. But the Capital One Venture X Business Card comes with a ton of other perks that make it one of the best business travel cards overall, including:2X miles on all purchases (up to 10X miles for travel booked via Capital One's travel booking site).Up to $120 statement credit on TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry.$300 annual travel credit for bookings through Capital One's travel booking site.Just remember, the Venture X Business is a charge card. That means you need to pay your balance in full each month. Should you get the Venture X Business?If your business spends enough to easily earn the full welcome offer — and has the cash flow to pay it off in full — then the Capital One Venture X Business Card is a slam dunk. Only spend enough to hit the 150,000 bonus tier? This is still an exceptional business travel card.If your business needs the option to carry a balance, though, this isn’t your card. Instead, look to the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. That business travel card has a low annual fee ($95) and an excellent, attainable bonus offer: Earn 90,000 bonus points after you spend $8,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.",
