  "text": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has finalized a rule to ban medical debt from credit reports, shielding millions of Americans from the financial fallout of healthcare-related expenses.The new rule also aligns with changes made by major credit reporting agencies—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—which began removing certain medical debts, such as collections under $500, in 2022. These updates, coupled with new guidelines from credit scoring models like FICO and VantageScore, are expected to enhance financial opportunities for millions.Impacts Of The RuleThe rule prohibits credit reporting companies from including medical debt and bans lenders from using such data in credit decisions. It also addresses past abuses where debt collectors leveraged credit reports to coerce patients into paying inaccurate bills.The CFPB predicts that these changes could lead to 22,000 additional affordable mortgage approvals annually. Furthermore, this rule can make other financial services more affordable, including rentals, insurance, and more.How Credit Reporting WorksCredit reporting agencies, such as Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, collect and maintain information about an individual’s credit history, including loans, credit card usage, and payment patterns. This data is used to create credit reports and credit scores, which lenders review to assess a borrower’s creditworthiness. Credit reports influence decisions on loan approvals, interest rates, and even employment or housing opportunities. Negative items, like unpaid debts, can lower credit scores and limit financial options. The lower a person's credit score, the less likely they are to qualify for loans. Furthermore, a low credit score can make other financial activities more expensive - such as requiring a larger deposit to rent an apartment or get a cell phone, or higher rates for car insurance.By removing medical debt, the CFPB aims to ensure credit reports more accurately reflect a consumer’s ability to repay non-medical obligations.Final ThoughtsThis new rule should improve the credit of millions of Americans. Medical billing and medical debt is a huge issue for many Americans. In fact, we have a full guide to disputing medical billing errors because it happens so frequently and it can be so impactful.Not having these issues show up on credit reports is a huge win.While states like California and New York had already enacted similar protections, the CFPB’s move creates a nationwide standard. As health care costs remain a pressing issue, this rule marks a significant step in reducing the financial strain for millions of Americans.Don't Miss These Other Stories:",
