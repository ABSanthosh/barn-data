My background with blogging More than 10 years ago, I decided to start my blog, Making Sense of Cents, on a whim. I had come across an article about a blog, and it sparked an idea to share my own experiences. In the beginning, blogging was just something I did for fun. At the time, I had no clue that blogging could actually bring in money. About six months in, a fellow blogger introduced me to an advertiser, and that was when I earned my first $100. At that point, I realized how much I loved blogging, and it felt amazing that I could actually make money blogging. Since then, the blog has grown in ways I never imagined, and I’ve made over $5,000,000 through blogging. It completely changed my life, giving me financial freedom and the chance to work from anywhere.And today, I want to help you start your own successful book blog. What is a book blog? A book blog is a website where people share their thoughts about books. Book lovers read books and then write reviews about them on their blogs. They also talk about book-related topics, like author interviews or upcoming releases. A book blog can focus on a single genre, like mystery or romance, or cover a wide range of genres. You can choose what you want to write about based on your interests and passions. Some examples of topics that a book blog may cover include: Book reviews – In-depth reviews of the latest books or classic favorites Book lists – Listing book recommendations such as “Best Money Books of the Year” or “Top 10 Mystery Novels” Author interviews – Conversations with authors about their writing process, inspiration, and upcoming projects Book vs. movie comparisons – Reviews of how well a book was adapted into a film or series Reading challenges – Hosting or participating in challenges like “Read 50 Books in a Year” Upcoming releases – Highlighting new or upcoming book releases that readers should look out for Book club discussions – Starting or participating in discussions for book clubs, with questions and analyses on books Book merchandise – Reviewing or sharing book-related merchandise, such as bookshelves, bookmarks, book-themed clothing, posters, stickers, and tote bags Recommended reading: What Is A Blog, How Do Blogs Make Money, \u0026 More Why should you start a book blog? Starting a book blog is a great idea for many reasons. You can share your love for reading and connect with others who enjoy books too. This can lead to new friendships and interesting discussions about your favorite stories. Other positives of starting a book blog include: Make money – If your book blog becomes popular, there are ways to make money. You can earn through ads, sponsored posts, or affiliate links. Some bloggers even get paid to review books! Creative outlet – Your book blog is a space to express yourself. You can write reviews, share reading challenges, and even post creative content like fan fiction or author interviews. Helps authors – By reviewing and promoting books, you support authors and help them reach a wider audience. Your review might be what convinces someone to pick up a book they otherwise wouldn’t have read. For me, I am so happy that I started my blog as it has led to so many good things in my life! How To Start a Book Blog Below is how to start a book blog and make money, step by step! 1. Choose your book blog niche The first step in learning how to start a book blog is to decide what you want to write about. Picking a niche for your book blog will help you stand out and attract readers. It’s important to find a specific area of focus that you are passionate about. Choosing a niche helps narrow down your audience. Instead of trying to please everyone, you can focus on a specific group of readers who share your interests. A niche also makes it easier to create content. When you know your focus, ideas for blog posts come naturally. Plus, specializing in a niche can establish you as an expert. Readers will trust your opinions and keep coming back. There are many popular niches in book blogging, these include: Young adult fiction Mystery and thriller novels Romance novels Fantasy Science fiction Historical fiction Children’s books Biographies Books that have been turned into movies And more! I recommend starting a self-hosted WordPress blog through Bluehost. 2. Start a self-hosted WordPress blog To start your book blog, I recommend that you use a self-hosted WordPress site for your blogging platform. This means you will own your blog and its content, unlike free platforms. WordPress is where you write and manage your blog posts. Think of it as your blog’s home base. You can log in, create new posts, add pictures and links, and publish them for your readers. It’s a simple tool that helps you control everything, from writing to how your blog looks. WordPress is great because you don’t need to know how to code to build your blog or website. It’s easy to use and has lots of options to customize your site. I use WordPress for my blog, Making Sense of Cents, too! Here are the steps to start a self-hosted WordPress blog: Get a web hosting service. A popular choice for new bloggers is Bluehost. Install WordPress. Most web hosts offer a one-click installation. It’s quick and easy. You can see my full tutorial for this at How To Start A WordPress Blog On Bluehost. There are step-by-step directions if you want more detail and/or want to see screenshots of the exact things you should click on. Plus, if you use my tutorial, you can get the lowest pricing as well as a free domain name! 3. Pick a blog name and buy the domain Choosing a name for your book blog can feel tough. Don’t let this stop you from starting, though. Here are some tips for figuring out your book blog name: Keep it simple. Make sure your blog name is easy to spell and remember. Avoid long or complicated words. You want people to find your blog with no trouble. Think about your blog’s content. What will you write about? Who will read it? Write down words that describe your blog’s focus. This brainstorm can help you come up with a good name. If you find it hard to think of names, use a thesaurus. This can give you new ideas and similar words that might work better. To make your blog name stand out, try something catchy. Use humor, rhymes, or alliteration. A memorable name can help attract readers. If you’re still stuck, consider using your own name. It’s easy and many bloggers do it successfully. I highly recommend using “.com” for your domain and not any of the others. This is simply because most people are used to typing in “.com,” so it is easier to remember. Once you have a blog name, you need to buy the domain. A domain is the web address people will use to find your blog. By the way, your domain name (or blog name) is free when you sign up for Bluehost! Just click here to get your free domain name. 4. Design your blog layout After you pay for your blog, the next thing you’ll want to do is design your site. Your site design is what readers see when they read your blog posts, and it is important. You have three things you can do when it comes to designing your book blog: Designing your book blog yourself (this can be hard to learn but is definitely doable as there are free WordPress themes). Paying a web designer for a custom design (this can be expensive, though). Getting a premade blog layout – this is what I recommend new bloggers do! My favorite option is getting a premade design. They are more affordable than a custom design and look great. The premade blog design site that I recommend is Restored 316. Going the premade blog design route saves you a TON of time and lets you move on to the next step of making money blogging, which I highly recommend. Lastly, make sure your blog is mobile-friendly (the blog designs sold on Restored 316 are usually mobile-friendly!). Many readers will visit your site from their phones, so test your layout on different devices. Please click here if you’d like to go the easy way and get an affordable premade blog design (this is what I recommend). Here’s what my About page looks like. 5. Make important pages for your blog To make your book blog successful, start by setting up your important pages. These pages are important because they help your readers navigate your site easily and find the content they’re looking for. Your key pages should include: Homepage – Your homepage is the first impression visitors get of your blog. A clear and organized homepage helps readers quickly understand what your blog is about and gets them to explore your blog further. This should be welcoming and easy to navigate. Make it clear that your blog focuses on books, and include links to your main sections, such as book reviews, recommendations, or author interviews. About page – This is where you tell your story. Share information about yourself, why you started your book blog, your favorite genres, and what your readers can read on your blog. This helps build a personal connection with your audience. Contact page – Make it easy for readers to reach you by listing your email address. This allows readers, authors, and potential partners to contact you. Privacy Policy page – Explain how you use data on your site. This is important for building trust and complying with legal requirements. For legal templates, you can search for these online or buy a premade privacy policy here. Disclosure page – If you earn money through affiliate links, book promotions, or sponsored posts, let your readers know. This keeps your blog transparent and trustworthy. 6. Start social media accounts for your book blog Creating social media accounts can help your book blog grow by making it easier for more people to find your book reviews and recommendations. The social media platforms you can start with include: Facebook Pinterest Instagram Twitter TikTok You don’t need to be active on all of these platforms, but it’s a good idea to claim your blog name on each so no one else can use your name on them. Once your social media accounts are set up, add the links to your blog’s homepage so your readers can easily follow you and stay updated on your latest book reviews, recommendations, and bookish content. 7. Create a blog post plan A blog content plan is a way to organize and plan what you’ll write and publish on your blog. It helps you stay on track and makes sure your posts support your goals, like getting more readers. A good content plan usually has a list of topics, post titles, when you’ll publish each post, and the purpose of each post (like promoting something or solving a problem for your readers). It can also include SEO keywords, image ideas, and how you’ll promote the posts. Overall, it’s like a road map to keep your blog organized and productive. You don’t need to make your blog content plan complicated. It can be as simple as a list of blog posts you want to write – it’s really up to how organized you want to be. For example, you can just write down the blog post ideas you have, like this: 10 Must-Read Books for Summer How To Start a Reading Habit and Stick To It My Top 5 Favorite Fictional Characters of All Time Beginner’s Guide To Starting a Book Club How To Read More Books on a Busy Schedule 10 Books That Changed My Life Book Review: [Insert Book Title] How To Organize Your Bookshelf Like a Pro Top 5 Audiobooks for Long Road Trips How To Get Free Books: A Guide to Book Swaps and Libraries 10 Underrated Books You Need To Read Books vs. Movies: Which Is Better? 8. Write your first blog post Your first blog post is important. It’s your chance to introduce yourself and set the tone for your blog. You can start with a catchy title. Something like, “Welcome to My Book Blog” or “Why I Love Reading” can work well. Next, tell readers a bit about yourself. Share why you love books and why you started this blog. This helps readers connect with you. Then, outline what your blog will cover. Will you review books? Share reading tips? Let readers know what to expect. Wrap up your post with a call to action, such as by encouraging your readers to leave a comment or follow your blog. 9. Find ways to make money with your book blog You can make money from your book blog by displaying ads, promoting affiliate products, writing book reviews, and selling your own products. Each method can help you earn extra income (or even a full-time income one day!) while sharing your love for books. Here’s more information on each way to make money with a book blog: Display advertising – One way to make money is by placing display ads on your blog. You can sign up with ad networks like Google AdSense to place ads on your site. You get paid when visitors see or click on these ads. The more visitors you have, the more you can earn. Affiliate marketing – Another way to earn is through affiliate marketing. You can sign up for programs like Amazon Associates. When you mention a book, you can use a referral link. If someone buys through that link, you get a commission. It’s a good way to earn by recommending books you love. I have a free ebook to learn more – Affiliate Marketing Tips For Bloggers. Book reviews – Writing book reviews can also bring in money. Authors and publishers may pay you to review their books. You can learn about the best places to get paid to write book reviews at 16 Best Ways To Get Paid To Read Books. Selling products – You can also create and sell your own products. Think about items that book lovers would enjoy. You could sell bookmarks, book-themed mugs, or even your own writing. Recommended reading: 13 Ways To Get Free Books Online and Sent to You 10. How to grow a book blog To get readers to your book blog, you need to share it so that people can find it. Below are some ways to grow your pageviews: Share your book reviews and blog posts on social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. For example, I make a pin image for Pinterest for every single one of my blog posts, and it’s a great way to get new readers to my blog. Write guest posts for other book blogs or websites. This can introduce you to new readers who are interested in books. Email marketing is another great option. I recommend that you find ways to persuade your readers to subscribe to your newsletter and send them updates with new book reviews and recommendations. If you are looking for a way to send newsletters or emails to your readers, I recommend Convertkit. Respond to comments and emails from your readers. Building a relationship with them can encourage them to share your blog with others. I always respond to emails and comments because I know that I would like it if my comments/emails were replied to as well. Use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to help your blog appear in search results when people look for book reviews or related book topics. My favorite guide that goes over many different strategies to grow a blog is 21 Strategies I Used to Increase My Monthly Page Views from 17k to 400k+ in 10 Months. This guide by my friend Lena is full of great information on how to increase your blog’s pageviews. If you are feeling stuck or if you are a new blogger, check out this resource!
