  "text": "Recently, a Reddit user asked: How do you decide whether to repair or replace a broken appliance? The user’s decade-old induction range wasn’t working properly, but replacing it would be expensive. Still, they liked the range and it fit perfectly in their home, so they were hesitant to buy a new one.Reddit users suggested finding the repair manual, researching a DIY solution and seeking out a factory-authorized repair person. Here’s what home and appliance experts recommend if you find yourself in a similar situation:1. Try a low-cost fixSometimes the owner’s manual contains troubleshooting tips that lead to a quicker-than-expected fix, says Keith Flamer, home and appliances writer at Consumer Reports. You can often find a digital version on the manufacturer’s website if you can’t locate the original, he adds. Some appliance makers offer diagnostic systems that can identify the specific problem. The manufacturer may offer a solution on its website or through the customer service line, Flamer says — especially if it’s a common issue. If you’re still stuck, you can crowdsource ideas. “Start with YouTube and message boards,” Flamer says. Often other users will share useful tips unique to their experience with a particular appliance. 2. Check your purchase historyDepending on how long ago you purchased the appliance, it might still be under warranty, says Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, a website that provides information on home services.A typical appliance warranty lasts one year, but consumers often have the option of purchasing extended warranties. Looking up your original receipt and paperwork can often confirm your warranty length. 3. Do the mathDetermining the age of your appliance and measuring that against its expected lifespan can also make your decision easier.“If your appliance is halfway through its useful life — and most last between 10 to 15 years — and it’s going to take half as much to repair it than to replace it, then absolutely replace it,” Hicks says. 4. Decide how much you like your applianceIf you have a favorite appliance — perhaps the cooktop works well, the oven heats up quickly, or you just like the look and feel of it — then it’s worth fully exploring potential fixes, says Ethan O’Donnell, digital editor of FamilyHandyman.com, a website about home improvement projects. When the handle broke on his white dishwasher and the matching replacement would have cost an exorbitant amount, O’Donnell decided to replace it with a cheaper black one. It doesn’t match, but he still has his reliable dishwasher, and the fix only cost him about $20. 5. Turn to the experts When repairs involve potential safety hazards, like a gas line or electronics, turning to repair professionals makes sense, O’Donnell says.“Capacitors hold charges and can give you a serious shock,” he warns.In some cases, taking apart an appliance yourself can also void the warranty, O’Donnell adds. Sometimes, you can learn useful tricks from watching the professionals at work. After O’Donnell observed the washer repair person remove a sock that had jammed up the washing machine, he was able to fix the clog himself next time. 6. Leverage summer sales Summer shopping events like Prime Day and July 4 sales offer deep discounts in the hottest months of the year. That makes summer an ideal time to replace an appliance and save money.“If you can hit sales weekends, you can get a better price,” Hicks says. Consider using coupons and comparison tools like PayPal Honey or the Camelizer browser extension when online shopping to make sure you’re getting the best price possible. If you do buy a new appliance, then be sure to fill out the registration information to validate your warranty and make it easier to find in the future. 7. Don’t forget regular maintenanceRemoving lint from the dryer vents, cleaning air conditioner coils and performing other kinds of regular maintenance can prolong the life of your appliances, Hicks says. “It helps them to run more efficiently and extends their life,” she says, whether it’s a brand-new model or a broken-in favorite. Reddit is an online forum where users share their thoughts in “threads” on various topics. The popular site includes plenty of discussion on financial subjects like saving and shopping, so we sifted through Reddit forums to get a pulse check. People post anonymously, so we cannot confirm their individual experiences or circumstances.",
