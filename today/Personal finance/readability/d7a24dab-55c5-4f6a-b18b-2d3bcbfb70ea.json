Looking for a job as a teenager can be exciting and a little scary. You might wonder what options are out there for someone your age. The good news is that there are many jobs for 17-year-olds that can help you earn money and gain experience. When I was a teenager, I wanted to start working more regularly and earn my own money. My first job made me feel independent and in control of my own income, and I was excited to save up for things I wanted. I was working nearly full-time hours at the age of 17, and I made decent money doing so! Recommended reading: 23 Business Ideas For Teens To Make Extra Money Best Jobs for 17 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 17-year-olds. 1. Babysitter Babysitting is a great job for 17-year-olds, and many parents look for teens to watch their kids after school or on the weekends. Babysitters take care of children while their parents are away. This may include feeding them, playing games, and putting them to bed. You might also help with homework or light housework. The pay for babysitting can be good and you could make $10 to $25 per hour, depending on where you live. Some families pay even more for experienced sitters. I still remember starting my first real babysitting job when I was a teenager (where I didn’t know the family but found them on a bulletin board in my local area). I worked around 36 hours a week in the summer for a single mom who was a nurse. She paid me $10 an hour! 2. Dog walker Walking dogs can be a fun way to make money as a 17-year-old. You get to spend time with cute pups and enjoy the outdoors. Most dog walking jobs pay between $10 and $20 per walk. The exact amount depends on how long the walk is and where you live. You might make more if you walk multiple dogs at once. 3. Lifeguard Being a lifeguard is a great job for 17-year-olds who love swimming and want to help others. You can work at pools, beaches, or water parks. Lifeguards do need to get certified and this usually involves taking a course (where you’ll learn skills like CPR and first aid) and passing a test. The pay for lifeguards is usually much better than other teen jobs. Many places pay around $15 to $20 per hour. Growing up, I had a few friends who worked at recreation centers and amusement parks nearby, and they all seemed to love their jobs and how much they were paid. It always sounded like a lot of fun too! 4. Grocery bagger Grocery bagging is a great job for 17-year-olds. You can find these positions at many supermarkets and grocery stores. Baggers bag customers’ groceries into bags or boxes, and I’m sure you’ve been grocery shopping and have had someone bag your food before – so you probably know what I’m talking about. Many stores hire teens as young as 14 or 15 for this role. But at 17, you might have more scheduling options. You’ll often work part-time, which is perfect for balancing school and work. Weekend shifts are common too. 5. Retail associate Retail jobs are a great option for 17-year-olds looking to earn money, and many stores hire teens to work as sales associates or cashiers. You can find these jobs at clothing stores, department stores, and big-box retailers. Places like Target, Walmart, and local malls usually have openings for young workers. As a retail associate, you’ll help customers find products and answer their questions. You might also operate the cash register, organize shelves, and keep the store clean. Most retail jobs pay around minimum wage to start. But you can usually get employee discounts on store merchandise, which is a nice perk. When I turned 16, I applied at one of my favorite clothing stores. It looked like a fun job (and it was) and I wanted the employee discount as well. I ended up working there for around 5 years, made good money, and made lifelong friends! 6. Fast food crew member Fast food jobs are great for 17-year-olds. Many places like McDonald’s, Burger King, and Zaxby’s hire teens your age. Crew members do different jobs like working the cash register, taking orders, preparing food, and helping customers. The pay is usually around minimum wage but some places might pay more. You can often work part-time, which is good for school schedules. I had many friends who worked at fast food chains when I was younger, and many enjoyed their jobs, the friendships they made, as well as, of course, the income they earned. Plus, they either received perks like free food or really discounted food. 7. Movie theater worker Working at a movie theater can be a fun job for 17-year-olds. You may be able to earn income plus watch parts of recently released movies. You might sell tickets or snacks at the concession stand. Most theaters hire teens who are at least 16 years old. Your duties may also include tearing tickets and checking for proper age ratings. You’ll also need to clean up after shows and make sure the theater is ready for the next screening. The hours can be flexible, which is perfect if you’re in school. You might work evenings and weekends when most people go to the movies. So, this schedule can fit well with your studies. 8. Golf caddy Being a golf caddy can be a great job for 17-year-olds who enjoy the outdoors and sports. Caddies help golfers by carrying their clubs and giving advice on the course. If you want to find a golf caddy job, you can start by calling local golf courses. Ask if they’re hiring and what their requirements are. Some places might want you to know about golf already, while others will train you. 9. Amusement park attendant Working as an amusement park attendant can be a fun job for 17-year-olds. You get to help people have a great time at the park. Your tasks might include operating rides, selling tickets, or helping with games. Many amusement parks hire teens for summer jobs. Six Flags is one big company that often hires young people. You usually need to be at least 16 to apply for these jobs. 10. Ice cream scooper Being an ice cream scooper is a fun summer job for 17-year-olds. Ice cream workers take orders from customers and serve up their favorite flavors. You might also make milkshakes and other frozen desserts. The job usually pays around minimum wage. Some places may offer slightly higher pay. You might even get free ice cream as a perk! Most ice cream shops are busiest in the summer. This means you can work more hours when school is out. Some places may offer part-time work year-round as well. There’s a very popular ice cream place near me that is only open in the late spring, summer, and early fall, and it is almost entirely staffed by teenagers from a local high school – and it’s been this way for years. When I was younger, it always seemed like such a fun place to work at too. 11. Library assistant Working as a library assistant can be a great job for 17-year-olds. You can help organize books, assist patrons, and keep the library clean. Many libraries offer part-time positions perfect for teens. You might work after school or on weekends. 12. Tutor Tutoring is a great job for 17-year-olds. You can help younger students with subjects you’re good at such as math, science, and English. You can tutor in person or online. Many families look for tutors to help their kids after school. Tutoring pays well for a teen job. You might earn $15 to $25 an hour (or more). The exact amount depends on the subject and how much experience you have. 13. Camp counselor Being a camp counselor is a great summer job for 17-year-olds. You get to spend time outdoors and work with kids. Many camps hire teens to help run activities and look after younger campers. Counselors at camps lead games, sports, or arts and crafts. You’ll also help kids with daily tasks and make sure they’re safe. Some camps have overnight programs where you stay for weeks at a time. Others are day camps that run during normal work hours. Pay can range from $500 to $1,000 a week, depending on the camp. 14. Gardener Gardeners plant flowers, trees, and shrubs. You could also mow lawns, trim hedges, and pull weeds. Some gardeners even help grow fruits and vegetables. The pay for teenage gardeners can range from $10 to $20 per hour. This can vary based on where you live and what tasks you do. 15. Pet sitter Pet sitting could be a fun way to make money as a 17-year-old. You can watch pets while their owners are away on vacation or at work. Pet sitters feed pets, take dogs for walks, clean litter boxes, and give medications. You can find pet-sitting jobs through websites, apps, or by asking neighbors and family friends. A few years ago, I needed someone to look after my two dogs while I was away, and I found a wonderful family to help out (I found them on a popular dog walking app). The teenagers in the family took care of my dogs, playing with them and keeping them entertained, with their parents nearby to supervise. My dogs stayed at their house for a week, had an amazing time, and the teens earned some extra money too! 16. House cleaner House cleaning can be a good job for 17-year-olds. You can work for cleaning companies or start your own small business. House cleaners vacuum, dust, mop floors, and clean bathrooms. You could also do laundry or organize closets. 17. Customer service Customer service jobs can be great for 17-year-olds. You can find these jobs in many places, like stores, restaurants, and call centers. Customer service reps help people with questions and problems. You might work at a store’s help desk or answer phone calls. 18. Car washer Car washing can be a great job for 17-year-olds. You’ll get to work outdoors and stay active while earning money. Many car washes hire teens, so it’s worth checking out places in your area. Car washers clean the inside and outside of vehicles. This means vacuuming interiors, wiping down surfaces, and washing exteriors. Many car washes are busiest on weekends. This can be perfect if you’re in school during the week. Some places might have flexible hours to fit around your classes too. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to questions about jobs for 17-year-olds. What job pays the best at 17? One of the best-paying jobs at 17 years old is lifeguarding, where you can make around $15 to $20 per hour. Babysitting can also pay well, especially if you have experience and good references. What are some good first jobs for teenagers just starting to work? Retail jobs are great for first-time teenage workers. You can try being a grocery bagger or store associate. Dog walking is another easy way to start working and earn money. How can a 17 year old find jobs that require no previous work experience? If you’re a 17-year-old who wants to find a job that doesn’t require previous experience, then I recommend looking for entry-level positions that give you training. Many fast food places and retail stores hire teens with no experience. You can also start your own small business like lawn mowing or car washing. Most places that hire teens know that you most likely won’t have experience, so it shouldn’t be a problem. What types of part-time jobs can 17 year olds do while in school? There are many part-time jobs that a 17-year-old can do while in school, such as working at a movie theater, a clothing store, or starting their own lawn mowing business. What’s the best way for a 17 year old to find a job near where they live? If you want to find a job near where you live, I recommend asking friends and family if they know of any openings. You can also check local job boards and your school’s career center, and even walk around your neighborhood and look for “Help Wanted” signs in store windows. Don’t be shy about asking businesses if they’re hiring. Best Jobs for 17 Year Olds – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on how to find the best jobs for 17-year-olds. Finding a job as a 17-year-old can be a great experience, helping you earn money and gain skills.
