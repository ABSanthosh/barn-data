I’ve been my own boss for… Looking for the best jobs where you can be your own boss? Being your own boss and running a small business can be exciting and rewarding. You get to make your own choices and set your own schedule. Many people dream of having this freedom in their work life. I’ve been my own boss for over 10 years, and I absolutely love it. I’ve had the freedom to work when I want, where I want, and to focus on the projects that excite me the most. It hasn’t always been easy, but the rewards of working for myself have been worth it. If you’re looking for a job where you can be your own boss, there are so many great options out there too! Best Jobs Where You Can Be Your Own Boss Below are the best ways to be your own boss. 1. Blogger Being a blogger might be perfect for you if you want to work from anywhere and be your own boss. As a blogger, you write articles about topics you like and post them online. You can choose the niche you write about – such as travel, personal finance, lifestyle, food, family, home, and more. It’s all about writing high-quality content that your readers will benefit from and enjoy. When I first started blogging, I never imagined it would grow into the career I have today. I’ve had the freedom to write about things that I’m passionate about while building an amazing community of readers. It’s been one of the best ways to express my creativity and connect with others who share my interests. Plus, I get to work from anywhere – whether I’m at home or traveling – which is such a huge positive! You can learn how to start a blogging business in my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. I have taught over 80,000 people how to start a blog with this free course. 2. Printables creator If you want to be your own boss and also work from home, then you may want to try selling printables on Etsy. Printables are digital files that customers buy and print themselves. You can make all sorts of things like planners, wall art, and gift tags. The best part? You only need to create each design once. Then you can sell it over and over without any extra work. You don’t need to be super artistic to get started and many people learn as they go. Tools like Canva make it easy to design, even if you’re not a pro. You can learn more at How I Make Money Selling Printables On Etsy. 3. Proofreader Proofreading might be perfect for you if you want to catch mistakes for a living. Proofreaders fix spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors in all kinds of writing. You can work from home or while traveling. Many proofreaders set their own schedules and choose their projects. This flexibility is great if you have other commitments or just want control over your time. Writers, companies, and students all need proofreaders to polish their work. You might proofread blog posts, books, ads, or academic papers. I have a proofreader for this blog, Making Sense of Cents, and I have many friends who have proofreaders as well. They are extremely valuable! You can learn more at How To Become A Proofreader And Work From Anywhere. I recommend signing up for the FREE 76-minute workshop where you can learn how to become a proofreader and start a proofreading business. You can sign up for free here. 10Proofread AnywhereThis free 76-minute workshop answers all of the most common questions about how to become a proofreader, and even talks about the 5 signs that proofreading could be a perfect fit for you. 4. Bookkeeper Being a bookkeeper can be a great way to be your own boss because they can work from home with just a computer and internet connection. Bookkeepers keep track of what a company spends and earns. They might record sales, organize receipts, and make financial reports. Many businesses need bookkeepers, so there’s lots of work available. You don’t need a college degree to start. With some training, you can learn the skills you need. Online courses can teach you how to use bookkeeping software and manage finances. Many bookkeepers earn around $40,000 a year or more. You can work part-time or full-time, depending on what you want. As your own boss, you choose your schedule and clients. You might work with one business or have several, so this job gives you the freedom to work when and where you want. If you want to learn more, the free workshop How to start a virtual bookkeeping business (and who should do it) is super helpful. Recommended reading: How To Find Online Bookkeeping Jobs 10Bookkeeper Launch CourseThis free training will teach you what you need to know to become a virtual bookkeeper and make money from home. 5. Freelance writer I have been a freelance writer for years and I think it’s a great way to work from home and be your own boss. Freelance writers create content for all kinds of clients. They could write blog posts, articles, website copy, or even books. Many businesses need writers to help them reach customers online, so that means there are lots of opportunities to find writing work. You can start small and grow your business over time. One great thing about freelance writing is the flexibility. You can set your own schedule and work as much or as little as you want. Many writers earn a full-time income working from home or while traveling. Recommended reading: 14 Places To Find Freelance Writing Jobs – (Start With No Experience!) 6. Graphic designer Graphic designers create visual content for websites, ads, logos, and more. They might specialize in one area or do a little bit of all different kinds of graphic design. They typically work for themselves and choose their own projects. I have hired several graphic designers over the years, and they’ve all been their own boss and worked from home. 7. Virtual assistant A virtual assistant job might be perfect for you if you want to work from home and be your own boss. Virtual assistants help businesses and entrepreneurs with all kinds of tasks online. I was a virtual assistant when I first started working online as a freelancer, and I loved how I could choose the work I did and my hours. I now have my own virtual assistants who help me in different areas of running my own business. As a virtual assistant, you could manage emails, schedule appointments, or handle social media accounts. You might also do data entry, create presentations, or help with customer service. The tasks vary depending on what your clients need and what you want to specialize in (you get to choose, of course). They can vary from administrative tasks to being a digital marketer – it just depends on what you want to do. The pay for virtual assistants can be pretty good too. You might start around $15 to $20 per hour, but experienced VAs can make much more. Some even earn over $10,000 a month! Recommended reading: Best Ways To Find Virtual Assistant Jobs 8. Litter cleanup business A litter cleanup business allows you to be your own boss and make money outdoors. Business owners and property managers need their places to look clean and they pay to pick up trash. You can charge $30 to $50 an hour for this work. All you need are some basic tools like a broom, dustpan, and grabber. The job is easy and flexible as you’ll typically walk around the property picking up litter in the early morning. You can learn more at How I Started A $650,000 Per Year Litter Cleanup Business. 9. Online course creator I created Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing almost 10 years ago as my first online course. Since then, I have earned over $2,000,000 from that single course. And, I do it all from home and on my own schedule. Becoming an online course creator might be perfect for you if you want to share your knowledge and skills with others. You can teach almost anything – from cooking to coding to crafts. Course creators make lessons – either text-based, video-based, or a mixture of the two –  create worksheets, and more. They build a course so that others can learn the subject, all from home. As someone who has created online courses myself, I can say it’s one of the most rewarding ways to share your expertise and help others learn. I’ve met many course creators who started with just a simple idea and turned it into a business that earns thousands of dollars a month. The best part is the flexibility – once the course is created, it can keep generating income with little maintenance. Recommended reading: How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 From My First Course Without a Big Launch. 10. Etsy shop owner Etsy is a great place to sell handmade items, vintage goods, and craft supplies. Etsy shop owners can work from home and set their own hours, so this is one of the best jobs where you can be your own boss if you are a creative person. You can sell many different types of items on Etsy, such as handmade items (like jewelry or home decor), vintage items (like clothing), printables, personalized items (like monogrammed gifts or custom prints), and more. Running an Etsy shop gives you creative freedom. You can design your own products and decide how to present them. You’re in charge of pricing, shipping, and customer service. Many people start Etsy shops as side hustles. Some grow them into full-time businesses. Your income depends on what you sell and how much time you put in. Recommended reading: How To Sell On Etsy Successfully: A Beginner’s Guide 11. Affiliate marketer Affiliate marketing is one of my favorite ways to earn income because it’s so flexible. When I started, I didn’t realize how powerful it could be, but over time, I’ve built a consistent income stream just by recommending products I love. The best part is that it’s passive – once your content is out there with affiliate links, you can keep earning from it without constantly working. It’s a fantastic way to monetize your blog or social media channels and be your own boss. There are many different types of affiliate products a person could promote, such as anything that is sold on Amazon (books, clothing, electronics, home goods, etc.), digital products like courses or software tools, subscription services (like HelloFresh), cell phone apps, vacations, and more. If you want to learn more about affiliate marketing, I recommend signing up for Affiliate Marketing Tips For Bloggers – Free eBook. 12. YouTuber Being a YouTuber can be a fun way to be your own boss. You get to make videos about things you love and share them with people around the world. YouTubers choose what kind of content to create, such as vlogs, game reviews, cooking tutorials, or anything else that interests them. They set their own schedule and work from home or wherever they want. All they need is a camera, some basic editing skills, and ideas for videos. Now, it does take time to start making money as a YouTuber, but you can earn through ads, sponsorships, and selling merchandise. Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? 13. Life coach Life coaches work with clients to improve their lives and achieve their dreams. They guide people through tough decisions and help them overcome obstacles. This job lets you set your own hours and work from anywhere. Life coaches can focus on specific areas like career, relationships, or health. Or you can be a general life coach who helps with all kinds of issues. Life coaching can be very rewarding. You get to see people grow and succeed because of your help. Plus, you’re in charge of your own business and schedule. 14. Pet sitter I’ve used pet sitters for my own pets while traveling, and I can see why so many people love this job! If you’re an animal lover, pet sitting can be a really enjoyable way to earn money while being your own boss. You get to spend time with cute pets and choose when and how often you want to work. You can work with cats, dogs, and other animals. Pet sitters usually feed pets, walk dogs, and give them attention. Some even stay overnight at the owner’s home. To start, you might join a pet sitting app or website. These can help you find clients and manage bookings. You can also spread the word to friends and neighbors. You can make good money as a pet sitter. Some people do it full-time, while others use it as a side job. The more clients you have, the more you can earn. 15. Reselling items I have resold many items over the years, and when I was younger I even had a small reselling business. I really enjoyed this side hustle and being my own boss! Reselling can be a fun way to make money. You can start by looking around your house for things you don’t need anymore. Old clothes, toys, or electronics might be worth something to others. You can also buy items cheap and sell them for more. This is called “flipping.” People have made good money doing this and some even turn it into a full-time job. Flea markets, yard sales, and thrift stores are great places to find stuff to resell. You might find hidden treasures that others missed. Online marketplaces like eBay or Facebook Marketplace are good for selling. Recommended reading: How Melissa Made $40,000 In One Year Flipping Items. 16. Managing Facebook ads for small businesses Many small business owners don’t know how to create effective ads on Facebook. That’s where you come in! By running Facebook ads, you can help businesses find new customers. You’ll create ads that show up in people’s Facebook feeds. These ads can help businesses reach more people who might want to buy their products or services. I recommend watching the free training How To Start Your Very Own Facebook Ad Agency In 30 Days Even If You’ve Never Written An Ad Before! to learn more. 17. Transcriptionist Transcription is a job where you can be your own boss. Transcriptionists listen to audio or watch videos and type what they hear. It’s a great way to work from home and set your own schedule. As a transcriptionist, you can choose when and how much you work. They might transcribe interviews, podcasts, or even TV shows. All they need is a computer, internet, and headphones to get started. Many companies hire transcriptionists. You can work for one company or find jobs on your own. Some places pay around $15 to $20 per hour, but your speed affects how much you earn. Recommended reading: 18 Best Online Transcription Jobs For Beginners To Make $2,000 Monthly 18. Home dog bakery People love spoiling their dogs. Many want healthy, homemade snacks for their furry friends. That’s where you come in! You can bake yummy dog treats using simple ingredients. Getting started is easy. You’ll need some baking supplies and dog-safe recipes. Try making a few batches for friends’ pets first. If they’re a hit, you can start selling them. There are lots of ways to sell your treats. You could set up a booth at local markets or you could sell online through sites like Etsy. You might even team up with pet stores in your area. You can learn more at How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!). 19. Photographer Many photographers set their own hours, choose their projects, and earn well over $50,000 a year. But your income can vary based on your skills and the type of photos you take. You can find work in many ways. Some photographers sell their pictures on stock photo websites like Shutterstock or Adobe Stock. Others take photos for special events like weddings or birthdays. You might also work with businesses to take product photos or create ads. Real estate photography is another option, where you’d take pictures of homes for sale.

They buy houses, apartments, or land to make money. There are different ways to invest in real estate. Some ideas include: You could flip houses by buying fixer-uppers, making them better, and selling them for more. Another option is becoming a landlord. You buy properties and rent them out to tenants. This can give you steady income each month. If you don’t want to deal with tenants, you might like REITs. These are like stocks for real estate. You invest money and get part of the profits without managing properties yourself. Short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb can also be profitable. You rent out a room or whole property to travelers. Recommended reading: 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money 21. Financial advisor As a financial advisor, you can be your own boss while helping people manage their money, such as by guiding clients on investments, taxes, insurance, and retirement planning. Many times, financial advisors work from home or set up their own office where clients can meet. As your own boss, you can choose your work hours and which clients to take on. You’ll have the freedom to specialize in areas you enjoy, like retirement planning or investment strategies. 22. Event planner Event planners put together special occasions for people and businesses, like parties, weddings, meetings, and more. As an event planner, you get to use your creativity. You’ll pick venues, decorations, and food that fit each event’s theme. You’ll also manage budgets and work with vendors to make everything perfect. Being your own boss means you can choose which events to plan. You might focus on weddings or corporate events. Or you could do a mix of different types of events. 23.

Personal trainers might work with clients at a gym or fitness center. Or, you could open your own studio. Some trainers even visit clients in their homes or do everything entirely online. Setting your own schedule is a big perk. You can choose when to work and how many clients to take on, so this lets you balance work and life the way you want. 24.

This means you can focus on the types of websites you enjoy creating most. 26. Influencer Being an influencer means you can be your own boss and make a full-time income or extra income. You share content on social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok. Your goal is to build a social media presence (your following) and connect with your audience. Influencers create posts, videos, or photos about topics they love. This could be fashion, travel, food, or any other interest. You get to decide what to share and when. Companies may pay you to promote their products to your followers. You might also earn money through sponsorships or affiliate marketing. Some influencers sell their own products or services too (like courses, candles, or clothing). Being an influencer is a popular self-employed job idea because you get to create your own flexible schedule, you have creative freedom, you can earn multiple income streams, and it also has low start-up costs (you can start for free with just your cell phone!). 27. Translator Being a translator lets you be your own boss. You can work from anywhere and choose your own hours, and this job is great if you know more than one language really well. Translators change text from one language to another. They might work on books, websites, or legal papers. Some translators even help with movies and TV shows. The best part is you can pick projects you like. You can work as much or as little as you want. This gives you control over your work and life. 28.

This gives you lots of freedom and flexibility. Frequently Asked Questions Being your own boss can be great, but it takes work. Here are some common questions about self-employment and running a business. Is being your own boss worth it? Being your own boss can be very rewarding and I definitely think that it is worth it. You get to make your own schedule and choose your projects. But it also means more responsibility because you have to find your own clients and manage your finances. What are some high-paying jobs where you are your own boss? Many self-employed jobs can pay well if you work hard. Some options are web developer, business consultant, real estate agent, freelance writer, blogger, and bookkeeper. What are some good jobs you can do from home where you’re the boss? Working from home as your own boss is getting more popular. Here are some ideas of good jobs you can do from home where you’re the boss: virtual assistant, online tutor, graphic designer, social media manager, and blogger. These jobs let you set your own hours and work in your pajamas if you want! Do you need a degree to be your own boss? Some self-employed jobs may need a certification or formal education, but some can be started with no experience (from scratch!) or with a small portfolio (to display your past work). While I have three college degrees, I did not need any of them in order to run the business that I own today. What steps should I take if I want to run a business by myself? Starting your own business takes planning. Here’s what to do: Choose a business idea. Make a business plan. Set up your finances and get any needed permits. Create a website and start marketing. Network and find your first clients. Now, it does take time to grow a business. Be patient and keep working at it!
