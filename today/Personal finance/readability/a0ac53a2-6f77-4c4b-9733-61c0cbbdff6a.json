Have you ever thought about turning your love for Pinterest into a way to make money? For me, Pinterest started as just a fun platform to find new ideas and get inspired, but over time, I realized it could be so much more. I’ve used Pinterest not only to grow my blog and online business but also to create new income streams and to make extra income. I personally make over $1,000 each month using Pinterest and have for years! Pinterest isn’t just an inspiration board for new hobbies or DIY projects either – it’s a tool that can help people like you make money too. Whether you’re into crafting, blogging, selling products, or something else, there are many ways to make money on Pinterest. 5 Best Ways To Make Money on Pinterest Below are the best ways to make money on Pinterest. Making Sense of Cents uses Pinterest to get traffic. Here’s the Pinterest profile page for Making Sense of Cents. 1. Promote your blog or website Pinterest is great for making money because it is a visually driven platform with a highly engaged audience searching for new inspiration, products, and services. There are over 400 million active users monthly on the platform, so this means your pins can potentially be seen by thousands of new customers, driving traffic and sales to your site over time.  So, it makes sense that Pinterest is a favorite for content creators! One way to make money on Pinterest is to get traffic from Pinterest and direct it toward your website. You can create pins that link to your articles or website, and then make money by selling items on your site, advertisements (such as with display ads on networks like Mediavine and Raptive Adthrive), and more. For example, if your website is monetized with display ads, Pinterest can help you increase ad revenue. The more traffic Pinterest sends to your site, the more pageviews you get, which directly translates into higher earnings from ads. You can also make money with affiliate marketing on a blog. This is where you may use referral links to share products on your blog with your readers. For example, I wrote this blog post for Making Sense of Cents – 15 Best Amazon Hacks To Save Money. In it, I include several links to Amazon. I also created pin images for this blog post. So, when a reader finds my pin on Pinterest, they will then read the blog post and possibly click on my affiliate link. If they purchase, then Making Sense of Cents earns a commission. I use Pinterest to get traffic for my site too (I own the blog FITnancials) by pinning blog posts that link to my content. Whether it’s new posts, evergreen content, or older articles, Pinterest helps me share everything with a wider audience. By sharing pins that link to these articles, I can increase the chances of driving more traffic and making money through affiliate marketing and display ads. I’m a writer here at Making Sense of Cents and also work as the Pinterest virtual assistant. Here are some of the pins I’ve scheduled for this blog. 2. Become a Pinterest virtual assistant If you’re skilled in creating high-quality pins and growing accounts, selling Pinterest management services is a great way to make money. As a Pinterest virtual assistant, you can help businesses or bloggers with tasks such as creating visually appealing pins, scheduling pins, and developing strategies for increased engagement. One of my strategies for monetizing Pinterest is through managing Pinterest accounts for other businesses, helping them grow their online presence and generate more traffic. I have been a virtual assistant specializing in Pinterest for several years now. I create new Pinterest graphics as well as schedule pins to blog posts. I am actually the Pinterest virtual assistant for the blog you are reading right now! Recommended reading: How I Started Earning $3,600 a Month As A Pinterest Assistant After Just 6 Months 3. Sell your products or services Pinterest is a great platform for selling your own products or services. For example, I use Pinterest to promote my own course, Making Sense of Sponsored Posts. You can create pins that link directly to your sales pages, helping potential customers learn more about what you’re selling. You’ll want to make sure your pins are visually appealing, with a clear message and relevant text overlays that explain your product or service. If you have an online store or sell services, Pinterest’s large, engaged audience can drive valuable traffic to your site. The more traffic you get from Pinterest, the more opportunities there are for increased revenue. 4. Create and sell digital products If you’ve designed digital products like printables, planners, templates, or any other downloadable items, Pinterest is a good platform for promoting and selling them. Digital products are especially great because they are easy to create, have low overhead costs, and can generate passive income. I also use Pinterest to promote my own digital products, and it has proven to be an effective way to showcase these products to my target audience. For example, if you create a new printable or template, create a set of different pins with different designs to see which one resonates the most with your audience. Make sure your pins include a clear call to action, such as “Click here to download your free planner!” or “Get started with this affordable digital template today!” This gets users to click through and check out what you’re trying to sell. Here are some of the pins I have recently made. 5. Teach Pinterest skills If you’ve learned how to use Pinterest to grow your business, you can make money by teaching others how to do the same. Many people want to know how to use Pinterest to get more traffic to their website or sell their products. This creates a great opportunity for you to share what you know. One way to do this is by creating a course that teaches others how to use Pinterest. In the course, you can explain how to create great pins, how to use Pinterest search to get more views, and how to develop a plan for long-term success. You could also sell coaching, where you work directly with people, giving them advice and helping them improve their Pinterest accounts. Another option is to make and sell digital products, like Pinterest templates or short guides, to help people make better pins. These can be sold on your website or sites like Etsy. Teaching Pinterest skills is a great way to make money while helping others. Plus, as more people want to learn about Pinterest, you can grow your business and earn even more! I have personally bought and taken many Pinterest courses and guides over the years, and they are extremely helpful! If you’re looking for a course to learn more about Pinterest, I recommend looking into Pinteresting Strategies. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to make money on Pinterest. What is Pinterest? Pinterest is a visually driven social media platform (yes, technically it’s a social media platform just like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, but it’s much different!) where users can find, save, and share images, videos, and links related to a wide range of interests, from DIY projects and recipes to business strategies and fashion trends. Unlike other platforms, Pinterest is more like a virtual inspiration board, allowing users to create boards that organize their favorite content. It’s also a powerful tool for businesses and content creators to drive traffic to their websites, promote products, and engage with a large, highly targeted audience. With over 400 million active Pinterest users monthly, Pinterest has many opportunities for those looking to monetize their content and expand their online presence. Can you make money on Pinterest? Yes, you can definitely make money on Pinterest and there are several ways to do this. Since Pinterest is a great tool for getting traffic, you can use this to your advantage by promoting your own products and services, selling digital downloads, or using affiliate marketing. You can even sell Pinterest management services to small businesses who need help running their Pinterest account. Can you get paid directly from Pinterest? Pinterest does not pay users to create content, but Pinterest does give you opportunities to monetize your presence on the platform. You can earn money via affiliate marketing, promoting your own products, and driving traffic to your website where you can then make money through ads, sales, or services.  How many followers do I need on Pinterest to make money? There is no specific follow count needed to make money on Pinterest. Success on the Pinterest platform totally depends on the quality of your content and how well you’re engaging with the audience. A larger following can make it easier to increase your visibility on the platform, but you can also start making money with a smaller, targeted audience if your pins are optimized to resonate with that audience. I recommend that you focus on creating visually appealing pins that are relevant. With consistency and time, you’ll likely see an increase in engagement and followers. How to make passive income on Pinterest? To generate passive income on Pinterest, prioritize creating content that continues to attract traffic long after it’s published – this is known as evergreen content. For instance, a post like “How To Budget Your Money” remains relevant over time, unlike a more time-sensitive topic such as “Budgeting Trends for March 2025.” Evergreen content performs better on Pinterest because the platform is designed for long-term engagement.  How to make money on Pinterest without a blog? You don’t need a blog to make money on Pinterest. Instead, link to your affiliate links, social media, Etsy, or Shopify shop. When posting affiliate links on Pinterest, you need to clearly disclose that you are sharing an affiliate link. You can do this by saying “This post contains affiliate links” or “I may earn a commission from qualifying purchases through these links.” How to make money on Pinterest with Amazon? Amazon has an amazing affiliate program, and since so many people shop on Amazon already, this can be a great way to increase your income (Amazon’s affiliate program is known as Amazon Associates). To make money on Pinterest with Amazon, you’ll want to find products that are relevant to your niche on Pinterest. This could be home decor, electronics, clothing, books, and anything else that Amazon sells. Then, you’ll create eye-catching, keyword-rich pins linking to your blog posts that contain Amazon affiliate links. When pinners click on your pin, they’ll be sent to your blog and then to Amazon, where they can make a purchase. What is the Pinterest Creator Fund? Does this still exist? The Pinterest Creator Fund was discontinued in 2022. This fund started as a program launched by Pinterest to support creators by providing financial grants to help them grow their content on the platform. Pinterest has now shifted to focusing on other ways to support creators. Some people made great money with this, but it didn’t last long. What are some tips for making great pins on Pinterest? There are many ways to make great pins on Pinterest and there’s a lot of strategy involved in having success on the platform. Here are some tips to get started creating high-quality Pinterest pins: Use images that are sharp, bright, and visually appealing Pinterest favors images that have an aspect ratio of 2:3 or 1000 x 1500 pixels Use Canva (free and paid versions) and use their already-made Pinterest templates Add text overlay that will explain what your pin is about; keep it short and to the point Use keywords that are relevant to your niche Create pins with value, selling something useful or inspiring, like tips or tutorials Experiment with different pin designs to see what resonates best with your audience  By focusing on these tips, you can create pins that not only grab attention but also increase engagement, helping you grow your reach on Pinterest. What are some tips for getting traffic from Pinterest? Here are a few tips to get traffic from Pinterest, aside from designing high-quality pins: Switch to a Pinterest business account which gives you access to analytics and additional tools Do keyword research and learn Pinterest SEO to see what your target audience is searching on the platform. Pinterest is a search engine, after all! Design multiple pins to see which pins your audience prefers Pin at optimal times (you can see when your audience is most active by using tools like Tailwind) Write Pinterest descriptions that get users to comment, share, and pin your pins. I also recommend testing out different pin descriptions to see what works (and what doesn’t) Keep pins fresh and regularly create new pins Keep an eye on Pinterest trends to align your content with what’s currently popular How Do I Make Money on Pinterest? I personally make money in several ways on Pinterest, including: I pin blog posts that link to my top-performing affiliate content I use Pinterest to promote my own products, like my Making Sense of Sponsored Posts course I make money by sharing sponsored content on Pinterest I use Pinterest to collect emails for my email list, which I use to make money All traffic from Pinterest is increased ad revenue from Mediavine, my advertising agency I’m in charge of Pinterest management for other businesses, like this blog (Making Sense of Cents) I think Pinterest is great for anyone as there are so many ways to make money with it!

Teach Pinterest skills\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve learned how to use Pinterest to grow your business, you can make money by teaching others how to do the same. Many people want to know how to use Pinterest to get more traffic to their website or sell their products. This creates a great opportunity for you to share what you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to do this is by creating a course that teaches others how to use Pinterest. In the course, you can explain how to create great pins, how to use Pinterest search to get more views, and how to develop a plan for long-term success. You could also sell coaching, where you work directly with people, giving them advice and helping them improve their Pinterest accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother option is to make and sell digital products, like Pinterest templates or short guides, to help people make better pins. These can be sold on your website or sites like Etsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTeaching Pinterest skills is a great way to make money while helping others.

Unlike other platforms, Pinterest is more like a virtual inspiration board, allowing users to create boards that organize their favorite content. It’s also a powerful tool for businesses and content creators to drive traffic to their websites, promote products, and engage with a large, highly targeted audience. With over 400 million active Pinterest users monthly, Pinterest has many opportunities for those looking to monetize their content and expand their online presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you make money on Pinterest?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, you can definitely make money on Pinterest and there are several ways to do this. Since Pinterest is a great tool for getting traffic, you can use this to your advantage by promoting your own products and services, selling digital downloads, or using affiliate marketing. You can even sell Pinterest management services to small businesses who need help running their Pinterest account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you get paid directly from Pinterest?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePinterest does not pay users to create content, but Pinterest does give you opportunities to monetize your presence on the platform. You can earn money via affiliate marketing, promoting your own products, and driving traffic to your website where you can then make money through ads, sales, or services. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many followers do I need on Pinterest to make money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no specific follow count needed to make money on Pinterest. Success on the Pinterest platform totally depends on the quality of your content and how well you’re engaging with the audience. A larger following can make it easier to increase your visibility on the platform, but you can also start making money with a smaller, targeted audience if your pins are optimized to resonate with that audience. I recommend that you focus on creating visually appealing pins that are relevant. With consistency and time, you’ll likely see an increase in engagement and followers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to make passive income on Pinterest?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo generate passive income on Pinterest, prioritize creating content that continues to attract traffic long after it’s published – this is known as evergreen content. For instance, a post like “How To Budget Your Money” remains relevant over time, unlike a more time-sensitive topic such as “Budgeting Trends for March 2025.” Evergreen content performs better on Pinterest because the platform is designed for long-term engagement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to make money on Pinterest without a blog?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t need a blog to make money on Pinterest. Instead, link to your affiliate links, social media, Etsy, or Shopify shop. When posting affiliate links on Pinterest, you need to clearly disclose that you are sharing an affiliate link. You can do this by saying “This post contains affiliate links” or “I may earn a commission from qualifying purchases through these links.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to make money on Pinterest with Amazon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmazon has an amazing affiliate program, and since so many people shop on Amazon already, this can be a great way to increase your income (Amazon’s affiliate program is known as Amazon Associates).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo make money on Pinterest with Amazon, you’ll want to find products that are relevant to your niche on Pinterest. This could be home decor, electronics, clothing, books, and anything else that Amazon sells. Then, you’ll create eye-catching, keyword-rich pins linking to your blog posts that contain Amazon affiliate links. When pinners click on your pin, they’ll be sent to your blog and then to Amazon, where they can make a purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Pinterest Creator Fund?

This fund started as a program launched by Pinterest to support creators by providing financial grants to help them grow their content on the platform. Pinterest has now shifted to focusing on other ways to support creators. Some people made great money with this, but it didn’t last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some tips for making great pins on Pinterest?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many ways to make great pins on Pinterest and there’s a lot of strategy involved in having success on the platform.
