  "text": "Hi all! So I’ve been working on a new project lately, and it’s officially live :) It has nothing to do with personal finance (*gasp*), but it is something that could help save you a ton of money – and grow faster! – if you run a business. It also heavily relies on AI, so if you’ve been trying to figure out the best way to harness it in this brave new world this could be the trick. Introducing…. YouBots.ai – A suite of advanced, powerful marketing tools powered by AI! My partner in crime has been obsessed with AI this past year – to the point he even changed his entire career around it! – and after watching him build out customized “bots” for companies and selling them for thousands of dollars a pop, I asked him why he doesn’t just package them all up under one roof and offer them up to *everybody*? Kinda like the world’s first AI marketing agency, but only at a fraction of the price? He paused for a few seconds leading me to believe it was massively stupid, haha, but to my surprise he eventually shot back with, “this is the best idea you’ve ever had – we need to build it.” Lol… Okay! And just like that YouBots was born :) Can’t say I ever imagined myself doing anything around AI, but it was one of those instances where it just clicked and I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t go for it. So we’ll see what happens! We already have a number of paying clients, and it’s been fun as hell working on the branding and building out the site… Just look at these cute little robots!! At any rate, if you run a business and wanna see if these bots can help YOU, check out our site and let me know what you think. It’s set up so that anyone on your team can use it without needing to know a thing about AI, prompt engineering, or even software development. Our target audience is small-medium businesses who wish they had a bigger budget for hiring (both people and marketing agencies), so we’ve priced it with that in mind and one of our clients is already saving $4,000/mo. It’s beautiful. Check it out –\u003e YouBots.ai We’re currently offering a one-week free trial, then 50% off the subscription cost while we’re in beta. No credit card required for the demo, and you can unsubscribe anytime. So that’s what I’ve been up to over here! How about you? Anyone else dabbling in AI or working on a new project? Would love to learn all about it :) Your long-time, non-AI powered, friend, PS: I should note that while AI can do big huge amazing things to make your life and work better, I don’t believe it should be a substitute for YOU. To me it’s meant for *enhancing* your work, not replacing it. PPS: If you came here today hoping for financial tips, check out my personal newsletter that just went out that features my favorite $$$ articles from around the community this month. There’s some really good ones in there, and you’ll find them in the bottom half of that page (as well as a current book I’m thoroughly enjoying).
