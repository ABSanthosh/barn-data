Best Ways To Get Free DoorDash Gift Cards Here’s a quick list before we begin: Freecash Fetch Rewards PayPal Honey  Swagbucks Branded Surveys  DoorDash referral program Ibotta MyPoints InboxDollars PrizeRebel Below are the best ways to get a free DoorDash gift card. Proof that I’ve made money playing games on Freecash. The $0.05 amounts were rewards for playing 2 minutes each day. The larger amounts like $40, $70, and $150 were for reaching certain levels. I turned my points in all for free Amazon gift cards, but you can easily redeem them for DoorDash gift cards too. 1. Freecash Freecash is a website where you can make extra money in your spare time. You can earn by doing things like playing games, trying new apps, and taking surveys. When you join Freecash, you’ll see lots of offers to choose from. Each task you finish gives you coins, which can be turned into real money or gift cards. Freecash has free DoorDash gift cards in amounts ranging from $15 to $100, and there is no fee to withdraw your points. Many people use Freecash every day to make some extra cash. You might earn $1 for a quick survey or up to $650 for trying out a new game. The amount you can make depends on the task. I have personally made $302 just by playing a game on Freecash on my phone, and it only took one week. I turned it into free gift cards and I got the gift card redemption codes instantly. Click here to sign up for Freecash. Recommended reading: Freecash Review – Is Freecash Legit? 2. Fetch Rewards Fetch Rewards is a free app that gives you gift cards for scanning your grocery receipts from any grocery store. I use this app on all of my grocery receipts (even today!), and I like how easy it is to use. You can get points from any receipt. This includes grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, and more. Just take a picture of your receipt with your phone. The app gives you at least 25 points for each receipt you scan. You can earn more points by buying specific items shown in the app (like a loaf of bread, shampoo, or fruit). You can turn your points into gift cards for places like DoorDash, Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. There are over 200 gift card options to choose from. Fetch Rewards is safe and doesn’t cost anything to use. Millions of people use it every month to save money on things they already buy. While you won’t get rich using Fetch Rewards, it’s a simple way to earn some extra gift cards. Just shop like you normally do and take a picture of your receipt when you’re done. You can sign up for Fetch Rewards by clicking here. Recommended reading: Fetch Rewards Review 3. PayPal Honey PayPal Honey is a free tool that can help you save money when you shop online. It’s a browser extension you can add to your computer in just a few clicks. Once it’s set up, it works by itself to find discount codes for you. When you’re ready to buy something, PayPal Honey searches for coupon codes. If it finds any coupons that work, it applies them to your cart. You don’t have to do anything extra – it’s all automatic! PayPal Honey works with lots of online stores. You can use it when you’re buying clothes, ordering food, or even booking a trip. You can also earn points when you shop with PayPal Honey. These points add up, and you can trade them for free DoorDash gift cards. You can learn more about Honey by clicking here. I’ve received over 100 gift cards from Swagbucks, as you can see in this screenshot. 4. Swagbucks Swagbucks is a fun way to earn free DoorDash gift cards. You can join for free and start earning points right away (these points are called SB). There are many ways to get SB. You can take surveys, watch videos, or play games. You can also shop online and earn cash back. Even searching the web can earn you points! I have personally earned over 110 free gift cards on Swagbucks over the years, so I know this is real! Once you have enough points, you can trade them for a gift card. DoorDash is one of the many gift card options. You can also get PayPal cash if you prefer. Sign up for Swagbucks here (and earn $5 in free bonus points). Recommended reading: Swagbucks Review – How Much Can You Earn On Swagbucks? 5. Branded Surveys Branded Surveys is a fun way to earn some extra cash. You can sign up for free and start taking surveys right away. It’s open to people in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom who are at least 16 years old. Each survey can pay between 50 cents and $5, depending on how long it takes. Most surveys take about 5-20 minutes to finish. You can earn points in other ways too. Answer the daily poll for 5 points, or invite friends to join. There’s even a contest where top survey takers can win bonus points. Once you have 500 points, you can cash out (that’s equal to $5). You can redeem your points for DoorDash gift cards varying from $5 to $200. Sign up for Branded Surveys here and receive a free 100-point sign-up bonus.

When you share your referral link with friends, you both win. Right now, you can give $30 to a friend and get $20 back (you’ll want to check your account to see what the current referral promotions are, as this can change). Here’s how it works: Your friend signs up using your referral link. They place their first order of $15 or more. You get $20 in DoorDash credits, and they get some credit as well. Here are the official terms: “Get $20 in credits when someone signs up using your referral link and places their first order over $15. Your friend also gets $30 off ($10 off each of their first 3 orders).” You can find your referral code/link in the DoorDash app or on their website after you log in. Here’s my referral link so that you can sign up and see (and you can also get free DoorDash credit!). 7. Ibotta Ibotta is an app that can help you get free DoorDash gift cards. It’s easy to use and gives you cash back on grocery purchases. It’s a lot like Fetch Rewards, and I personally like to use both of these grocery receipt scanning apps on the same receipts (it gives you more chances to earn points!). Here’s how Ibotta works: Before you shop, check the Ibotta app for offers (it will tell you the number of points you will get for a specific item, like a loaf of bread or a container of yogurt). Add the ones you want to your list in the app and then go shopping like normal. After you’re done, take a picture of your receipt with the app. Ibotta will match your purchases to the offers you picked and you’ll get cash back for the items that match. You can then turn the points you’ve earned into free DoorDash gift cards. You can sign up for Ibotta by clicking here. 8. MyPoints MyPoints is a rewards site that lets you earn points for different online activities. You can get these points by taking surveys, watching videos, playing games (such as Angry Birds, Wheel of Fortune, Bejeweled, and Scrabble), and shopping online. You can even earn points for trying out new products or for signing up for trial offers to companies such as Hulu, Disney+, ESPN, AT\u0026T, HelloFresh, and more. The points you collect can be traded for gift cards, including ones for DoorDash. This means you can get free food delivered to your door. MyPoints is available to people located in the United States. You can sign up for MyPoints by clicking here. 9. InboxDollars InboxDollars is a good way to earn free DoorDash gift cards, as you can make money by doing easy tasks online. These tasks include taking surveys, watching videos, reading emails, and playing games (games include Monopoly where you can earn up to $446.25, for example). You can also earn cash by shopping online and printing coupons. As you complete tasks, you earn real money and you can choose to get paid via PayPal or gift cards. Sign up for InboxDollars here and get a free $5 bonus. 10. PrizeRebel PrizeRebel is a fun way to get free DoorDash gift cards. It’s a website where you can do easy tasks to earn points, such as taking surveys, watching videos, and trying new apps. You can sign up for PrizeRebel for free. Once you’re a member, you’ll see a list of activities you can do to earn points and you can just pick the ones that look most interesting to you.

If you want a DoorDash promo code, I recommend trying an app like Freecash or Swagbucks and earning points that can be turned into a real free DoorDash gift card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow To Get a Free DoorDash Gift Card – Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you enjoyed my article on how to get a free DoorDash gift card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking to save money on food delivery services, free DoorDash gift cards can be a great way to cut costs.
