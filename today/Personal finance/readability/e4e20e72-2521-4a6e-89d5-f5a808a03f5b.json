How to Choose the Best Online Bookkeeping Service Given the vast array of options, it’s important to determine your needs before attempting to select the best bookkeeping app. So consider these questions as you review the available options: How many billable clients or customers does my business have, and how many total invoices do I generate each month? What is my monthly bookkeeping budget? Is a cloud-based bookkeeping app the best option for me, or am I more comfortable with a downloadable option? Does my business require other applications or integrations, such as customer relationship management, payroll, scheduling, e-commerce, inventory management, or time tracking? Do I need invoicing options in more than one currency? Do I need an app that accepts payment by check, PayPal, Stripe, Venmo, direct deposit, and credit card? How many users — including my employees and third parties like my tax professional — need access to the software? Do I need customizable templates to include my company header, or is a preset template okay? How comfortable am I with accounting and bookkeeping terminology? What other features do I require in an online bookkeeping app? When reviewing bookkeeping and accounting apps for your business, note those that most closely meet your requirements.  If you can’t find the perfect invoicing or accounting package, look for one with add-on options, such as easy integration with other applications or the option to increase the number of users for an additional charge. Also, take into consideration your comfort with accounting. Some bookkeeping and accounting apps require familiarity with accounting and bookkeeping terminology, whereas others do not. Our Methodology Here are the areas we focused on to determine the best online bookkeeping platforms for your small business: Features: We honed in on features like invoicing, expense tracking, payroll processing, and financial reporting and prioritized platforms that offer these services. User experience: Ease of use is crucial. We tested each platform’s interface for intuitiveness and accessibility.  Customer Support: We examined the availability and responsiveness of support teams through chat, email, and phone, favoring companies with accessible support. Integration: Integration with other tools like project management software and CRM systems can boost efficiency. We looked at the range and ease of integrations each service offered, favoring those with seamless connections. Pricing: Cost matters. We compared different pricing tiers and the features they offered. Transparent pricing models with no hidden fees scored better in our review. Final Word Life is a lot easier for small-business owners who use cloud-based accounting software. You don’t have to buy expensive software, download it to your computer, and purchase expensive upgrades. Whether you’re a freelancer or a small-business owner with several employees, you can find anything from basic invoicing to more complex accounting platforms that integrate with other apps you use in your business. Remember, technology and software change quickly, especially cloud-based software, so be sure to visit the vendor sites directly to get the most current feature and pricing information before choosing the best one for your business. And don’t feel overwhelmed by the choices. Decide what features you absolutely must have, identify your budget, and spend some time researching your options. *Free month of full-service bookkeeping for new clients only.
