While it is a worthwhile goal that will pour many benefits into your life, it should not be a goal that drains your wallet.Here are the top four money mistakes you need to stop making while trying to get in shape.1. Stop Looking for the Next Magic PillSeveral of my friends have had great success with a popular wrap company and another MLM company that sells shakes. Look, I think these companies have worked for many and have earned many individuals amazing incomes. However, you cannot just buy a product and expect to reach your goals. I bought products from both companies, and the weight did not magically fall off. Why? Because I was using them as a magic pill rather than overhauling my whole diet and exercise routine.If you are not willing to put in the work to eat better and exercise now, then why would you think paying an extra $100 for fitness products would help? 2. Ditch the Expensive GymHow often do you really go to your gym? If you use it enough to justify the cost of membership, then the cost is worth it. However, if you are just going to use the treadmill a few times a week, then why not shop around for a cheaper gym? You need to get real with yourself at how often you use the gym and if you use your gym to gain the maximum benefits. If you love your gym’s workout classes and are there more than four days a week, then by all means, keep your membership. It is obviously working for you. Otherwise, skip the expense!3. Ditch the Trendy Healthy FoodYou can get healthy and lose weight eating inexpensive staples, such as organic oats or hard boiled free-range eggs. You do not need overpriced coconut water, fancy kombucha drinks, or specialized protein powders or bars to reach your goal. Many times these products can hinder your results too, since many people would rather grab a protein bar that tastes like a candy bar than to eat a bowl full of kale.4. You Don’t Need Recovery Drinks and GelsMost people who work out don’t need specialized recovery drinks or gels. The body is able to recover with just water and a healthy meal, even after a hard workout. The people that need these specialized products are professional athletes and individuals who continually stress their bodies for several hours every day (such as a fitness instructor).Even if you do need a specialty recovery drink, you can make your own inexpensively. Look up recipes to find the best sugar to salt ratio to make your own recovery drink. Even Cardinals football player, Tyrann Mathieu, drinks plain Pedialyte to recharge after hours of training instead of using expensive name-brand sports drinks.Getting healthy and staying healthy are both notable goals, but stop fooling yourself into spending more money to get the results you desire. Eating healthy and exercising can be very inexpensive if you stick with the basics.How do you save money when trying to get or stay in shape? Tagged as: Better Yourself, Lifestyle, Money Tips",
