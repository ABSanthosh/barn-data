FlexJobs promises to connect remote job seekers with verified, scam-free job listings. But is it worth paying for? After all, there are plenty of free job boards out there that ostensibly offer the same thing. And with workplace burnout on the rise, more people than ever are looking for legit remote work opportunities. In this article, we’ll share how FlexJobs stacks up against the job board competition and whether it’s worth the cost.  Side Hustle Nation Approved FlexJobs: #1 For Remote Jobs 4.7 The best place to find legit work from home jobs. Established in 2007, FlexJobs has 1000s of listings including part-time, full-time, and freelance options in tons of industries. Yes, FlexJobs is a legit place to find a work from home job.  The company was established in 2007, and in 2024 was acquired by BOLD, a well-established career company. According to FlexJobs, they’ve helped over 11 million job seekers connect with over 57,000 jobs from over 60,000 employers. How FlexJobs Works FlexJobs makes it easy to find legit, remote jobs. Here’s how it works. Search and Apply FlexJobs has a user-friendly interface, and more than 50 industry categories. For example, you can find work-from-home jobs in: accounting admin fashion graphic design project management sales and tons more You can search for jobs based on factors like: job category desired flexibility experience level Each job listing tells you about the company, the required qualifications, and how to apply. Since the jobs are screened, you can apply with confidence, knowing that there’s a real opportunity behind each listing. What Kind of Jobs Can You Find on FlexJobs? On FlexJobs, you can really find a wide range of job types covering just about every industry you can think of. The common thread among all these jobs is flexibility. Here’s a closer look at what you might find. Remote Jobs Freelance Opportunities Part-Time Positions Temporary or Contract Jobs Alternative Schedule Jobs To cater to different needs, FlexJobs offers various employment types, including part-time, full-time, and freelance. Part-Time Jobs These are ideal if you’re looking for less than 40 hours of work per week. They offer flexibility to balance work with other commitments like studies or family. Part-time positions often come with flexible hours, making them attractive for those who need flexible schedules. Full-Time Jobs Full-time jobs provide stability for those wanting more traditional employment. They often come with benefits like health insurance, paid time off, and retirement plans. These roles usually require 40 hours per week but may also offer flexible start and end times. Freelance Opportunities Freelance jobs are project-based and allow you to work as an independent contractor. This type of work is highly flexible, letting you choose when and where you work. Freelancers might juggle multiple clients or projects at once and have the freedom to build a portfolio of diverse work. How Do They “Vet” the Remote Jobs? FlexJobs takes the vetting of job listings seriously, which is a huge plus for anyone tired of running into scams or dead-end leads. Here’s how they go about making sure the jobs they list are legit: 1. Human Screening Unlike job boards that rely on automation, FlexJobs has a team of real people who manually review every job listing for the site. This team checks out the company posting the job and makes sure the company and job are legit. 2. Research on Companies \u0026 Jobs The vetting process includes in-depth research on each company and their job postings. They check into the company’s history, its online presence, and reviews from employees to ensure it’s a solid, reliable place to work. 3. Ongoing Monitoring FlexJobs doesn’t just post a job and forget about it. They continuously monitor their job listings and the companies on their site. If they receive negative feedback about a job or employer, they will decide if that job should stay on the site. How Much Does FlexJobs Cost? Unlike other job boards, FlexJobs charges a nominal fee to see details about each posting and apply. Thankfully, these plans start at just $2.95 for 14-day access. Here’s the breakdown of their pricing: 14-Day Full Access: For $2.95, you can get full access to test out the platform. Annual Subscription: At $71.40 for the year, this is the best deal in terms of cost per month ($5.95).  While you can definitely find a remote job for free, these rates make it a very reasonable investment in your future earning power.  Set Up Your Profile Once you’re signed up, you can set up your profile. This involves: uploading your resume detailing your skills specifying types of job(s) you’re looking for You can be as detailed as you want with the flexibility you need, such as telecommuting, alternative schedules, or freelance gigs. Are There Any FlexJobs Discounts Available? FlexJobs currently offers a 50% discount for military, first responders, and teachers. Here’s a screenshot from their website: Is FlexJobs Worth It? If you’re committed to finding a flexible or remote job and value your time and security, FlexJobs can be worth it. It’s especially useful if you’re looking for a niche role or you want to avoid the clutter of free job boards. Instead of scouring dozens of different sites, you can find an aggregated, curated selection of jobs in one place.  Let’s break it down. Curated, Scam-Free Listings One of FlexJobs’s biggest perks is that every job listing is hand-screened for legitimacy. This saves you the hassle and worry of sifting through potentially dubious job offers, which unfortunately is common on free sites. Variety and Quality of Jobs FlexJobs covers many areas, from entry-level to executive positions at reputable companies like: Walmart Pinterest Honeywell Stubhub and more This is a big plus if you’re aiming for quality over quantity and don’t want to wade through less relevant jobs. Resources and Support The membership also gives you access to career coaching and resume reviews at discounted rates. They also offer free skills tests and webinars that will help you better position yourself in the job market. These resources are handy, especially if you’re new to the remote or flexible work scene. Who is FlexJobs the Best Fit For? FlexJobs has many success stories from users who have found jobs that match their needs. Here are a few highlights from user testimonials. 1.

Subscription Fee The most frequent complaint is about the subscription fee required to access job listings.

Communication Issues There have been complaints about customer service and their response times.
