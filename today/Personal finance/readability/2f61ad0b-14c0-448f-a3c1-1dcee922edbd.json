Apply Now Why Banks Offer Sign-Up Bonuses You probably wonder why banks offer sign-up bonuses. Why would they give away ‘free money’? The answer is simple – marketing. Think about which bank account you’d be more willing to open: one with no sign-up bonus or one that pays you a couple hundred dollars to open and maintain. Banks use sign-up bonuses as a marketing tool to get more customers. They figure that by offering the bonuses, they’ll get your business for the new account, plus you might use their other banking services, making the bank even more money. How to Qualify for a Bank Bonus Each bank has different requirements to qualify for a bank bonus. The key is to read the fine print to understand how to qualify. Most banks require more than simply opening an account. For example, they may require a certain number of transactions or a minimum direct deposit. Be sure you can meet the requirements before choosing a bank bonus, paying close attention to the dates that coincide with the bonus. For example, if a bank requires a minimum balance to earn the bonus, they usually specify how long you must keep the balance in the account either by the number of days or a specific date. How Bank Bonuses Are Taxed Bank bonuses, unlike credit card bonuses, are taxed. Just like you’d pay tax on interest earned on your bank account, you’ll pay interest on any bank bonuses, as the IRS considers it interest earned. Don’t worry about remembering to claim the bank bonus. If you earn a bank bonus, the bank will send you a 1099-INT with the bonus included on the statement so you don’t forget to claim it on your taxes. How Many Bank Accounts Should You Have? You can have as many bank accounts as you want, but ideally, you should at least have a checking and savings account. The savings account should hold the funds meant for an emergency fund or other financial goals. If you can manage the accounts and find accounts that won’t cost you a monthly maintenance fee, you can have even more accounts. Keeping a separate emergency fund, for example, is usually suggested because it eliminates the risk of spending the money on another goal, leaving nothing for those unprecedented emergencies. However, don’t open more bank accounts than you can manage or have bank accounts that cost you monthly maintenance fees because you have your money spread out amongst the accounts and can’t meet the minimum balance requirements to waive the monthly maintenance fees. Are Bank Bonuses Worth It? Bank bonuses are always worth it as long as you don’t open accounts that will cost you a monthly maintenance fee. Just ensure you can meet the requirements to meet the bank promotion and waive the monthly fee.  Final Word Take your pick of these bank promotions. You’ve earned them. But don’t let bank account bonuses have the last word on where you choose to bank. When choosing a bank, it’s important to find one that suits your needs – whether that’s favorable interest-bearing accounts, low or no fees, overdraft protection, access to potentially lucrative cash-back credit cards, or mobile-friendly online banking features. Bank account promotions for new customers are wonderful, but taking advantage of permanent perks is a long-lasting bonus in its own right. You deserve a bank that’s willing to work every day to earn your business. Editorial Disclosure: This content is not provided or commissioned by the bank advertiser.

They figure that by offering the bonuses, they’ll get your business for the new account, plus you might use their other banking services, making the bank even more money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Qualify for a Bank Bonus\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach bank has different requirements to qualify for a bank bonus. The key is to read the fine print to understand how to qualify. Most banks require more than simply opening an account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, they may require a certain number of transactions or a minimum direct deposit. Be sure you can meet the requirements before choosing a bank bonus, paying close attention to the dates that coincide with the bonus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if a bank requires a minimum balance to earn the bonus, they usually specify how long you must keep the balance in the account either by the number of days or a specific date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Bank Bonuses Are Taxed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBank bonuses, unlike credit card bonuses, are taxed. Just like you’d pay tax on interest earned on your bank account, you’ll pay interest on any bank bonuses, as the IRS considers it interest earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t worry about remembering to claim the bank bonus. If you earn a bank bonus, the bank will send you a 1099-INT with the bonus included on the statement so you don’t forget to claim it on your taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Many Bank Accounts Should You Have?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can have as many bank accounts as you want, but ideally, you should at least have a checking and savings account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe savings account should hold the funds meant for an emergency fund or other financial goals. If you can manage the accounts and find accounts that won’t cost you a monthly maintenance fee, you can have even more accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping a separate emergency fund, for example, is usually suggested because it eliminates the risk of spending the money on another goal, leaving nothing for those unprecedented emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, don’t open more bank accounts than you can manage or have bank accounts that cost you monthly maintenance fees because you have your money spread out amongst the accounts and can’t meet the minimum balance requirements to waive the monthly maintenance fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAre Bank Bonuses Worth It?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBank bonuses are always worth it as long as you don’t open accounts that will cost you a monthly maintenance fee. Just ensure you can meet the requirements to meet the bank promotion and waive the monthly fee. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFinal Word\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake your pick of these bank promotions.
