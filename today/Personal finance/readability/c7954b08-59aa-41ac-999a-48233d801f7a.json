This money-saving trick helps you cut out unimportant spending for a set amount of time (could be one week, one month, or even longer – you choose!). By not buying things you don’t need, you can save more money and reset your spending habits. During a no spend challenge, you only buy what you really need. This can be food, bills, and/or other must-haves. You may skip things like new clothes, eating out, or shopping for fun. The goal is to save money and learn about your spending habits. I’ve had friends do no spend challenges in different ways such as: No new clothing for a year – They wore what they already had and bought NOTHING. I actually have a few friends who have done this and they all really liked it! No takeout or restaurants for a month – They cooked all their meals at home and saved hundreds. No Amazon or online shopping for three months – They avoided impulse purchases and realized how often they bought things they didn’t really need. Grocery budget freeze – They challenged themselves to only eat what was already in their pantry (like all of their canned goods and pantry staples) and freezer for a set time. No in-person shopping – I have a friend who only does grocery store pickup so that they are not tempted by walking around in the aisles of a store. A No Spend Challenge Can Reset Your Finances – Here’s How To Do It If you’re curious about trying one, here’s how a no spend challenge can work for you! What is a no spend challenge? A no spend challenge is a fun way to save money. You pick a time, like a week or a month, and try not to buy anything extra. It’s like a game where you only spend on things you really need. During the challenge, you can buy necessities. These are things you must have, such as: Rent or mortgage Groceries Gas for your car Medicine But you avoid spending money on things you don’t need like: Eating at restaurants New clothes Movie tickets Coffee shop visits All the extras you throw in your cart at Target The goal is to cut out these extra costs. This helps you save money and see where your money usually goes. It can be eye-opening to realize how much you spend on things you don’t truly need. Remember, it’s okay to adjust the no spend rules to fit your life (it’s a contest with yourself, after all!). The main idea is to spend less and save more. Benefits of a no spend challenge I like doing no spend challenges because they can help you save money by not buying things that you don’t actually need. Plus, you really learn a lot about how you spend your money. The challenge makes you look closely at what you buy, and you might spot bad habits you didn’t know you had. Many people, including myself, spend more money than they need to because of impulse buys. This is when you buy things because you’re on a shopping trip (such as at Target or Walmart, when you buy things not on your list), because you’re in a mood where you think spending will make it better, and more. But, when you’re not spending, you get used to not wanting to shop. I find that when I’m doing a no spend challenge, I continue to spend a lot less well into the future because I find that I just don’t need to spend money. Instead, you’ll use up stuff you already own or you’ll find happiness in doing things where you aren’t spending money. P.S. If you’re looking for a helpful no-spend challenge book to read even more on this topic, I highly recommend The No-Spend Challenge Guide by my friend Jen Smith. You may be able to find it at your local library too! Are there any negatives of doing a no spend challenge? Okay, so I know some people will say, “No spend challenges don’t work! You’ll just spend the money once the challenge is over!” And honestly, that can happen. A no spend challenge isn’t a magic fix for bad spending habits. It’s a tool to help you reset. But like any tool, it has its pros and cons. Sure, some people may just purchase the item that they wanted to buy right when the challenge is over. But, at least they thought about it and realized that they still wanted it. How to prepare for a no spend challenge Here’s how you can get started: Pick your challenge length. You can start small with a weekend or go big with a whole month (or even a whole YEAR!). Choose what feels right for you. Set clear goals. Decide which expenses you’ll cut out and write these down to stay focused. And that’s pretty much it. It doesn’t have to be hard to get started. There are also some ways to make it easier such as: Tell your friends and family about your challenge. They can cheer you on and maybe even join you. Delete shopping apps from your phone because this makes it harder to buy stuff. Unsubscribe from store emails so that there are no more tempting sales in your inbox! Plan your meals ahead and use what’s already in your kitchen. When you want to buy something, wait 24 hours. You might change your mind (I find that most people do!). If you slip up, don’t give up, and just start again the next day.

You can customize them to fit your lifestyle and goals! No new clothing for a year – Wear what you already own, mix and match outfits, don’t go to the store to just window shop, and find ways to get free clothes like on Buy Nothing groups. No takeout or restaurants for a month – Cook all your meals at home and see how long you can go. I find that if I eat out, I just continue to eat out more and more. But, if I go a few weeks without eating out, I simply just won’t even think about it, or try for much longer! No online shopping for three months – Don’t even try to look at online stores like Amazon, Target, or anywhere else to prevent impulse shopping. Pantry and freezer challenge – Only eat what you already have in your kitchen instead of grocery shopping. You may set rules for yourself though. For example, maybe you still want to be able to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. No new home decor or furniture for a year – If you buy a lot of home stuff, then this is a great one to focus on as it can help you declutter fast! Maybe try rearranging stuff instead of buying. Cash-only challenge for a month – Stop using credit cards and use cash for everything to make spending feel more intentional. No entertainment spending for a month – Find free ways to have fun, like hiking, reading, or visiting your local library. No coffee shop purchases for a month – Brew your own coffee at home. No salon visits for one year – Cut or color your own hair, or just go without. No spending on kids’ toys for three months – Rotate toys they already have, swap with friends, or focus on free activities instead. If you’re anything like the average family with kids, then you probably already have more than enough! I’d love to hear your ideas for a no spend challenge. Please share in the comments below!

A No Spend Challenge Can Reset Your Finances – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on how a no spend challenge can reset your finances. Personally, I love doing no spend challenges because they help me break out of bad spending habits and remind me of what truly matters. Sometimes, I catch myself spending out of convenience or boredom rather than buying things that I actually need, and these challenges help me pause and reset. I also love how they push me to use what I already have, whether that’s food in my pantry, clothes in my closet, or hobbies I’ve neglected. After a no spend challenge, I usually realize that I don’t even want to go back to certain spending habits because I didn’t miss them at all. It’s a great way to feel more in control of my money, and I always walk away with a fresh perspective on what I really value. Have you ever done a no spend challenge? How did it go?
