The deals have started. Today, I have created a Black Friday and Cyber Monday roundup of the best deals I have found. The deals below will help you grow your website, make money blogging, add legal templates to your blog, work from home, and more. The resources included here are all my favorites! Note: Most of the deals below end on Monday night, December 2nd at 11:59 pm. Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing – 20% off! Want to learn how I’ve made over $1,000,000 from affiliate income on my blog? There are over 10,000 students in my course, with great results! Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing is a step-by-step guide to creating and making money from your own successful affiliate marketing strategy. This course explains all of the ins and outs, so you are never left wondering where to go next when creating and implementing your affiliate marketing strategy. Here’s a testimonial I’ve received: “I took Michelle’s course at the very beginning of my blogging journey when I knew NOTHING about affiliate marketing. I had no idea how to find affiliate programs, create deep links, cloak links or how to strategically add links to posts and newsletters. Michelle’s course answered all these questions with easy to digest lessons, worksheets, spreadsheets and a workbook. I had my affiliate marketing up-and-running in no time, and five years later, I make about $8,000-$9,000 per month with affiliate marketing. Her course was incredibly helpful and instrumental to me.” – Kristin Hanes, The Wayward Home You can use coupon code BF20SALE or simply click here to take advantage of this deal on the full payment.

This deal is only valid Wednesday, November 27th. Become a Proofreader – 70% off Proofreading is the process of reviewing and checking a written document to find and correct errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting. Proofreading is an in-demand job where you only need a laptop or tablet, an internet connection, and the skills to get started. Learning how to proofread is a valuable skill that can open doors to a successful work-from-home career. Due to the increasing demand for online content, now is a great time to learn how to proofread. This is a great price for this course, too. This course is normally $797 and today it is only $239.10. If you want to become a proofreader, do not miss this! Starting today and through Monday December 2nd, 2024, you can get 70% off General Proofreading. Please click here to get 70% off.

If you’ve been wanting to work from home and want to earn $40,000+ each year, bookkeeping may be perfect for you. From today through Monday, December 2nd, the Black Friday deal on this virtual bookkeeping course is that you can enroll for 60% off all versions and payment options of Bookkeeper Launch. Just use promo code: gobble60. You can learn more by clicking here. DepositPhotos – Get 100 photos for $49 I just bought this deal and I do every year. DepositPhotos is an affordable place to purchase photos. Putting pictures in your blog posts is important. They can help explain your story, break up text to make a blog post easier to read, and you need them for social media too (such as Facebook and Pinterest). This is one of the most popular Black Friday deals for bloggers each year, so don’t miss out! You can click here to check out this deal. Tip for shopping this holiday season: There are a few other ways to save this holiday season by using easy cell phone apps! Don’t forget to: Scan your grocery receipts with Fetch Rewards. Fetch Rewards is a cash back and gift card cell phone app that rewards you for purchases that you’ve already made. With Fetch Rewards, you can earn points by submitting your receipts to the Fetch Rewards app from any grocery store. Yes, ANY! You can sign up for Fetch Rewards here. Shop with Rakuten and get cash back at online retailers. All you do is click on a store that you want to shop through (they have tons of stores such as Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Kohls, REI, etc.) and shop just like how you normally would shop online and get cash back. Plus, when you sign up through my link and make a qualifying purchase, you receive a free $40 cash sign-up bonus. Get cash back at gas stations with Upside. I have this app and it is very easy to use. Upside is a phone app that helps you find gas stations, groceries, and restaurants where you can earn cash back. You simply sign up for a free account, and then look at the Upside app to find places near you. You can earn up to $0.25/gallon cash back at gas stations, up to 30% back on grocery purchases, and up to 45% back at restaurants. You can check out Upside here to learn more. I use all three of these apps and recommend them if you are looking for easy ways to save money right now. Also, I recommend reading How To Save Money During The Holidays (20+ Ways To Save \u0026 Make Money!) if you are looking for ways to save money this holiday season. I hope you enjoyed this list of deals and found something you can use. Enjoy! -Michelle",
