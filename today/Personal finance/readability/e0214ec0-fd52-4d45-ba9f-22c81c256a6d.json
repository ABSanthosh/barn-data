  "text": "Frequent travelers often have adventurous stories rooted in the uncertainty and excitement that comes with stepping away from day-to-day life and into a new or challenging environment. Personally, nothing gives me the travel bug more than learning about a new place through the experiences of someone else. And great travel stories curated by the right host can make for a great podcast. Here are my favorite travel podcasts for 2025.Before we begin, we'll note that NerdWallet has its own weekly travel podcast, Smart Travel. Episodes cover topics like budgeting for trips, getting elite perks the easy way and avoiding costly travel mistakes. In general, to avoid conflicts of interest, NerdWallet does not rate or review its own products, nor do we consider them for roundups of the \"best\" offerings, so we are not including it in this list. But if you're interested, you can listen to Smart Travel here. Armchair ExplorerOur pick for: Adventure travel enthusiastsIf any podcast is equivalent to a page-turner book, Armchair Explorer is it. The enthusiastic and immersive storytelling about adventure travel through remote locations of the world is captivating, making Armchair Explorer my favorite podcast, not just my favorite travel podcast. Almost every episode leaves me feeling inspired to venture outside of my comfort zone. There are over 100 episodes and many are recorded on-location, giving the podcast a real sense of authenticity. My favorites include stories about kayaking the entire Amazon River and traversing the Siberian plateau with native reindeer herders.The Lost GeographerOur pick for: Lifetime learnersDo you know why Singapore is a city-state? Or why the European Union has headquarters in Belgium? I didn’t until I started listening to The Lost Geographer. I love learning, and I learn something new every time I listen to this show. With the goal of making people “geographically and culturally literate,” each episode focuses on a different country or location. If you’re looking for a deeper historical understanding of why a particular place or culture is the way that it is, The Lost Geographer probably has the answer.  Travel with Rick StevesOur pick for: How to travel like a localRick Steves has been a cornerstone of the travel media industry for decades, having authored several popular guidebooks while encouraging travelers to become “temporary locals” wherever they visit. His podcast and radio show Travel with Rick Steves includes a weekly one-hour conversation about all things travel. While he talks about attractions in major cities, he also covers destinations off the beaten path. I find it nearly impossible to listen to him and not get excited to travel somewhere new. All the Hacks with Chris HutchinsOur pick for: Travel and financial optimizersWhile not exclusively a travel podcast, All the Hacks is my go-to for learning ways to get more for less. Whether you’re trying to optimize the value of your travel rewards or looking for (legal) ways to pay less in taxes, this show walks you through creative tactics for living a five-star life on a three-star budget. Zero to TravelOur pick for: Practical travel adviceZero to Travel is a great source for actionable, engaging and practical advice for people who want to build their life around travel. I enjoy the style of the show’s interviews, which cover a variety of topics, such as starting a location-independent business, maximizing miles and points, and exploring specific destinations and cultures. How to maximize your rewards",
