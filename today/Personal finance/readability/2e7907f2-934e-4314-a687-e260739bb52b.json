How to Find Cheaper Flights1. For weddings, groups, or complicated itineraries, use a travel agentYou should consult with a travel agent even if it’s for a family, high school, or college reunion. You miss out on a lot of money-saving opportunities if you choose to do it yourself online. Travel agents have access to special group rates with different travel suppliers, and they can usually negotiate a better deal on your behalf.2. Experiment with alternative airportsEvery situation is different, but you’d be surprised by the money you could save simply by flying out of a nearby airport. For example, here in Toronto, we’ve found that it’s sometimes worth it to book flights from Buffalo and make the short drive down.3. Be flexible with your datesJust checking the “flexible dates” box on any travel website will show you the savings you could get if you travel a couple of days earlier or later. You never know what you might find — it could be well worth it!4. Plan aheadMany people fall into the trap of waiting until the last minute to book their travel, thinking they’ll get a better deal. This is a myth. While this might have been true 6 or 7 years ago, current trends show that prices rise the longer you wait, as seats become scarce.5. Always ask for a better rateSay you’re already at a hotel or car rental company, and you want to extend your stay or add on a car rental. When you’re at the reservation desk and given a certain rate, ask for a better one. Many hotels and car rental companies won’t tell you about the better rate unless you ask. Surprising, but true!6. Try adding in layoversWhen doing your research, decide if it’s worth it to you to pick a less convenient flight for a better price.7. Use local agencies (either online or in person)If you’re already at your destination and have a change of plans, visit a website or agency that’s local to where you are. Local travel agencies sometimes have access to better consolidated rates for departures from their country.8. Consider the extras Account for all the extra costs when booking a specific ticket, as the cheapest option isn’t always the cheapest for you. For example, if you know that you need to travel with excess luggage, or that you might need to change your return date later, booking the cheapest tickets with less flexible rules wouldn’t be the best option. Going for the more expensive option could actually be a better deal once you pay for excess baggage and change fees.9. Carry it onIf you can skip heavy baggage, do so. Most airlines charge for baggage, and extra if it’s overweight. If you can get all you need into a carry on, you’ll save a lot on the fees associated with checked luggage.Flying doesn’t have to mean breaking the bank.
