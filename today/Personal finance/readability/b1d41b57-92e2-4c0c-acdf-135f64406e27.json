  "text": "The financial principles from The Richest Man in Babylon, by George Samuel Clason, might be nearly 100 years old, but they’ve stood the test of time. These lessons on consistent saving, smart investing, and building wealth still hold up in today’s complex financial market.In this article, I’ll break down these timeless principles and show you how to apply them to modern-day money challenges. The Richest Man in Babylon Rules (7 Cures For a Lean Purse) The Richest Man in Babylon breaks down wealth building into seven fundamental rules (the book calls “cures for a lean purse”). While they might sound ancient, these principles have quietly built more millionaires than any get-rich-quick scheme or crypto investment ever will.Think of these “cures” as your step-by-step guide to moving from living paycheck to paycheck into financial freedom. Let’s explore each step and dive deeper on how to apply them today. 1. Start thy purse to fattening When I first read The Richest Man in Babylon, this principle hit me hard—not because it was complex but because it was fundamental. Yet, so many people get it wrong. Most people try to save what’s left at the end of the month, and that approach fails every time.Let me show you the core principles that actually work:Build your emergency fund: This is your first step toward financial stability. Having savings means you’re better prepared for unexpected expenses, which reduces the chance of falling into debt. Aim to have around 3-6 months of your monthly expenses saved up.Pay yourself first: The core lesson here is to consistently save a portion of your income—at least 10%. This strategy helps build a habit of saving that becomes the foundation for future wealth.Automate your finances: Use automated transfers or savings apps to ensure that a portion of every paycheck is directed to your savings before you see it.Saving while managing debt: Even if you’re paying off debts, continue setting aside savings. This dual approach ensures you’re building a financial cushion while reducing liabilities.Start small if you need to. Even saving $50 per month creates momentum. The key is consistency and automation. Set up your first automated transfer today, then gradually increase it as you get comfortable. Soon, you’ll have your first $1,000 saved, then your first month of expenses, then three months. That’s when you’ll feel the power of this principle. Build a Conscious Spending Plan (CSP) My Conscious Spending Plan (CSP) gives you the exact framework to make this work. This isn’t another restrictive budget making you feel guilty about buying lattes. Instead, it helps you:Automatically handle all your fixed costs, such as rent, utilities, and insurance, each month, ensuring your essential expenses are always covered without stress.Build wealth steadily through systematic, automated transfers that happen before you even see the money in your account.Spend money freely on the things that bring you joy, knowing you’ve already handled your core financial responsibilities.Cut costs ruthlessly on things that don’t enhance your life, redirecting that money toward what truly matters to you.The CSP takes these timeless principles and updates them for today’s world. You don’t need complicated spreadsheets. You need automation and systems that work while you sleep. 2. Control thy expenditures Most people think controlling expenses means cutting back on everything. They’re wrong. It’s about being intentional with your spending and creating systems that work. I see way too many people earning six figures still living paycheck to paycheck because they never learned this principle.Here’s what works:Avoid lifestyle inflation: As income rises, so do expenses—unless you consciously control them. Living within your means helps keep savings on track.Budgeting tools for modern times: Apps, like You Need a Budget (YNAB) can help you track spending and ensure you’re not overspending on what Clason would call “unnecessary expenses.”Distinguishing needs vs. wants: Clason’s advice rings true today: in your spending habits, identify what is essential and simply a “nice-to-have.”Align spending with values: Splurge on what you love but cut costs mercilessly on things that don’t matter to you.This principle matters more than ever in today’s one-click purchases and subscription services. Take 10 minutes right now to review your spending from last month. I guarantee you’ll find at least three recurring charges you forgot or didn’t need. This isn’t about deprivation; it’s about spending consciously on what matters to you. Real-life couple who ignored Rule 2: “control thy expenditures” Alex and Courtney’s financial story shows how quickly things can shift from stability to strain. Once debt-free and saving, they soon became overwhelmed by rising expenses and life changes. Despite owning valuable assets, they were stuck stressing over daily costs. Their experience ties back to the lessons in The Richest Man in Babylon—where managing money consistently and controlling spending is key to staying ahead, no matter the circumstances. Alex: [00:10:28] I feel the same way I’ve felt for the last five years, always in fear, and I feel like I’m behind the ball in comparison to my peers. Money’s always been a big stressor, four years or so. We were doing really well. We were in a place that the rent was cheap. We didn’t have a child. We were both working and making decent money and saving money. I paid off my car and my motorcycle and I was debt free and I had more money in the bank than I had ever had. It wasn’t a lot, but it was more than I had ever had–Ramit Sethi: [00:11:07] And before you go on, what did that feel like at that moment?Alex: [00:11:11] It felt great. However, my fear with money never changed.Ramit Sethi: [00:11:17] Did you think that once you were debt free that your relationship with it would change magically?Alex: [00:11:23] No, because knowing how I function, especially with money, I was just super driven to accumulate wealth, so to speak, and I was like, “I’m debt free. Okay, cool. Now I need 20 grand in the bank. Okay, cool. Now I need 50 grand.”Ramit Sethi: [00:11:45] When did things start to change financially?Alex: [00:11:50] I would say over the last year. Ramit Sethi: [00:11:50] What happened?Alex: [00:11:59] The last couple of years. We had a kid, we were earning less. We had moved before, our rent was more. It was about eight or $900 more than we were paying at our original place, our one-bedroom. And I feel like for the last year, we’ve been chipping away. We got married in October, and that cost quite a bit of money.Ramit Sethi: [00:12:30] How much?Alex: [00:12:33] Well, I’m not sure, but I would say if I count the ring and I count the bachelorette party and the bachelor party, I’m thinking probably out of our pocket, 15 grand. Alex and Courtney’s financial journey reflects the ups and downs many couples face when managing money. In their case, everything seemed fine when they were both working, living in a cheaper place, and saving steadily. Alex had even paid off his debt, feeling good about having more money in the bank. Despite being debt-free at one point, Alex’s fear of not having enough money never truly went away. As they welcomed a child, took on more expensive rent, and got married, their financial situation shifted. Ramit Sethi: [00:49:43] Well, that’s okay. Let’s break it down. No need to feel nervous. We’re going to take it step by step. So let’s start off with how much you think you have in savings.Courtney: [00:49:52] In savings. Okay. So I took a quick peek at it. It said $10,000.Ramit Sethi: [00:49:56] How about investments?Courtney: [00:50:00] Let’s see. My Roth has $13,000 the last time I checked. And then Maggie’s fund has, I don’t know, probably like $1,200 or something right now. The stocks have been dropping.Ramit Sethi: [00:50:11] Okay. How about your assets? How much would those be worth?Courtney: [00:50:14] Like Alex’s cars or motorcycles and stuff?Ramit Sethi: [00:50:21] YeahCourtney: [00:50:21] Well, this is going to be a ballpark, let’s just say $108,000.Ramit Sethi: [00:50:24] Okay. Anything else? You have a car or anything like that you want to add in there?Courtney: [00:50:32] Oh, I didn’t think about the Lexus. I have no clue how much that’s worth. $35,000.Ramit Sethi: [00:50:40] Let’s say $30,000 just to keep it even. And how about how much debt do you owe?Courtney: [00:50:46] Okay, so it’s $107,000 on my loan and then the car is, I think, at $22,000. So 1,2,7,8,9. 129, so let’s say $130,000.Ramit Sethi: [00:50:59] Courtney, how do you feel about that?Courtney: [00:51:03] I don’t know. The assets are trying to just like whatever like that’s going to change depending on what the market is. So that’s cool. But if nobody’s buying motorcycles, then that’s worth dog shit.Ramit Sethi: [00:51:17] That’s $45,000 worth of assets. That’s money in the bank. Now, we would need to sell it, we might incur some transaction fees, etc. But that’s not anything. And it’s not aaah and in fact, I don’t want you to use that aaah, word anymore because we don’t use that when we talk about money. We’re going to get more precise with our language.You have $45,000 worth of assets. The fact that the two of you are arguing over groceries, does not make sense when you have $45,000 worth of assets. Would you agree? This brings us back to the timeless lessons in The Richest Man in Babylon. As Clason teaches, accumulating wealth isn’t just about paying off debt or earning more—it’s about controlling expenditures and creating a system where your money works for you, not the other way around. Alex and Courtney’s story highlights the importance of addressing financial habits early and keeping them in check as life changes. 3. Make thy gold multiply Too many people think investing means picking hot stocks or timing the market. They watch CNBC and think they need to make daily trades to get rich. After years in personal finance, I can tell you the best investors are usually the most boring ones.Invest wisely to grow your wealth: Saving money in a regular bank account will make your money worth less over time due to inflation. When you invest, you buy pieces of companies through stocks or lend money to governments and corporations through bonds. Both of these methods can grow your wealth substantially over time.The power of compound interest: Compound interest works like a snowball rolling downhill. If you invest $100 and it grows 10% to $110, the following year you earn interest on $110 instead of your original $100. Over decades, this effect can turn small regular investments into substantial wealth. Starting early gives you an enormous advantage because time makes compound interest more powerful.Diversify your investments: Smart investors never put all their money in one place. Spreading your money across thousands of companies through index funds protects you from losing everything if one investment fails. Modern investors put their money into different types of investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate across various regions of the world. When one investment struggles, the others help keep your overall wealth stable.The secret to multiplying your money isn’t finding the next crypto moonshot or meme stock. It’s about consistently investing in low-cost index funds, reinvesting your returns, and letting compound interest do the heavy lifting. The most successful investors I know set up their investments once, automate them, and barely look at their accounts except for rebalancing. 4. Guard thy treasures from loss Let’s talk about protecting your money. I see it happen repeatedly: people focus all their energy on making money but forget about guarding it. In today’s world of meme stocks, crypto hype, and “guaranteed” returns, this principle matters more than ever.Understand and manage risk: The first rule of growing wealth is not losing your money. Smart investors protect their initial investment by carefully balancing safer options like bonds with growth investments like stocks. This balance helps your money grow while keeping it safe from major losses.Don’t chase unrealistic returns: The latest hot investment promising to make you rich overnight is usually too good to be true. Real wealth builds steadily over time through proven investments that match how much risk you can handle and how long you plan to keep your money invested.Insurance as a modern safeguard: The ancient Babylonians didn’t have the protection options we have today. Modern insurance guards against major financial disasters, home insurance protects your biggest asset, life insurance supports your family if something happens to you, and disability insurance keeps money flowing if you can’t work. You should take advantage of all safeguards available to you.Beware of emotional investing: Your feelings can be your worst enemy regarding money. Many investors lose fortunes by buying investments because they’re trending or selling everything when the market drops. A clear investing plan keeps you from making expensive emotional mistakes.The best wealth protection strategy isn’t exciting. It’s about having proper insurance coverage, maintaining a diversified portfolio, and not letting emotions drive your financial decisions. When everyone else is panic-selling during a market crash or FOMO-buying into the latest trend, you’ll be thankful you have a solid strategy in place. “Get rich quick” schemes will never work, even after 3 years Martin and Arly’s story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of falling for “get rich quick” schemes. Arly left her stable full-time job, earning $56,000 a year, to join a network marketing business selling essential oils.The result? Her income plummeted to just $300 a month, all while they struggled to manage mounting debt. This example highlights the importance of making informed financial decisions and avoiding schemes that promise easy money but rarely deliver. As we’ll see, The Richest Man in Babylon teaches us to build wealth steadily and wisely, not through shortcuts or quick fixes. Ramit Sethi: [00:14:33] Okay. Well, let’s find out. A few questions and we’ll know the answer. Arly, when did you leave your full-time job?Arly: [00:14:42] 2019.Ramit Sethi: [00:14:44] Okay. A Couple of years ago. And what were you making at that job?Arly: [00:14:49] Fifty-six. Ramit Sethi: [00:14:50] Fifty-six. Very good. And since the time you left, have your finances gotten better or worse?Arly: [00:14:59] Worse.Ramit Sethi: [00:15:00] Mm-hmm. How much do you make from your current company?Arly: [00:15:06] $300. Ramit Sethi: [00:15:08] Per month. Uh-huh. How much are you going to make next month?Arly: [00:15:14] Same.Ramit Sethi: [00:15:15] Yeah. And, Arly, what kind of business is this?Arly: [00:15:18] Network marketing.Ramit Sethi: [00:15:21] What are you selling? Arly: [00:15:23] Essential oils.Ramit Sethi: [00:15:25] No. Network marketing selling essential oils, oh, my God, is there a bigger scam on Earth?Arly, how did you get into this, a Facebook group?Arly: [00:15:44] No, no. Somebody that I know.Ramit Sethi: [00:15:47] Oh, God. And what did they tell you, if you get in, then you can make a bunch of passive income, and then other people will be working for you, that kind of thing?Arly: [00:15:56] Yeah, something like that. Arly’s experience is a classic example of how “get rich quick” schemes can lead to financial setbacks rather than success. The appeal of passive income and fast wealth often blinds people to the risks involved, but as The Richest Man in Babylon teaches, true financial growth comes from smart, steady investments and careful planning. Shortcuts may sound tempting, but real wealth is built on consistency and discipline. 5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment The old advice was simple: “Buy a house. It’s always a good investment.” But that advice has cost people millions. While real estate can build long-term wealth, success requires understanding exactly how the numbers work in your situation.Should you rent or buy?: Clason’s principle emphasizes owning property to build equity over time. I suggest running the numbers to decide if renting or buying makes sense based on your circumstances.Building equity vs. flexibility: Look at your career trajectory. If you’re in tech or another high-growth field, job-hopping every 2-3 years might boost your income by 20-50% each move. Renting keeps you flexible for these opportunities. But if you’re in a stable career in a growing market, building equity through homeownership could be your best investment.Real estate as an investment: To diversify your investment portfolio beyond your home, consider real estate investment trusts (REITs) or rental properties.Financial independence through housing: Turn your home into a profitable investment by “house hacking” (renting out part of it).Let’s discuss that last point. House hacking has become one of the most powerful ways to build wealth through real estate. Smart homeowners are turning their basements into rental units, renting out spare bedrooms to long-term tenants, and listing their entire homes on Airbnb while they travel. A friend of mine bought a duplex as his first home. He lives in one unit and rents out the other while his tenant’s rent covers most of his mortgage.The rise of remote work has created even more opportunities. People are moving to lower-cost areas while keeping their big-city salaries. Since they’re working from home, they buy homes with extra space for home offices. Many are finding they can afford much more space than they need, opening up possibilities for rental income they never considered before.As you can see, purchasing as an investment is not always so black-and-white. The biggest money mistake in real estate isn’t choosing to rent or buy—it’s rushing into a decision without understanding the true costs and opportunities in your specific market. How to find the true costs and opportunities in your real estate market Clason couldn’t have imagined today’s real estate data tools when he wrote about profitable dwellings. However, raw data only tells part of the story. The real opportunities emerge when you dig deeper into your target neighborhood.Start by tracking sale prices and how long homes sit on the market. A neighborhood where houses sell quickly for the asking price often signals strong demand. But watch for warning signs, too. Multiple price cuts might mean the market is cooling, and empty storefronts could signal broader economic problems.The best market research happens on foot. Spend time in the neighborhood at different hours and ask yourself the questions most relevant to you:Are young families at the parks on weekends?Do you see renovation projects on multiple blocks?Are local businesses staying open later or closing earlier than they used to?Is there a mix of long-term residents and newcomers in the community?These subtle clues often predict neighborhood changes before they show up in market data.Pay attention to government decisions, too. New zoning laws, planned transit lines, or school improvements can dramatically affect future home values. Even small changes like new bike lanes or pedestrian zones can transform a neighborhood’s desirability over time. 6. Insure a future income Too many people think securing their future means just having a retirement account. I see successful entrepreneurs and high-earning professionals lose everything because they skip basic protection. People also don’t realize there are other ways, aside from insurance, to help secure income.Retirement planning and insurance: Understand your full retirement stack beyond the basic 401(k). If you’re making over $100,000, look into backdoor Roth IRAs and mega backdoor Roths – these let you contribute an extra $35,000+ annually to tax-advantaged accounts. The tax savings alone can be worth thousands per year.Consider life and disability insurance: Most employer disability insurance covers only 60% of your base salary, not bonuses or commissions. And it’s taxable. Get your long-term disability policy early; each year you wait costs 3-5% more premiums.Invest in passive income streams: Clason’s ancient advice about making your gold work for you is even more relevant today. While building passive income streams through dividends, real estate, or online businesses takes significant upfront work, creating money that works for you (instead of you always working for money) is one of the smartest ways to build long-term wealth.Maximize employer contributions: Missing your employer match is giving away money. If your company matches 5%, that’s a guaranteed 100% return on investment. Even better, many companies have hidden benefits like mega backdoor Roth options or deferred compensation plans, but you might have to ask for them.The key to future income isn’t just saving more—it’s building layers of protection and income streams that work together. Start with one layer this month. Once that’s running smoothly, add another. This compound effect of multiple income streams creates financial security. 7. Increase thy ability to earn This is my favorite principle because it has unlimited potential. While cutting costs has limits, there’s no ceiling on how much you can earn. The key is being proactive. That could mean pursuing additional education, starting strategic side hustles, or raising your hand for new challenges at work.I’ve seen students go from earning $45,000 to over $100,000 in a year by mastering the art of negotiation and strategic job changes. Let me show you the four most powerful ways to increase your earning potential:Invest in yourself: Focus on developing skills that increase earning potential, such as learning new software, improving communication skills, or obtaining certifications.Side hustles and freelancing: Explore ways to make additional income outside your primary job through side hustles that align with your skills and interests.Networking for career growth: Build relationships within your industry to open up new opportunities and keep yourself updated on trends that can enhance your earning capacity.Continuous learning: As the job market evolves, so should you—embrace lifelong learning to stay competitive.Too many people focus only on saving money or cutting costs. But investing in yourself and growing your earning potential is your most powerful financial lever. Start with one new skill or certification this month. It might sound corny, but it’s true, your future self will thank you. The Five Laws of Gold: Applying Ancient Wisdom to Modern Investments While the Seven Cures we’ve discussed so far teach us how to build wealth from nothing, the Five Laws of Gold serve a different purpose. In the book, these laws appear when Arkad gives his son Nomasir a bag of gold and five tablets of wisdom. This wasn’t advice for the common person starting their journey—it was a father’s guidance to his son about preserving and growing inherited wealth.Think of the Seven Cures as your path to building wealth. But once you’ve built it, the Five Laws become your guardrails for keeping and growing it. Here’s what Arkad taught his son: Law 1: “Gold comes gladly to those who save” This law reveals why some wealthy families stay rich while others lose everything. The secret isn’t just making money; it’s in the habit of saving a portion of everything you earn, no matter how wealthy you become. The world’s richest families don’t abandon this practice once they “make it;” they keep the saving habit alive through generations. This consistent practice of saving and investing, not just earning, builds lasting wealth.Here’s how the wealthiest families maintain their saving habits across generations:Smart families teach their kids to split every dollar into saving, spending, and giving. A 5-year-old learning to save part of their allowance becomes a 25-year-old who automatically saves part of their salary.Old-money families don’t decide monthly whether to save. They build systems. Money moves automatically from every income source into investment accounts before it hits their checking account, removing emotion and willpower from the equation.Celebrate milestones, not spending. Instead of praising expensive purchases, they praise smart saving moves. A teenager’s first investment account is celebrated more than their first car, and a young adult’s first rental property gets more recognition than their first luxury purchase.This approach to saving becomes part of the family’s DNA. The result is wealth that grows stronger with each generation instead of being squandered by the third. Let me be clear that it’s also not about hoarding money but about building a foundation supporting your family’s goals and dreams for future generations. Law 2: \"Gold labors diligently for the wise owner\" This law teaches us that true wealth isn’t built by letting money sit idle. Smart money works multiple jobs. The wealthy don’t just park their money in a savings account; they put every dollar to work in ways that generate more dollars. It’s like having an army of employees working around the clock to build your wealth. The key isn’t just having money – it’s making your money an active force for creating more wealth.Here’s how wealthy families put their money to work:They diversify income streams, not just investments. While others focus on one job, wealthy families create multiple revenue sources – rental properties bringing in monthly checks, businesses generating passive profits, and investments paying regular dividends.They think in generations, not quarters. Rather than chasing quick returns, they build long-term assets. A commercial property might take five years to turn profitable but could provide family income for fifty years.They reinvest relentlessly. When their investments make money, they don’t rush to spend the profits. Instead, they put those returns back to work, creating a snowball effect that accelerates wealth building over time.This approach transforms money from a static resource into a dynamic force for building wealth. The goal isn’t to have the highest-yielding investment this year but to build a perpetual wealth-generating machine that grows stronger over time. Law 3: \"Gold clings to the protection of the cautious owner\" The wealthy understand that keeping money is harder than making it. Risks, schemes, and market crashes have attacked every great fortune. Smart wealth builders survive because they build fortresses around their money and the world’s most successful families know their limits.Here’s how wealthy families protect their wealth:They build a brain trust, not just a portfolio. While others might have one advisor, wealthy families create networks of expertise. Tax attorneys coordinate with investment advisors, estate planners work with insurance specialists, and every major decision gets vetted by multiple experts.They question everything, especially success. When their investments perform unusually well, they investigate why. When a new opportunity promises amazing returns, they dig deeper. Skepticism becomes their shield against losses.They plan for disasters before they strike. Insurance isn’t an afterthought—it’s a core strategy. They maintain emergency funds even with millions in the bank. Every investment has an exit strategy before it enters.This protective mindset isn’t about fear. It’s about understanding that generational wealth is built by avoiding major mistakes and making great decisions. Law 4: \"Gold slips away from unfamiliar ventures\" As we’ve already discussed, the most dangerous investments are the ones you don’t fully understand. Warren Buffett’s billions came from a simple rule: never invest in businesses you can’t explain to a child. The greatest fortunes have been lost when people strayed from their circle of competence. Today’s markets tempt us with complex derivatives, crypto schemes, and AI-driven funds that promise riches. But the wealthy stay wealthy by staying in their lane.Most people think expanding into new ventures shows ambition, but the truly wealthy think differently. They know every investment has two risks: losing money and understanding. You can recover from the first, but investing without understanding is like walking blindfolded through traffic. This is why the most successful investors focus on deepening their knowledge in specific areas rather than chasing every new trend. Law 5: \"Gold flees from impossible schemes\" History repeats itself with painful clarity when it comes to impossible promises. Every generation faces its version of “guaranteed” riches – from tulip bulbs to crypto coins. The truly wealthy know that sustainable wealth isn’t built on dreams of overnight riches. It’s constructed steadily, deliberately, and without shortcuts.Modern markets move faster than ever, creating constant pressure to act quickly. “Get in now before it’s too late” becomes the battle cry of every new scheme. However, families who maintain their wealth across generations understand that rushing is a luxury they can’t afford. They know the paradox of wealth: the faster you try to grow it, the more likely you will lose it.These Five Laws paint a clear picture of sustainable wealth. Building wealth might feel like climbing a mountain, but keeping it requires building an entire infrastructure of knowledge, protection, and disciplined habits. Notice how each law reinforces the others:You save consistently to create capital you can put to work (Law 1)Then, invest this capital wisely into work that builds more wealth (Law 2)Protect these growing investments with careful wisdom (Law 3)Stay within investments you deeply understand (Law 4)And let this understanding guide you to patient, sustainable growth (Law 5)The wealthy don’t follow these laws because they’re cautious; they follow them because they work. These ancient principles feel more relevant than ever in a world of instant fortunes and overnight collapses. While the Seven Cures gave us the foundation to build wealth, these Five Laws give us the blueprint to keep it growing for generations. Why You Should Read The Richest Man In Babylon I’ve read hundreds of personal finance books over the years. Most overcomplicate things with complex strategies and technical jargon. The Richest Man in Babylon does the opposite. It strips away the complexity and focuses on timeless principles that work.Is it repetitive? Yes. Does it lack specific details about modern financial tools? Yes. It was written well before banks and organized markets existed as we know them today. You won’t find detailed instructions about setting up a backdoor Roth IRA or optimizing your asset allocation.But that’s exactly what makes it powerful. While other books get lost in the weeds, The Richest Man in Babylon focuses on fundamental truths about building wealth that I’ve been teaching for years at IWT—principles that worked in ancient Babylon and still work today. The book’s real power lies in its simplicity. When everyone else is chasing complicated strategies, these basic principles remind us what matters: consistently saving, investing wisely, protecting your wealth, and looking for ways to earn more. Building Your Rich Life Beyond The Book The principles in The Richest Man in Babylon are just the beginning. Take these timeless lessons and adapt them to your unique situation. Whether you’re paying off debt, saving for a dream home, or building generational wealth, these fundamentals create the foundation for your Rich Life.But remember—a Rich Life isn’t just about having money in the bank. It’s about creating a life where you can spend extravagantly on the things you love while cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t. Use these principles as a starting point, then go further. Create your vision of financial success. Make your money work for the life you want to live.
