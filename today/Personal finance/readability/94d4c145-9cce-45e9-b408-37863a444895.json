When comparing Visible vs. US Mobile, they are both great options, but which of these options is best for you? Check out the differences between Visible and US Mobile to determine which suits your needs the most. Visible vs. US Mobile: Overview Visible is a carrier that operates on Verizon’s network and is also owned by them. The great news is that you’ll still have access to Verizon’s vast 5G network but at a more budget-friendly price point.  Visible takes a simplified approach by offering 2 plans. The Visible plan and the Visible+ plan. The key difference between these plans is that the Visible+ plan offers unlimited premium data on Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network, 50 GB/month of premium data on Verizon’s 5G and 4G LTE networks, calling to 30+ countries, unlimited texting to 200+ countries, smartwatch service, higher hotspot speeds, and one global pass day per month included. US Mobile offers more flexibility when it comes to picking a plan that best suits your needs. So if whether you’re a data junkie or someone that doesn’t use much data, you’ll likely find a plan that’s a great fit. US Mobile also offers coverage on both Verizon and the T-Mobile network, so you can choose which network best fits your location. Another thing to note is that there are multi-line discounts with US Mobile, which is not the case with Visible.  Visible vs. US Mobile: Pros \u0026 Cons Looking at the pros and cons of Visible vs. US Mobile is the key to determining which option is best for you. Visible Pros \u0026 Cons Pros Unlimited talk and dataFixed payment every month with no contractUses the Verizon 5G and 4G LTE network Cons Only two plans to choose fromDeprioritized data if in a busy area US Mobile Pros \u0026 Cons Pros Multi-line discounts are availableAccess to both the Verizon and T-Mobile networkMultiple plans to choose from so you can find the exact fit for your needs Cons Most affordable plan is only available via an annual plan Multi-line family plans are not eligible for annual pricing discounts Visible vs. US Mobile: Plans and Pricing A big part of the decision between Visible vs. US Mobile is the pricing. Understanding what each plan includes and its cost can help you decide. Visible Visible has two plans, Visible and Visible+. Their plans are a fixed price and include taxes and fees, so there aren’t any unpleasant surprises when you get your monthly bill.

Here’s what to consider. Network Coverage Visible and US Mobile both use Verizon’s network, but US Mobile also has an option to access T-Mobile’s network as well. The great thing about the Verizon network is that it has very good nationwide LTE and 5G coverage and should be plenty good for most people – even if you live in the country.  While on the surface, it may seem like a nice option to have access to both networks on the US mobile carrier, you’ll still have to pick between Verizon or T-Mobile. You can’t alternate between both networks. While T-Mobile is considered to have the fastest overall network, you’ll get much less premium data compared to if you went with Verizon as your preferred network. Data Speeds When considering data speeds, you’ll always get higher speed or greater priority with the larger carriers, like Verizon or T-Mobile.  While Visible and US Mobile run on the same network, the largest concern is when your plan would be deprioritized (given slower speeds during congested periods). Simply put, if you decide to go with Visible or US Mobile, your data is subject to deprioritization. If you are in a congested area, you’ll likely notice slower speeds vs if you went with one of the larger carriers. If this isn’t a deal-breaker for you, it may be worth the cost savings over time. International Roaming Roaming charges are a concern if you travel outside the country or call other countries often. All plans from Visible and US Mobile include unlimited talk and text to Canada and Mexico. However, Visible’s standard plan and all of US Mobile’s plans don’t include unlimited talk, text, and data in Canada and Mexico. Visible+ includes unlimited calling to 30 countries and unlimited texting to 200 countries as well as access to unlimited talk and text, plus high-speed data, every day you’re abroad with Global Pass (complimentary 1 day/month). US Mobile does include 1 GB of International Data on its Unlimited Starter plan and 10 GB of International Data on its Unlimited Premium plan. Perks and Promotions Visible and US Mobile have current promotions, but they can change over time. US Mobile is offering 30 days free and up to $500 in prepaid cards when you transfer for your number and is only available on select plans. Visible hosts a payback program so If your phone doesn’t work with Visible, you get 12 months of service credits by purchasing a select new phone with Visible Payback. Device Compatibility Visible and US Mobile work on the same network and accept the same phones. But since US Mobile can also access the T-Mobile network, you’ll be able to bring over T-Mobile only phones with no issue. Both companies allow you to bring your phone to the plan, saving you hundreds of dollars. The phone must be paid in full and unlocked to be eligible. You can check compatibility with Visible and US Mobile before signing up to ensure your phone is compatible. Customer Service Customer service is essential when talking about cell phones since we rely on them for much of our day.  Visible offers 24/7 customer service, so you always know you’ll get answers to your questions anytime. You can access support through the Visible app using ConnAI which can help answer questions. If ConnAI cannot answer your questions, it will connect you to a live agent via chat. Additionally, you can receive customer support through Visible’s social media channels.  US Mobile offers 24/7 customer support as well. You can contact them via phone or email.  Visible vs. US Mobile: FAQs Comparing Visible vs. US Mobile is a good way to determine which service suits you best. Here are some more questions people have about the services. Can I Switch From One Carrier to the Other Without Changing My Phone Number? You can port your phone number if you stay within the same geographic area and haven’t canceled your existing service yet. If you want to keep the same number, don’t cancel your old service until you officially port your number to the new service. Can I Use the Same Phone on Both Visible and US Mobile? Yes, because Visible and US Mobile are on the same network, you can use the same phone on either network. However, if you have a T-Mobile only device, you’ll only be able to use that device on US Mobile. Can I Switch Between Visible and US Mobile Easily? You can switch between Visible and US Mobile. However, if you want to bring your own device, it must be paid for and unlocked. Does Visible Unlimited Data Slow Down? Visible does not slow data down after a certain usage point, unlike many other services, including Verizon, which slows your speed down after certain usage points. Does Visible Sell Your Data? Visible may share your data with select partners, including Verizon, to share the latest news and deals with you. However, Visible customers can opt out of any marketing materials, and you can limit the sale and sharing of any information provided on their website. Visible vs. US Mobile: Which Is Your Best Option? Visible is the obvious choice if you’re looking for a simple cell phone plan operating on one of America’s largest networks. You don’t have to worry about unexpected charges; you get the same data speeds on both services. However, US Mobile may offer more options if you need customized plans or want additional perks like multi-line discounts.",
