Top Earning Content Creators by Platform Here are the top earning content creators grouped by their platform. YouTube Top creators like MrBeast can rake in over $50 million annually, combining ad revenue, merchandise sales, sponsorships, and even ventures like his burger chain, Beast Burger.

His controversial persona keeps him in the spotlight, further fueling his financial success.In the gaming world, Markiplier (Mark Fischbach) commands attention with his Let’s Play videos, bringing in about $40 million each year.

While his YouTube channel featuring makeup tutorials and beauty content remains popular, it’s his entrepreneurial ventures that have significantly elevated his earnings.Finally, Ryan Kaji, the young star of Ryan’s World, proves that age is no barrier to success. With an estimated annual income of $100 million, Ryan has expanded beyond YouTube toy reviews into merchandise and partnerships with major retailers, making him one of the highest-earning creators on the platform. TikTok TikTok creators are taking a different approach to monetization, often combining the TikTok Creator Fund—which pays $20 to $40 per million views—with brand deals and other revenue streams. Charli D’Amelio, for example, reportedly earned around $23 million in 2023 through sponsorships and partnerships. Her rise to fame through viral dances has showcased the platform’s potential to turn everyday users into major influencers.Bella Poarch, another standout, has earned an estimated $10 million from her viral success with “M to the B,” which led to brand partnerships and a successful music career, further expanding her earnings and influence.Zach King, known for his visually captivating “magic vines,” has brought his unique content style to TikTok, where he has earned an estimated $15 million through sponsorships and brand deals. His creative approach to short-form content continues to attract high-profile collaborations.Mexican influencer Kimberly Loaiza has turned her TikTok fame into a reported $12 million in annual income, amassing a huge following through her music and lifestyle content. Her partnerships with global brands propelled her to mainstream success.Celebrity chef Burak Özdemir, widely known as Czn Burak, has also found significant financial success, reportedly earning around $11 million annually. His joyful cooking videos have attracted millions of followers, helping him secure brand deals and open multiple restaurants, proving that even culinary content can translate into a thriving business empire on TikTok. Instagram Earnings on Instagram depend greatly on engagement levels, with some creators making anywhere between $10-$500 per post. Creators like Addison Rae–who also has a significant TikTok following–use Instagram to supplement their income through paid posts, while others like top earning podcaster Alexandra Cooper dive into personal ventures to capitalize on their influence.Cristiano Ronaldo, the platform’s highest earner, reportedly earns around $1.6 million per sponsored post through deals with major brands like Nike and his personal ventures. Similarly, Selena Gomez, known for her enormous fan base and authentic engagement, earns approximately $800,000 per post, promoting beauty brands and her own Rare Beauty line.Kylie Jenner, a beauty mogul and reality star, capitalizes on her influence by earning around $1.2 million per sponsored post, effectively promoting her Kylie Cosmetics empire while securing additional brand deals.Meanwhile, Nikkie de Jager (NikkieTutorials) has built a thriving career through her makeup tutorials and product endorsements, earning about $200,000 per post. Factors Influencing Content Creator Income Here are the key factors that determine how much you can make as a content creator. Platform YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram all offer different monetization options, with YouTube’s ad revenue model generally being the most straightforward. Instagram and TikTok lean more on sponsorship deals, with TikTok also introducing creator funds.Content creators on Instagram/ Instagram influencers make from $10 – $500 per post, depending on their rate.Content creators on TikTok earn between $20 to $40 per million views through the Creator Fund program. But they can also earn from brand deals on this platform.YouTubers make 55% of the revenue on their channels, which means that for every $100 an advertiser pays, Google pays the creator $55. The average content creator on YouTube makes about $0.018 per view or $18 per 1,000 views. However, the rates also vary depending on many factors, including location. For a more detailed look on earnings you could make on YouTube, check out our other post: How Much Money Do YouTubers Make?. Location Where you’re based plays a role in earnings. U.S.-based creators often see higher payments due to larger market sizes, while creators in countries with lower ad rates may struggle to reach the same income level.The United States, particularly California, is known for offering some of the highest-paying opportunities in the content creation industry. Influence The earning potential of an influencer depends on their experience, popularity and brands they work with.The bigger and more engaged your audience, the more brands will want to work with you. More experienced and popular creators often receive better offers from major brands, further boosting their earning potential.Micro-influencers may not reach millions of people, but their close-knit audiences can still make them attractive to brands targeting niche markets. Diversification Content creators who diversify their revenue streams—whether through paid content, merchandise, or exclusive content platforms—are more likely to generate sustainable income over time than those who rely solely on paid posts. How to Make Money as a Content Creator in 2024 Here’s a breakdown of the most common revenue streams for content creators: Ad Revenue Ad revenue plays a crucial role in the income of content creators, especially on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. YouTube offers creators 55% of the revenue generated from ads, making it a highly profitable stream for those with large audiences. On TikTok, while payouts from the Creator Fund are smaller per view, having the occasional piece of viral content along with  brand deals can significantly boost earnings. Brand Deals As your audience grows, brands will pay for the chance to have their products featured. This is especially common on Instagram and TikTok. For example, creators can make anywhere from $500 to $5,000 per post depending on the size and engagement of their audience. Merchandise Sales Selling branded merchandise is a great way for creators to diversify their income. Once you have a dedicated fan base, you can create products that resonate with your audience, much like MrBeast with his successful merch line. Exclusive Content Platforms Patreon: Patreon allows creators to offer exclusive content to subscribers. The average creator makes between $315 to $1,575 per month, depending on their tier structure.YouTube Memberships: Similar to Patreon, YouTube creators can offer channel memberships, where subscribers pay for perks like exclusive videos and content. Paywalls Sites like OnlyFans (for exclusive access), Patreon, or even YouTube memberships are becoming popular methods for monetizing fan engagement. Creators can charge a monthly fee in exchange for unique, high-quality content. Consulting As you gain experience, brands may seek out your expertise. Consulting is a lucrative income stream for those with the know-how in growing an online presence or managing social media strategy. Other Success Stories of Top Earning Content Creators Emma Chamberlain, a YouTuber turned fashion icon, now commands millions in deals with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, while also launching her own coffee company. Blending her personal brand and business savvy, in this case, led to her explosive financial success.Similarly, Logan Paul leveraged his internet fame into a multifaceted empire, transitioning from YouTube into professional boxing, podcasting, and co-founding the successful energy drink company Prime. He was able to successfully pivot into different industries and diversify his brand beyond content creation.Liza Koshy, another YouTube sensation, expanded her influence by entering mainstream entertainment, starring in movies and hosting major events like the Met Gala red carpet. She evolved from comedic skits to a full-fledged media personality to establish a long-term career in entertainment.Meanwhile on TikTok, creators like Khaby Lame have made the leap from viral star to millionaire through a combination of platform revenue and high-profile collaborations. Starting with funny videos, Lame’s appeal crossed borders, attracting deals from major brands like Hugo Boss, proving that creators can thrive by staying authentic. Final Thoughts Entering the world of content creation in 2024 offers immense potential, but it’s important to understand the nuances of each platform and diversify your income streams. Whether you aim to hit it big on YouTube, dominate TikTok, or build a dedicated following on Instagram, focusing on audience engagement, consistency, and authenticity will set you up for success.
