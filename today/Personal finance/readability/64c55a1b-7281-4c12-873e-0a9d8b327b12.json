  "text": "My Rich Habits research has taken me down many rabbit holes. Because habits are forged by the brain, I’ve been forced to take a deep dive into the anatomy of the brain and brain function in order to understand how the brain physiologically creates habits.After many years of studying the brain, I found myself forced down another rabbit hole – quantum mechanics.Why quantum mechanics?Well, several recent studies on the brain have determined that our brain is not what we thought it was. It turns out the brain is a quantum-based computer, specifically the myelin sheath part of the brain. The myelin sheath is fatty tissue that envelopes every axon branch. The axon branch is a part of every brain cell. It is the sender or transmitter of electrical signals for each brain cell.I also learned that the brain, which has approximately 86 Billion neurons, and our heart, which has 40 thousand neurons, both create an electromagnetic field. The heart’s 40,000 neurons, incidentally, create an electromagnetic field that is 100 times stronger than the field created by the brain.It is well-known among quantum physicists that quantum mechanics operates using electromagnetic fields.What scientists are just starting to understand is that the electromagnetic field somehow is able to carry the electrical signals discharged by the axons in the brain and the heart. Like passengers riding on a electromagnetic train, these electrical signals pass through the human body, and float around the electromagnetic fields that envelope all of us.In other words, every human thought is stored inside the connected and entangled electromagnetic fields that exist everywhere around us, on earth and beyond.The existence of these quantum-based electromagnetic fields appear to be a common denominator, connecting everything and everybody in the universe.
