Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to make money on Upwork. Can you really make money on Upwork? Yes, you can really make money on Upwork! I make money on Upwork with both short-term and long-term projects. Upwork makes it possible to find jobs that are flexible and can typically be done on your schedule. The hardest part about making money on Upwork is finding jobs in the beginning because you won’t have any jobs completed or reviews on your profile. This makes it harder to stand out, which is why it’s important to find quick one-time jobs so you can build your reviews and ratings. How do beginners make money on Upwork? Beginners on Upwork need to focus on a few key strategies to establish themselves on the platform. Here are a few tips to help you get started: Start small with entry-level jobs Set competitive rates and increase your rates as you get reviews Submit the very best proposals for jobs Deliver high-quality work and communicate well with clients Build a portfolio of projects you can do, even if you weren’t paid for them These are all things that I have done! How much can I earn from Upwork as a beginner? As a beginner on Upwork, the amount of money you can earn will vary depending on the demand for your skills, the amount of time you dedicate to the platform, and how effectively you market yourself to jobs.  On average, beginners typically get paid $10-$30 per hour, depending on the field. Jobs in areas like data entry and customer service pay the lowest, while jobs in technical fields like web development or graphic design can earn you higher rates.  For one-time project jobs, beginners can earn anywhere from $50 to $500 per project, depending on the complexity and length of the job. What are the best Upwork jobs for beginners? For beginners, the best jobs on Upwork are the ones highest in demand and easiest to learn. Some examples of these jobs include: Data entry Virtual assistance Writing Customer support Transcription Social media management Online tutoring Proofreading Basic graphic design How much does it cost to sell on Upwork? What is the Upwork fee? Upwork makes money by charging freelancers a service fee based on a percentage of their earnings, charging freelancers to pay for connects, and charging job posters a fee based on payments made to freelancers (depending on the client’s plan). Currently, Upwork charges 20% on the first $500 billed with a client, 10% on billings between $500-$10,000 with a client, and 5% on billings over $10,000 with the same client. To apply for jobs, freelancers need “connects,” which are virtual tokens used for submitting proposals. I actually like that Upwork does it this way. If jobs were free to apply to, potential clients would get swamped with hundreds if not thousands of job offers, making it impossible to find a job. I’ve found that most jobs require around 10–15 Connects to apply. The number of Connects needed tends to increase based on the job’s potential, such as higher pay, longer hours, or greater project scope. Why am I not getting jobs on Upwork? If you’re not getting jobs on Upwork, it might be because your profile or job applications need some work. I recommend that you make sure your profile is fully filled out with a nice photo, a short bio about what you can do, and some examples of your work. When applying for jobs, don’t send the same message to everyone. Instead, write each application personally to show you understand the job and can help with what the client needs. Starting with smaller jobs can help you get positive reviews (whenever you finish an Upwork job, make sure you ask your clients for feedback and for them to leave a review), making it easier to get hired for bigger jobs later.
