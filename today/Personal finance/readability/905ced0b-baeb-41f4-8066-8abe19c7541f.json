  "text": "Hello friends!! Happy New Year!! It’s nice to see so many of you at the gyms and yoga studios and veggie aisles these days :) Everyone’s so energized and motivated – be sure to do whatever it takes to KEEP UP WITH IT! Remember – even if you fail one day or two (or two hundred days), it doesn’t matter – it’s literally in the past. All that matters is what you do TODAY! So get back out there and try again!! A record of “1” in a row is better than a record of “none” in a row. #TRUTHBOMB ** Awkward transition ** Did I tell you my best friend and I created a new project recently? And by recently, I mean almost a year ago but I keep forgetting to tell you about it because I just poured over my archives here and can’t find a mention of it anywhere?? ;) Yup, my boy Nate St. Pierre and I devised it* late one night on a rare visit together (we’ve been internet besties for around 14 years now but only see each other in real life maybe once every few years!) and the very next morning we built it and put it out into the world. Though for once it’s a project not actually meant for the *world*, but for a specific *person* who made our day. It’s called, I Met You Today, and the concept is simple: Whenever one of us meets someone who blows us away with their kindness, genuineness, or brilliance, we hand them a card that says “I met you today. Check this site in 24 hours: IMetYouToday.com” We then post up a note letting them know how much they impacted us! They then (hopefully) remember to come back and visit the site to see what a difference they made to us :) Now some of us are better at remembering to pass out these cards than others**, but at the end of the day we show them some love and hopefully it brings them as much joy as they brought us. If nothing else, it gives us the chance to think through these encounters and put ’em down on paper, that way when we’re feeling depressed about the state of the world we can look back at the archive of people who are actually cool! Lol… We’ve done about 10 of these so far, and you can find them here if any in particular pique your interest. Some are short, some are long, some are random, but every single one is from our heart: A Real Life Friend Request Old Paperbacks, With a Side of Ranch Back in the Game Namaste 🙏 Free Cupcake 🧁 Lunch at the Pier A Real Life Actual Phone Call Serotonin, Inked Let’s Give Hugs Unexpected Space Force (Can you guess which ones *I* wrote vs those from Nate? ;)) It’s been a fun project and reminds me there’s still so much goodness in people if you pay attention enough. Anyone can hate on others (and we’re often quick to do so!), but it’s a lot harder to focus on the opposite. Maybe it’s time we change that this year? Feel free to steal this idea if you like it! You don’t need a website to do it – just open your heart and show them you care. See you back here again sometime soon! I’m continuing The Year of The Flow so who knows what will be occurring next ;) From homeless shelters, to board games, to juicing, to yoga – it’s been a helluva unexpected year! And that’s just the way I like it! You friend today, and always, ——————– *Okay, so Nate actually came up with the main idea, but if it never gets fleshed out and put into the world does it really ever count?! ;) **Hi, I’m the problem, it’s me… Nate is GREAT about handing out these cards the second he realizes he’s in the middle of a beautiful experience, but for me it usually takes a couple of days as I’m slow. It usually dawns on me when I catch myself telling loads of people about the experience later, and then I quickly hop onto the computer and write it up! Which of course is then way too late, lol, but often times I run into the person again so it’s more of a “I Met You A Few Weeks Ago Actually, But Still – Check Out This Nice Letter I Wrote To You on This Website – KTHXBYE!” 😂😂 (Visited 2,000 times, 1 visits today) Get blog posts automatically emailed to you!",
