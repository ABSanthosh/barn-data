Joint ownership is very common, especially for spouses or trusted partners. Being joint owners on a checking account, savings account, or home loan is standard fair. But what about sharing a joint credit card? Joint credit cards are a lesser-known financial product that allows two parties to share the responsibility for one credit card account. If you are curious about opening a joint credit card, keep reading to learn the risks and rewards of sharing a line of credit with another person. What Is A Joint Credit Card Account? A joint credit card is exactly like a traditional credit card, except the account is shared by two users rather than one. Each joint cardholder receives a credit card that is linked to the same account, and any activity on the credit card is reflected on that account. The major difference between a joint credit card and a regular credit card is that both people are responsible for repaying the credit card debt. Whenever someone makes a purchase with the joint credit card, it will link back to the joint account. Each person will be responsible for paying the balance on the credit card, even if the card is only used by one person. How Do Joint Credit Cards Work? Just like other joint financial accounts, joint credit cards allow two people to benefit from the same credit account. Both parties will enjoy the same benefits and responsibilities that come with having a credit card. This can be convenient for people who want to share their finances with a spouse or family member. Because two parties share control of the credit card, the credit card issuer will review both credit histories before approving the joint account. If both parties have excellent credit, this shouldn’t be an issue. However, if one person has a lower credit score, it can jeopardize the chances of being approved for a joint credit card. Joint credit cards are risky for banks and credit unions, so they aren’t offered as much these days. Financial institutions are counting on two people to use their credit cards responsibly. Because it can be all too easy to swipe and forget, joint credit cards are considered a risk to collect on. If you are interested in opening a joint credit card, be sure to do your research on which companies offer them. Factors To Consider Before Applying Opening a joint credit card is a big decision, and there are several points to consider before you take the leap. Here are some important details to discuss with your co-applicant before opening a joint credit card account. 1. Joint Credit Cards Affect Both Party’s Credit History Because two people have access to a single line of credit, having a joint credit card will impact the credit scores of both account holders. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how both people use the shared credit card. Joint credit cards can be a great way to boost the credit score of someone with a poor credit history. People with lower credit scores may have a hard time qualifying for credit cards on their own, so applying for a joint credit card can help them gain access to a new line of credit. As long as both parties keep their credit utilization low and pay the balance on time, a joint credit card can be a way for both people to improve their payment history. However, joint credit cards are a double-edged sword. In the same way that using the card properly can boost your credit, maxing out the card or making late payments can be detrimental to both account holders’ scores. Remember that both people are responsible for using the card wisely, so consider the total effect on both cardholders’ credit when using the card. 2. Joint Credit Cards Can Offer Better Interest Rates Joint credit cards are attractive to people with poor credit history for a number of reasons. Not only do they offer a way to improve your own credit score, but they also grant you access to rates and benefits that you wouldn’t otherwise qualify for. Some credit cards are better than others. If you have higher credit, you can qualify for credit cards with lower interest rates, higher credit limits, and perks like earning travel points with each purchase. Applying for a joint credit card with someone with good credit lets you take advantage of the best credit card features. 3. Joint Cardholders Can’t Be Removed From the Account No one wants to think about the fallout of a relationship, but it can be an important consideration when applying for a joint credit card. It is extraordinarily difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove an account holder from a joint credit card. If you and your spouse divorce, you will need to work together to pay off the balance and close the account. You may also choose to transfer the balance to a traditional credit card and pay it off separately. If the joint cardholder passes away, you will be solely responsible for repaying the balance. 4. Joint Cardholders are Responsible for Repaying the Balance Perhaps the biggest point of contention with joint credit cards is that both account holders are responsible for paying the card balance. It doesn’t matter whether only one person uses the account or not. Credit card companies view both parties as 100% responsible for the account, which can make repaying the balance a sticking point for couples or relatives. If there is one thing to consider before opening a joint credit card, it is to make sure that the joint account holder is someone that you trust. A joint credit card will affect both of your credit histories, which can impact the rest of your life. Make sure that your counterpart is someone with good spending habits and understands the responsibilities of a credit card. Otherwise, you may find yourself in a difficult situation. Who Offers Joint Credit Card Accounts? Joint credit cards are not as common as other financial products, but there are several banks that offer them. Here are some banks that offer credit cards to consider if you’re interested in opening a joint account. U.S. Bank PNC Bank Bank of America Alliant Credit Union How To Choose The Best Joint Credit Card Choosing the best joint credit card for you and your family depends on what your goals for the account are. Here are some steps to take to find out if a joint credit card is the best option for you. Discuss Your Spending Habits and Credit Usage The main reason that joint credit cards are a bad idea for some people is that one party has drastically different spending habits from the other. Be sure to have an open discussion about your consumption habits and how you plan to use the line of credit. Make a Plan for Payments and Rewards Before you even apply, have an open discussion about how each person plans to pay the balance on the credit card. You should also discuss what you plan to do with the rewards if you choose to apply for a rewards card. Making a plan for these inevitabilities will prevent conflict down the road. Be Open to Other Options Having a joint credit card isn’t the only option for a family or married couple. You can choose to list each other as authorized users on one person’s account, or you may choose to simply have separate credit card accounts. There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to credit card authorizations. You simply have to find one that works for you, your family, and your financial goals. How To Apply For A Joint Credit Card Applying for a joint credit card is relatively similar to applying for an individual account. You and your partner/family member will need to submit a joint application. The financial institution will review the credit histories, financial backgrounds, and any other pertinent details of both parties before issuing the credit cards. Once they have determined that both people qualify for a joint account, they will issue cards to both parties and authorize the line of credit. It is once again important to remember that your credit card issuer does not distinguish activity between users. When your bank or credit union issues a statement, they will send a complete account of the card’s activity for the billing period. Both cardholders will be responsible for paying the entire balance on the card, not just their portion. Authorized User Vs. Joint Credit Account Not sure what the difference between an authorized user and a joint account holder is? Here are some of the main differences between these two shared accounts. Authorized User The difference between an authorized user and a joint credit card holder is that an authorized user is not considered a primary account holder. Rather, they are a user that is permitted to use a card linked to the account, but they don’t need to submit a credit card application. Adding a loved one to your credit card account as an authorized user is a great way to help them improve their credit report. An authorized user’s credit is not considered by a credit card issuer when opening an account. In fact, they can be added to an existing account by the primary cardholder at virtually any time. Because many credit card companies report authorized users to credit bureaus, adding someone to your account can help them build their credit score without opening a line of credit. Authorized users get their own credit card that is linked to the account’s line of credit, but they are technically not obligated to repay the debt. For this reason, many primary account holders set spending limits for the authorized user. Many parents choose to add their children to their credit card accounts as authorized users because of the ability to set limits on the account. Because authorized users have little control over the account, many parents view this as a great tool to help teach their children how to responsibly use a credit card. Joint Cardholder A joint cardholder is an equal account holder for a line of credit. They are considered a co-account holder and are equally liable for any debts or balances accrued. Unlike an authorized user, a joint cardholder must apply for the account at the same time as the other cardholder. In the eyes of the bank, there is no primary account holder. Both people are responsible for maintaining the account.",
