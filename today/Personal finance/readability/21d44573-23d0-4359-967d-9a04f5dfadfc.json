And one of the biggest reasons I started Making Sense of Cents was so that I could choose how I spend my time. I love blogging and… This summer, I’m planning to work as little as possible – and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve spent years building a business that gives me freedom. And one of the biggest reasons I started Making Sense of Cents was so that I could choose how I spend my time. I love blogging and helping others, but I also want to be present for the fun moments – especially during the summer when my family and I are out exploring, traveling, and enjoying life (summer is my favorite season in the mountains – so I want to use that time fully!). And I know I’m not the only one who wants to enjoy their vacations or summers more. Whether you want more beach days, family time, or even just lazy mornings with coffee, I want to show you that this kind of flexibility is possible. With some planning, systems, and the right income streams in place, you can work less and still earn a good income. And while I’m sharing this from the perspective of a full-time blogger, these tips can be helpful for freelancers, small business owners, content creators, course sellers, and more. If you run any kind of work-from-home job or online business, you may be able to apply these ideas to create more time in your schedule – whether it’s for a vacation, parental leave, a sabbatical, or just to have more time in your day. Here’s how I’m setting myself up for a low-workload summer – and how you can too. How I Plan On Working as Little as Possible Over the Summer (While Still Making Money) Here’s how I plan on working as little as possible but still make money. I don’t expect my income to go down at all – I actually expect it to go up! P.S. I recommend joining my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I teach you how to start a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken my free course! 1. Working ahead now to create breathing room later Right now, I’m putting in extra effort so that I don’t have to work much later. This means I’m writing blog posts, emails, and social media content in advance. I’ve already scheduled a lot of my content in advance, and I’m continuing to stay ahead so I can step away without stress. Instead of creating things last minute, I do it now and get it on my calendar. I use tools like WordPress post scheduling (every WordPress blog has this), Kit for my email newsletters and funnels, and the Pinterest scheduler to make sure everything continues running while I’m offline. I’m also working on all of those big picture tasks that have been building up for the last year. I’m embarrassed to admit this but there are some tasks that I have been pushing off for years, and I’m getting around to them now so that I can stop thinking about them. For example, I am combining my two courses onto one platform, as well as testing adding more display advertising to my blog posts. Working on big things like this right now is great because they will take up a lot of time, so I’d rather do it now than later. I’d rather my summer be full of smaller tasks that don’t take up as much brain power. It feels good to know that my blog and business will still be helpful to readers, even while I’m out hiking with my family or relaxing by the water. Here’s what you can do: Create a content calendar for the next 3–4 months. Think about blog post topics, email newsletters, and social media content so you’re not scrambling at the last minute. Schedule blog posts and emails ahead of time. Use WordPress, Kit (or whatever you use for your email tool), and Pinterest schedulers to automate your publishing. Identify and tackle lingering to-dos. Finish those annoying backend tasks you’ve been putting off – like switching platforms, cleaning up plugins, refreshing your About page, etc. Pick 2–3 big projects to complete now. Choose things that require lots of time or brainpower and finish them before summer starts. Create templates for recurring content. This could be newsletter formats, blog post structures, or social media captions to make future content faster to create. Audit your affiliate links and ads. Update them now so they’re working for you all summer long. 2. Batch work Batch working is one of the best ways to save time and get more done. I’ve been doing this for years, and it’s truly a game changer because it allows me to be more efficient with my time. Instead of switching back and forth between different tasks, I focus on one thing at a time. I might spend a whole day just writing blog posts or a few hours only working on email newsletters. This helps me stay focused, avoid distractions, and create better work – faster. And because I’m grouping similar tasks together, I don’t waste time switching gears or trying to remember what I was doing. I even batch errands and personal tasks, like planning travel or stocking up on groceries, so I can stay in work mode when I’m working and enjoy personal time when I’m off. Here’s what you can do: Choose 1–2 days per week for focused batch work. These are your deep work days where you knock out as much as possible in one category (like writing or designing). Group tasks by type. For example, batch all writing tasks on Mondays, photo editing on Tuesdays, and Pinterest pin creation on Wednesdays. Use a timer to stay focused. Try working in 25- or 45-minute blocks with short breaks in between (Pomodoro style). Create checklists for repeat tasks. For example, a checklist for writing a blog post or creating a Pinterest graphic can speed things up and make sure nothing is missed. Even though I’ve been blogging for many years, I still have a checklist that I look at every single time (I’m not joking!). Write multiple blog posts in one sitting. Outline 3–5 blog posts at once, then write drafts the next day, then edit all at once – breaking it into clear stages. Record or outline multiple videos or reels in one session. Even if you’re not filming in bulk, preparing ideas in batches helps you stay ahead. Batch your email marketing. Plan and schedule your weekly or monthly emails all in one go, using previous content as inspiration. Batch personal tasks too. Grocery shopping, appointment scheduling, and other life to-dos can be grouped together so they don’t interrupt your work flow. We drove from Key West to Alaska last summer! (the longest road trip in the USA) 3. Outsourcing what I don’t need to do I don’t do everything myself – and that’s part of how I work less. Over the years, I’ve built a small team that helps with different parts of my business. I have help with Pinterest scheduling, social media management, customer service, proofreading, and more. I don’t need to be involved in every little thing, and letting go of some control has allowed me to take back more of my time. If you’re not ready to hire a team, even outsourcing just one thing can help. For example, you might hire someone to edit your blog posts, repurpose your content, or help with graphics. Delegating tasks gives me more freedom to spend time doing what I love – and that’s what summer is all about. Here’s what you can do: Make a list of tasks you don’t enjoy or that drain your time. This could be tech issues, formatting blog posts, making graphics, or scheduling content. Start with just one task to outsource. Choose something simple and time-consuming (like Pinterest scheduling or proofreading). Hire a freelancer for 5–10 hours a month. Websites like Fiverr, Upwork, or even referrals from blogging Facebook groups are great places to look. Write a quick standard operating procedure. Document how you want something done with a short Loom video or Google Doc – it doesn’t have to be fancy! Test with a small project first. Before hiring someone long-term, give them one specific task and see how they do (and see if you’re happy). Set a budget and stick to it. Even $100 to $200 a month can free up hours of your time and reduce burnout. Outsource personal tasks too. If work help isn’t in the budget yet, you may be interested in hiring a cleaner, grocery delivery, or a part-time babysitter – it all supports your business indirectly. 4. Earning with semi-passive income streams This is the biggest reason I’m able to step away from work and still earn money: semi-passive income. My main source of passive income is affiliate marketing. I’ve built up a library of blog posts (I have written over 2,000 blog posts over the years) that bring in affiliate income every day – whether I’m working or not. I’ve also created courses that sell on their own through email funnels, blog posts, and affiliates. Because I’ve already done the hard work of creating content and building trust with my audience, I don’t have to be constantly online to make money. That’s the power of passive income, it keeps working for you long after you’ve done the work. If you’re just getting started with a blog, you can focus on creating helpful evergreen content and building traffic to those posts to do the same. Of course, make sure that you promote products you truly believe in, and think long-term. Semi-passive income builds slowly, but once it’s rolling, it can support your lifestyle in a big way. Here’s what you can do: Update older blog posts with fresh affiliate links. Look for posts that get steady traffic and make sure the affiliate links are working, relevant, and well-placed. Add product comparisons or reviews. These types of posts usually convert well and are great for SEO too. Use affiliate links in your email funnel. If someone signs up for your freebie or newsletter, send them to helpful resources that also earn you income. Focus on evergreen content. Write blog posts around topics that will be searched for all year long (like how to budget, how to plan a family vacation, how to be healthier, etc.). Track your top-earning posts and links. Use affiliate dashboards or tools like Pretty Links to see what’s working – and do more of that. Repurpose old content with affiliate potential. Turn a helpful Instagram post into a blog post or turn a blog post into an email newsletter. You can learn more about my affiliate marketing strategies in my course, Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing. This course teaches how I’ve made over $2,000,000 with affiliate marketing over the years! Also, if you are interested in how I make money online, I recommend reading this article of mine – How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog. 5. Reusing and resharing existing content I don’t always need to reinvent the wheel. Over the years, I’ve written thousands of blog posts, emails, and social media updates. Many of these are still valuable and relevant today. So during the summer, I plan to refresh and reshare some of my older content. This might mean updating links, tweaking headlines, or turning a popular post into an Instagram carousel. I’ll also schedule evergreen emails to go out to my list – ones that have performed well in the past and still have lots of value but are updated. Most readers haven’t seen all your content, and even if they have, they sometimes appreciate a reminder. Repurposing saves time and keeps your message consistent. Here’s what you can do: Pick 5 old blog posts to update and reshare this month. Start with posts that get good traffic or answer common reader questions. Update affiliate links, images, and outdated info. This keeps your content fresh and improves user experience (and conversions). Turn blog posts into short-form video or reels. Break a post into 3–5 tips and record a quick Instagram reel or TikTok. Create Instagram carousels or Pinterest graphics from old content. Use Canva templates to speed up the design process. Turn old blog posts into email newsletters. Pull out highlights or tips and send them to your list with a personal note. Create a “Best of” blog post roundup. For example, “10 Most Popular Side Hustles” and include internal links. My daughter and I on a hike. 6. Setting clear work boundaries One of the most important things I’m doing this summer is protecting my time. I’m choosing specific days and hours that I’ll work and sticking to them. I’ll likely work just a few hours a week, mostly checking in and making sure things are running smoothly. I’m also saying “no” to anything that doesn’t fit my priorities right now. This might mean turning down certain projects, delaying some ideas, or even taking a break from my email inbox. I’ve realized that I don’t have to say “yes” to everything – especially if it means sacrificing time with my family or relaxing. Here’s what you can do: Choose your weekly work hours and stick to them. For example, commit to working only Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 a.m. to noon. Block your work time on your calendar. Treat it like an appointment so you’re less tempted to squeeze in “just one more thing.” Create an autoresponder for your email. Let people know you’re working limited hours and when they can expect a reply. I don’t plan on doing this, but this may be a good idea for others. Turn off notifications outside of work time. Silence apps like Slack, email, and social media when you’re off the clock. Set boundaries with clients, brands, or collaborators. Let them know your summer schedule ahead of time so there are no surprises. Keep a running “later” list. Write down ideas and tasks that pop up so you don’t feel pressure to handle them right away. I already have moved some tasks to the fall because I don’t think they’re important enough to do right now. Delete or pause unnecessary apps. Remove anything that gets you to check in constantly or distracts from your time off. Share your goals with your family or partner. Let them know when you’re working and when you’re fully off – so they can help hold you to it. 7. Focusing on high-impact tasks only When I do work, I want it to count. So I’m focusing on tasks that need me right then. For me, this might mean creating content that brings in traffic or revenue, sending emails to my list, and maintaining relationships with my audience (like answering emails) and affiliate partners. I’m avoiding busywork – like checking stats too much or spending too much time on social media. Here’s what you can do: Write down your top income-generating tasks. These might be writing blog posts, sending emails, or optimizing affiliate links – focus on these first. Use the 80/20 rule. Ask yourself: “What 20% of my tasks bring in 80% of my results?” Do more of those, and less of everything else. Personally, I have spent so much of my time on tasks that do nothing for my business or for my readers, and I know I need to stop that. Track where your time is going. For one week, write down what you’re working on and how long it takes. You might be surprised what’s not actually helping your business grow. I did this last month and it really opened my eyes as to what I spend my time on! Say no (or not right now) to low-priority projects. It’s okay to save ideas for later – they don’t all need to be done before your break. 8. Using ChatGPT to brainstorm and save time One tool I’ve been using more lately is ChatGPT – and it’s been a huge time-saver. I use it to help brainstorm blog post topic ideas, write outlines, come up with subject lines for emails, and even draft social media captions. If I’m stuck or just need a fresh view on something, ChatGPT helps me move forward faster. It’s like having a brainstorming partner available all the time. This doesn’t mean I don’t add my personal touch – I always, ALWAYS do. But using ChatGPT helps me skip the blank page and save time when I need it most. Here’s what you can do: Ask ChatGPT to brainstorm blog post topic ideas in your niche. For example, I recently fed all of my most recent articles that have gone viral and asked ChatGPT to brainstorm more article ideas that are similar. Use it to create outlines before writing. You can feed ChatGPT a bunch of your old blog posts and then ask: “Can you outline a post in my style titled ‘10 Easy Ways To Save Money On Groceries’?” Have it draft social media captions. Copy/paste part of your blog post and say: “Turn this into 3 Instagram captions in my voice.” Turn old blog content into email newsletters. Paste a blog post and say: “Summarize this into a short, friendly email with a call-to-action.” Use it to write Pinterest pin descriptions. Ask: “Write a keyword-rich Pinterest description for a post about budget travel tips.” Use ChatGPT to analyze your past posts on Facebook, study your style, and come up with hundreds more ideas for Facebook posts. You can even just tell ChatGPT all about your business, and then ask it how it thinks it can save you time. For example, you can ask: “I run Makingsenseofcents.com. How do you think ChatGPT can save me time?” or “I run a business where I plan travel for couples. How do you think ChatGPT can save me time?” I just asked both of these questions and it gave me a bunch of ideas I didn’t even list above! Now, I do want to say – I never just take what ChatGPT says and publish it. I am heavily editing it and making sure the information is correct. I use it as an on-demand assistant tool for when I want to brainstorm new ideas. 9. Planning for flexibility Even with a plan, life happens. I know that I will still be working this summer, and that is okay. I love what I do, so that is completely fine! This is why I build in flexibility. Some weeks I might work a little more and other weeks not at all. I don’t plan on working 0 hours a week for 3 months straight. Because I’ve built a business that doesn’t depend on me working 24/7, I can take that time off without everything falling apart. That’s the nice thing about online income – you can set it up to support the life you want. And that life includes long summer days, slow mornings, and more time with the people I love. Here’s what you can do: Build extra buffer time into your calendar. Don’t schedule every hour – leave space for unexpected plans, family time, or just rest. Have backup content ready. Write 1–2 extra blog posts or emails now that you can use later if you need a break. Use tools that make it easy to pause. Tools like Kit, WordPress scheduling, and social schedulers let you plan ahead – but also stop or reschedule content if needed. Give yourself permission to take a full day (or week) off. Your business won’t fall apart if you step away – especially if you’ve prepped in advance. Revisit your priorities weekly. What felt important in May might not matter in July. So, be prepared to adjust your goals based on what your life needs that week. How I Plan On Working as Little as Possible Over the Summer (While Still Making Money) – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on how I plan on working as little as possible while still making money. Working less this summer doesn’t mean I care less about my business. In fact, it means I’ve set it up to support me in the best way possible. By planning ahead, batching tasks, outsourcing, and earning semi-passive income, I’m creating time to enjoy life outside of work – and still earn an income while doing it. Whether you’re a blogger, entrepreneur, or just someone looking to step back a little, I hope my article shows you that it is possible to work less and live more.
