Print-on-demand businesses are a good way to sell personalized and unique gifts like candles, tote bags, and mugs without managing inventory or shipping (and all while running an online business from home!). These types of products are perfect for customers looking for thoughtful gifts that can’t be found in big-box stores, and today, I’m excited to share an interview with Emily, who has built a thriving print-on-demand business centered around giftable items. Emily, a mom of two, started her print-on-demand journey in 2023 after learning about the potential for creating low-cost, low-risk products. By focusing on giftable items, she quickly found a way to stand out in the crowded e-commerce marketplace. In less than two years, Emily hit $500,000 in revenue on Etsy and earned an average monthly profit of $7,500 in 2024. In this interview, Emily talks about: How she shifted her focus to selling gifts like candles, journals, and mugs Why giftable items are a great niche for print-on-demand businesses How much you can earn and what it takes to get started Tips for designing, pricing, and marketing giftable products If you’ve ever thought about creating unique and meaningful gifts, this interview is packed with helpful tips to help you start and grow your own print-on-demand business. I also recommend signing up for her How to Make Money with Print-On-Demand free workshop. In this workshop, you’ll learn how Emily made $500,000 in two years selling gifts, the best types of products to sell to maximize your earnings, and how to start this side hustle on Etsy. How I Made $500,000 Selling Print-On-Demand Gifts in One Year If you want to learn how to start a print-on-demand business that focuses on gifts, this interview is for you. 1. Please give us a little background on yourself and how you got started with a print-on-demand business. How much do you earn monthly from print-on-demand? Hi there! My name is Emily, and I am your average mom of two young girls with a background in education. My story is similar to many side hustlers–I was awake in the middle of the night doom scrolling on Instagram searching for avenues to make a little extra money and the possibility to spend more time with my kids. My oldest daughter was going to be starting kindergarten the following year, and I knew that it was going to be challenging having to juggle two working parent schedules, and I really wanted to be involved in her class, go on field trips, and be there to pick her up everyday at the bus stop. I dabbled in a few different side hustles before I stumbled upon a YouTube video about print-on-demand, and I was hooked! It was low-risk, low-cost, and didn’t require me to hold any inventory…it was perfect for a working parent. In January 2023, I committed to making it work, and in under two years I hit $500,000 in revenue on Etsy. Each month varies depending on the season, in 2024, I averaged a profit of $7,500 per month. I never imagined when I opened my Etsy shop that it would lead to where it is today! 2. What is print-on-demand? How does print-on-demand work? Selling print-on-demand products is a way to sell your designs on products without keeping any inventory. You can sell a wide range of products from t-shirts to candles to tote bags to even door mats! First, you research what Etsy buyers are looking for, think of something like a teacher appreciation gift. Then, you create a simple design using a tool like Canva and upload it to a print-on-demand company website, like Printify. When a customer places an order, the print-on-demand company takes over and does all of the printing, packing, and shipping! You just focus on creating designs, and the print-on-demand company does the rest!  Here is an example of a print-on-demand product you can make. 3. What led you to focus on giftable items like candles, journals, and mugs? When I first started my print-on-demand shop, I focused on apparel like shirts and sweatshirts, which is common for many sellers. I was getting daily sales, but not at the level I wanted. A few months in, I decided to try other products and quickly noticed a trend—customers kept mentioning how much their friends, family, or coworkers loved the items as gifts. That’s when the lightbulb went on, and I shifted to selling gift-focused products. Once I made the switch, my sales grew each month, and as a bonus, I didn’t have to deal with sizing issues that come with selling apparel anymore! 4. What do you like about print-on-demand? Is it worth it? I absolutely LOVE print-on-demand! The fact that I can create a design, and it can sell for months (and years!) without ever having to touch a single product still is mindblowing to me. There is one product that I spent 15 minutes designing \u0026 listing, and this year it brought in over $27,000 in revenue.  I genuinely love and have so much fun with this business! Some of my favorite days are spent researching, designing, and listing for hours—it feels like a scavenger hunt for new ideas, which I enjoy. Plus, hearing from customers about how a gift made their day or brought joy to their loved ones is the best.  5. What’s an average day like for you running your print-on-demand business? One of the best things about print-on-demand is that once your shop is established, it takes less time to manage. I now spend just 1–2 hours a day processing orders on Printify, responding to messages, and listing new products. I like to start early in the morning before my daughters wake up to get most of my work done. Later in the day, I’ll check in to answer messages or spend time on fun tasks like research or designing! 6. How much can a new person make selling print-on-demand? How much a new Etsy seller can make selling print-on-demand really depends on a few things, like how much time they can invest, the type of products they’re selling, etc. Some new sellers start making a few hundred dollars a month pretty quickly, while others grow their shops to bring in thousands over time. The key is consistency—adding new products regularly, improving your listings, and learning what works for your shop. 7. Can a person start a print-on-demand business with no money? When do you pay the company who is actually making and shipping the product? Print-on-demand requires very little upfront investment to start! I typically advise that new sellers have $30 to be able to pay for the Etsy shop opening fee \u0026 Canva Pro. Most print-on-demand partners, like Printify, offer a free plan, and you don’t need to buy any inventory upfront. You only pay the print-on-demand company after a customer places an order. This means you don’t have to spend any money until you’ve already made a sale! It’s a low-risk way to start a business. Here is an example of a candle you can make. 8. What are your expenses with your gift print-on-demand business? My current expenses include Printify Premium, Canva Pro, and a few Etsy research tools that help me find in-demand product ideas. I spend less than $100 each month of the tools to support my business!  As I mentioned, I do cover the costs of the products with Printify when I receive an order. I use a business credit card, and I pay it off immediately once I receive my Etsy payouts. Plus, I get to take advantage of earning points!  9. Can someone with no computer skills start a print-on-demand business? Absolutely! This business is very accessible for all skill levels. Print-on-demand services like Printify guide you step-by-step through setting up products, and design tools like Canva are super easy to use—even if you’re not a designer, like me!  If you’re willing to learn as you go, you can absolutely succeed. Start simple, and as you get more comfortable, you can explore more advanced strategies! 10. What’s your advice for someone who feels they aren’t artistic or creative but still wants to try print-on-demand? I love this question! If you’re worried about not being artistic or creative, don’t stress. When I started my Etsy shop, I had no graphic design experience either, but if you are willing to take time to learn, those skills will grow.  Success as a print-on-demand seller comes from combining the ability to identify in-demand product ideas and niches with creating simple designs that appeal to your customers. 11. How do you handle competition in such a crowded marketplace? Selling niched down gifts–I’ve found that the more narrowed down my products are, the more that customers emotionally connect with them. For example, a “best teacher ever” mug may not work these days on Etsy, but if you made a funny first grade teacher candle, you will have a better chance of being seen on the platform. Etsy customers are often looking for products they can’t find at big box stores, and simple, specific products are a way to connect with them. 12. Can you list the steps needed to get started selling print-on-demand, from creating the product to actually earning money? Sync your print partner – Sign up for a free print-on-demand service like Printify and connect it to your Etsy shop. Research – Pick a specific type of product or audience to focus on, like gifts for teachers or personalized mugs for pet lovers. Choose your products – In The Gift Lab, we teach students how to sell mugs, candles, tote bags, ornaments, and journals. Create your designs – Use a tool like Canva to make your designs–and simple is always best! List your products on Etsy – Add your product mockups, write a keyword optimized title and description, and include a description so customers know what they’re receiving. Set your prices – Make sure to include a profit margin that covers your costs! Make a sale – When a customer buys, the print-on-demand company prints and ships the product directly to them. Get paid! – After Etsy takes its fees, you’ll receive your profit from the sale. 13. Can you tell me more about the course you have? I am so thrilled about my new course with Gold City Ventures, The Gift Lab! This course stands out by focusing on gift-focused print-on-demand products—perfect for Etsy, a top marketplace for gifts! With 60+ video lessons, we guide you through selling popular gift items like candles, ornaments, mugs, tote bags, and journals in your Etsy shop. We include The Micro-Niching Workbook, a spreadsheet filled with hundreds of niche product ideas–something I wish I had when I started! To keep things simple, we walk you through selecting the perfect product for your shop step by step. And now, we’ve added five Canva templates for candles, tote bags, mugs, ornaments, and journals! You can easily customize these designs to make them your own making it so easy to take action. Everything included in this course from the lessons to the templates to the microniching workbook are the exact tools \u0026 steps I use in my Etsy shop on a daily basis! You can click here to learn more about The Gift Lab. 14. What motivated you to create The Gift Lab, and how is it different from other courses? As a career educator, teaching is in my DNA, so sharing what I’ve learned from my Etsy journey felt natural. I’m passionate about this business model because it’s so accessible—if a regular mom like me can do it, anyone can! I created The Gift Lab because I wanted to help other sellers find success by focusing on giftable products. Gifts are such a big part of what people shop for on Etsy, and once I saw how well it worked in my own shop, I knew I had to share this strategy with others. What makes The Gift Lab different is that it’s all about selling gift-focused print-on-demand products like candles, mugs, tote bags, ornaments, and journals. It’s not just another “how to sell on Etsy” course—we’ve got 60+ video lessons, a step-by-step process to avoid overwhelm, The Micro-Niching Workbook packed with product ideas, and even Canva templates to make designing super easy. I’ve made this course as practical and fun as possible so you can hit the ground running with confidence! Are you interested in starting a print-on-demand business focused on gifts?
