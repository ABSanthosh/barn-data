What is the best credit card for us? Which card will give back the most?  Because of this, it’s essential to consider your spending habits and goals before choosing a credit card. Things to consider include: Spending Habits What do you spend the most on? If you’re constantly fueling up your car, then aim for a card that gives you back at gas stations. If you’re constantly re-stocking your pantry, then choose a card that gives you back on grocery shopping! Financial Goals (Short-Term And Long-Term) Think about which credit card is the best fit for your financial goals – whether it’s putting down a mortgage, or making a luxury purchase. Fees Consider annual fees, interest payments, and other fees to see if you are getting a good deal (and whether it’s worth it!). Keep in mind that there is often an annual fee if you plan to add an authorized user. What Do You Want To Be Rewarded From? Are you a foodie? Choose a card that offers dining rewards! Do you love to travel? A card that earns points, miles, and/or other travel rewards could be the most ideal for you. Should Married Couples Share Credit Cards? As with many things in life, there is no one size fits all answer to this question. The one thing to consider is that it depends on you and your partner. As a married couple, it might make sense to get a credit card together for numerous reasons. There are many benefits that come when sharing one credit card: earning rewards faster, combining expenses, and possibly building credit. Managing a card together will also give you the experience of effectively managing your finances together. This can come in handy if in the future you want to buy a house together or invest. On the other hand, if you are a couple who doesn’t like mixing love and finances, or you’re not too bothered about money, then sharing a credit card might not be the best option. One positive thing to consider about not sharing a credit card is that both of you can earn separate signing-up bonuses, and each can choose their most desired rewards. Authorized User Vs. Joint Account So, an authorized user or joint account: What’s the best option? What do they even mean? Authorized User An authorized user is when one person is the primary cardholder and the partner is added as a person that can also use the card. Only the main cardholder is legally responsible for paying the bill, but both can make charges to the card. Sharing a credit card as an authorized user is perfect if one partner has a lower credit card score and wants to build up their credit. However, don’t forget that any charges your partner makes will affect your credit utilization and score, so make sure to keep an eye on the spending. Joint Account Most banks and major credit card providers no longer offer a joint credit card option. Currently, U.S. Bank is the only major bank that offers the ability to add a joint owner to an existing account. Opening a card in a joint account makes you and your partner both legally responsible for paying off the bill and managing the card. This option can help simplify finances and build credit together. However, before choosing this option you’ll need to come up with a solid plan so that you don’t overspend or ruin each other’s credit. Pros And Cons Pros You can combine expenses with just one card. It’s easy, secure, and can save you a lot of time Can help the spouse with lower credit to start and build their score, and you can build credit with your partner Easily accumulate any rewards, points, cash backs, and air miles that credit cards offer Transparency in your finances can build trust in the relationship Save on annual credit card fees — just pay one, instead of two! Cons Risk of overspending and accumulating debt — do you fully trust how your spouse manages their money? If your partner misses payments, this could negatively affect your credit  Frequently Asked Questions Can my spouse use my credit card without me there? The answer is yes, whether your spouse is an authorized user or you have a joint account. Having a credit card with your spouse means that they can use it whenever they want, whether you are there or not. Will adding my spouse as an authorized user hurt my credit score? No, adding your spouse as an authorized user won’t hurt your credit score. However, any charges they make to the card will affect your credit utilization, so keep an eye on that! Is sharing a credit card a good idea? Choosing a credit card that offers the right benefits for you can be a daunting task. However, with these tips, you’ll be able to find financial harmony and enjoy the universe of credit cards! Keep in mind that sharing a credit card with your partner is a big commitment, so it’s not a decision that can be rushed. Sharing a credit card can bring you and your spouse closer together if it all goes well, but it also has the potential to cause unnecessary strife. Always remember that the key to successfully sharing a credit card is open communication, honesty, and responsible financial management. So whether you choose to share or not to share, always consider the benefits and consequences fully!",
