I’ve been making over $3,000 a month for more than 10 years now, and I think it’s a great way to change your life if you want to start making more money. Whether you are looking to learn the best ways to make $3,000… Do you want to learn how to make $3,000 a month? I’ve been making over $3,000 a month for more than 10 years now, and I think it’s a great way to change your life if you want to start making more money. Whether you are looking to learn the best ways to make $3,000 a month full-time or if you’re looking to make $3,000 extra on top of what you already earn, there are many ways that you may be interested in. You can make $3,000 a month through side hustles, online work, starting a small business, and more. Some options include freelancing, selling items online, delivering food, or baking food. The best choice depends on you, though, as well as your skills, time, and interests. Best Ways To Make $3,000 a Month Below are the top ways to make $3,000 a month. 1. Blogging Blogging can be a great way to make $3,000 a month from home. I’ve been blogging for over 10 years, and it has changed my life in big ways. When I first started, I had no idea it would grow into a work-at-home business that makes me over $3,000 a month consistently (I actually make well over this amount – I have earned over $5,000,000 from Making Sense of Cents over the years altogether). What’s great about blogging is that there are many different topics that you can write about – such as travel, personal finance, cooking, family, and more. And, you don’t need to be an expert writer either – I was definitely not a good writer when I started my blog, nor did I ever think I would make a full-time income from it. You can make money blogging through ways such as affiliate marketing (like when you share a link to Amazon on your blog), display advertising (the video ads that you may see on my site), sponsored posts, and selling your own products like candles or mugs. For me personally, it took around one year to make $3,000 a month from my blog. At around 2 years of blogging, I was earning about $10,000 a month from my blog, and now I earn much more than that. I really enjoy blogging not only because of the great income I am able to earn, but also because I have a flexible schedule, can help people with my blog posts, and get to work from home! An article that I recommend reading is How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog. Also, you can join my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I teach you how to start a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken this! 2. Proofreading Proofreading can be a great way to make $3,000 a month. You can work from home and set your own schedule, which is perfect if you like flexibility. Proofreaders check written content for mistakes. This includes looking for spelling errors, grammar issues, and punctuation problems. They work on blog posts, books, newsletters, websites, sales pages, or even restaurant menus and brochures. Many companies need proofreaders to make sure their writing looks professional. This means there’s a good chance you can find work if you decide to try proofreading. I personally have a proofreader for my blog and business, and she is a lifesaver!

Sell printables on Etsy Printables are digital files customers can buy and print themselves. I buy printables all the time, and so do many others – parents, teachers, business owners, students, and more. You can create all sorts of printables such as planners, wall art, gift tags, invites, cards, and more. What’s great is that you only need to make each design once, and then you can sell the design an unlimited amount of times. All you have to do is come up with an idea for your printable, create it, and then list it on a site like Etsy. Recommended reading: How I Made $6,161 in Just 4 Months With a New Etsy Printables Shop 4. Sell dog treats Pet owners love buying dog treats for their pets, and I have bought many homemade dog treats over the years! You may be able to sell dog treats at local farmers markets (the farmers market near me actually has a beautiful little dog treat booth at it and I love it), online through sites like Etsy, and even by reaching out to local pet stores to see if they would be interested in wholesaling dog treats from you. So, how much can you make? It depends on how much time you put in. As a side job, you could earn $500 to $1,000 a month. If you decide to make it a full-time business, you might even reach $3,000 to $4,000 monthly. Recommended reading: How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!) 5. Create and sell an online course Making an online course can be a great way to earn extra money by selling your expertise. You can teach almost anything – from coding to cooking to crafts. I think it’s actually one of the best ways to learn how to make $3,000 a month online too, because you can create the course just one time and then the income is semi-passive well into the future. I created my first online course around 10 years ago, and it has helped me to earn over $2,000,000 over the years and help over 10,000 people learn the topic that I am teaching. Topics that you can teach in an online course include: Watercolor painting How to start an Etsy shop How to take better family photos of your own family How to meal plan for the week Parenting and baby sleep training Goal setting and habit building Minimalism and decluttering your home How to find cheap flights and travel on a budget A popular platform for uploading your course lessons is Teachable, and it is what I personally use for my two courses. Teachable makes it very easy to set up your course and handle payments.  Recommended reading: How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 From My First Course 6. Be a virtual bookkeeper Virtual bookkeeping is a job where you work with numbers and help businesses manage their money, all from your computer at home. And no, you don’t need to be an accountant or have a college degree. You can learn how to do this, all from home. Many people earn around $3,000 a month doing this work. And, I know someone who makes over $10,000 doing this from home! Bookkeepers track money coming in and going out for businesses, such as by recording sales, filing receipts, and creating reports. Recommended reading: How To Make $40,000 With Online Bookkeeping Jobs 10Bookkeeper Launch CourseThis free training will teach you what you need to know to become a virtual bookkeeper and make money from home. 7. Deliver food with DoorDash DoorDash is a popular food delivery app that can help you make extra money. You can work when you want and set your own hours, so this can make it a good way to earn cash on the side. It’s easy to get started too – you just apply to be a Dasher on their website (you’ll need a car in most cities, although some places may allow you to have a bike or scooter for deliveries). Once you pass a background check and are approved, you can start taking orders through the app right on your phone. You’ll get notifications on your phone for nearby delivery requests, and you can then pick the ones that work best for you. Of course, you do want to factor in how much being a Dasher will cost you when calculating your pay. For example, don’t forget to think about how much gas and car maintenance will cost!

You can sell things like T-shirts, mugs, greeting cards, baby clothing, candles, tote bags, and phone cases without keeping any stuff in your house (no inventory needed!). People buy print-on-demand products all the time, and they are more popular than ever. For example, the other day I wanted to get a thank-you card for my daughter’s teacher. I searched for “toddler daycare teacher thank you card” on Etsy to try to find something that was fun and unique. Another example of something I recently bought was for my husband – he’s been obsessed with growing mango trees lately, so I wanted to find him a unique shirt with a mango on it. Again, I searched on Etsy and found some here. Here’s how it works: You make a design on your computer. Then you put it on a website that sells things, like Etsy or Shopify. When someone buys your item, the print-on-demand platform prints your design on the product and sends it directly to the customer. You don’t have to do any of the hard work and you don’t need to buy anything up front or ship packages. The print-on-demand company does all that for you. I have personally been thinking about starting a print-on-demand business myself too, as I buy so many print-on-demand products throughout the year, and I have so many ideas that pop into my head all the time for things that I am unable to even find. I think it sounds like a fun business idea to start. Recommended reading: How I Make $7,500 Monthly Selling Print-On-Demand Gifts 9. Become a virtual assistant I was a virtual assistant for several years, and I really enjoyed the job. It opened the door for me to the online world and gave me a flexible schedule. Now, I have a virtual assistant of my own who is very much needed in my business and she helps me so much. You can make $3,000 a month as a virtual assistant too. This job lets you work from home and help businesses with different tasks. Virtual assistants do many things, such as answering emails, scheduling meetings, graphic designing, or managing social media accounts. Some VAs also do data entry, write blog posts, or even arrange vacations. My VA does a little bit of everything, which is very nice, but some businesses may like their VA to be more specialized in one task. Many VAs earn $20 to $50 per hour. Your pay depends on your skills and experience, and as you learn more, you can charge higher rates. To find virtual assistant gigs, my VA personally has had good luck with UpWork over the years. Fiverr is another option. Recommended reading: How To Find Virtual Assistant Jobs 10. Sell stock photos online Selling stock photos online can be a fun way to make money taking pictures. Stock photos are the pictures that you see on websites, in advertising, in brochures, on social media, books, slideshows, and more. These can be pictures of people, places, food, business settings, nature, and more. I use stock photos all the time for my blog (there are some sprinkled within this blog post), and so do most other small websites and businesses that you come across. This is because we don’t have the time or expertise to take the photos that we need. For example, for me, I need a lot of photos, so it would be hard for me to take them all. Instead, I can search online on a site like Deposit Photos and get all of the pictures that I need. 11. Freelance writing for websites Freelance writing for websites can be a great way to make $3,000 a month. Many different businesses hire freelance writers, such as bloggers, business owners, advertising companies, e-commerce stores, travel brands, and more. As a freelance writer, you may be writing blog posts, email newsletters, sales pages, books, tutorials, helping with SEO, and more. I have been a freelance writer for several years, mainly as a side job right now. I usually make around $1,000 to over $1,500 per freelance article that I write. New freelance writers usually can make around $50 to $100 per article when they first start, and as you gain experience and build your portfolio, you can charge more. If you’re able to make $250 per freelance writing assignment, then that would be about 12 tasks each month, which is very doable. You can learn more at 14 Places To Find Freelance Writing Jobs – (Start With No Experience!). 12. Become a transcriptionist Transcriptionists turn audio and video into text by listening to recordings and typing what they hear. This is a flexible job that you can do from home, and many companies need transcriptionists in fields like law, medicine, and entertainment (like podcasts). Beginners can usually make around $15 to $25+ per hour. Your pay depends on how fast you work and which company you choose. Recommended reading: 18 Best Online Transcription Jobs For Beginners 13. Launch a YouTube channel Starting a YouTube channel can be a way for you to make $3,000 a month. And, you don’t need a huge million-subscribers channel to earn money. Topics that you can start a YouTube channel on include personal finance, travel, health and wellness, food and cooking, DIY and home improvement, parenting and family life, beauty, and so much more. Here are some ways to make money with a YouTube channel: One way to make money with a YouTube channel is with ads. When people watch your videos, you can earn money from the ads that play. But you need lots of views to make good money from ads alone. You can also make money through sponsorships. Companies might pay you to talk about their products in your videos. Selling your own products is another option. You can use your channel to promote things you make or sell, and this could be anything from T-shirts to online courses. Affiliate marketing is popular too. You can share links to products you like, and when people buy through your links, you get a small cut of the sale. You can learn more at How Much Do YouTubers Make? 14. Manage Facebook ads for businesses If you’ve ever been on Facebook, then you’ve probably seen a Facebook ad. Someone, like you, creates and puts these ads on Facebook. You can charge $1,000 to $2,000 per month for each client, so with just a few clients, you can reach your $3,000 goal. Many small business owners know Facebook is important, but they don’t know how to use it well. That’s where you come in. You can learn to run ads that bring customers to their businesses. You can learn more about this business by joining the waitlist here for the FB Side Hustle Course. It’s run by my friend Bobby and my sister-in-law Ariel, and they really know their stuff! Frequently asked questions Here are answers to common questions about making $3,000 a month. How to make $3K a month easily? Making $3,000 a month isn’t always easy, but there are ways to do it.

If you have money saved up (and a lot of it!), then one of the easiest ways would be to buy dividend stocks and earn dividends. Is $3,000 a month good income?
