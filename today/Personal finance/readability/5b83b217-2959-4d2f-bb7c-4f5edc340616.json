A lot of us are afraid of change, which is why we stay at jobs we hate and suffer through broken marriages for too long. But how about being more adventurous instead and relocating to another country. After all, you've got more money than 94% of the American population and 99% of the world. Live a little! Depending on where you would move to once you become a millionaire depends on where you currently live, how happy you currently are, and what stage of life you're in. Let me share where I would have moved to in my younger days. Then we'll get to the big data. Millionaire Migration In My 30s If I could rewind time to 2012, when I left my job and didn't have children yet, I would have spent a year living in Malaysia and then China for a year. I had a blast living in Kuala Lumpur during middle school, and always fantasized what life would be like if I actually had some spending money. The people are great and the food is hands down top 3 in the world in my book. Meanwhile, I first visited China in 1997 as a college junior studying abroad for six months. It was extremely evident back then that the country was going through an economic boom. But when I got a job offer to work and help manage an eyeglass parts manufacturing company in Shenzhen in 1999, I chickened out for the safer route of a Wall Street job. By returning to China, I would fulfill my uncertainty of not going as a 22 year old and improve my Mandarin. Then I would attempt to do something entrepreneurial so I won't look back on life with regret for not trying. With millions of dollars in investments, I would feel free to experiment with new ideas. I'm sure I could easily make friends, partly by being a gregarious newcomer. Millionaire Migration In My Late 40s Today, if you were to tempt me to move away from vibrant San Francisco with $10 million, I would obviously move to Oahu. I've been to most states in America and over 60 countries so far, and Hawaii provides one of the greatest qualities of life. As a bonus, you might even get to live longer, with Hawaii as the highest life expectancy state at 79.9 years according to the CDC. Once you've won the financial lottery, your health can no longer take a back seat. Your goal should be to live as long and healthy of a life as possible to enjoy your wealth for longer. Sadly, my hunger for adventure and exploration has waned. For all you younger folks out there, take advantage of your motivation while you've still got it. Eventually, you'll no longer want to live in youth hostels and backpack around the world. Today, I mostly want to live in an area with year-round sunshine and comfortable weather. I love being outdoors and moving my body in some capacity every day. Further, I want to be there for my parents, who are in their late 70s. Where Millionaires Are Moving Around The World Based on The 2025 Henley Private Migration Report, more millionaires are migrating than ever. The UAE is attracting the most millionaires, followed by USA, Italy, Switzerland, and Saudi Arabia. Conversely, the UK is losing the most millionaires, followed by China, India, South Korea, and Russia. What's going on here? The answer is a country's tax policy. Given millionaires earn the most and have the most assets, they also tend to face the highest tax rates. Therefore, one of the easiest ways to minimize taxes is to relocate to a country with lower taxes, and preferably, a higher quality of life. UAE Is Drawing Millionaires In, While the U.K. Pushes Them Out If you’re a high-net-worth individual looking to optimize for taxes and lifestyle, it’s easy to see why the UAE is one of the top destinations. With zero income tax, long-term golden visas, and a luxury lifestyle in a strategic global location, the UAE has become a magnet for migrating millionaires. So far, most millionaire migrants to the UAE have come from India, Russia, Africa, and the broader Middle East. But more Brits and Europeans are expected to follow as tax policies in places like the U.K. become increasingly unfavorable. The U.K., in particular, is losing appeal fast. The government is phasing out the long-standing “non-dom” status, which used to shield foreign residents from paying taxes on overseas income. That change alone will likely drive many wealthy residents to consider relocating. Add in Labour Party plans to slap a 20% VAT on private school tuition, and you’ve got another reason for affluent families to look elsewhere. When the government keeps raising the cost of staying, it’s only natural to explore what life might look like somewhere more welcoming. Hard To Save On Taxes By Migrating As An American If you’re a wealthy American thinking about moving abroad to lower your tax bill, here’s the reality: the IRS doesn’t care where you live. So long as you hold a U.S. passport, you owe taxes on your worldwide income, regardless of your physical location. This makes America one of only a few countries in the world with citizenship-based taxation. In other words, even if you move to a tax haven, the U.S. still wants a piece of your financial pie. That said, there are ways to reduce your tax liability—but not eliminate it. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) For 2025, the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion allows you to exclude up to $130,000 in earned income if you qualify via the physical presence test (330 full days abroad in a 12-month window) or the bona fide residence test. If you’re married and both of you qualify, that’s potentially $260,000 of income shielded from federal income tax. But keep in mind, this exclusion only applies to earned income—your W-2 wages or freelance/contractor income. It does not apply to investment income, rental income, dividends, or capital gains. So if your wealth is largely passive, the FEIE won’t help much. Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) If you’re living in a higher-tax country, the Foreign Tax Credit lets you offset U.S. tax liability dollar-for-dollar based on the income taxes you pay abroad. This can be especially useful for those earning significant passive income. However, you can’t double-dip. If you exclude income using FEIE, you can’t also claim the FTC on that same income. And while the FTC can reduce your tax bill significantly, it rarely brings it to zero—especially if you’re living in a low-tax jurisdiction. State Taxes Still Lurking Some states, like California, don’t give up easily. They will hunt you down like the Predator does in one of my favorite movies. Unless you completely sever ties—no property, no driver's license, no voter registration—they may still argue you owe state income taxes too. It’s a good reminder that just because you move doesn't mean the state lets go. Want True American Tax Freedom? Renounce Citizenship If you want to completely cut ties with the IRS, there’s only one way: renounce your U.S. citizenship. But before you go booking a one-way ticket to St. Kitts, know that this move comes with consequences. If your net worth exceeds $2 million or your average income over the past five years is above a certain threshold (~$200,000+), you may owe an exit tax. This tax treats all your assets as if they were sold the day before you renounce—triggering potential capital gains taxes on unrealized gains. You’ll also be giving up the right to live and work freely in the U.S., face limitations on banking and travel, and lose access to certain legal protections. And once you renounce, there’s no going back. For most people, especially those with deep roots or business interests in the U.S., renunciation is a nuclear option—not a clever tax optimization move. It's much easier to relocate to one of the no state income tax states instead.

That kind of exposure gives you perspective. You start to appreciate where you live—and more importantly, you start to understand what’s possible elsewhere. Unfortunately, even if you work remotely and have millions in investments, chances are you won’t actually move to a new country for a better life. It’s hard to leave behind the comfort of the familiar—your routines, your friends, your community. If you have young kids, it becomes even harder because you don't want to disrupt their sense of stability. Think about it. No rational multi-millionaire would voluntarily spend winter in frigid Winnipeg, Canada or Duluth, Minnesota when they could be enjoying life in Honolulu, Hawaii. And yet, plenty of millionaires stay put. Why? Because they've built deep roots in their communities. That connection outweighs climate and even tax savings. When you’re younger and still building wealth, go wherever the best opportunities are. But once you achieve financial freedom, don’t forget to upgrade your environment. Live in the best place money can buy—not just for comfort, but for quality of life. Readers, if you were to inherit $1 million or $10 million, where would you move—and why? If you’re currently living in the UAE or the U.K., I’d love to hear what your lifestyle and tax experience has been like. Would you recommend it to others seeking financial freedom or a better quality of life? Reevaluate Your Portfolio Before You Relocate If you’re thinking about moving for a better life—or just sitting on a large cash windfall—it’s worth getting a second opinion on your finances. One smart move is to take advantage of a free financial check-up from Empower. If you have $100,000 or more across taxable accounts, IRAs, savings, or a 401(k), an Empower advisor can help you uncover hidden fees, spot unbalanced allocations, and identify ways to improve your risk-adjusted returns. It’s a no-obligation way to stress-test your strategy—especially if you're considering a dumbbell portfolio or shifting more assets internationally. Before you migrate your life or your money, make sure your portfolio is working as hard as you are.
