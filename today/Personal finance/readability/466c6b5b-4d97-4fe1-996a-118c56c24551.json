It's not the cheapest option, but it’s an excellent choice for those seeking a peaceful beach vacation at an upscale property.The island is a popular destination for U.S. travelers, offering beautiful beaches, delicious food and passport-free travel. Plus, if you’re coming for Bad Bunny’s music residency in 2025, the Caribe Hilton is a short Uber ride away from the venue, the Coliseo de Puerto Rico. On the lower end, expect to pay under $300 or 68,000 to 75,000 Hilton Honors points for a standard room per night. However, during peak periods, those numbers can climb to over $1,000. Timing is everything, so you’ll need to be flexible with your travel dates to get the best deal.I stayed at the Caribe Hilton for four nights in April 2025. While the hotel covered the cost of my meals and lodging, this review is my own opinion and was not influenced by the property.Vacation more, spend less.

That area is easily accessible from the hotel by Uber or, if you’re feeling spry, by foot (expect a 40-minute walk).To get to the isleta, or little island, you’ll need to cross a bridge from Condado Beach, where a large number of the city’s chain hotels are located. Santurce, a vibrant neighborhood known for its street art and nightlife, is located by Condado Beach.(Screenshot from Google Maps)The hotel is in a relatively quiet neighborhood, although you can still find shops and restaurants nearby. If you’re looking for total peace and quiet, head to the large park next door, which has access to a stretch of public beach that’s popular for organized water activities.I’ve been to San Juan multiple times, and I found the peaceful atmosphere of the Caribe Hilton to be a highlight of my stay, since the nearby Condado Beach can feel extremely touristy and crowded.DesignWhen you first pull up to the property, you immediately notice the imposing buildings that make up the Caribe Hilton. Designed in the International Style, with an emphasis on simple geometric shapes, you might mistake them as office buildings from afar if you couldn’t see the hotel signage. But playful elements help add character to the smooth and unassuming rectangular facades, such as the saucer-shaped roof over the open-air lobby. (Photo by Benjamin Din)A massive lawn lined with palm trees greets guests at the entrance to the property. If you’re coming by rideshare, you’ll be dropped off by the hotel’s tallest building and need to walk down to the lobby. A taxi can drop you off in front of the lobby at the end of the driveway.Once you arrive, you’ll hear tropical music setting the tone for your vacation and encounter fun design elements that play into the island vibe.(Photo by Benjamin Din)It’s also where you’ll check in. If you have Hilton elite status, you can use a dedicated line to speed up the process. Typically, this is where you would get a wristband, which security uses to identify you as a guest of the hotel when accessing the pool and beach area. However, when I checked in, the agent informed me that they had run out of wristbands since the hotel was extremely full. Instead, I would need to show my keycard to access the pool area.Most of the resort’s dining options are in or near the lobby. The entrance to the outdoor pool and beach area is here as well.If you’re looking for a calm place to sit and relax, check out the outdoor garden with a small pond and gazebo. I didn’t spend much time here but the green space would be a fun place to bring kids for animal spotting, from fish and birds to iguanas and turtles.(Photo by Benjamin Din)While you’re there, don’t miss the colorful mural of pineapples just around the corner. You’ll also be able to see playful touches of the hotel’s signature blue color incorporated into the architectural design.One thing that’s abundantly clear about the Caribe Hilton: It’s proud of its history. Small exhibits and placards showcasing the hotel’s heritage are scattered around the property, from historical photographs to an entire wall dedicated to the hotel’s claim to fame as the birthplace of the pina colada. (Photo by Benjamin Din)RoomsThe property is split into three wings: the Beach Wing, the Garden Wing and the Wave Wing. The Beach Wing is closest to the lobby, the pools and the beach, while the Garden Wing overlooks the outdoor garden area. The Wave Wing is the furthest away and requires a short trek. I stayed in a high-floor room in the Wave Wing that had an ocean view. This wing is the tallest structure in the hotel offering the best views, and the entrance to this building is near the rideshare pickup and dropoff area.(Photo by Benjamin Din)When you first enter the room, the bathroom is immediately on your left, while the rest of the room is straight ahead.(Photo by Benjamin Din)I really enjoyed the room, although I found it to be a bit bare, considering how much space there was. But there’s plenty of room for luggage.(Photo by Benjamin Din)I appreciated the bedside charging options, which included a wireless charging pad and different charging ports in case you forget (or are too lazy to pull out) your charging block. (Photo by Benjamin Din)In the room, you have standard amenities like a TV, a coffee machine, a mini fridge and two chairs. (Photo by Benjamin Din)There was plenty of storage space for my belongings, which helped me keep things organized during my stay.My favorite part of the room, of course, was the balcony. The weather was a bit muggy while I was there, but the idea of being able to sit outside made me happy. Plus, it was helpful to have a place to dry out swimsuits after a day at the beach.(Photo by Benjamin Din)One thing I didn’t like about the view was having to look at the roof of the much lower building below, which houses the hotel’s conference and meeting rooms. Against the backdrop of the beautiful Atlantic Ocean, the mechanical equipment was a bit of an eyesore. If that’s something that would bother you, try to ask for a room on the other side of the building facing the beach area.(Photo by Benjamin Din)The bathroom, in my opinion, felt comically large for a standard hotel room. While I don’t necessarily find that to be a bad thing, I thought it was an interesting choice that they made the bathrooms larger instead of opting for more square footage for the room.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Like many standard Hilton properties, the hotel uses Crabtree \u0026 Evelyn bath products. I liked the fun art piece that hung on the wall by the toilet.(Photo by Benjamin Din)BookingThe Caribe Hilton is a part of the Hilton Honors program, meaning you can book rooms using cash or Hilton points. It’s also an eligible property where you can spend the twice-a-year resort credit that comes as a perk of holding the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card. (That card also comes with automatic top-tier Diamond elite status, with benefits like complimentary breakfast and upgrades.) Terms apply.If you’re looking for the best deal, expect to pay under $300 a night for a room at the Caribe Hilton. Standard points pricing seems to hover between 68,000 to 75,000 Hilton Honors points, so make sure you do the math to see whether it makes sense to use cash or points. NerdWallet values Hilton Honors points at 0.6 cent apiece, so it’s generally worth considering using points when you start seeing nightly prices north of $500.Keep in mind when booking that the hotel charges a resort fee, which is waived for Hilton Honors members when booking using points or redeeming a free night award. If you have any elite status with Hilton and are planning a stay on points, you might be able to take advantage of Hilton’s “fifth night free” perk, allowing you to pay the price of four nights for every five nights you stay in a standard room when using points.Don’t have elite status but want to use this perk? Consider opening a credit card that comes with automatic elite status, such as the Hilton Honors American Express Card, which includes entry-level Silver status and has a $0 annual fee (see rates and fees). As mentioned above, Hilton offers various credit cards that come with differing tiers of status. If you want higher status, though, you’ll need to pay a higher annual fee. Terms apply.Dining optionsGuests at the Caribe Hilton have multiple dining options — ranging from sit-down restaurants to coffee shops with grab-and-go options. Most of the eateries are located in or near the lobby.For breakfast, guests can visit Nectar del Caribe, which offers a breakfast buffet as well as hot food stations, including made-to-order omelettes and waffles. As a Hilton Diamond elite, I was offered complimentary breakfast for cold items only with a $20 upcharge for the hot food buffet and stations, which had bacon, eggs, pancakes and empanadas. I skipped the upsell and went with the cold items, which included fruit, pastries, cheeses, charcuterie, smoked salmon, breads and juices.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Even though breakfast was complimentary due to my elite status, I was given a receipt that listed a $10 charge. This surprised me, but I was told that it would be removed from my folio later on, and it was. The full breakfast buffet is about $35 per person, which I don’t think is worth it. If you want to eat here, I’d recommend ordering a la carte.For other meals, guests can try Rustica Ristorante and Lola’s, which serve Italian and Puerto Rican cuisine, respectively. The latter two actually share the same space, so you can order from either menu while dining there, which is great for families or large groups with different tastes. Rounding out the restaurants are Morton’s The Steakhouse next to the check-in counter and Ocean Restaurant \u0026 Lounge, which is located by the Wave Wing and has an upscale and intimate vibe.(Photo by Benjamin Din)One of my favorite meals I had during my stay on the island was actually at Caribar, the lobby bar which has an outdoor terrace. I ordered the grilled skirt steak which was cooked perfectly and came with flavorful green chili rice and plantains. You can also order a variety of cocktails here, including the classic pina colada or one of the concoctions on the special Bad Bunny menu. (Pro tip: The Born in Paradise made with Don Q rum was a crowd favorite during my stay!) (Photo by Benjamin Din)Other options include an on-property Starbucks, which can get busy in the mornings, as well as Ice Cream \u0026 Cookies Co., which serves — you guessed it — ice cream and cookies, as well as acai bowls, smoothies, coffee, sandwiches and other snacks. Out by the pool, you have Bagua, a swim-up bar and grill. That’s where the daily pina colada tasting takes place, which is included in the resort fee.If you’re looking for food options off-property, I enjoyed Cruda, which is in the complex across the street and sells poke bowls. Nearby, you can also try 787 Coffee, a chain that sells creative coffee drinks, with an option to use alcohol-infused beans. I didn’t try it during my stay, but I’ve had it in New York City and enjoyed the variety it offers.AmenitiesThe Caribe Hilton has multiple pools, including one designated for children, and hot tubs, as well as beach access. I found the pool area to be overrun with children during my stay, so I opted to spend most of my water time at the beach. (Even if the pool was empty, I’d always choose the open water over a pool.)(Photo by Benjamin Din)Both the pool and beach areas have plenty of lounge chairs to choose from, making them great spots to relax and hang out. (Photo by Benjamin Din)By the pool, you’ll find a hammock garden, a giant chess set and a chalkboard listing the various resort activities offered by the hotel.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Guests can play volleyball on the grassy area by the beach, while kids can run around on the nearby play structure.The property also offers three tennis courts, named after Monica Puig, who won gold at the 2016 Olympics. The resort fee comes with a complimentary one-hour court rental. The hotel spa, Zen Spa Oceano, and fitness center are between the tennis courts and the beach. Behind that area is the dilapidated Normandie Hotel, which is a bit of an eyesore for guests. I asked a hotel staff member about it, and they told me that it was abandoned in 2009 and the owners hope to renovate it one day. (Photo by Benjamin Din)The fitness center is open 24/7 and is well stocked, with treadmills, ellipticals, stair climbers, weight machines and more. The best part, though, is the incredible view of the ocean while working out. (To access it after the spa’s hours, you’ll need to use the entrance by the tennis courts, not the main entrance.)(Photo by Benjamin Din)The property also has a 24-hour laundry room, which I thought was a convenient option for those planning to spend multiple days at the beach or pool. There’s only one washer and one dryer, and each 45-minute cycle costs $3 ($6 for washer and dryer). If you didn’t pack detergent, you can buy it in the laundry room.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Getting to the Caribe HiltonMost travelers visiting San Juan will fly into Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU). From the airport, an Uber to the Caribe Hilton will cost about $15. If you’re planning on renting a car, keep in mind that self-parking at the hotel is $25 a day, while valet rates will cost you $32 a day.Whether you should rent a car depends on what activities you want to do during your trip. Those who want to relax at the beach and explore Old San Juan likely don’t need a car. However, for those who want to explore the entire island, such as hiking in El Yunque National Forest, a car will likely be necessary.To save money, consider blocking off a few days for activities that require having a car to get around and rent a car just for that period. That way, you won’t have to pay for your car rental and parking fees on days when you don’t plan to stray far from the hotel.All information about the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card has been collected independently by NerdWallet.
