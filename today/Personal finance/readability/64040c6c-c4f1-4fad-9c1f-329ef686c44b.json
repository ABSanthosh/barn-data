Getting your finances ready in the months before your baby arrives can make things easier. Saving for a baby in just nine months is possible if you plan… Do you want to know how to save for a baby in 9 months? Having a baby is exciting and joyful, but it also brings new costs. Getting your finances ready in the months before your baby arrives can make things easier. Saving for a baby in just nine months is possible if you plan and budget well. To get ready for these changes, you might need to change how you spend money now and save up for future costs. It’s a good time to think about where you can save and how to use your money wisely for your growing family. Best Ways To Save for a Baby in 9 Months Below is how to save for a baby in nine months. 1. Set a budget The very first thing you should do if you want to learn how to save for a baby in nine months is look at your budget. Setting a budget involves taking a good look at your current finances and figuring out how much money you’ll need to save for baby-related expenses. This will help you plan and avoid any big financial surprises. First, you need to know where your money is going. Track all your income and spending for a month or two. Include everything like rent, groceries, utilities, health insurance, life insurance policy, and entertainment. Also, don’t forget about annual or longer-term expenses, like possibly a car insurance payment that only comes up every six months or a property tax bill. Use a spreadsheet or budgeting app to list all your expenses. And, break down your spending into categories like housing, food, transport, and bills. Next, review your financial statements, such as bank accounts, credit cards, and any loans. Note any areas where you might be able to cut costs. For example, can you dine out less or cancel unused subscriptions? Can you negotiate any of your bills or shop around to get a better rate? Finally, total up your monthly income and compare this with your total expenses. This will help you see if you need to make changes to save for baby expenses. You can learn more at How To Create A Budget That Works. 2. Calculate baby-related expenses Now, let’s figure out how much money you’ll need for the baby. As everyone knows, having a baby can be expensive! You can start by listing one-time larger expenses for things like a crib, stroller, and car seat. Then, there are many smaller expenses, like blankets, changing table, diaper bag, swing, rocking chair, dresser, crib mattress, and more (you don’t need everything on this list, though). Next, think about monthly expenses such as diapers, formula, and baby clothes. And, if you plan on breastfeeding, don’t forget that there may be higher costs with that as well (many people think that breastfeeding is free, but that’s not always the case). Even if you are breastfeeding, you may have costs related to creams, pads, a breast pump, a lactation consultant, and more. Medical costs can also add up quickly, so you will want to check what your insurance covers for prenatal and postnatal care. You will want to think about what you may have to pay out-of-pocket when/if you go to the hospital for labor, any midwives you may use, and more. You may also want to think about childcare costs, whether it’s daycare, a nanny, or a babysitter. Don’t forget to include potential changes in income, especially if you or your partner plan to take time off work. And then, there are bigger-picture expenses that you may eventually want to start thinking about as well, such as college savings and starting a college fund. Remember to adjust your budget as needed. Babies grow fast, so your spending will change. Be flexible, and update your budget to meet your baby’s needs. 3. Cut unnecessary expenses If you need to find more money in your budget and stretch your paycheck, then I recommend looking at your current spending and finding areas where you can cut back. Every dollar saved can go toward your new baby. Here are some ideas: Skip eating out frequently. Cooking at home saves a lot of money. Plus, you can make extra portions for leftovers. Evaluate your subscriptions. Do you need all those streaming services? Cancel the ones you use the least. Stop buying expensive coffee every day. Brew your coffee at home instead. It’s much cheaper and can be just as tasty (plus, it saves you valuable time). Limit buying new clothes. See if you can make do with what you already have or shop at thrift stores. Avoid impulsive buys. Always make a shopping list and stick to it. This helps you avoid buying items you don’t need. Cut down on travel costs. Save on gas by combining errands into one trip and using public transportation when possible. Reduce utility bills. Simple actions like turning off lights and unplugging devices can lower your electricity costs. Look for deals and coupons for groceries and household items. Many stores offer discounts that can help you save a lot. Now, of course, not everyone will want to do everything on the list. You may want to just try one or two, or you may decide to do them all. It is personal and it all depends on how much money you want or need to save. Every little bit helps. By cutting unnecessary expenses, you’ll free up money that can go toward preparing for your baby’s arrival. 4. Meal plan and bulk cook One smart way to save money and reduce stress is by meal planning and bulk cooking freezer meals before your baby is born. This strategy allows you to prepare meals in advance and freeze them, so you’ll have ready-to-eat options when you’re too busy with the baby to cook. By buying ingredients in bulk and preparing meals ahead of time, you can save a significant amount on groceries, avoid the temptation of takeout, and make sure you’re eating well during those hectic early days of parenthood. Plus, having meals ready to go in the freezer means one less thing to worry about as you adjust to life with a newborn. Some easy meals that you can make ahead include: Lasagna – A classic dish that freezes well. You can make a big batch, portion it out, and freeze it. When you’re ready to eat, just pop it in the oven. Stir-fry – Cook chicken and your favorite vegetables with a simple sauce. Freeze in portions and serve over rice or noodles. Chili – A hearty and versatile meal that’s easy to freeze. Make a large pot, and freeze it in individual portions. It’s perfect for quick lunches or dinners. Casseroles – Dishes like shepherd’s pie or chicken and rice casseroles are ideal for freezing. They can be made in bulk and heated up in the oven. Soups and stews – These are some of the easiest meals to freeze. Options like vegetable soup, beef stew, or chicken noodle soup can be made in large batches and stored in the freezer for later use. Burritos – Assemble burritos with fillings like beans, rice, chicken, or beef. Wrap them individually and freeze. They’re great for quick, handheld meals. Meatballs – Cook and freeze meatballs in marinara sauce. They can be served with pasta, in a sub, or as a quick protein-packed snack. Quiche – A versatile dish that can be filled with various vegetables, meats, and cheeses. Bake, cool, and freeze for a quick breakfast, lunch, or dinner. These meals are easy to prepare in large quantities, freeze well, and can be reheated with minimal effort – perfect for those busy days after the baby arrives. I really wish I would have done this before I had my daughter. I think it would have been a lifesaver! I have a friend who recently had a get-together (during her pregnancy) with all of her friends and they spent all day prepping meals for her. I thought this was a wonderful idea and so sweet. I recommend reading 15 Delicious, Easy Freezer Meals For New Moms \u0026 Dads to see more ideas. 5. Use cash back apps Cash back apps can be a great way to save money. These apps give you a percentage of your spending back in cash or rewards. My favorite cash back apps are: Fetch Rewards – This is my absolute favorite cash back app, and you can get points back on ANY grocery store receipt, and then eventually turn your points into gift cards. Swagbucks – This is a rewards site that will give you cash back as well as help you make some extra money online. Rakuten – This is my favorite cash back site for when shopping online as almost every store is listed on this website. Upside – This app is a great way to get cash back on your gas purchases. Honey – This app is great for online shopping and coupon codes. Cashback apps can make a difference. Every little bit adds up when you are preparing for a baby. 6. Buy secondhand baby gear One of the best ways to save money when preparing for a baby is to buy secondhand baby gear. Babies grow quickly and tend to use items for only a short time. This means you can find gently used gear at a fraction of the cost. And, you can often find high-quality brands that are built to last when shopping secondhand! Baby strollers, cribs, and high chairs are usually available in good condition if you shop around. Make sure you inspect these items carefully for any damage or missing parts. Shopping for used baby clothes can also save you a lot of money. Babies outgrow clothes so fast that you can often find barely worn outfits at thrift stores or online marketplaces. You can find secondhand baby items at places like thrift stores, online marketplaces, and even through friends and family. Some of the most popular ways to find used baby gear include: Once Upon a Child Goodwill Salvation Army Poshmark Facebook Marketplace Buy Nothing groups on Facebook Local parent groups on Facebook – I’m a part of a local mom group in my area, and moms are always giving away free things, such as strollers, clothes, diapers, and more. 7. Find ways to make extra money There are many ways to make money while preparing for a baby. Here are some ideas: Freelancing – You can freelance in areas like writing, graphic design, proofreading, or social media management. Selling unused items – Go through your home and sell items you no longer need, like clothes, electronics, or furniture. Platforms like eBay, Poshmark, and Facebook Marketplace make it easy to sell your items locally or online. Taking online surveys – Answer online surveys through platforms like Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, or Branded Surveys. While not a huge income, surveys can help you make some extra cash or gift cards that can be used for baby-related expenses. Providing babysitting or pet sitting services – If you have experience with kids or pets, you may want to babysit or pet sit. Websites like Care.com, local Facebook groups, and Rover can help you find clients. Starting a side hustle – You may want to try starting a small side business, like selling printables on Etsy, blogging (this is what I do so that I can work from home!), or bookkeeping. A side hustle can grow into a steady source of income over time. You can learn more at 16 Best Jobs for Pregnant Women. 8. Find cheap or free diapers Diapers can be one of the biggest expenses for a new parent. Buying them on sale or even finding them for free is a smart way to save money. Some ways to get free or cheap diapers include: Ask in a Buy Nothing group on Facebook – Join local groups where people give away items they no longer need, including diapers. Join rewards programs – Sign up for programs like Pampers Club or Huggies Rewards to earn points that can be redeemed for free diapers. Sign up for diaper coupons – Register on diaper brand websites to receive coupons and promotions via email. Check online marketplaces – Look for free diapers on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Freecycle. Visit local diaper banks – Access free diapers through local community organizations or diaper banks. Apply for government assistance – Explore programs like TANF that may offer diaper allowances. Use the National Diaper Bank Network – Find a nearby diaper bank through this network’s resources. Reach out to nonprofit playgroups – Connect with local playgroups that provide free diapers to families in need. Add diapers to your registry – Include diapers on your baby registry or create a diaper fund for your baby shower. Use cloth diapers – Save money by using reusable cloth diapers instead of disposable diapers. I recommend reading How To Get Free Diapers: Free Diaper Boxes, Samples, Coupons to learn more. 9. Build an emergency fund An emergency fund is a savings account for unexpected expenses. This might include medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss. This is something that I highly recommend having because it will help to lessen your stress level a little bit once the baby comes. This money gives you peace of mind when life throws you a curveball. I recommend that you aim to save enough to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses. But, you should definitely start small if you need to. Setting aside $1,000 is a good first goal. Even a little cushion can prevent you from going into debt. Then, save what you can each month. Even small amounts add up over time, and this makes your emergency fund grow slowly and steadily. If you get a tax refund, use it to increase your emergency fund. Extra money can help you reach your goal faster. And, keep your emergency fund in a separate savings account. It should be easy to access but not too easy to spend. I personally use Marcus by Goldman Sachs for my emergency fund as they have a very high rate. You can get up to 4.40% at the time of this writing through a referral link bonus. According to this high-yield savings account calculator, if you have $10,000 saved, you could earn $440 with a high-yield savings account in a year. Whereas with normal banks, your earnings would only be $46. That’s a big difference! Building an emergency fund takes time, so be patient. Consistency is key and I recommend that you keep contributing whenever you can. Frequently Asked Questions Saving for a baby can be tough, but it’s doable with the right plan. Here are some common questions and helpful tips to guide you as you get your finances ready for your new family member. What are the top ways to save money for my baby’s first year? To save money for your baby’s first year, I recommend that you find ways to cut unnecessary expenses wherever you can. Try meal planning and bulk cooking to save on food, use cash back apps to get some money back on purchases, and find ways to make extra money. How much to save for baby’s first year? Deciding how much to save for your baby’s first year is hard. You can expect to spend on things like diapers, formula (or breastfeeding items), and baby gear. Diapers and wipes might cost around $50 to $100 per month. Formula can add another $100 to $150 each month. Also, include costs for clothes, toys, and medical bills. What to do if not financially ready for a baby but pregnant? If you are not financially ready for a baby, but you are currently pregnant, there are things that you can do. I recommend that you reach out to community resources or government assistance programs for help as many areas give free or low-cost baby supplies. You can also ask friends and family for hand-me-downs. Start saving whatever you can now; even small amounts help. Is 9 months enough time to prepare for a baby? Yes, nine months can be enough time to prepare for a baby. Start by making a plan and budget right away. Cut back on unnecessary spending, use this time to save as much as you can, and look for deals on baby items. How expensive is having a baby? Having a baby can be expensive. The first year alone can cost several thousand dollars. Baby gear, diapers, formula, and medical bills add up quickly.

This might include medical bills, car repairs, or sudden job loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is something that I highly recommend having because it will help to lessen your stress level a little bit once the baby comes. This money gives you peace of mind when life throws you a curveball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend that you aim to save enough to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses. But, you should definitely start small if you need to. Setting aside $1,000 is a good first goal. Even a little cushion can prevent you from going into debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen, save what you can each month. Even small amounts add up over time, and this makes your emergency fund grow slowly and steadily. If you get a tax refund, use it to increase your emergency fund. Extra money can help you reach your goal faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, keep your emergency fund in a separate savings account.

Try meal planning and bulk cooking to save on food, use cash back apps to get some money back on purchases, and find ways to make extra money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much to save for baby’s first year?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding how much to save for your baby’s first year is hard. You can expect to spend on things like diapers, formula (or breastfeeding items), and baby gear. Diapers and wipes might cost around $50 to $100 per month. Formula can add another $100 to $150 each month. Also, include costs for clothes, toys, and medical bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to do if not financially ready for a baby but pregnant?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are not financially ready for a baby, but you are currently pregnant, there are things that you can do. I recommend that you reach out to community resources or government assistance programs for help as many areas give free or low-cost baby supplies.
