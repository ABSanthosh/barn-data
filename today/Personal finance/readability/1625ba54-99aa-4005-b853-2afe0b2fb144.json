  "text": "(Sorry guys, this post isn’t likely to be directly useful to you, but you can share these tips with the girls in your life and look really knowledgeable and respectful about girlie things.)Makeup is one of those items that I have a love/hate relationship with. I love trying new colors, dolling up my best friend’s teenage daughter for prom, and goofing around with the girls for a spa night at home.Now, don’t get me wrong, I can go weeks without wearing makeup and be perfectly happy; it’s not essential to my life. But it’s fun to be creative and play with color combinations and application techniques.Makeup also holds great potential for a shopping addiction. Before I had kids (when I had considerably more spending money), I used to shop for makeup on a regular basis. I stopped shopping at the drugstore and began venturing into the department store’s line of more pricey products. The products were nice, but the price tag was outrageous. When my kids came along, I simply couldn’t afford to keep up. I learned how to make what I had last longer and how to spend significantly less on my makeup.Here are eight of my top tips for saving money on makeup: 1. Start with skin care.No amount of quality cosmetics will make up for basic skin issues. Dry skin, blemishes, enlarged pores, etc must be treated in order for your make up to wear well and look good. If the canvas is a poor quality, the makeup doesn’t matter. If you’re going to spend more on anything, splurge on a quality skin care kit and use it regularly.2. Buy your pressed or loose powder a shade darker than usual and mix in a little talcum powder.This makes your powder last much longer and doesn’t affect the overall look of your makeup.3. Mix in a little quality moisturizer with your liquid foundation to make application smoother.This also stretches how long your foundation will last since you’re essentially using less each day. This technique allows me to purchase a single bottle of high-quality foundation and make it last for 10-12 months.4. Always apply cosmetics with a brush, not your fingers.Applying foundation with your fingers means you’re wasting makeup on your hands that will be washed down the drain. Using a brush allows you to precisely apply the product exactly where you want it.5. Shop for your favorite makeup regularly.Popular drugstores like Rite Aid often have half-off sales to help clear out older inventory and make room for new products. You can stock up on the essentials at a fraction of the price during these sales. Sometimes you can even find a too-bright shade on clearance and mix it with a lighter shade you already own to make it useable.6. Visit your local department store’s cosmetics counter for a complimentary make over.Most companies don’t charge for this service (knowing you’re likely to buy something before you leave) and this a great way to get a fresh look for special occasions without investing in new cosmetics.7. Experiment with color.Many items, such as nail polish, blush, and eye shadow can be mixed to create new colors. This can result in a new favorite shade or a new look without spending a dime on additional colors.8. Always use a setting product to hold your look in place.Topcoat for your nails, lipstick treatments, and loose powder are wise investments since they prevent the need for touchups.Even if you’re addicted to a pricey name brand cosmetics line, you can still save money by adding a few steps to your daily routine and being on the lookout for a good bargain.What money-saving makeup tips have you found to be useful?Tagged as: Frugality, Money TipsEditor's Note: Did you know about the service called $5 meal plans?
