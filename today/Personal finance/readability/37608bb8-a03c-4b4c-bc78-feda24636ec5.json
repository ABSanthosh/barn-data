I still remember the first time I reached this monthly income level – I couldn’t believe it! It was a game-changer that helped me pay off debt, save for my future, and finally feel more in control of my finances. It’s a goal that may feel far off, but with the right steps, it’s absolutely achievable. Many people dream of earning this much but aren’t sure how to get there. There are many ways to make $10,000 a month, and you don’t need a fancy degree. You just need to pick the right path and work hard. From starting a business to selling services, the options are wide open whether you’re looking to make extra income or if you want to start a new career. Best Ways To Make $10,000 a Month Below is how you can make $10,000 a month! 1. Start a blog and monetize it Starting a blog was one of the best decisions I ever made, and I think it’s one of the best ways to make money online. I still remember the excitement of hitting “publish” on my first post and earning my first $100 – it showed me that blogging could truly change my life. I now make well over $10,000 a month online and have for around one decade now consistently. Starting a blog can be a great way to make $10,000 a month. First, you’ll want to pick a topic you’re passionate about or that you think you’ll like talking about a lot. This could be personal finance, travel, cooking, or anything else you like. Next, set up your blog. Choose a domain name and get hosting – WordPress is a popular platform that’s easy to use. You can find my tutorial here for starting a blog on WordPress. Now it’s time to create content. You will want to write helpful articles that your readers will enjoy, as well as post regularly so that readers keep coming back. To make money, you can try different methods. You can put ads on your site or promote products as an affiliate. Some bloggers sell their own courses or ebooks. I recommend signing up for my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken my free course too! 2. Bookkeeping Bookkeeping is a great way to make money from home. You don’t need a degree or lots of experience to get started – this is something that you can learn. Many businesses need help keeping track of their money, and you can be the one to help them. Bookkeepers record money coming in and going out of a business. They also organize receipts and create financial reports. It’s like managing your own budget but for someone else’s business. You can work as a freelance bookkeeper and have multiple clients. This gives you the freedom to set your own schedule. All you need is a computer and internet connection to work from anywhere. Many bookkeepers earn around $40,000 a year or more. You could make $50 to $100 per hour. Some bookkeepers make $300 to $400 a month from just one client, working only 4-5 hours. If you are interested in finding online bookkeeping jobs, I recommend signing up for this free workshop all about finding a virtual bookkeeping job. Here, you will learn how to start a freelance bookkeeping business. You can sign up for free here. Recommended reading: How To Find Online Bookkeeping Jobs 10Bookkeeper Launch CourseThis free training will teach you what you need to know to become a virtual bookkeeper and make money from home. 3. Teach online courses When I created my first online course, I was nervous about whether anyone would sign up. But seeing those first enrollments roll in was an incredible feeling, and knowing my course was helping others made it even more rewarding. I now have had over 10,000 people take my course, and I have been able to help so many people! Teaching online courses can be a great way to make $10,000 a month too. You can share your skills and knowledge with students around the world. You can get started by picking a subject you know well. This could be anything from cooking to coding to traveling and more. Next, plan out your lessons and create engaging content. You might use videos, worksheets, or quizzes to teach your students. A popular site for hosting courses is Teachable, and it is what I personally use for my two courses. This platform makes it easy to set up your course and handle payments. They also have a free workshop that you can take – How Anyone Can Create an Online Course That Sells. One big plus of online courses is that they can bring in passive income. Once you make the course, you can sell it over and over without much extra work. Some teachers earn thousands of dollars each month from just one popular course.

You can even sell things like a web design or printables on your Etsy store! Etsy is a global platform to sell your work. With millions of active buyers, it’s a great place to connect with people who are looking for unique and high-quality items. I buy on Etsy all the time, and just last week I actually bought a shirt, earrings, a plant pot, and a calendar – all from different Etsy sellers! Promoting your Etsy shop is important for driving traffic and increasing sales. You may want to use social media platforms to showcase your products, share behind-the-scenes content, and interact with potential customers. Running promotions or having discounts during holidays and special occasions can also help increase sales. Recommended reading: How To Sell On Etsy Successfully: A Beginner’s Guide 5. Sell stock photos Selling stock photos can be a great way to make extra money. Some photographers earn $500 to $10,000 per month from stock photo sales. I buy stock photos all the time for my business (you’ll see some stock photos in this blog post that you’re reading right now actually!). To get started, take high-quality photos of different subjects, and you can focus on popular themes like nature, business, technology, and travel. Then, upload your best shots to stock photo websites like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, Deposit Photos, or Getty Images. These sites connect you with buyers looking for images (buyers can simply browse these sites and look for pictures that are related to the topic they need). You’ll want to build a large portfolio of diverse images as this increases your chance of someone downloading your photo. Top earners often have thousands of photos for sale.

To get started, pick a topic you love. This could be cooking, travel, gaming, or anything else. There are thousands of different niches you could get into and I have watched videos on all sorts of topics. Even ones that seem fairly small (like Alaska homesteading) have millions of views! People like to watch videos on all sorts of topics. Next, create your channel. Come up with a catchy name and make an eye-catching profile picture. Then, start making videos. You don’t need fancy equipment at first – your cell phone can work just fine. Remember, it takes time to build a successful channel. Don’t give up if you don’t see results right away. Keep making great content and engaging with your viewers. With hard work and patience, you could earn $10,000 a month or more from YouTube! Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? 7. Become a freelance writer When I first started freelance writing, I didn’t know where it would lead, but landing my first paid gig felt like a huge win. Over time, writing became a flexible and rewarding way to earn money while working on my own terms. Freelance writing can be a great way to make $10,000 a month too. As a freelance writer, you work for yourself and write for different clients. You might write blog posts, articles, or website content. Many businesses need writers. They want to share information online but don’t have time to write it themselves. That’s where you come in!

Invest in rental properties There are many different real estate side hustles, and one is to invest in rental properties. Rental properties can be a great way to make $10,000 a month. You can buy homes or apartments and rent them out to tenants, or even get into commercial real estate. The key to making money as a real estate investor is to find properties that will bring in more money than they cost you. Look for places in good areas where people want to live or shop. Aim to charge enough rent to cover your mortgage, taxes, insurance, and repairs, plus extra for profit. For example, you might collect $1,800 in rent and have $800 in expenses. That leaves $1,000 profit each month. To reach $10,000 monthly, you’d need about 10 properties like this. It takes time to build up, but rental income can grow into a big moneymaker. Just be ready to deal with tenant issues and property upkeep. Remember to save some of your profits for times when you have no renters or need to make big repairs (such as if there’s a leak or if the AC breaks).

Finding hidden gems at thrift stores (or even just in my very own closet) and seeing them sell for much more online became not only a fun challenge but also a reliable way to make extra money. So, what is flipping exactly? This is where you buy things at low prices and sell them for more. This can help you earn $10,000 a month if you do it right. You can look for items at yard sales, thrift stores, or flea markets. You can find good deals there and then sell these items online or at local markets for higher prices. Popular things to flip include furniture, electronics, and clothes. Shoes, especially sneakers, can also be very profitable. Some people make thousands of dollars just from flipping shoes, for example. Recommended reading: How Melissa Made $40,000 In One Year Flipping Items 10. Become a virtual assistant I used to work as a virtual assistant, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve made. It not only helped me earn money on a flexible schedule but also taught me the skills and confidence I needed to eventually build my own successful business. Plus, I think it’s a great way to work from home and make extra money. Virtual assistants help business owners with tasks they need to get done. This job lets you work online and set your own schedule. Virtual assistants do all kinds of work. They might manage social media accounts, plan events, help with SEO (search engine optimization), handle email marketing or content marketing, or answer emails. Some VAs even help with bookkeeping or customer service. You can look for jobs on sites like Fiverr or Upwork. You can also reach out to bloggers or small business owners directly. As a beginner, you might make around $15 to $25 per hour. But with experience, you could earn much more. Some skilled VAs make over $10,000 a month! Recommended reading: Best Ways To Find Virtual Assistant Jobs 11. Create digital products Digital products can be a great way to make $10,000 a month from home. These are items you create once and sell many times over. Some examples of digital products you can create include ebooks, online courses, templates, and printables. Recommended reading: How I Make Money Selling Printables On Etsy 12. Invest in dividend stocks When I started investing in dividend stocks, I loved seeing those payouts hit my account – it felt like getting rewarded just for being consistent. Over time, those payments grew, showing me how powerful dividend investing can be for creating steady, passive income. Dividend stocks can help you earn money each month too. These are stocks from companies that share some of their profits with shareholders. To make $10,000 a month from dividends, you’d need to invest a lot of money. You might need around $4 million if the stocks pay 3% in dividends each year. As you invest more, your dividend income will grow. It might take a while to reach $10,000 a month, but every bit helps.

Affiliate marketing When I first started affiliate marketing, I was amazed at how I could earn money just by sharing products I loved and used myself. Over time, it became one of my favorite ways to earn income because it felt so natural to recommend things that genuinely helped others. Affiliate marketing can help you make $10,000 a month too. Affiliate marketing is where you promote other people’s products and earn a commission when someone buys through your link. You can share affiliate links (also known as referral links) on your website, on social media, in emails, and more. And, there are affiliate links for everything out there – books, kitchen gear, clothing, furniture, travel, and even food! Recommended reading: What You Need To Know About Affiliate Marketing For Beginners 14. Create a membership site A membership site is a place where people pay to access special content or services online. You can sell things like online courses, videos, a forum, or expert advice. Membership sites can be on all different kinds of topics, such as personal finance, fitness, hobbies, crafts, business, travel, and more. You can set different price levels for your membership. Some people might pay $10 a month, while others could pay $50+ for more features. To make $10,000 a month, you’d need 1,000 members at $10 each or 100 members at $100 each. For example, I know someone who has a membership site for moms. In it, they have a forum for moms to ask questions and talk to one another. They also give a binder with helpful printables to manage a household, weekly meal plans, expert speakers who come in occasionally and host webinars, and more. Moms pay around $10 a month for this membership site and they have hundreds (maybe thousands?) of paying members each month! 15. Sell print on demand products If you want to make money without storing inventory, you should try selling print-on-demand products! This business lets you create custom items like T-shirts, mugs, and phone cases. You design the products, and a partner company, such as Printify, makes them when customers order (they’ll handle the printing and shipping for you). It’s that simple! You don’t have to worry about packaging or shipping anything yourself. As your business grows, you can possibly make $500 to $1,500 (or much more!) in monthly profit as a side hustle. Some full-time sellers even earn $50,000+ a year!

Write ebooks Writing ebooks can be a way to make $10,000 a month by sharing your knowledge on topics you’re passionate about or through stories that you’ve created, and earning money from it. Once your ebook is ready, you can sell it on platforms like Amazon. You can also sell it on your own website if you have one. One very popular niche to get into right now is romance novels. You can learn more at How to Make Money Self-Publishing Short Romance Novels on Amazon. Frequently Asked Questions Many people want to know how to earn $10,000 a month.
