  "text": "Air duct cleaning typically costs about $270 to $500, with an average cost of $388. Your cost depends on the number of vents, the type and size of ductwork, and where you live.How much should I pay for air duct cleaning?The price youâ€™ll pay for air duct cleaning depends on a number of factors:The number of vents you have. Vents usually cost around $35 each to clean but can range from $25 to $50 per vent.The amount of ductwork in your home. Because the cost of air duct cleaning is often based on a homeâ€™s total square footage. In general, costs run $0.15 to $0.30 per square foot.Labor costs. Air duct cleaners often charge $90 to $125 per hour, and an air duct cleaning job typically takes between three and eight hours to complete.Accessibility. If your ducts are particularly difficult to access, you may end up with additional labor charges.Type of ducts. Cleaning rigid metal ducts typically costs less than cleaning flex ducts because they are relatively simple to clean with basic equipment.Location. Duct cleaning services charge more in some regions of the country.Add-on services. Video inspections, preventive sprays, air duct coating or repairs will increase your total job cost.Additionally, if your duct-cleaning service discovers unexpected issues (or infestations) in your ducts, you can expect additional charges. For example:Pest removal usually ranges from $100 to $260.Rodent removal typically costs between $200 and $1,200.Mold and mildew removal can cost between $1,100 and $3,400.Asbestos removal generally costs between $5 and $20 per square foot.Can I clean my own air ducts?Itâ€™s possible to do some air duct cleaning on your own, but beware: generally a DIY approach only cleans the last 10 feet of each duct, you might not be able to dislodge all the debris in your ducts and what you do dislodge may move closer to the vents rather than toward a central unit. You probably wonâ€™t get things as clean as a professional can, and you might spread the dirt and germs around rather than remove them in some instances.If you opt for DIY air duct cleaning, youâ€™ll need a number of tools and supplies, which may include:Shop vacuum.10-foot extension hose for shop vacuum.Nylon bristle brush.Dryer vent cleaning brush with a 10-foot extender.Electric drill.Flashlight.Goggles.Mask.Ladder.Rags.ðŸ¤“Nerdy TipDIY air duct cleaning isnâ€™t without risk. Itâ€™s a messy job that could expose you to dangerous and/or germ-infested mold, rodent droppings, volatile organic compounds, pet dander, viruses, smog, mildew and other debris. Additionally, if you need to climb a ladder, you could fall and injure yourself. Finally, you risk inviting mold growth by introducing moisture into your ducts and damaging your HVAC components and ducts, particularly if you have flex ducts in your home.Air duct cleaning advantagesHaving your air ducts cleaned has a number of possible benefits, including:Improved energy efficiency and lower energy costs. Air duct cleaning may (or may not) help make your HVAC system more efficient, which might lower your energy bills.Possible improved indoor air quality. The air that blows into your living space may be cleaner, with less dust building up in your home.Possible improvement of allergy and asthma symptoms. Cleaning ducts may reduce your indoor exposure to allergens and irritants.A fresher smelling home. Air duct cleaning can help reduce or remove bad odors coming from your ducts.Air duct cleaning disadvantagesThere are some potential drawbacks to air duct cleaning to be aware of:Itâ€™s messy and invasive. The technician may have to drill holes in your walls or ceilings to access ducts, and you may be left with a lot of dust and debris to clean up after the job is done.It can be costly. This is especially true if you have a large home with many vents, or if you have issues with your ducts such as infestations, asbestos, mold or mildew.You may have to keep doing it. Dirt and debris may build up in your ducts again, and you may feel you need another cleaning.It takes time. The job usually takes several hours (or in some cases, a full day or more) to complete.You may have to move furniture. In order to create access to ducts, you may have to move heavy furniture and other personal belongings.Timing matters. You may need to schedule your air duct cleaning during a time when your heating or air conditioning system isnâ€™t being used.Is duct cleaning really worth it?According to the National Institutes of Health, thereâ€™s not sufficient evidence that routine air duct cleaning shows a clear benefit on indoor air quality, health or HVAC performance â€” even when contaminants are effectively removed from the duct system. In fact, in a number of cases in a 2010 review of scientific studies, post-cleaning levels of indoor air contaminants were higher than pre-cleaning levels.That said, there are certain circumstances when itâ€™s advisable to get your air ducts cleaned, including:Persistent or permanent water damage in your ducts.Slimy substances or microbial growth visible in ducts.Unpleasant odors coming from your ducts or HVAC.Dust being discharged from supply diffusers.Debris buildup in ducts to the point where it restricts airflow.Mold growth in ducts.Evidence of rodents or insects infesting your ducts.Can I get financing for a home repair or improvement?Your contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other â€” any maybe better â€” financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, as well as future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. Youâ€™ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isnâ€™t at risk if you miss payments, but youâ€™ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.Credit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. Thatâ€™s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, youâ€™ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Which financing option is best for me?The best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project youâ€™re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If itâ€™s something thatâ€™ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.On the flip side, if itâ€™s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you donâ€™t have much equity in your home.Some home improvement contractors offer their own financing options. Before taking this option, shop around and see how their offer compares with other loans.Regardless of what you choose, make sure you compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing options youâ€™re considering. This will ensure you get the best deal.",

HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. Youâ€™ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you\u0026#39;re using your home as collateral.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isnâ€™t at risk if you miss payments, but youâ€™ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. Thatâ€™s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase.
