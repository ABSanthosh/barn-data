  "description": "Ever wondered if you're making the right choice between a Traditional and Roth 401(k)? You're not alone. In this episode, Katie Gatti Tassin, host of MorningBrew’s Money with Katie podcast, joins us to tackle this common retirement savings dilemma. We deep-dive into the debate between using Traditional vs. Roth 401(k) accounts for retirement savings, in the context of: Future tax rates Tax complexities for small business owners and high earners Social Security uncertainty Stock-based compensation Incentives for business owners vs. employees Katie explains her strategy for maximizing retirement savings while minimizing taxes. She suggests that for some people in higher tax brackets, maxing out a traditional 401(k) and then investing the tax savings elsewhere might be the way to go. But as we dig deeper, it becomes clear that there's no one-size-fits-all answer. We explore the Traditional vs Roth question, discussing how your current income and expected retirement spending can affect your choices. It's not just about the math, though. The unpredictability of future tax rates and policies adds another layer of complexity to the decision. Social Security plays a major role, as well. We discuss its current funding situation and the challenges it might face in the future. This leads to a fascinating discussion about how AI might impact future costs and lifestyles. Could things actually get cheaper in the future? Taxes for high earners and small business owners is another focus. We break down some misconceptions about who falls into high tax brackets. It's not always as simple as it seems. Stock-based compensation is another hot topic. We discuss how it affects corporate decision-making and the wider economy. This leads to an interesting comparison of the incentives for business owners versus employees. Throughout the episode, we keep coming back to one key point: no matter which type of account you choose, the most important thing is to contribute as much as you can. Your contribution amount has a bigger impact on your retirement savings than the type of account you use. By the end of this interview, you'll have a better understanding of the factors that go into choosing between a Traditional and Roth 401(k). More importantly, you'll see how this decision fits into the bigger picture of retirement planning and overall financial health.",
