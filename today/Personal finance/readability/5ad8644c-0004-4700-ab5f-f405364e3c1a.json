  "text": "Walt Disney World just dropped a major deal for families planning a vacation ‚Äî and it‚Äôs one of its most generous offers in years.The Orlando, Florida resort announced a new promotion for families with young kids. For 2026, kids ages 3 to 9 will eat free when you purchase a Disney Dining Plan for the rest of your party and stay at one of more than 25 Disney Resort hotels. Unlike previous offers, you can combine the deal with other discounts, making it much more flexible and valuable.You'll be able to book 2026 Disney World trips with this deal starting Tuesday, April 22, 2025.‚úàÔ∏è LIMITED TIME OFFERGet the ‚Äòcheat codes‚Äô to using travel points and miles so you can spend less cash. üì• Sign up for our free newsletter before April 30 and enter to win a 1:1 travel rewards coaching session.How the Disney Dining Plan worksThe Disney Dining Plan is a prepaid meal program covering food and snacks during your stay. In 2026, you can choose from two tiers:Quick-Service Dining Plan: Two quick-service meals and one snack per night.Standard Dining Plan: One table-service meal, one quick-service meal and one snack per night.Quick-service meals include one entree and a drink (which can be alcoholic if you're 21 or over). Table-service meals include an entree, drink and dessert during lunch or dinner. Snacks cover items like popcorn, churros and ice cream. Both plans also include a refillable drink mug that can be used for refills at self-service beverage stations (typically serving soda, tea and coffee) at Disney Resort hotels.The Partysaurus Tex is a non-alcoholic drink made of lemonade, strawberry puree and a gummy worm garnish, served at the Roundup Rodeo BBQ based on \"Toy Story.\" (Photo by Sally French)Meals are loaded into your Disney account and can be redeemed at any time during your stay. You can use up more meals and snacks on some days and fewer on others, with unused meals rolling over until the last day of your visit. To redeem, you just flash your Disney Resort ID (a key card, MagicMobile pass or MagicBand, which is a wearable ticket on your wrist) and the meal is deducted from your account.With the 2026 offer, children receive the same tier of dining plan selected by the adults in their hotel room.Why the 2026 Disney Dining Plan offer is so goodYou can stack the free Disney Dining Plan deal with other offersMickey Mouse waffles. (Photo by Sally French)In the past, Disney‚Äôs free dining deals typically weren‚Äôt stackable. Guests had to choose between free dining or other discounts on hotels and tickets.For example, the current 2025 promotion offers a free dining plan for select stays at Disney Resorts Collection hotels ‚Äî but only if you book a minimum four-night, four-day package through Disney that includes a theme park ticket with Park Hopper benefits. The deal also can't be combined with other discounts, such as the 2025 limited-time deal for up to 30% off hotel rooms when you stay five nights or longer. Because of these limitations, NerdWallet recommends many families skip it. But this new one for 2026 is far more flexible. It doesn‚Äôt require a minimum night stay and allows you to pair the deal with other discounts, as long as you buy a dining plan for everyone in the room 10 and older. For some families, that could mean buying just one or two adult dining plans, which cost about $60 per adult per day for the Disney Quick-Service Dining Plan and about $100 for the Disney Dining Plan.Groups with many kids really winThere‚Äôs no limit to how many kids ages 3 to 9 qualify per room. Although Disney won‚Äôt allow kids to go full Peter Pan and check into a hotel with no adult present, a single adult traveling with five kids ages 3 to 9 could pay for just one dining plan ‚Äî and all five kids would eat free. But keep in mind that kids 10 and up are not eligible for the deal and will still need a full-price dining plan.Why Disney is sweetening the deal nowDisney‚Äôs timing here is no coincidence. Universal Orlando Resort‚Äôs much-anticipated Epic Universe theme park opens on May 22, 2025, and competition for theme park travelers is heating up.Epic Universe is set to introduce several major attractions, including Super Nintendo World and new expansions to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Disney World's new dining deal, which stacks with other offers and benefits larger families, appears to be a strategic response to growing competition.How to maximize your rewards",
