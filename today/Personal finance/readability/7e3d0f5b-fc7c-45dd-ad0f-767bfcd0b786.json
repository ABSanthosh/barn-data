You might think a 12-year-old’s options are limited, but there are actually many ways they can start making cash at this age. While they can’t work most regular jobs yet, there are plenty of fun and safe jobs that they may be able to try out. A 12-year-old can find jobs that match their skills and interests, from helping neighbors to selling crafts online. These jobs can teach them important skills like managing money and being responsible. I still remember the excitement of making my first few dollars from small gigs like babysitting when I was a kid. Those experiences taught me so much, and it was a lot of fun being able to make my own money. Recommended reading: 23 Best Business Ideas For Kids To Make Extra Money Can a 12 year old work legally? In most cases, 12-year-olds can’t work regular jobs legally in the U.S. The law sets 14 as the minimum age for most types of work (and there are a lot of rules that even go along with that age) to make sure that young workers are safe. Here’s a good place to learn more about the guidelines – U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor (the rules talk about school hours, if kids can work agricultural jobs, the number of hours they can work, if they need a work permit, and more. There are also state laws that you will want to look into). But, 12-year-olds can still make money in other ways, such as by doing smaller jobs for family, friends, and neighbors. It’s super important to stay safe while working, especially as a kid. Always: Make sure parents or guardians know what the 12-year-old is doing. Have them work with people you know and trust. Have a trusted adult close by. The job should have parental consent before the child starts working. It’s also important to make sure the 12-year-old knows they can always go to their guardian or parent for help without feeling awkward or afraid. You want them to feel open and comfortable, knowing they can talk about anything that comes up. This way, if they ever feel that something is off – like a situation with someone they’re working for – they’ll know they can come to you with questions and even stop the job if needed. Remember, school is the top priority! Work shouldn’t get in the way of studying, sleep, or fun. Best Jobs for 12 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 12-year-olds. 1. Babysitter Babysitting can be a good job for a responsible 12-year-old, allowing them to earn money while caring for younger kids in the neighborhood. Babysitters watch children while the parents are away, and this might include playing games, helping with homework, or preparing simple meals. To help them get started, you could ask around to see if any neighbors or family friends need a sitter. Letting neighbors know they’re available is also a good approach. I highly recommend making sure that the babysitter knows CPR and basic first aid so that they can make sure the children they are watching are safe. Starting with short jobs, like a few hours after school, is a great way for them to gain experience. As they become more comfortable, they may take on longer jobs on weekends or evenings. When I was younger, I started by watching my younger sister, which eventually turned into babysitting jobs for neighbors, family friends, and eventually families in the area. 2. Dog walker Dog walking can be a fun job for a 12-year-old who loves animals, and they can start by walking dogs for neighbors who live close by. Many pet owners are busy and appreciate extra help exercising their dogs, making this a great way for a child to earn money. They can charge per walk or per hour, depending on the arrangement. It’s important they feel comfortable around dogs and know how to handle them properly. If they’re new to dog walking, starting with smaller or well-behaved dogs can help them build confidence. I recently came across a flyer on a community board where a kid was advertising dog walking services. They were asking for around $5 for a 30-minute walk, with their parent tagging along to assist. It was simply a fun way for the child to gain some experience and learn about making money, and I found it to be such a sweet idea! 3. Yard work and lawn mowing Yard work can be a good way for a 12-year-old to earn money, especially if they enjoy being outdoors. They can help neighbors with tasks like mowing lawns, raking leaves, and pulling weeds. To get started, they can ask around to see if any neighbors or family friends need help with their yards. They could begin with easier tasks, like watering plants or picking up sticks. As they gain experience, they can take on bigger jobs like mowing lawns, with an adult showing them how to use lawn equipment safely, of course. They can charge different amounts based on the task, such as $10 for raking a small yard or $20 for mowing a lawn. 4. Paper route A paper route can be a great job for a responsible 12-year-old, giving them a chance to earn money while building time management skills. They’ll deliver newspapers to homes and businesses in the area, which teaches reliability and commitment. Since papers need to be delivered early, they’ll need to wake up on time to make sure they’re delivered before people leave for work or school. Today, most newspapers are delivered in large batches by adults driving cars. However, you could reach out to local newspaper companies to see if they have any delivery opportunities for kids. When I was younger, a friend of mine had a family paper route as a way to earn some extra money. She’d help with the deliveries, making a little bit for herself along the way. It wasn’t something she handled entirely on her own, but more of a family side hustle where everyone woke up early and helped. 5. Lemonade stand A lemonade stand can be a fun and profitable way for a 12-year-old to earn money. They can set up a table in the front yard or at local events to sell refreshing drinks (with permission, of course). On hot summer days, many people enjoy a cold glass of lemonade, making it a great business opportunity. They’ll need basic supplies like cups, lemons, sugar, and water to get started. There’s something classic about running a lemonade stand. My friends and I loved setting lemonade stands up during the summer. We learned how to talk to customers, count change, and make something people enjoyed. It was so exciting to earn our own money! 6. Pet sitting Pet sitters feed pets, provide fresh water, and play with them. They could also take dogs for walks or clean litter boxes for cats, depending on the pets’ needs. Now, I don’t recommend having your child stay alone at someone’s house for this, but you may be able to go with them during the day or evenings to help them take care of the pet, or you could have the pet brought over to your home. To help them get started, you could ask around to see if any neighbors or family friends need a pet sitter or help them in creating flyers to distribute in the neighborhood. 7. Car washing Car washing can be a fun way for a 12-year-old to earn money, especially during the summer. They can start by offering to wash neighbors’ cars on weekends. All they need are some basic supplies like sponges, car soap, and a hose, so it’s easy to get started. They could charge around $10 to $25 per car, depending on its size, and as they gain experience, they might add services like vacuuming or waxing for extra income. 8. Household chores Doing extra chores at home can be a way for a tween to earn money while contributing to the household that they already live in. They might ask if you’d be open to paying for additional tasks around the house. Some chores they could take on include washing dishes, cleaning bathrooms, watering plants, or vacuuming floors. Laundry is another chore they can handle at this age. They can learn to sort clothes, operate the washer and dryer, and fold everything neatly. For those interested in organizing, they could help clean out the garage, sort through old toys, or clean up closets. This can be a big help to the family and might even lead to a yard sale! If you have pets, caring for them can also be a rewarding chore. They can feed the animals, clean their areas, and even give them baths. Extra chores aren’t just a way for them to earn money; they’re a huge help to the family. Starting with small tasks for an allowance can make them feel more responsible, and it also teaches practical skills that will be useful throughout their life. 9. Tutoring younger kids Tutoring younger kids can be a great way for a 12-year-old to earn money, especially if they enjoy helping others learn. Many kids this age are good at explaining concepts to younger children. Tutors can help with subjects like math, reading, or other areas where elementary school students need help. It’s a rewarding way for them to share their knowledge and help other students. They can choose to tutor in person, either at someone’s home or even online. Online tutoring can be more convenient if transportation is a challenge as it allows them to work from home. Tutoring can also be a well-paying job, with rates around $10 to $25 per hour, depending on the subject and level of experience. When I tutored my younger sibling in reading and math, it not only helped them but also made me realize how much I enjoyed teaching and sharing what I knew. 10. Garage sale assistant If your 12-year-old is looking for a fun way to earn money, working as a garage sale assistant might be a perfect fit! They can help neighbors or family friends organize and run their sales. You could put up a flyer on a local bulletin board advertising this as a service in order to find paying jobs. Garage sale assistants can take on different tasks, like setting up tables and arranging items before the sale begins. During the sale, they could greet customers and help with handling money. At the end of the day, they’ll help with cleanup and packing away any unsold items. This job is great for 12-year-olds who are looking for jobs for the weekends or summer break since that is typically when garage sales take place. 11. Actor Acting can be an exciting job for a 12-year-old who loves performing. They could audition for roles in movies, TV shows, commercials, or theater productions. To help them get started, you could look for local casting calls and auditions. Many websites list opportunities for child actors, and joining a talent agency that specializes in working with young performers could open more doors.
