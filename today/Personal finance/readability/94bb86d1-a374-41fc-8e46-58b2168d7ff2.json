Freecash is a website where you can earn money by doing fun activities online. It’s like getting paid to play! You can make extra cash by taking surveys, trying out new apps, and even playing games on your phone or computer. Freecash started in 2020 (you can find my full Freecash review here). Since then, lots of people have joined and earned money. In fact, Freecash users have made over $75 million combined! Here’s how it works: Sign up for free Pick an activity you like Complete the task Get coins as a reward Every 1,000 coins equals $1.

Best Websites Like Freecash Here’s a quick list of the best sites like Freecash: Swagbucks KashKick InboxDollars PrizeRebel MyPoints Survey Junkie Branded Surveys Scrambly Below are the best websites like Freecash to make money. As you can see here, I have earned 109 gift cards from Swagbucks. This is an old screenshot, I’ve earned a few more since then. 1. Swagbucks Swagbucks is a rewards platform where you can make side cash online. I started using Swagbucks years ago, and it’s helped me earn extra cash from home or while traveling. I’ve personally earned over 100 free gift cards through Swagbucks, so I know it’s a real app that pays you! You can earn points called SB by doing easy tasks. These include taking surveys, watching videos, shopping for cash back, scanning receipts, and playing games. You can also get SB for shopping online or searching the web. It’s free to join and only takes a few minutes to sign up. The points you earn can be turned into free gift cards, such as to Amazon, Target, Visa, and PayPal. To play games on Swagbucks, just go to the “Play” tab after logging in. When I logged in, I saw over 20 games I could get paid to play, with a total reward value of $2,264.02 or 226,402 SB points. Swagbucks won’t make you rich, but it’s an easy way to get some extra spending money. You could use it for small treats or to help pay bills. Give it a try and see how much you can earn! If you join Swagbucks through my referral link, you can receive a $10 bonus. Recommended reading: Swagbucks Review 2. KashKick KashKick is a Get Paid To (GPT) site that pays you for doing simple tasks like taking surveys and playing games. It’s free to join and easy to use. One of the best things about KashKick is the variety of games you can play. You might try Monopoly GO, Yahtzee, or Bingo Blitz. Some games can even earn you over $100 if you reach certain levels. Example: Here’s how you can make money playing Monopoly Go on KashKick: Install the game (make sure to allow tracking on your device!) and reach Board 27 within 8 days to get $30. If you reach Board 42 in 12 days, you’ll earn an extra $40, and if you reach Board 71 in 24 days, you’ll get another $50. Altogether, you can earn $120! Surveys are another good way to earn on KashKick. You’ll answer questions about products and services, and each survey usually takes less than 20 minutes and pays between $1 and $5. When you’re ready to get paid, KashKick uses PayPal. You need to earn at least $10 before you can cash out. Please click here to sign up for KashKick for free. Recommended reading: KashKick Review 3.
