It seemed illogical to pay $30 a month for software that just offered a basic sales page, especially without any integrated email service provider. This was a stark contrast to my experience with platforms like ConvertKit, where I started with a free account until my subscriber count grew large enough where I had to pay. As I spent more time with Stan Store, my perspective began to shift. I realized that for someone completely new to online marketing, who might be overwhelmed by the complexities of building and creating a landing or sales page, Stan Store could actually make a lot of sense. It’s tailored for beginners, offering them a straightforward entry point into the world of digital marketing. Who is Stan Store For? So, who’s going to love Stan Store? Pretty much anyone aiming to make a buck online through digital products or services. If you’re like me, trying to turn those ‘link in bio’ clicks into actual sales, then Stan Store is your go-to. Let me break it down for you. Stan Store is a hit with a wide range of creators and businesses, but from my experience, it’s a total game-changer for: Content Creators, Influencers, Micro-influencers, and UGC Creators Instagrammers, TikTokers, YouTubers, X’rs Online Coaches, Mentors, and Teachers Digital Product Creators (Etsy, you’ve got competition) Social Media Managers and Content Managers Designers, Freelancers, and Small Digital Businesses And hey, even if you’re in the business of selling physical goods, Stan Store can be a killer tool for growing your email list or hosting online events. Just a heads up though – selling physical products directly through Stan Store isn’t on the table just yet. How Does Stan Store Work? Picture this: I’m on TikTok or Instagram Stories, chatting about my latest digital product – let’s say it’s an eBook or a PDF. In the past, I’d direct my followers to the ‘link in my bio’, which would then send them off to another site, like my website. There, they’d have to play detective to find the product I was talking about, or sit through endless page loads. But with Stan Store, things get a whole lot smoother. The ‘link in my bio’ is now the store itself. Followers can hit that link, buy what they want right there and then, without being shunted off to a different site. The best part? They can hop right back to Instagram or TikTok without feeling like they ever left. It’s all about keeping it simple and seamless – and that’s what Stan Store nails perfectly. Here’s a screenshot of my wife’s personal Stan Store: We’re still not a big fan of their email signup process so for now our opt-in page (squeeze page) is hosted on Kajabi. But my wife is selling our Digital Product Quickstart Guide on Stan Store. Here’s how the sales page looks: Behind the scenes of our sales page is a payment processor and the ability to deliver the digital product with ease. That’s what makes Stan Store so attractive. You can literally start selling your very own digital product in a matter of minutes. Why Stan Store Stands OutWhat truly sets Stan Store apart is its efficiency – you can begin selling your own digital products in just a matter of minutes. Stan Store Features Overview Stan Store is packed with features designed to make the life of a digital creator easier and more profitable. Whether you’re a coach, influencer, or digital product creator, here’s what Stan Store brings to the table: Mobile \u0026 Desktop Optimized Store: Your store looks great and works seamlessly on any device, ensuring a smooth shopping experience for your audience. Calendar Invites \u0026 Bookings Product: Easily manage appointments and bookings directly through your store. Analytics: Get insights into your store’s performance to make data-driven decisions. Unlimited Course Products: Offer as many courses as you like, with no restrictions. 1-Tap Checkout: A streamlined checkout process that makes purchasing a breeze for your customers. Recurring Subscription Products: Ideal for memberships and ongoing services, this feature allows for regular income. Audience/Newsletter Builder: Grow your audience and keep them engaged with integrated newsletter tools. Stan Store Plans: Creator vs. Creator Pro Creator Plan The Creator plan, priced at $29 per month (or $300 per year with a 20% discount), is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to jumpstart their online business. It includes all the essential tools you need: Mobile \u0026 Desktop Optimized Store Calendar Invites \u0026 Bookings Product Analytics Unlimited Course Products 1-Tap Checkout Recurring Subscription Products Audience/Newsletter Builder This plan is perfect for creators who are just beginning to monetize their online presence and need a comprehensive, yet straightforward set of tools to get started. Creator Pro Plan For those ready to take their business to the next level, the Creator Pro plan is available at $99 per month (or $948 per year with a 20% discount). It includes everything in the Creator plan, plus advanced features for optimizing conversions and offering more to your customers: Advanced Pricing \u0026 Payment Plans Discount Codes Limit Quantity Payment Plans Order Bumps \u0026 Upsells Funnel Builder Affiliate Share Feature Email Marketing The Creator Pro plan is tailored for creators who are looking to expand their offerings, optimize their sales process, and engage more deeply with their audience. Benefits of Using Stan Store Convenience and Accessibility The convenience and accessibility of Stan Store are what eventually changed my initial skepticism. The platform allows anyone, regardless of their technical skill, to quickly set up a landing or sales page. This ease of use is a crucial factor for many users, especially those who lack the time or technical expertise to navigate more complex systems. Competitive Pricing and Deals The initial pricing, though seemingly high, is justified by the platform’s simplicity and effectiveness, particularly for its target audience – the absolute beginner in online marketing. The recent addition of an email service provider at a higher tier adds more value, making it a more comprehensive tool. Drawbacks of Stan Store Limitations in Product Availability One of the criticisms I had of Stan Store was its limited range of features. While its simplicity is its strength, it also means that users looking for more advanced features might find Stan Store lacking. This limitation can be a significant drawback for users as their businesses and marketing skills evolve. Stan Store Alternatives In the journey of online entrepreneurship, it’s crucial to explore various platforms to see what aligns best with your business needs. While Stan Store has been a solid choice for me, I’ve also had experiences with other platforms worth mentioning: Shopify: Shopify is a robust platform for creating online stores. It’s feature-rich and offers a lot of flexibility for those looking to build a detailed and extensive online shop. WooCommerce: Ideal for WordPress users, WooCommerce seamlessly integrates with your existing site, transforming it into a fully functional e-commerce platform. It’s versatile but can be a bit complex, especially for beginners. Etsy: Etsy is the go-to marketplace for unique, handmade, or vintage items. It’s less about building your own store and more about joining a vibrant, existing marketplace. Teachable and Thinkific: Both are excellent for creating and selling online courses. They offer a range of tools tailored for educators and coaches, focusing on course creation and student engagement. Gumroad: Simple and straightforward, Gumroad is perfect for independent creators selling digital products like books, music, or art directly to their audience. Kajabi: Kajabi is an all-in-one platform offering tools for online courses, marketing, and website building. It’s ideal for those offering educational content and looking for a comprehensive solution.

Each platform has its strengths, and the best choice depends on your specific business needs and goals. Is Stan Store Worth it? After diving deep into Stan Store and comparing it with its alternatives, the big question remains: Is Stan Store worth it? Based on my experience and the insights I’ve gathered, my answer leans towards a yes, especially for a specific audience. Stan Store stands out for its sheer simplicity and focus on digital content creators. If you’re just starting out or find yourself overwhelmed by the complexities of more advanced platforms, Stan Store offers a welcoming and straightforward path. The ease of setting up a sales or landing page, combined with the platform’s focus on digital products, makes it an attractive option for creators who want to monetize their content without the hassle. The pricing, initially a point of skepticism for me, actually makes sense when you consider the target audience and the features offered. For beginners and those not ready to navigate the complexities of platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce, Stan Store’s $29 monthly fee for the Creator plan is a reasonable investment. And for those looking to scale up, the Creator Pro plan, despite its higher price, brings in advanced features that could justify the cost as your business grows. If you’re not sure Stan Store is a good fit, the 14-day free trial might be exactly what you need. Bottom Line – Stan Store Honest Review In conclusion, while Stan Store might not be the one-size-fits-all solution for every online entrepreneur, it certainly has carved out its niche. It’s a platform that understands and caters to the needs of digital content creators, making it a worthwhile consideration for those in its target demographic. As with any tool, it’s about finding the right fit for your specific needs, and for many creators, Stan Store could be just that. To try Stan Store for free, click here for a 14-day trial. Stan Store is best suited for digital content creators, including online coaches, influencers, micro-influencers, UGC creators, and digital product creators.

The integration allows creators to direct their social media audience straight to their Stan Store via a 'link in bio', facilitating immediate purchases without leaving the social media app. Stan Store is designed with simplicity in mind, making it extremely user-friendly for beginners.
