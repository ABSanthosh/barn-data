  "text": "United Airlines is leaning into luxury with its newest Boeing 787-9 planes. The new interiors, which United is calling United Elevated, are a clear signal from United that it believes premium demand is here for the long haul. United Polaris business class seats will become suites with sliding doors. Flyers willing to pay even more will be able to sit in the new ultra-exclusive Polaris Studio suites, which include more space than a standard Polaris seat, elevated amenities, and a caviar amuse-bouche.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Beyond business class changes, all cabins are getting larger seatback screens.The first new aircraft is scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2025, with the first international commercial flights expected in 2026 on United‚Äôs routes from San Francisco to Singapore and London. The airline expects to have at least 30 of these planes by 2027, so it may be a while before passengers get to experience the new cabins.United invited me to a launch event to check out the designs for the new interiors. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know.Seating layoutAccording to United, the new planes will feature:Eight United Polaris Studio suites (two rows in a 1-2-1 configuration, meaning one seat by each window and two in the middle).56 United Polaris standard suites (14 rows in a 1-2-1 configuration).35 United Premium Plus seats (five rows in a 2-3-2 configuration).33 United Economy Plus seats and 90 United Economy seats (15 rows total in a 3-3-3 configuration).Its existing 787-9 planes have 48 business class seats (the new layout will have a 33% increase in business class seating), 21 premium economy seats (66% increase), 39 Economy Plus seats (15% decrease) and 149 economy seats (40% decrease).United Polaris StudioUnited is introducing a business-plus product called United Polaris Studio, a way for the airline to monetize the extra space typically found in bulkhead seats (rows 1 and 9). JetBlue Airways does the same thing, charging more for its front-row Mint Studio seats.(Photo by Benjamin Din)But passengers aren‚Äôt just paying for extra space. They‚Äôll get upgraded amenities and more dining options. That includes an exclusive amuse-bouche of Ossetra caviar with creme fraiche on toast and a glass of Laurent-Perrier Cuvee Rose.These suites will be 25% larger than standard Polaris suites and come with a 27-inch 4K OLED screen (a five-inch improvement over JetBlue‚Äôs Mint Studio screens, which they advertise as ‚Äúthe largest TV on a U.S. airline‚Äù). Enhanced amenities include thicker slippers, softer pajamas, a bigger amenity kit with extra products and premium noise-canceling headphones. I tested out a pair, which are powered by Meridian technology, and the audio quality was excellent.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Bedding will largely be the same as what you‚Äôd find at regular Polaris seats, but Polaris Studio passengers will get an additional velvet accent pillow. While I usually find hotel accent pillows unnecessary, this one was soft and surprisingly comfortable.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Six of the eight suites will include an ottoman (except the middle seats in row 1), where an additional passenger can sit and chat with you midflight. While a great idea, I found the space a little tight for two people (it‚Äôs still an airplane, after all). United will also include a pack of playing cards at each Polaris Studio seat, in case you need another way to pass the time.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Polaris Studio guests will also get access to perks reserved for United's invite-only Global Services passengers. That includes access to Global Reception check-in areas and pre-boarding. They‚Äôre also eligible for United‚Äôs tarmac transfer program, where a United agent meets you on arrival when you have a tight connection and drives you to your next gate ‚Äî although the odds of actually getting one are probably slim to none for most.One downside of these seats is their location. Because they‚Äôre by the bulkhead, they‚Äôre also next to lavatories and galleys, where flight attendants prep for meal services and chat, sometimes loudly. I‚Äôve never had issues sitting in rows 1 and 9 (in fact, they‚Äôre my favorite places to sit), but it‚Äôs something worth considering if you‚Äôre a light sleeper or sensitive to noise and light.United didn‚Äôt have any details to share on how much extra it will cost to book Polaris Studio seats. United PolarisAll Polaris seats will have sliding doors, making seat selection less of a hassle on the new planes. It also means you will no longer have to contort your body into awkward positions to reach your seat. Currently, seats alternate between rows where one row is slanted and exposed to the aisle, while the other is more private and faces forward. (Photo by Benjamin Din)With the new layout, all window seats will face toward the window, while the two middle seats will either face the aisle or each other, separated by a privacy divider that can be lowered to bed height. The Polaris cabin will be split into two sections of eight rows each, so if you want a middle seat facing the aisle, pick a seat in rows 9 to 16. Otherwise, middle seats in rows 1 to 8 will face each other.Standard seats will include 19-inch 4K OLED screens, which are larger than the existing onboard offering.ü§ìNerdy TipCouples traveling together (and who enjoy each other‚Äôs company) will want to select middle seats angled toward the aisle, as these will make it easier to carry on a conversation when the divider is down.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Seat designNew features include a raised cubby to store your headphones, as well as multiple ways to charge your phone, including wirelessly. There‚Äôs also a small digital screen to adjust the lighting and seat position.(Photo by Benjamin Din)The design touches in the new Polaris suites help the cabin feel brighter, from the wood grain trims to the light-gray wool-blend fabric that replaces the traditional navy. However, it‚Äôs United, so the blue is still there, with soft velvet fabric lining the area behind the seat in a darker tone and the more traditional United blue lining the cubby.‚ÄúThe use of colors is really important to warm up the aircraft relative to what we've done in the past,‚Äù United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said at the event. ‚ÄúSo you see this awesome wood look that I think just brings this aircraft into today's age and it just makes it look amazing.‚ÄùAnother fun Easter egg: The United globe logo is featured on the seat itself.(Photo by Benjamin Din)AmenitiesWith the new changes, United will also be replacing its Therabody amenity kits onboard with Perricone MD-branded kits. Beyond the standard skincare items, Polaris Studio kits will be larger and also include skincare products from the brand‚Äôs Cold Plasma Plus+ line.(Photo by Benjamin Din)The new planes will also include a self-serve snack bar, allowing passengers to grab a quick bite or drink in between meals.(Photo courtesy of United Airlines)United Premium PlusUnited is giving its Premium Plus seats the Polaris touch, adding quartzite cocktail tables and upgrading the seatback screens to 16 inches.It‚Äôs also saying goodbye to its signature ‚Äúpurple seats‚Äù ‚Äî a familiar feature to frequent flyers ‚Äî and adopting new colors more consistent with United‚Äôs new branding. This new three-color design, which extends into the economy cabin for a cohesive look, is unlike any other airline seat I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it in action.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Other features include a water bottle holder, headphone holders, and a privacy divider with a built-in reading light. While the existing premium economy seats are comfortable, there isn‚Äôt a lot of space to put things, so the added storage is a welcome improvement. In addition to Bluetooth connectivity, passengers will also be able to wirelessly charge their phones ‚Äî just like in the business class cabin. The added seatback tray below the screen also includes a slot to put your glasses, which I thought was a nice addition.(Photo by Benjamin Din)United economy seatsEven economy is getting some upgrades, despite losing a significant amount in overall seats. (Photo by Benjamin Din)All economy seats will come with 13-inch 4K OLED screens, which United is touting as the largest in the world. If you‚Äôve ever flown in (or seen from afar) United‚Äôs Premium Plus cabin, those screens are also 13 inches, so this is a major upgrade for economy.As someone who is in the back of the plane more often than up front, I‚Äôm a big fan of this change.(Photo by Benjamin Din)Each seat will have Bluetooth connectivity, while each row will include six power outlets.
