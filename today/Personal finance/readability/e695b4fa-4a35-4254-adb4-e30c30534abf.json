Whether it’s groceries, travel, electronics, or everyday essentials, we’re all making purchases throughout the year. But what if I told you there’s an easy way to get paid for shopping for the things you’re already buying? That’s where cashback apps like ShopBack come in. ShopBack helps you earn real money when you shop online, making it an easy way to save hundreds of dollars a year. ShopBack was started in 2014 and has helped over 45 million shoppers around the world! I personally made $35.19 just by signing up and making two simple purchases, and I actually spent less than that (I only spent $24.29), meaning I made money just by shopping. The best part? It took almost no effort – I simply signed up, used the $30 sign-up bonus here, and followed ShopBack’s easy cashback process. If you’re already shopping at places like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, DoorDash, and Expedia, why not earn money back on every purchase? New users (like you!) can get a $30 sign-up bonus when they register with ShopBack using the promo code SENSE by clicking here! It’s free, easy, and totally worth it! (Note: Code is case sensitive, all in CAPS) How to Save $200 a Year on Things You’re Already Buying Online Below is how you can save hundreds of dollars each year by using this cashback site. How cashback works (it’s super easy!) Earning cashback with ShopBack is simple, and if you’re already shopping online, there’s no reason not to use it: Start shopping through ShopBack – Instead of going directly to a store, visit the ShopBack website, app, or browser extension first. Click through to your favorite online store – Shop like normal (and follow the rules stated on the ShopBack store page to make sure it’s tracked properly), and your cashback will be tracked. Cashback is confirmed – Once the return period is over, your earnings are verified. Withdraw your earnings once you hit $5 – Cash out via PayPal. That’s it! There’s no catch – just an easy way to get money back on your purchases. As you can see, I spent $24.29 on Amazon, and I made $35.19 back on Shopback, which means I actually made $10.90 by shopping online and got both of my purchases for free. How I made money shopping on Amazon with ShopBack’s sign-up deal I love testing out money-saving hacks, so I signed up for ShopBack to see if it really works. Here’s what happened: I received a $30 sign-up bonus just for creating an account and making my first purchase. I earned $4.99 cashback from my first Amazon order using the ShopBack app. I earned $0.20 cashback from a second Amazon order (I made the second Amazon order right after the first so that I could reach the $5 minimum in order to cash out) Total earnings? $35.19 – for buying things I was already going to buy! If you’re an Amazon shopper, you should definitely take advantage of ShopBack’s Amazon cashback offer. You can earn up to $4.99 cashback on your first order and $0.20 for every additional order (this deal isn’t always around, but they have different promotions on different online stores all the time that you can use instead). It may seem small at first, but these savings add up over time – especially when combined with other deals. New users get a $30 sign-up bonus when they register with ShopBack using the promo code SENSE by clicking here! (Note: Code is case sensitive, all in CAPS. When you sign up for ShopBack using the promo code SENSE, you’ll receive a $30 sign-up bonus, which can be withdrawn after earning at least $5 in confirmed cashback and adding your withdrawal details on ShopBack.) How much you can save in a year (real-life example) To give you an idea of how much you could realistically earn, let’s say you shop online regularly – here’s how your cashback could add up (the percentages vary depending on the week, so it may be different for you): Amazon: Initial purchase ($4.99 cashback) + 5 additional purchases ($0.20 each) = $5.99+ Walmart: $100 monthly spend at 0.7% cashback (but sometimes up to 20%) = $50+ Best Buy: $500 annual spend at 3.5% cashback (but sometimes up to 20%) = $15+ Expedia: $1,500 annual spend at 3% cashback = $45 DoorDash: $50 monthly spend at $2 cashback (but sometimes up to 20%) = $30+ Old Navy: $500 annual spend at 3% cashback = $15 Columbia Sportswear: $100 monthly spend at 6% cashback = $72 And that doesn’t even include extra savings from promo codes, flash sales, and seasonal deals that ShopBack users often stack on top of their cashback earnings. Bonus Ways to Save Even More While earning cashback is a great way to save money, you can take it even further by combining it with other smart shopping strategies. Here are some more ways to increase your savings when shopping online: 1. Stack cashback with credit card rewards If you’re using a cashback or travel rewards credit card, you can double dip on savings by earning rewards on top of ShopBack’s cashback. For example: If your credit card gives you 2% cashback on online purchases and ShopBack offers 6% cashback, you’ll effectively be getting 8% back on that purchase. If you have a travel rewards card, you can use your cashback to offset travel expenses like flights or hotels. Tip: Many credit cards offer special quarterly bonus categories (like 5% cashback on Amazon or grocery stores). Check your card’s rewards calendar and use it strategically to maximize your savings. 2. Complete shopping quests for extra bonuses ShopBack regularly has Shopping Quests, which are special promotions that give you extra cashback when you complete certain tasks. Examples of Shopping Quests include: Get a $5 bonus when you make your first purchase using the ShopBack browser extension. Earn a $15 bonus when you spend $200 across travel brands. Receive a $15 bonus when you spend $50 at Best Buy. These stack on top of normal cashback rates, so they’re a great way to increase your earnings easily. Just check the Quests section in the ShopBack app before making a purchase so that you can see what is currently available to you. 3. Use ShopBack’s browser extension to never miss a deal One of the easiest ways to make sure you’re always earning cashback is by installing the ShopBack browser extension. Here’s why it’s helpful: Instant cashback alerts – If you visit an online store that gives cashback, the extension will notify you and remind you to activate your savings. Tracks your purchases – No need to manually visit ShopBack before shopping – it activates cashback automatically. How the shipping rebates look with the browser extension. 4. Take advantage of shipping rebates Hate paying for shipping? So do I! Thankfully, ShopBack has shipping rebates that help you eliminate delivery fees on select purchases. Here’s how it works: New ShopBack users get 2 x $2.99 shipping rebates that can be used on purchases from Walmart, eBay, Petco, and more. Existing users can continue earning shipping rebates by completing Shopping Quests or using certain store promotions.
