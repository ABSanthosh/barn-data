Looking for a job as a 14-year-old can be exciting – it’s a great way to start earning money and gain some early work experience. There are plenty of options out there, both in person and online, that can fit their interests and skills. I started my first job at 14, and I worked around 36 hours a week during the summer. It paid me $10 an hour and I loved being able to make my own money. Recommended reading: 23 Business Ideas For Teens To Make Extra Money Can a 14 year old work legally? Yes, 14-year-olds can work legally in many places. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets 14 as the minimum age for most nonfarm jobs. But there are rules about what jobs they can do and when they can work. These rules help keep them safe and make sure work doesn’t get in the way of school. Here’s a good place to learn more about the rules – U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor. For example, here are some rules that you may come across (this can vary depending on your state): They cannot work during school hours. They cannot work more than 3 hours on a school day. They cannot work more than 18 hours in a school week. During summer and holidays, they can work up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week. They’ll also most likely need to get a work permit from their school or local government office for more traditional jobs (such as at a fast food restaurant). This shows their employer that they’re old enough to work legally. It’s important to stay safe when wanting to make money. Always: Make sure parents/guardians are aware of what the child is doing. Have them work with people you know. Have an adult you trust nearby. It’s important to make sure the teenager understands they can always approach their guardian or parent for help without feeling uneasy. You want them to feel secure and comfortable discussing any issues that might come up. This way, if something feels off – such as an interaction with someone they’re working for – they’ll know they can bring it up, ask questions, and, if needed, walk away from the job. Best Jobs for 14 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 14-year-olds. 1. Babysitter Babysitting can be a great job for a responsible 14-year-old because many parents look for trustworthy teens to watch their children after school or on weekends. Babysitters keep kids safe, play with them, help with homework, and more. They may also make snacks or put younger kids to bed. Babysitting often pays well, around $10 to $20 per hour, which is higher than many other teen jobs. They also get to choose when they want to work. Babysitting is a wonderful job for teens who enjoy spending time with kids. I still remember starting my first real babysitting job at 14 (where I didn’t know the family but found them on a bulletin board in my local area) – earning my own money felt amazing. 2. Dog walker Dog walking can be a fun way for a responsible 14-year-old to make money. They get to spend time outdoors and enjoy being around friendly dogs! Many pet owners need help exercising their dogs, especially during the day. As a dog walker, teens can take the dogs on walks around the neighborhood. Typical prices for dog walking are about $10 to $15 for a 30-minute walk. As they gain more experience, they may be able to raise their rates. 3. Lemonade stand owner Running a lemonade stand can be a fun and rewarding way for a 14-year-old to make money. It’s a classic summer job that lets them try being their own boss. This job can be especially fun during summer months when people are looking for refreshing drinks, and it allows teens to work close to home with the support of family. Plus, setting up a stand is a flexible option that lets them choose their own hours, making it perfect to fit around school and other activities. And, no, 14 isn’t too old for a lemonade stand at all! Running a lemonade stand at this age can still be a fun and valuable experience. At 14, kids can bring a bit more creativity and business sense to their stand, making it even more successful. They might experiment with new flavors, better signage, or even offer other treats like cookies or snacks to make more money. 4. Garden assistant Being a garden assistant can be a great job for a 14-year-old who enjoys the outdoors. They can help people take care of plants and flowers in their yards, such as by watering plants, pulling weeds, or planting new flowers. They could also help spread mulch or trim bushes. 5. Paper delivery person Being a paper delivery person can be a good job for a 14-year-old. These days, most newspapers are delivered in bulk by adults driving cars. Still, you might want to check with local newspaper companies to see if they have any delivery jobs available for kids. Growing up, I had a friend whose family took on a paper route to bring in a bit of extra income. She would help out with the deliveries, earning a small amount for herself in the process. It wasn’t something she did all on her own – it was more like a family side project where everyone pitched in together. I went with her a few times and they would pay me as well! 6. Pet sitter Pet sitting can be a fun way for a responsible 14-year-old to make money. They get to spend time with animals and help pet owners who are away from home. Pet sitters feed pets, give them water, brush pets, and play with them. They could also take dogs for walks or clean litter boxes for cats. Pet sitting is flexible, fitting easily around their school schedule. They can work after school or on weekends. A few years ago I needed a pet sitter for my two dogs. I found a wonderful family to do it. It was mainly the teenagers who were watching my dogs and playing with them, but the parents were home as well (I brought my dogs to their house and they stayed there for one week). My dogs had a great time, and the teens were able to make some extra money! 7. Tutor for younger kids Tutoring younger kids can be a great job for a responsible 14-year-old. They can help elementary school students with homework and studies in subjects like math, reading, or science. To get started, they could ask teachers if they know any families in need of tutors. Putting up flyers in your neighborhood or at the local community center can also help find clients. Tutoring usually pays well, with rates around $10 to $15 per hour (or more), depending on experience and the subject. 8. Errand runner Some errands they might handle include grocery shopping, picking up dry cleaning, or mailing packages. They could also walk dogs, water plants, or do simple yard work. Setting clear prices is important. For example, they might charge $10 for a quick errand or $20 for a longer task. Make sure they discuss the details with clients before starting any job. 9. Social media assistant If your 14-year-old is skilled at Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook, they might be able to turn those social media skills into a job as a social media assistant! Many small businesses need help managing their social media accounts. As a social media assistant, they could post updates, respond to comments, and create fun content. They might make graphics, take photos, or record short videos. Some assistants also help track how well posts are performing. 10. Plant waterer and sitter If your 14-year-old enjoys nature and has a green thumb, they could make money by taking care of plants for people who are away from home. Their main tasks would include watering plants and making sure they stay healthy. They might need to visit homes every few days to check on the plants. Some plant sitters also do small tasks like collecting mail or turning lights on and off, helping make the house look lived-in while the owners are away. 11. Car washer Being a car washer can be a fun job for a 14-year-old who enjoys working outside and making cars look shiny and clean. Starting a car washing business doesn’t need much – usually, they can start with just soap, water, and some cleaning tools. 12. House cleaner House cleaning can be a good job for a responsible 14-year-old. They can start by helping neighbors or family friends clean up their homes. Typical tasks might include dusting, vacuuming, mopping floors, and wiping down surfaces. They could also help with laundry or organizing closets. 13. Garage sale organizer If your 14-year-old is looking to make money and help neighbors, becoming a garage sale organizer might be a great job for them! This role lets them use their organizing skills to set up and run garage sales. As a garage sale organizer, they would sort through items people want to sell, arrange them neatly on tables, and put price tags on them. They might also make signs to advertise the sale and help customers during the event. 14. Amusement parks Amusement parks can be a great place for 14-year-olds to get work experience. Many theme parks hire young teens for different jobs, like working as hosts, selling tickets, helping in guest relations, or being an attendant. Some parks only open in the summer, so your teen would probably want to apply before school ends. This could be a good way for them to earn money during summer break. One popular amusement park is Six Flags. Six Flags typically hires starting at 15 years of age, but you may be able to call them or send an email to see what the age is that the local Six Flags near you hires at. 15. Craft seller on Etsy Selling crafts on Etsy can be a fun way to make money as a 14-year-old. Etsy is an online marketplace for handmade and unique items. They can sell things they create, like jewelry, paintings, or knitted scarves. It’s a great option if they enjoy making art or crafts in their free time. To start selling on Etsy, your 14-year-old will need your help because Etsy requires sellers to be at least 18 years old. However, with your supervision, they can open a shop at 13. It’s also important to know that the account must be registered in your name, and you will be responsible for all activities on the account (such as handling financial information and making sure that everything runs smoothly). Not long ago, I bought some beautiful bead earrings from a young girl. I got to watch her create them right in front of me, which made the experience even more special. She priced each set at around $10, and I thought it was a fantastic and creative way for her to start a small business. 16. Fast food Fast food restaurants can be good places for 14-year-olds to find their first job. Many chains hire teens for entry-level positions. Your child might work as a cashier, taking orders and handling payments. Other roles could include preparing food in the kitchen or cleaning dining areas. Popular chains like McDonald’s and Burger King sometimes hire 14-year-olds (unfortunately, Chick-fil-A typically starts at 16 years old). 17. Dishwasher at a restaurant Working as a dishwasher at a restaurant can be a great job for a 14-year-old. They will be responsible for cleaning dishes, utensils, and kitchen equipment. They might start at minimum wage, but some places pay more. As they gain experience, they could have opportunities to move up to other kitchen roles or even serving positions. My husband’s first real job was as a dishwasher at a local restaurant when he was around 13 or 14 years old. Frequently Asked Questions Many 14-year-olds want to start working and earning money.
