  "text": "Lead Bank (pronounced \"leed\") is a community bank and financial technology company based in Kansas City, Missouri. In addition to offering its own lineup of checking and savings accounts and loan options, Lead also partners with companies to offer lending products, bank accounts, and debit and credit cards. The company promotes itself as an innovation-first partner and has received awards for its cutting-edge products. Its portfolio of credit cards does indeed include unique options with innovative features: from a card that offers free pet insurance to another that allows cardholders to link their health care savings account (HSA), among other rare benefits. Here's a closer look at Lead Bank's notable credit card offerings.Atlas CardFitting for those who value the most exclusive experiences, the Atlas Card is a charge card that offers luxury benefits like complimentary Priority Pass lounge access, Erewhon Cafe membership and access to personal concierge services, to name a few. And it comes with a polished metal exterior to boot. The card charges a sky-high annual fee of $1,000, which is significantly higher than what other premium cards on the market cost, yet it doesnâ€™t come with a welcome bonus to offset any of that hefty fee. Atlas cardholders earn the following rewards: 5 points per $1 spent on BLADE, a helicopter, jet and seaplane charter service.3 points per $1 spent in your top eligible spending category from a list of options, including dining, flights, auto services, hotels, nightlife, fashion, groceries and more.3 points per $1 spent on hotel bookings through Atlas Hotels.1 point per $1 on other eligible purchases. Rewards can be redeemed for luxury hotel stays and statement credits. The Atlas Card is membership-only, and you must request an invitation to apply, which requires providing your contact information and estimated monthly spending. Lane Healthcare Spending Card If you have a large medical expense to finance that's not covered by insurance, the Healthcare Spending Card can be a useful option. The $0-annual-fee card, offered by financial technology company Lane Health, offers 0% financing when you use it for certain hospital and health care-related expenses and pay it back within its set amount of time. Specifically, holders can get 0% financing when they use their card to pay for qualifying hospital bills â€” which Lane defines as services at general hospitals, psychiatric hospitals and specialty hospitals â€” and pay off the charges within 12 months. Similarly, non-hospital health care expenses (dental and vision procedures, medications, pharmaceutical products, urgent care centers, medical equipment and more) are also eligible for 0% financing when repaid in one- or four-month repayment plans. But keep in mind that cardholders can incur costly loan origination and periodic finance fees if they carry a balance past their repayment periods. Another notable highlight is that Lane cardholders who have an HSA can link their account to their cards. This means that HSA holders can use their tax-free dollars to finance a medical procedure if necessary, using one of Laneâ€™s no-interest installment plans. Nibbles credit cardImage courtesy of NibblesThe main selling point of the Nibbles card is its pet insurance feature. Cardholders can get pet insurance for one pet (more pets can be added for an additional cost) on up to $10,000 in yearly health coverage for accidental injury and illness, which can be used at any licensed vet across the U.S. The company offers 80% coverage and a maximum deductible of $500. The card does charge a high annual fee of $249, but the included pet coverage can easily defray that cost and save pet owners on insurance costs overall. Note that furry friends that are older or have pre-existing health conditions might not meet Nibblesâ€™ eligibility criteria for pet insurance. In addition to the valuable and rare pet insurance perk, the Nibbles card earns 3% cash back on pet-related expenses like pet food, dog walking, grooming, training services, vet bills and more. The card also offers 1% back for all other spending. Self CardThe secured Self VisaÂ® Credit Card is ideal for those with thin or poor credit. There's no hard inquiry on your credit report when you apply, meaning your credit scores won't suffer any temporary ding. And the card reports your payment history to all three major credit bureaus, which is crucial for credit-building. You'll need to put down a $100 security deposit, but that's lower than what other secured credit cards typically require. And if you can't afford that amount upfront, there's also an option to cover the deposit over time (though it requires opening a separate installment loan first, meaning you won't get the card immediately).On the downside, the card charges an annual fee of $0 intro first year, $25 thereafter, which can be a barrier for some. Plus, it charges a late fee of up to $15, a return fee of up to $15 per failed payment from a bank account, and an expedited payment fee of $3.50 when you pay your credit card balance with a debit card.Note that if you have the secured card for six months and maintain a good payment history, you can apply for the unsecured Self Plus Credit Card. But that card charges a $35 annual fee, and applying for it will trigger a hard inquiry on your credit. ðŸ¤“Nerdy TipThe secured Self VisaÂ® Credit Card can be issued by either Lead Bank or First Century Bank. Are Lead Bank credit cards right for you?Lead Bank-issued cards offer niche benefits that can be useful if you're in the market for highly specific rewards or benefits. For example, pet owners whose animals qualify for the Nibbles cardâ€™s rare pet insurance feature might find the card extremely valuable. But those looking for less specific or more flexible benefits should first consider a general rewards credit card, which will be more useful for a larger segment of people.",
