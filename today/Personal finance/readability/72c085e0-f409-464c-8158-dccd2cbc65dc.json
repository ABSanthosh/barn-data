Most of us have things we no longer use, like old phones, extra shoes, clothes we haven’t worn in years, and even gift cards stuffed in a drawer. Instead of letting those items get dusty, you could turn them into extra money. Whether you need to make extra money as quickly as possible, or if you are looking to clean out your home, I think selling your stuff can be a great thing to do. In today’s article, I’m sharing the easiest items to sell that you probably already own. You might even have something worth $1,000 sitting in your home right now! 15 Easiest Items To Sell That You Already Own Here’s a list of the easiest items to sell that you already own. Recommended reading: Make Extra Cash By Learning How To Sell Your Stuff! 1. Clothing you don’t wear  Why it sells: Clothing items, especially vintage clothes from the early 2000s or ’90s styles, are super popular right now, thanks to nostalgic ’90s trends that are becoming popular for younger people. Plus, clothes that you’ve purchased recently can sell well too! I have sold many, many used clothes over the years, and I think it’s a great way to clean your closet and make some extra money. Where to sell: The best places to sell these clothing items include Poshmark, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace. If you want to sell in-person and easily, then thrift stores like Plato’s Closet are a great place to sell (my sister used to work here for years too!). Quick tips: If you decide to sell your clothes online, then you’ll want to take good photos (not blurry) of the clothing items, use keywords that match your clothing’s description, price fairly, be honest about rips or stains, and ship quickly to get good reviews.  Recommended reading: 16 Best Places To Sell Clothes For Cash 2. Old cell phones  Why they sell: Old phones (and other electronics like tablets!) still have value, even if you think they don’t. People buy and use old cell phones for parts, backups, or resell them in other markets. Apple and Samsung tend to hold value the longest, but others can be resold as well. Where to sell: The best places to sell old cell phones include eBay, Swappa, Amazon Trade-In, and Gazelle.  Quick tips: If you decide to sell your phone, make sure you delete all files and factory reset the phone so that no one can access your information. I know this probably sounds scary to someone who has not sold a cell phone before, but it’s really easy and I’ve done it several times with no problems at all.

Brands like Adidas, Nike, Converse, and other designer labels tend to sell pretty easily. If you have a vintage or limited item, these sell well too. Where to sell: The best sites to sell shoes include Poshmark, eBay, Mercari, ThredUp, and Facebook Marketplace. If you want to sell in person and easily, then Plato’s Closet is a great place to sell, as you just bring them your shoes and they give you a cash offer on the spot for them. Quick tips: The best tips for selling shoes include cleaning them before listing the shoes online, including all important details (brand, size, and exact model), taking photos from different angles, describing the wear level, and noting whether the box is included (more expensive shoe buyers typically like to have the box as it increases the shoe value).  Recommended reading: 20 Best Places to Sell Shoes Online And Near You 4. Books  Why they sell: Books such as textbooks, bestsellers, and collectible editions all have a strong resale value because people are either looking to add to their collection or save money on expensive textbooks. I have sold and bought used books over the years, such as textbooks, collectible books, and just books that I want to leisurely read. Where to sell: You can sell books at places like eBay, BookScouter, and in Facebook groups. If you have a collectible old book that you’d like to sell, you may be able to reach out to a used bookstore that specializes in that genre to see if they are buying any. For example, there is an old bookstore in Moab, Utah, that sells first editions, signed copies, and other higher-value books that are focused on the outdoors and history genre (I love this bookstore and have been to it many times!). Quick tips: The best tips for selling books include taking photos of the book from all angles (this is more important for expensive books – for just cheaper, used books, one photo is probably plenty), mentioning the condition of the book clearly, and looking up the book’s ISBN to check the current resale value.  Recommended reading: 17 Best Places To Sell Used Books For Cash 5. Old coins Why they sell: Old coins, especially coins that have historical significance, limited mintage, or are in good condition, tend to sell well.  Where to sell: The best places to sell old coins are Cash for Gold USA, eBay, local coin shops, coin shows, and Facebook Marketplace.  Quick tips: If you want to sell old coins quickly, research the coin’s year, mint mark, and condition to get an idea of pricing. Before cleaning the coin, you may want to do your research first to make sure that you don’t hurt the value (sometimes, it may be best just to leave it the way it is, especially if you think it’s worth a lot, and leave it to an expert to clean up).

Video games and consoles  Why they sell: Video games and consoles from brands like Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox have a strong resale value. Other consoles that are retro, limited edition, or in demand can sell for a good amount too. Where to sell: The best places to sell video games and consoles include Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and GameStop.  Quick tips: To sell video games and consoles quickly, first test everything to make sure it works, include all parts that belong to the console, and include the original packaging if possible. Plus, make sure that you take good photos of the console or game case and mention if any are special editions.  Recommended reading: 12 Best Places To Sell Video Games 7. Gift cards you won’t use  Why they sell: Unused or partially used gift cards hold value because people are looking for discounts at shops they go to. If you have a gift card for a popular retailer, restaurant, or online platform, you can probably get some money for it. Where to sell: The best places to sell gift cards include Raise, CardCash, and Facebook Marketplace.  Quick tips: If you want to sell gift cards fast, sell at a slight discount to get a buyer quickly, and use reputable platforms to avoid scams. For example, if your gift card has $49.35 left, look at what other gift cards are selling for. Usually, they are selling at around 10% off.

Jewelry  Why it sells: Jewelry items made from gold, silver, or platinum, as well as gemstones and branded designer items, usually have good resale value. Where to sell: The best places to sell jewelry items include Worthy, eBay, Etsy, The RealReal, and local pawnshops.  Quick tips: The best tips for selling jewelry include taking pictures of the jewelry and including relevant information about the quality. If you think the piece is worth a lot of money, you may want to get an appraisal for it. You can click here to sell your jewelry on Worthy.

Furniture  Why it sells: Furniture that is either vintage or a popular style sells well because people are looking for furniture while saving money. For example, mid-century modern items are some of the most popular furniture items people are looking to buy, and I see these for resale online all the time. Where to sell: The best places to sell furniture include Facebook (such as local buy/sell groups), local consignment shops, and specialty vintage furniture stores.  Quick tips: The best tips for selling furniture include cleaning and repairing any minor damage before listing the furniture piece. Also, having several photos from multiple angles can help too. Recommended reading: 15 Best Places To Sell Used Furniture For Cash 10. Tools Why they sell: Tools are really expensive, so people such as contractors and DIYers like to buy used tools to save money. Where to sell: The best places to sell tools include Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp, and eBay.  Quick tips: If you want to sell your tools quickly, clean the tools and make sure they work (plug them in and test them!). Also, include the brand, model, and condition in your listing description, and take clear pictures showing the tool. 11. Toys Why they sell: Toys from brands like Lego sell well because people are looking to add to their collection without paying full price. Other toys that are vintage, educational, or limited edition also tend to sell well because people are looking for them (they can be quite collectible!). Where to sell: The best places to sell toys include Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Mercari, and OfferUp. An easy place to sell them in person is Once Upon A Child, where they give you cash on the spot. Quick tips: If you want to sell toys fast, clean the toys before listing them, and include all pieces and original packaging if possible.  Recommended reading: 10 Best Places To Sell Beanie Babies 8 Best Places To Sell Old Legos To Make Extra Money 12.

Where to sell: The best places to sell old baby items include Facebook (local parent groups are great for this), Once Upon A Child, and Mercari.  Quick tips: The best tips to sell old baby items include cleaning and sanitizing all items before selling, including good photos of the old baby items, and pricing competitively based on the brand and condition.  Recommended reading: 11 Best Places To Sell Used Baby Items 13. Wedding items, such as a wedding dress Why they sell: Wedding items like dresses, decor (vases, candles, fake flowers, lights, etc.), and accessories sell pretty easily because people are looking for discounted rates instead of paying full price for something they’ll only use once. Where to sell: The best places to sell wedding items include eBay, Facebook Marketplace, wedding consignment shops, and local bridal resale events.  Quick tips: If you have a dress for sale, I recommend cleaning the wedding dress before listing the item, including detailed measurements, taking high-quality, well-lit photos from all angles, and sharing information on the designer. Recommended reading: 10 Best Places To Sell A Wedding Dress 14. Outdoor gear, like camping items Why it sells: Outdoor gear like sleeping bags, cookware, backpacks, and tents can sell pretty easily because people are looking to buy high-quality items at a discounted price. Buyers are always looking to upgrade equipment or start their outdoor hobby by buying used items first. I have bought plenty of used camping and outdoor gear over the years, and I think it’s a great way to save money. Where to sell: The best places to sell outdoor camping gear include REI Re/Supply Used Gear, Geartrade, Facebook, eBay, and OfferUp. If you have sports equipment, then you may be able to sell it at Play It Again Sports. Quick tips: When selling outdoor gear, always clean your items thoroughly before listing so that you can make the most money. Also, include important details, like the brand, model, and condition.

Designer handbags Why they sell: Designer handbags from brands like Chanel, Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci have high resale value because people want to purchase these at a discounted price. Or, sometimes they are vintage and collectible. Where to sell: The best places to sell designer handbags include The RealReal, eBay, Poshmark, and local consignment shops.  Quick tips: When selling designer handbags, you’ll want to have high-quality, detailed photos of the bag, including the interior and the exterior of the bag. If you have authenticity cards, original packaging, and serial numbers, then this is important too because they are so expensive.  Recommended reading: 8 Best Places To Sell Used Designer Bags Frequently Asked Questions Here’s a list of the common questions about the easiest items to sell that you already own.
