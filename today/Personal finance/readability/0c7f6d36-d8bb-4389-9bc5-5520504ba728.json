  "text": "Citi has closed applications for its Citi Rewards+® Card and Citi Rewards+® Student Card, a Citi spokesperson confirmed. Current holders of the Rewards+ and Rewards+ Student can continue to use their cards and will not be moved to another Citi credit card.Both Rewards+ cards have $0 annual fees, and they share the same rewards structure: 2 ThankYou points per $1 at supermarkets and gas stations up to $6,000 combined annual spend, and 1 ThankYou point per $1 on all other purchases. Those are hardly groundbreaking reward rates on cards that require at least good credit to qualify. The Rewards+ cards do have two unique features that might have appealed to cardholders: a 10% points bonus on the first 100,000 ThankYou points redeemed per year, and a “round up” feature where rewards are rounded up to the nearest 10 points. (For example, a combo meal that costs $10.99 will be rounded up to 20 points earned.)ThankYou points earned with the Rewards+ cards can be redeemed for things like gift cards and statement credits, and the Citi Rewards+® Card allows point transfers to a few of Citi’s travel partners, including Choice Privileges, Wyndham Rewards and JetBlue TrueBlue. Information related to the Citi Rewards+® Card and the Citi Rewards+® Student Card has been collected by NerdWallet and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of these products.",
