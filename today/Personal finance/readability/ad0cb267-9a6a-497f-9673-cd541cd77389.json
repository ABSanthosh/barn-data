  "text": "The FAFSA Deadline Act now mandates that the form be available by October 1 each year.The Department of Education has announced improvements to the FAFSA form, including a redesign of the contributor invite process to increase completion rates.The 2026-27 FAFSA form will remove \"nonbinary\" as a gender identification option and align with new policies regarding sex identification. The U.S. Department of Education has announced significant updates to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), with changes that will impact millions of students and families. These updates, which include form redesigns, policy shifts, and new deadlines, aim to streamline the application process and resolve lingering issues from previous cycles. With the FAFSA Deadline Act now mandating an October 1 release, families will have a clearer timeline to plan their financial aid applications. Here’s what you need to know about the first changes proposed by the new Trump-era Department of Education.2026-2027 FAFSA Changes: What To ExpectThe Department has begun the official process for developing the 2026-27 FAFSA, ensuring it will be released on time on October 1, 2025. As part of the updates, the Department is seeking public feedback on potential improvements. One major change is the removal of the \"nonbinary\" gender identification option, aligning the form’s demographic questions with other new federal policies.Additionally, the Department is redesigning the contributor invite process, a step that has historically led to high drop-off rates among students completing the application. By making this process more user-friendly, officials hope to increase FAFSA completion rates and reduce the need for support calls. Fixing Issues With Prior Year FAFSAIn response to technical difficulties that have plagued the 2024-25 FAFSA cycle, the Department is introducing batch correction capabilities. This feature will allow colleges and universities to process updates more efficiently, reducing administrative burden and improving the overall application experience.Another key priority is clearing the backlog of features left unfinished by the previous administration. This includes ensuring schools receive real-time updates from the National Student Loan Database System and properly notifying institutions of changes in student eligibility.FAFSA Deadline Act ComplianceThe FAFSA Deadline Act was signed into law last year and requires the Department of Education to release the form by October 1 each year without exception. Previously, the Department had flexibility in setting the release date, sometimes delaying availability until January. The new law eliminates that flexibility and requires an annual certification to Congress confirming that the form will be ready on time.If the Department anticipates missing the deadline, the Secretary of Education must testify before Congress on the reasons for the delay and its financial impact on students. This measure aims to prevent disruptions in the financial aid process and ensure families can complete applications as early as possible.What This Means For Students And FamiliesThe focus on getting the FAFSA released on-time, and improvements to the contributor process, are both huge wins for families. The removal of the \"nonbinary\" option and the shift in gender data collection will likely generate concern among advocacy groups and students. As the Department of Education refines its processes, families should stay informed about upcoming deadlines and changes to ensure they maximize their financial aid opportunities.Don't Miss These Other Stories: Robert Farrington is America’s Millennial Money Expert® and America’s Student Loan Debt Expert™, and the founder of The College Investor, a personal finance site dedicated to helping millennials escape student loan debt to start investing and building wealth for the future.
