Maybe you’re tired after a long work day or maybe you just want to start making more money but don’t have a lot of time. For years, I thought the only way to make more money was to work longer hours. I used to work full-time as an analyst and I was always feeling stressed, burned out, and tired. And even though I was making a decent salary, I knew I didn’t want to live that way forever. Now, I earn much more than I did at my old job, but I work far fewer hours. Some weeks, I only work a handful of hours and still earn a full-time income. I spend more time with my family, travel when I want, and have more control over my life. And it all started with changing how I thought about work and income. In today’s article, you’ll learn how you can start working less and earning more. Whether you want more freedom, are burned out from your job, or are just looking for better ways to increase your income, this is for you. 5 Ways To Make More Money While Working Less Here’s how to make more money while working fewer hours. 1. Focus on what actually makes you money Not all work tasks are created equal. Some work leads to more income, while other tasks just keep you busy (and don’t actually help your income at all!). If you want to earn more and work less, one of the first things you need to do is figure out which tasks actually grow your income. I was actually recently talking to a friend of mine who runs an online store. She told me about how in the previous month, she barely worked and didn’t do any of the normal tasks she usually does in her 8-hour workday. Instead, she only worked a few hours a week rather than the normal 40. Yet, her income was actually HIGHER than her average month. And, I wasn’t surprised. Not one bit! In the early days of my blog, I did everything myself, from editing to fixing website bugs to creating all images. I also tried every strategy that you could think of – it was like I was throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what would stick. Eventually, I realized that writing new blog content and working on affiliate marketing brought in most of my income. That’s when I started outsourcing and saying no to tasks that took me too long to do (because I wasn’t an expert in the area), that I didn’t enjoy, or that didn’t help my business. For example, when I first started Making Sense of Cents, I tried everything to grow my pageviews. I was on every platform and tested every idea. But eventually, I started tracking what brought in results (such as through Google Analytics). And guess what? A few things were bringing in most of the income and pageviews. Once I saw that, I doubled down. I stopped doing things that took a lot of time but weren’t making a difference. Focusing on things that make you money might be things like creating a new product or really understanding where you can find new customers. These are the tasks that directly tie to your income. And, this can be applied to pretty much any job or business. There are so many tasks that you may waste your time doing! So, take a look at your day. Make a list of what brings in the most income or results, and compare it to where your time is going (yes, actually sit down and write a list of what you do as you do it – don’t just guess!). You might be surprised by how much you can cut. Ask yourself – are you spending hours doing things that don’t move the needle? What would happen if you focused only on the top 20% of tasks that bring in 80% of your results? 2. Build passive income streams This is one of my favorite ways to work less and earn more. Passive income doesn’t mean you never do any work. It usually takes effort upfront, but once it’s set up, it can continue making money in the background (there may or may not be maintenance to keep it going as well). That means you can earn money while you sleep, travel, or spend time with your family. I earn passive income through affiliate marketing, digital product sales, display ads, dividends, and more. For example, a blog post I wrote years ago still brings in daily income from affiliate links and ad revenue. I don’t have to actively promote it every day – it just works. This helps me to make more money because I can focus on replicating this over and over again. Other passive income ideas include: Renting out real estate Creating and selling an online course Writing an ebook Investing in dividend-paying stocks Putting your savings in a high-yield bank account Starting a blog or YouTube channel (this can be semi-passive) Selling digital printables Renting out your RV Selling stock photography Creating print-on-demand items, like T-shirts Even if you only start small, adding one passive income stream can make a big difference. Plus, these can all start out as a side hustle (or a second job) and eventually turn into your own business or a full-time income.

Simplify your business or personal life More complexity can mean more time and stress. Over the years, I’ve learned that simplifying things leads to more freedom and sometimes even more income. I used to try to do everything – multiple social platforms and checking email all day long. It was exhausting and didn’t always lead to more income. And, it definitely did not lead to a good work-life balance. Now, I batch tasks, use tools to automate things, and focus only on what works. Simplifying helps me to avoid decision fatigue and frees up time for my most important work. Some things that helped me to simplify: Scheduling tools for blog posts and social media Batch similar tasks so I’m not switching back and forth all day Templates for emails and blog posts Cutting back on platforms that weren’t bringing in traffic or income Saying “no” more often But simplifying doesn’t have to stop with work. You can also simplify your personal life to create more time and space for what really matters to you. Here are some ways to simplify your personal life: Declutter your home – Less stuff means less to clean, organize, and worry about Meal plan or prep in advance – Reduces daily stress and saves money Create routines for your mornings and evenings – So your days start and end with less chaos Cancel subscriptions or memberships you don’t use – Cut out the noise and expenses Limit decision fatigue – Simplify your wardrobe, rotate meals, and automate bills Set screen time boundaries – Less time scrolling can free up hours in your week Ask for help – Whether it’s hiring a cleaner once a month or trading babysitting with a friend, support makes life easier Simplifying your personal life might not seem like it directly makes you more money, but it really can. When your life feels calmer and more organized, you have more mental space to think clearly, take action on your goals, and even build new income streams without burning out.

Raise your rates If you freelance, sell a product, or work with clients, one of the fastest ways to work less and earn more is to charge more money. Many people (my past self included!) are afraid to raise prices. And, many people are undercharging for their services to begin with. If you can improve your product, provide more value, or better serve a niche audience, you can raise your prices. That means fewer clients, less stress, and more income. Also, this definitely applies to asking for a raise if you work for someone else as well! Increasing your hourly rate or your annual salary can help you to earn more while working less. For me, I have been extremely busy with new partnerships lately and am scheduled out quite a bit (several months in fact!). Due to that, I have raised my rates, and the interesting thing is, the demand hasn’t gone down at all. Plus, if it does eventually go down, I’d rather work with fewer clients at a higher rate than take on too much and feel overwhelmed. If you’re fully booked, consistently turning down work, or are just delivering great results, that may be a sign it’s time to raise your rates too. You don’t have to double your prices overnight, but even a small increase can make a big difference in your schedule and income. 5. Create systems that run without you This is one of the biggest mindset shifts that helped me work less. When you create systems, you don’t have to constantly be involved in every detail. Systems allow you to earn even when you’re not actively working. And, this is something that I am constantly working on because they can really, really help you make more money while working less! Some examples of systems: An email welcome series that runs on autopilot A course that sells through an evergreen funnel A customer FAQ page that reduces back-and-forth emails A referral program for your product or service that runs on autopilot Recurring billing for memberships or subscriptions Automated upsell sequences after someone buys your product A blog post that drives traffic and income year-round Scheduling tools that post for you on social media A digital product that delivers automatically when someone purchases Using rental property managers so you don’t have to handle every tenant request Automated investment contributions through a robo-advisor Selling templates or printables on Etsy with automatic delivery A bookkeeping system using QuickBooks that tracks income and expenses without your manual input A chatbot on your website – Answers basic questions and directs people where they need to go For example, I have blog posts that I haven’t touched in years that still bring in traffic and affiliate sales all the time. That’s the power of setting up smart systems. You can also hire help, like virtual assistants or contractors, or pay for tools that do the work for you. Systems give you more time and freedom. Recommended reading: 18 Businesses That Run Themselves for Passive Income Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to make more money and work less. Is it possible to work less and earn more? Yes, it is definitely possible to work less and earn more. I’m living proof of this too. It takes hard work, some trial and error, and a willingness to do things differently, but it’s doable. I think to do this, it is important to focus on high-value work (the tasks that make you money!) and setting up income streams that don’t require constant effort. How to make $1,000 a month passively? To make $1,000 passively, start by picking one income stream, like maybe a blog, selling digital products, or rental property. How to make the most money with the least amount of work? Find ways to multiply your efforts. So, instead of trading hours for dollars, focus on scalable income, like selling a digital product, creating a membership site, or investing. Yes, it will be a lot of work upfront but it can pay off for years. What’s the easiest job with high pay? It depends on your skills. Some jobs with high pay and flexible hours include freelancing, tech roles, consulting, or selling digital products. But “easy” is relative because most will take effort to set up or learn, and it, of course, depends on your skillset too. How to get rich without working a 9-5? You’ll want to focus on building income streams that don’t depend on a traditional job, such as starting a business, investing, building an online brand, or real estate. Should I take a lower salary to be happier? Taking a job for less money to be happy is something that more and more people are thinking about these days. While it might seem counterintuitive in a blog post about making more money, the truth is that making a strategic pay cut for a better work-life balance can actually be one of the best long-term financial decisions. A lower-stress job may free up your energy to build passive income streams, start a passion project, or simply enjoy your life more. If you’re wondering how to have a better work-life balance in your life, that may mean choosing happiness and flexibility over the highest paycheck – and that’s completely okay!

I’m living proof of this too. It takes hard work, some trial and error, and a willingness to do things differently, but it’s doable.

While it might seem counterintuitive in a blog post about making more money, the truth is that making a strategic pay cut for a better work-life balance can actually be one of the best long-term financial decisions. A lower-stress job may free up your energy to build passive income streams, start a passion project, or simply enjoy your life more.
