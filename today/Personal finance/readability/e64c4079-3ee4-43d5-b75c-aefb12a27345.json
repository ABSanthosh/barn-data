But you do need to be careful: look at the terms and conditions and be sure you can avoid monthly fees, account closing fees, and so on. Also, remember that you'll have to pay income tax on this cash, so you might want to set some of it aside for that.That said, if you pay careful attention to the terms of these offers, you can make much more than you make even by parking your money in a high-interest savings account. You might want to just do this once for a few hundred dollars, but if you invest a little more time, you can make thousands of dollars a year treating it as a regular side hustle.And who among us doesn't like free money?These offers change every month, but right now here's the best of the best on offer, divided into offers that require you to begin with large amounts of cash on hand, and offers that let you start with very little money.Final ThoughtsOverall, there are some great bank bonus offers out there right now. I'd advise you to decide what kind of bonus hustler you are: do you want to do this once while you're switching to a new account permanently? Or do you need a complex calendar to keep track of your multiple bonus accounts?Be careful, but also, take advantage of free money if you're sure you can follow the rules! If this is all too much, check out our list of the best online banks and just park your cash there!

But you do need to be careful: look at the terms and conditions and be sure you can avoid monthly fees, account closing fees, and so on. Also, remember that you\u0026#39;ll have to pay income tax on this cash, so you might want to set some of it aside for that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, if you pay careful attention to the terms of these offers, you can make much more than you make even by parking your money in a \u003ca href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/21940/best-money-market-accounts/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehigh-interest savings account\u003c/a\u003e.

I\u0026#39;d advise you to decide what kind of bonus hustler you are: do you want to do this once while you\u0026#39;re switching to a new account permanently?
