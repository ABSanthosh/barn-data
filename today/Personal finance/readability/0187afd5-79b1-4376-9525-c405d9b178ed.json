  "text": "After remodeling a fixer I bought in 2019 between 2019–2022, I swore I would never take on another remodeling project again. I hate remodeling with a passion, even though I'm always satisfied after the project is done. The delays, cost overruns, and people management completely bum me out. If you want to save your sanity and earn a higher return, buy a fully remodeled home instead. However, in the summer of 2025, I spearheaded a remodel of a rundown two-bedroom, two-bathroom in-law unit in Honolulu attached to my parent's house. The in-law unit has two bathrooms, a kitchen, a washer room, and a living/dining area. Overall, I estimate the living area is about 900 square feet. The space fits three comfortably, and four so-so. The fourth person would either have to share a queen-size bed or sleep on the queen-size sofa bed. It used to belong to my aunt, who unfortunately passed away in 2020. But she hadn’t been living there since around 2013, so it was left neglected for 12 years. During this time, the unit rotted away as it became infested with bugs, valves started breaking down, and water intrusion began eroding the window sills and interior. The unit essentially needed a gut remodel. Before this year, I had never been inside. It was like the forbidden place. But my aunt left my dad the unit, so I finally got his blessing to rehabilitate the place. Initially, I estimated I would need to spend about $25,000 and 30 hours fixing it up and managing workers. However, like almost all remodeling projects, it went over budget and took longer than expected. Why Fix Up a Two-Bedroom Unit in the First Place? As a son who believes it is important to take care of his parents, my number one reason for fixing up the in-law unit was to provide flexibility for a caretaker. The primary caretaker would be me, and the in-law unit will serve as a place for me to stay for an extended period of time. If I’m not the primary caretaker, then a professional caretaker can live there comfortably. My dad is 79 and my mom is 77. The in-law unit will also house our family of four for up to six weeks at a time during the summer and two weeks during the winter when we come visit. Although living in a 2/2, 900 sq ft unit is tight for our family, it's larger than the vast majority of two-bedroom suites we would rent at a resort for $2,000+/night. Alternatively, we could rent a fully furnished 2/2 condo for between $8,000 – $12,000 a month. But then we wouldn't be living next to my parents and helping them. Finally, the in-law unit could house my father and mother comfortably. Given it is on the ground floor, there's no need to walk up and down steps, which will provide better accessibility. If my parents want to move into the unit, my family of four could then move into the main house, which is more than three times larger. Given my family or my parents will live there, I wanted to make the unit as nice as possible. At the same time, I didn't have time to hire a general contractor or buy the nicest finishes. So instead, I was the general contractor and cobbled together all the tradespeople to get to work. Then I focused on purchasing the best of everything from Home Depot, Best Buy, and a couple furniture and drapery stores. Here’s the cost to fix up the two-bedroom in-law unit. I’m sure I’m missing something, but here’s what I’ve got: Item and trash removal – $4,500 (includes tip) 39 years’ worth of stuff had accumulated. It took four trucks to haul everything out (beds, furniture, fridgerators, trash etc). I arranged two trash removal services to give me quotes. Both originally came in at $5,100 and $5,500, but I was able to haggle one down. Random assortment of stuff in the kitchen Not only did they take everything out, they also removed some of my aunt and uncle's junk, and a steel bathtub that had been sitting in the yard for the past 39 years. It was an eyesore, but they kept it out of sentimentality—we used to raise goldfish in it. Shout out to the husband wife team at Kanai's Junk Removal, they were awesome. New doors and exterior wood trim – $3,000 The two entryway doors were decrepit and needed to be replaced. Termites were everywhere. I chose exterior fiberglass composite doors, instead of wood, to hopefully better weather the elements. In addition, four interior doors were also replaced, as two of them were infested with termites. I wanted all the doors to match. Then we discovered termites had eaten the closet trim and doors, so we had those replaced. Ugh… the unanticipated problems kept popping up. Luckily, I was able to find an incredible handyman. He’s Belarusian and moved to Oahu in 2019 after gaining U.S. citizenship. The handyman worked with me to get all the materials at Home Depot and dump the old doors and trim. He knew how to do everything, but I couldn't hire him to do everything because there was so much to do in a limited amount of time. So I had to farm out the plumbing at a huge premium unfortunately. Old beat up door with ants and termites crawling all over it New door with new trim and platform Termites had eaten around a lot of the door trims Termites had eaten through the doors Replaced water heater – $3,600 The old water heater was rusted and leaking. Originally, it was connected to solar panels, but that system was also leaking. So we went with an electric 50-gallon tank, new plumbing, and a new switch. Getting the hot water going was my biggest worry, so I was thrilled when the plumbing company found a solution. Leaking, rusted, and last replaced in 2006! A 50 gallon electric tank was good enough for the in-law unit Plumbing – $10,500 (paid a massive premium for immediate service) I hired the same team who replaced the water heater to handle as much of the new plumbing as possible throughout the unit. They were extremely expensive, and I was disappointed in myself for not getting a better deal. They gave me a “20% discount” for bundling more work, but the prices were still outrageous. But I was on a time crunch and somewhat desperate. I was willing to pay a premium to get problems fixed ASAP since my time was valuable. I was supercommuting 1 hour and 25 minutes from Laie and wanted to maximize what could get done in each visit. They were efficient—sending four guys with four vans over to work eight hours in one day—which helped me feel slightly better about paying what was likely a 100% premium over what I would’ve paid using just my handyman. They replaced two bathroom faucets, a kitchen sink and faucet, installed two new elongated toilets, swapped out a leaking shower cartridge, installed a water valve for the refrigerator, changed all water valves, and opened up a wall to fix a leaking pipe behind the washer and dryer. Rusted out sink and faucet with dead cockroaches New sink and faucet, also got new garbage disposal that was leaking, new valves, notice the window ledge falling apart due to water intrusion. This is pre-cleaning Opening up wall to fix a washing machine pipe leak Replaced the copper pipes Installed new valve for refrigerator water line Originally wanted to give me commercial toilets, but I told them for the outrageous price, to at least give me something I've heard of. So they came back with Kohler elongated toilets the next day. Replaced leaky shower cartridge in the in-law unit. We potentially had to go through the back and cut open the sheetrock, which would have cost $1,000 more. Luckily we didn't. The Bonus That Made The Plumbing Cost All Worth It Although it hurt to pay so much – probably $5,000 more because I couldn't wait – it was nice they got everything done in one day. The biggest bonus was that they identified the source of a leak that had been dripping from my parents’ kitchen ceiling for over three years and fixed it! My dad had hired a plumber before to solve the problem. The old plumber went up into the crawl space, said there was a hole in the roof where the vent was, and patched it. But unfortunately, the leak continued, so they just lived with the slow drip. It leaked regardless of rain, so I knew it had to be from a bathroom pipe above. The plumbers waived their $650 “leak discovery charge,” which includes opening up sheetrock and doing tests. Thankfully, they found the leak exactly where they opened the ceiling, and replaced the faulty joint for $100. What I do remember thinking was: I would’ve happily paid $5,000–$10,000 just to identify and fix the source after three years. My dad agreed. Small leaks can lead to massive damage over time, and often, they’re incredibly difficult to locate. Cut hole in kitchen ceiling and replace leaking pipe, we got lucky the leak was right where we opened the hole Finished patching the ceiling by my handyman The crew also changed five water valves in my parents’ house and replaced my dad’s leaking bathroom faucet. As their son, I felt proud to have finally solved their persistent water issues. Since they eat all their meals in the kitchen two or three times a day, that slow leak had always been a source of stress and concern. Cleaning – $255 After clearing out junk and hiring a handyman for a week’s worth of repairs, it was time to bring in cleaners. I first got a quote from an online cleaning agency for $450 for a “move-out clean” to prep the unit for new tenants. It sounded high, but I agreed and asked how much extra it would cost to clean the windows too. They quoted $300 more, and I said maybe. I went ahead and paid their 20% deposit—$90. But when the cleaner arrived, he said he charges $30/hour and would be done in four hours. That’s it? I had expected a deep clean, maybe six hours or more, given the place hadn’t been cleaned in over a decade. Cockroaches and other bugs were everywhere. So I called the agency back to ask for a discount. They lowered the price to $390, which I didn't think was low enough. When I asked to cancel, they said I could—but I’d lose my $90 deposit. I chose to cancel, ate the $90 loss, and paid the cleaner $165 directly for a total of $255. It felt good to save $140 after spending so much on plumbing, but the cleaner didn’t do a good job. He left 30 minutes earlier than promised and I couldn't supervise because I had to pick up the kids. I ended up mopping most of the living and kitchen floors myself and wiping down the counters. I also saved $300 by cleaning all the windows—inside and out—myself. Unfortunately, I ended up slicing my pinky on one of the slat windows. I thought the edge was bezeled, but it wasn’t. Ouch. Electrical – $2,500 Electrical work was far more affordable than plumbing because my handyman did all the work. I purchased and replaced two exterior light fixtures, one sensor flood lamp, two bedroom ceiling lights, two living/dining room fixtures, two bathroom fixtures, and one washer room light. I also had Vasili replace all the plates and outlets to freshen up the look. All bathroom and kitchen outlets were upgraded to GFCI for safety in case of water exposure. We also upgraded two entryway light fixtures at my parents’ house. One had burned out, and when I asked my dad why he hadn’t just replaced the bulb, he said the lid was fused shut. So after 39 years, it felt amazing to finally have bright, fully functioning lights at the entrance. The bulbs can now be easily changed too, as there is a permanent opening underneath. In addition, I replaced a cracked light fixture in one bedroom and installed dimmer switches in both bedrooms. A few small upgrades can really modernize a place and make it more functional. New entryway light fixture where the bulb can easily be replaced now from underneath New washer and dryer – $1,600 (on sale from $2,000) We got two LG units during a 4th of July sale at Best Buy. They are beauties! Unfortunately, they won’t arrive until mid-September. New refrigerator – $800 (on sale from $1,000) We upgraded to a 32-inch LG fridge. If I had hauled the old one away through Best Buy, I would’ve gotten a $250 rebate for energy efficiency. Who knew? Oh well. My dad will have to manage the delivery and install in September. He'll need to confirm the water line works and there are no leaks or vent issues. So long as the washer, dryer, and fridge are properly hooked up and test, everything should be good! New living and dining room furniture – $4,200 We bought a queen sofa bed, side tables, rug, round dining table, and four chairs. The living room furniture was delivered before we left; dining stuff will arrive in mid-September. We could have spent $2,000 more dollars for an even fancier sofa bed, but this one was fantastic. Everything we are getting is much nicer than what was there, and all the furniture in my parent's house. They will be pleased. I even bought a new recliner, nicer than the one my dad uses now. Bought this sturdy round table and four chairs (not pictured) to comfortably seat up to 6. Good table for poker too! Two new mattresses (Cal King + Queen) – $1,800 We got Serta mattresses and two metal frames from Amazon. My wife ended up building the two metal frames, go her! My wife and daughter share the Cal King, my son has the Queen, and I sleep on the sofa bed. After a life-time of saving, investing, and working diligently, getting to sleep on a sofa bed in the living room is a good way to keep things real. New curtains/blinds – $2,700 We bought three blackout curtains from Wong \u0026 Co. and had them remove the old hardware and install new ones. We could’ve spent $4,500 for custom designs, but we found ready-made options that fit. Eventually, we may have to spend another $3,500 to replace four more old blinds. New flooring – $3,000 Both bedrooms had old, stained carpet. We replaced it with Lifeplank vinyl from Home Depot. One room had an uneven floor, so we had to apply self-leveling compound first. We also changed the baseboards and caulked everything. Besides new windows, new flooring provides the best bang for the buck in my opinion. Paying so much for the three new curtains didn't feel good, but the old ones were disintegrating. Old stained carpet floor Three new AC units – $780 + $1,000 in labor The in-law unit originally had only one AC unit installed in a west-facing bedroom. I was pleased to find that the 8,000 BTU units from Toshiba cost just $260 after tax. So we had that one replaced ASAP. Our handyman picked up the unit, bought wood for support, and installed it like a charm. For about five hours of work, the total cost came out to around $550 for the new unit and installation. Second bedroom, old carpet, no AC unit Installed new Toshiba 8,000 BTU AC unit from Home Depot We decided to install another AC unit on the cooler east side for another $550. Then, a week later, we decided to install a third unit in the living area. We originally bought a 12,000 BTU unit—50% larger—but had to return it because it required too much electricity. That probably cost me an extra $100, since our handyman had to go back to Home Depot and pick up a more appropriate one. I had told him I was concerned about three AC units drawing too much power and tripping the circuits, but he didn’t think it would be an issue. This ended up being one of many unexpected variables that cost more time and money. We didn’t discover the issue until we started changing out all the electrical sockets. Thankfully, after installing the correct unit, we tested all three AC units by running them all concurrently for two hours—and no circuits tripped. We'll do our best to use fans when we can. The alternative to getting individual AC units was to install an inverter AC system for $10,000 – $15,000. That option was far too expensive compared to the $1,720 solution we came up with. Painting – $420 in paint and supplies, plus free labor I like to work, and I like to paint. So I took on the project of painting the entire unit myself—including all the baseboards, doors, and walls. I've spent 25 hours painting so far, and probably need about three more hours to finish everything. I had to pause because our handyman was mudding the window sills in the living room. Getting on step-stool and painting around the tub area with semi-gloss Benjamin Moore white paint from City Mill ($60/gallon plus tax). Need to redo the window ledge as it's crumbling. Roaches in the tub, and dust everywhere Painting the dining room area wall and then baseboards. Tried to paint one area or room a day for one week I could’ve hired our handyman to do the painting, but that would’ve meant pulling him away from the many other tasks he was working on. Now that I think about it, I probably only saved around $1,600 by doing the painting myself instead of having my handyman do it. I could have used that time to write on Financial Samurai. However, if I had hired professional painters, they would have easily charged $600–$900 per room, which means I actually saved more like $3,600–$5,400. Charging $5,000+ to paint a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo is in the ballpark. Fixed Old Window Ledges – $1,000 We removed the deteriorated window ledges on three windows and replaced them with a plastic alternative. Then we mudded, waited for it to dry, sanded, mudded again, waited, sanded again, and finally painted. Over time, water intrusion from the slat windows had caused the ledges to crumble. If someone had been living in the unit, it would’ve been easy to wipe away moisture after each storm. 5 window ledges looked like this, with gecko and cockroach poop Decorations, Sheets, Pillows, Bedding, Trashcans, Bedside Tables, Power strips – $900 Of course, no remodel is complete without the essentials. I test-drove staying in one of the bedrooms on a Friday night just so I could see what was missing. It became apparent to me quickly that we needed to buy bedside tables, trashcans, powerstrips, and more. So off we went to Target again (went five times) to get everything. One thing we also need to do is get a couple non-electronic bidets. You can spend as little or as much as you want on decorations. We wanted to go the minimalist route with the least amount of clutter. We also bought a bunch of plastic Tupperware to store my Aunt's things, instead of leaving them in cardboard boxes for the silverfish to eat. General Contracting – A Free $15,000 I spent about 30 hours sourcing sub-contractors, managing the work, reviewing the results, and securing competitive bids. I suspect a general contractor would have charged $15,000 for the same effort. None of this would have ever gotten done if I hadn’t stepped in to get the ball rolling. Although getting screamed at for letting the washer sink overflow was extremely unpleasant, it gave me the motivation to finish the job. I didn’t want to feel that same type of emotional pain I felt as a kid again, so I became highly motivated to remodel the place for ourselves. At the same time, since I always think in two timelines, I wanted the unit to feel great for my parents too, if they ever choose to move in. So whenever you're in pain or are afraid, use it as a motivator to create or change something. Fear and the pain of financial loss in 2009 pushed me to start Financial Samurai in July of that year. And this time, the fear of experiencing more emotional pain the next time I return to my childhood home drove me to work 50 hours during our five-week visit to Hawaii. Final Cost Summary To Remodel A Two-Bedroom In-Law Unit Initial budget: $25,000 and 20 hours Actual spend: $40,685 and 50 hours Over budget: +$15,685 (63%) Over time: +150% If I include the value of my labor and painting, the total cost jumps to $58,000–$60,000. And sadly, if we had fully remodeled the two bathrooms and the kitchen—instead of just replacing the fixtures—it probably would have cost an additional $25,000. Thankfully, my parents insisted on paying for all the plumbing work and then cut me a $19,000 check equal to the annual gift tax limit after seeing how hard I worked. Therefore, I paid about $6,625 and worked 50 hours for free. I was happy to keep footing the bill, but my mom insisted. That said, I honestly don’t know how much money my parents have to be able to afford spending this much on a renovation. They'll always be financially OK because they have me. At the end of the day, we’re co-owners of the property, so the money is all within the family. Please Don’t Make Me Remodel Again When we return, I’m hoping the dining room furniture, refrigerator, and washer and dryer will all have been delivered and properly installed. All my dad has to do is let the delivery teams in and ensure everything is new and in working condition. The appliances need to be tested before the installers leave. If all goes well, we’ll come back to a fully functioning unit—which would be incredible. I estimate the value of each night’s stay at about $500. That means we’d need to stay for 81 nights to break even. However, that breakeven point could come sooner if my sister and her boyfriend visit as well. And once we move back permanently, the cost will be recouped quickly—and then some. After going through this latest remodel, I never want to do it again. After taking initiative and working hard, we can now enjoy the benefits for years to come. I see the in-law unit as an insurance policy for a better life, which feels great. Back in 1986, my grandfather had a vision of building a family compound to house multiple generations—a common setup in Honolulu. For various family reasons, things didn’t unfold as he’d hoped. But now, his vision is back on track. And for that, I am hopeful for a better future. Readers, I’d love to hear about your latest remodeling projects. How did they go—did you manage to stay on budget? Do you dread remodeling as much as I do? Does spending $40,000–$60,000 to renovate a 2-bed, 2-bath in-law unit sound reasonable to you? And do you ever struggle with the need to be productive, even while on vacation? Invest In Real Estate Passively All this work reminded me why I no longer want to buy physical rental properties to manage and renovate. It’s just too much of a pain now that I’m in my late 40s. If you can, try to tackle all your remodeling projects before your energy and patience run out. I'm guessing that's by age 50.

The biggest bonus was that they identified the source of a leak that had been dripping from my parents’ kitchen ceiling for over \u003cem\u003ethree years\u003c/em\u003e and fixed it! \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad had hired a plumber before to solve the problem. The old plumber went up into the crawl space, said there was a hole in the roof where the vent was, and patched it. But unfortunately, the leak continued, so they just lived with the slow drip. It leaked regardless of rain, so I knew it had to be from a bathroom pipe above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe plumbers waived their $650 “leak discovery charge,” which includes opening up sheetrock and doing tests. Thankfully, they found the leak exactly where they opened the ceiling, and replaced the faulty joint for $100. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I do remember thinking was:\u003cem\u003e I would’ve happily paid $5,000–$10,000 just to identify and fix the source after three years\u003c/em\u003e.

As their son, I felt proud to have finally solved their persistent water issues. Since they eat all their meals in the kitchen two or three times a day, that slow leak had always been a source of stress and concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-cleaning-255\"\u003eCleaning – $255\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter clearing out junk and hiring a handyman for a week’s worth of repairs, it was time to bring in cleaners. I first got a quote from an online cleaning agency for $450 for a “move-out clean” to prep the unit for new tenants. It sounded high, but I agreed and asked how much extra it would cost to clean the windows too. They quoted $300 more, and I said maybe. I went ahead and paid their 20% deposit—$90.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the cleaner arrived, he said he charges $30/hour and would be done in four hours. That’s it? I had expected a deep clean, maybe six hours or more, given the place hadn’t been cleaned in over a decade. Cockroaches and other bugs were everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I called the agency back to ask for a discount. They lowered the price to $390, which I didn\u0026#39;t think was low enough. When I asked to cancel, they said I could—but I’d lose my $90 deposit. I chose to cancel, ate the $90 loss, and paid the cleaner $165 directly for a total of $255.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt good to save $140 after spending so much on plumbing, but the cleaner didn’t do a good job. He left 30 minutes earlier than promised and I couldn\u0026#39;t supervise because I had to pick up the kids. I ended up mopping most of the living and kitchen floors myself and wiping down the counters. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also saved $300 by cleaning all the windows—inside and out—myself. Unfortunately, I ended up slicing my pinky on one of the slat windows. I thought the edge was bezeled, but it wasn’t. Ouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-electrical-2-500\"\u003eElectrical – $2,500\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eElectrical work was far more affordable than plumbing because my handyman did all the work. I purchased and replaced two exterior light fixtures, one sensor flood lamp, two bedroom ceiling lights, two living/dining room fixtures, two bathroom fixtures, and one washer room light. I also had Vasili replace all the plates and outlets to freshen up the look. All bathroom and kitchen outlets were upgraded to GFCI for safety in case of water exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also upgraded two entryway light fixtures at my parents’ house. One had burned out, and when I asked my dad why he hadn’t just replaced the bulb, he said the lid was fused shut. So after 39 years, it felt amazing to finally have bright, fully functioning lights at the entrance. The bulbs can now be easily changed too, as there is a permanent opening underneath. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, I replaced a cracked light fixture in one bedroom and installed dimmer switches in both bedrooms. A few small upgrades can really modernize a place and make it more functional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"437\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/new-light-fixture-437x500.png\" alt=\"New entryway light fixture\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/new-light-fixture-437x500.png?fit=1456,9999 437w, https://i2.wp.com/financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/new-light-fixture-306x350.png?fit=1456,9999 306w, https://i2.wp.com/financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/new-light-fixture.png?fit=1456,9999 652w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eNew entryway light fixture where the bulb can easily be replaced now from underneath\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-new-washer-and-dryer-1-600-on-sale-from-2-000\"\u003eNew washer and dryer – $1,600 (on sale from $2,000)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe got two LG units during a 4th of July sale at Best Buy.

Then, a week later, we decided to install a third unit in the living area. We originally bought a 12,000 BTU unit—50% larger—but had to return it because it required too much electricity.

I test-drove staying in one of the bedrooms on a Friday night just so I could see what was missing. It became apparent to me quickly that we needed to buy bedside tables, trashcans, powerstrips, and more. So off we went to Target again (went five times) to get everything. One thing we also need to do is get a couple non-electronic bidets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can spend as little or as much as you want on decorations. We wanted to go the minimalist route with the least amount of clutter.

If all goes well, we’ll come back to a fully functioning unit—which would be incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI estimate the value of each night’s stay at about $500. That means we’d need to stay for 81 nights to break even. However, that breakeven point could come sooner if my sister and her boyfriend visit as well. And once we move back permanently, the cost will be recouped quickly—and then some. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter going through this latest remodel, I never want to do it again.
