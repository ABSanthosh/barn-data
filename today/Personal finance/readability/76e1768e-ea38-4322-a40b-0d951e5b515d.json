  "text": "The average cost to finish a basement is about $32,000, but the price can range from $2,800 to $100,000 or more, depending on a number of factors. Costs per square foot typically fall between $7 and $23. The materials, permits, appliances and labor required for your specific project will determine your final cost.What is the most expensive part of finishing a basement?The most expensive aspect of finishing a basement is generally the required materials themselves, which can constitute about 70% or more of your total cost. Labor is a significant expense as well, and may account for as much as 20% (or more) of project costs. Permits to meet local building codes typically range from 1% to 2% to as much as 10% of your total project expense.Here’s a rough idea of what you can expect to pay for major components of the work:Type of workCostNotesPermits$1,200 to $2,000.Depends on where you live and what you're changing.Electrical (labor and materials)$5,300 on average.Could hit the five-figure range if major electronic devices are part of the project (a home theater setup, for example).PlumbingAbout $45 to $200 per hour.Could total $2,500 to $15,000.Framing$700 to $1,800 ($7 to $16 per linear foot) on average.Not including drywall or insulation.CeilingAbout $1,600 to $3,600.Depends on materials and size.DrywallAbout $1,750 on average.Ranges from about $800 to $3,000.WaterproofingAbout $4,500 on average.Can range from about $2,000 to $6,500.FlooringAbout $3 to $30 per square foot.Depends on whether you choose tile, carpet, hardwood or other flooring types.Is finishing a basement worth the money?Finishing a basement may increase your home’s value, and you can expect to recoup about 70% of what you spent on it if you sell your home. Your home’s specific increase in value depends on your location, how your home compares to other homes for sale in your area, and whether you simply finished the basement space or remodeled it as well.Advantages of finishing a basementIncreased home value. Depending on where you live, the features of your basement and your home’s condition, finishing a basement may add as much as 10% to your home’s value. This can equate to a return on investment of about 70%, meaning your home's value may increase by about 70% of the cost of finishing the basement.Lower energy bills. When your basement is unfinished, your home’s HVAC system needs to work harder to control the temperature in your entire home. Finishing the basement removes a source of cold in the winter as well as a source of extra heat in the summer, creating a more energy-efficient home.May attract buyers. Homebuyers may consider a finished basement a desirable feature.Possible rental income. If you plan to rent out your finished basement and your basement space meets local building codes for safety and egress, the rental income might offset your costs, bringing you a larger return on your investment. Versatile way to increase usable home square footage. Finishing your basement can increase your personal enjoyment of your home. You’d have more usable living space, allowing you to enjoy an additional bedroom, den, playroom, home theater, kitchen, bathroom, music studio, gym or other type of room that suits your lifestyle.Can take noisy activities away from the home’s main living space. A finished basement is an excellent space for loud music practice, parties or play areas that won’t disturb the rest of the household or the neighborhood.May create a safe space during severe weather. During severe weather or natural disasters, the basement may be the safest area of the house. A finished basement allows you to enjoy that shelter in a comfortable living space.Disadvantages of finishing a basementThis project can be costly. Finishing a basement is a sizable expense that may require financing to complete.You probably won’t recoup 100% of your expenses. Unless you plan to rent out the space for many years, your return on investment will likely come in at around 70%.May raise your property taxes. Finishing your basement may increase your property’s taxable value. To find out whether and how much your property taxes will increase if you finish your basement, contact your town or city’s municipal office for a rough estimate of how your property tax bill will change.You’ll need to meet building codes. Permit(s) and municipal inspections are likely part of this project.Moisture may be an issue. Because basements tend to be moist spaces that are vulnerable to flooding, you may need to invest in dehumidifiers, a sump pump and additional flood insurance.Lighting may not be optimal. Basements are often naturally dark spaces, which may make it necessary to buy and install extra windows and/or lighting fixtures.Access to plumbing and electrical lines may become more difficult. Adding walls and a ceiling to your basement may make electrical and plumbing lines invisible or hard to reach. If you don’t install removable access panels when you finish your basement, you may need to cut walls open if you need repair work done.Can I get financing for a home repair or improvement?Your contractor may offer some financing options (either through a partner or a payment plan), but there are other — any maybe better — financing options available.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, as well as future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.Credit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase. If you go this route, you’ll want to make sure you pick one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Which financing option is best for me?The best financing option for you will depend on how much money you need, when you need the money, what project you’re doing and how long you need to pay the money back. If it’s something that’ll add value to your home, a HELOC or home equity loan may be your best option because the value of your house could increase by more than the amount of the loan.On the flip side, if it’s a less expensive repair, a credit card is probably your best option if you want to pay no interest or earn rewards. Personal loans can apply to both small and large repairs or renovations, and they may make sense if you don’t have much equity in your home.Some home improvement contractors offer their own financing options. Before taking this option, shop around and see how their offer compares with other loans.Regardless of what you choose, make sure you compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing options you’re considering. This will ensure you get the best deal.",

HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You’ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you\u0026#39;re using your home as collateral.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and with fixed annual percentage rates. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. Unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral. This means your home isn’t at risk if you miss payments, but you’ll still have to pay late fees and the late payments can negatively impact your credit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit cards are an option for lower cost repairs or renovations. That’s because credit cards typically charge higher interest rates than home equity loans, HELOCs and personal loans. When used responsibly, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months; rewards so you can earn cash back, travel or points; and sign-up bonuses that can give you some extra cash back or rewards for a larger purchase.
