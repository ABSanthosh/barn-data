These jobs can teach your child important lessons about customer service and teamwork. Plus, it’s a great way for them to start saving money for their future. When I was a teenager, getting my first job felt like a huge step toward independence. I was excited to earn my own money and have the freedom to save or spend it on things I wanted. Those early experiences taught me a lot about showing up on time, working with others, and handling responsibilities. Looking back, those lessons shaped how I approach work and manage money to this day. Recommended reading: 23 Business Ideas For Teens To Make Extra Money Can a 15 year old work legally? Yes, 15-year-olds can work legally in many places. But there are rules to follow. These rules help keep teenagers safe and make sure their jobs don’t get in the way of school. The Fair Labor Standards Act says 14- and 15-year-olds can work but with limits. Here are some key things to know: They can only work outside of school hours. They can’t work more than 3 hours on a school day. They can’t work more than 18 hours in a school week. During summer, they can work up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week. Remember, state laws might have extra rules. It’s a good idea to check your state’s laws too. Here’s a good place to learn more about the rules – U.S. Department of Labor Child Labor. It’s important to stay safe when wanting to make money. Always: Make sure parents/guardians are aware of what the child is doing. Have them work with people you know. Have an adult you trust nearby. Also, one more thing that I think is extremely important – make sure that the teenager knows they can always turn to their guardian or parent for help without feeling uncomfortable. They should feel safe and confident and be able to talk about any concerns that might arise. This way, if anything doesn’t feel right – like an interaction with someone they’re working for – they’ll know they can talk about it, ask questions, and, if necessary, leave the job. Best Jobs for 15 Year Olds Below are the best jobs for 15-year-olds. 1. Babysitting Babysitting is a wonderful job for a 15-year-old because it allows them to earn money, and many families are looking for responsible teens to watch their kids. Babysitters are responsible for keeping the kids safe and entertained. They might play games, help with homework, or prepare snacks. Some babysitting jobs involve caring for babies, while others focus on older children. Pay for babysitting can vary, typically ranging from $10 to $20 per hour, depending on where you live and the responsibilities involved. Some families may offer higher pay for sitters with more experience or special skills. Babysitting is a great job for teens who enjoy spending time with kids. I still remember starting my first real babysitting job when I was a teenager (where I didn’t know the family but found them on a bulletin board in my local area). I worked around 36 hours a week in the summer for a single mom who was a nurse. She paid me $10 an hour! 2. Dog walking Dog walking can be a fun job for a 15-year-old. It’s a way for them to spend time with cute dogs while earning money. Many pet owners need help walking their dogs during the day, making it a great opportunity for teens with free time after school. Your child can set their own schedule and decide how many dogs to walk. Typically, they may be able to earn around $10 to $20 for a 30-minute walk. They might earn more for longer walks or if they walk multiple dogs at once. 3. Lawn mowing Lawn mowing can be a great job for a 15-year-old. Many people are willing to pay teens to mow their lawns, making it a good way for your child to work outside, get exercise, and earn some money. When setting prices, they can base them on the size of the lawn. For a small yard, they could charge around $20 to $30, while larger lawns might cost $40 to $50 or more. 4. Car washing Car washing can be a great job for a 15-year-old. They can either start their own small business or work at a local car wash. If they want to begin their own car washing business, they’ll need some basic supplies like soap, sponges, and towels. They can sell their services to family, friends, and neighbors. And, if they’d rather work for someone else, many car washes hire teens. Some places might require workers to be 16, but others may hire 15-year-olds with parental permission. 5. Tutoring Tutoring can be a good job for a 15-year-old. Tutors help younger students with subjects they excel in, such as math, geography, or science. Getting a tutoring job means that they can usually set their own schedule, making it easy to work after school or on weekends. So, it’s a flexible option that can fit around their studies. Tutoring also pays well for a teen job, with potential earnings of $15 to $25 per hour. 6. Lemonade stand A lemonade stand is a classic summer job for a 15-year-old. It’s a fun way for them to make money while learning important business skills. And, no, 15 years old isn’t too old for a lemonade stand at all! Running a lemonade stand at this age can still be a fun and valuable experience. At 15, kids can bring a bit more creativity and business sense to their lemonade business, making it even more successful. For example, they might experiment with new flavors, better signage, or even sell other treats like cookies or snacks to make more money. 7. Paper route A paper route can be a good first job for a 15-year-old. They’ll deliver newspapers to homes and businesses in the area, giving a way to earn money. Nowadays, newspapers are usually delivered in large quantities by adults in cars. However, you could contact local newspaper companies to find out if they offer any delivery positions for kids. When I was growing up, I had a friend whose family ran a paper route to earn some extra income. She would help with the deliveries and even earned a little for herself. It wasn’t something she managed alone; it was more of a family project where everyone chipped in. I joined her a few times, and they even paid me for helping out – it was a fun way to earn a bit of pocket money! 8. Pet sitting Pet sitting can be a wonderful job for a 15-year-old who loves animals. They can care for pets while their owners are away on vacation or at work. Their duties might include feeding, walking, and playing with dogs or cats. They could also be responsible for cleaning litter boxes, giving medications, or watering plants. Many pet-sitting jobs pay between $10 and $20 per visit and more for overnights. A few years ago, I needed someone to watch my two dogs while I was away. I found a great family to help out. The teenagers in the family took care of my dogs and played with them while the parents were also home to supervise. I brought my dogs to their house, where they stayed for a week. My dogs had a wonderful time, and the teens got to earn some extra money! 9. Garage sale helper Garage sale helper can be a great job for a 15-year-old. They can help neighbors or family friends in setting up and running garage sales. Their tasks might include sorting items, pricing them, arranging displays, and helping customers. They’ll also handle money and make change, which are valuable skills for future jobs. Garage sale helpers pretty much exclusively work on the weekends (because that’s when garage sales happen), making it a good fit with school schedules. They can typically work for just a few hours at a time, which is perfect for teens. 10. House cleaning House cleaning can be a great job for a 15-year-old. They can start by helping family friends or neighbors with basic cleaning tasks like dusting, vacuuming, mopping floors, and wiping down surfaces. They could also help with laundry or organizing closets and drawers. When setting their rates, they should think about the tasks they’ll be doing and how long each will take. Many teen cleaners charge between $10 and $15 per hour. My big tip for this job is to make sure that the 15-year-old stays safe. They should only work for people you or your family know and trust, and it’s a good idea for you to drop them off and pick them up from their cleaning jobs. 11. Snow shoveling Snow shoveling can be a great job for a 15-year-old during the winter months. They can earn money by clearing snow from driveways, sidewalks, and paths in their neighborhood. 12. Fence painting Fence painting can be a great job for a 15-year-old who is looking to earn some money. They can start by offering their services to neighbors or family friends (this is a boring and tedious job that many people will pay to not have to do after all!). When painting, remind them to cover the ground with drop cloths to protect any plants and grass from paint drips. They should apply the paint evenly and let it dry between coats for the best results. 13. Gardening assistant Becoming a gardening assistant can be a fun way for a 15-year-old to earn money. They might help with planting flowers, mowing lawns, or weeding gardens. This job allows them to work outdoors and learn about different plants. They could help neighbors, local gardeners, or even nurseries in your area. 14. Party helper Being a party helper can be a fun job for a 15-year-old. They get to help with setting up and running parties for kids or adults, allowing them to earn money. Parents look for party helpers all the time as running a party (such as a birthday party for their toddler) can be a lot of work! Party helpers do tasks like blowing up balloons, hanging decorations, or setting up games. They could also help in serving food and drinks to guests. In some cases, party helpers even dress up in costumes to entertain kids. 15. Fast food Fast food jobs are a common option for a 15-year-old who is looking to earn money. Many popular chains hire teens, but age requirements can vary depending on location and state laws. Some fast food places that may hire 15-year-olds include McDonald’s, Burger King, and Dairy Queen. These jobs often involve preparing food, taking orders, or cleaning. 16. Amusement parks Amusement parks can be fun places for a 15-year-old to work. Many parks hire teens to help run rides, sell tickets, or serve food. Keep in mind that age requirements can vary. Some parks hire 15-year-olds, while others may require workers to be 16 or older, so it’s best to check with each park directly. 17. Lifeguard Being a lifeguard can be a fun job for a 15-year-old who loves swimming and wants to help keep others safe. They will need to be strong swimmers and complete certification courses first. As a teen lifeguard, they might work at public pools, water parks, or beaches during the summer. Some indoor pools also hire lifeguards year-round. Their main responsibility will be to watch the water and rescue anyone in trouble. They will learn important skills like CPR and first aid, which are valuable and look great on college applications. Lifeguarding typically pays well for a teen job, usually above minimum wage. 18. YouTuber Being a YouTuber can be an exciting job for a 15-year-old. They can create videos about things they love and share them with the world, such as gaming, makeup, music, travel, or any other interest. As their channel grows, they might start earning money through ads, sponsorships, or merchandise sales. Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? 19.
