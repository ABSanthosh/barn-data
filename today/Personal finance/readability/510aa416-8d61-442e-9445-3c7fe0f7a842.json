  "text": "College students need to do their taxes, and many have student loans. So, if you're a student or a student loan borrower, which tax software is best?This year, several major tax companies are courting student loan borrowers with the promise of free state and federal filing for people claiming education credits and student loan interest deductions.Anyone who qualifies to file their taxes for free should take advantage of these software packages.However, filers expecting free filing should watch out for gotchas. Student loan borrowers who aren’t careful may wind up paying for expensive software. Below, we compare the top tax software options for students and student loan borrowers.Why \"Free\" Tax Software Might Not Be Free For Most Student Loan Borrowers Tax filing software companies often plaster “FREE!” all over their advertising. But many student loan borrowers won’t qualify for free returns. Several companies offer free software for people who want to claim the student loan interest deduction. In fact, two premium software packages, H\u0026R Block and TurboTax support this deduction on their free tier.However, this so-called free software may not be suitable for all student loan borrowers. Filers might use one of these packages to “start for free” only to find they don’t qualify for the free option. It can be frustrating!Many filers will need to pay for the most expensive version of the software because they have self-employment income. Self-employment is an expansive term that covers a wide range of work situations including most side hustles.For example, people who flip items on eBay, those who drive for rideshare companies, and many others have to file a Schedule C. These jobs, which you may have taken on to help pay off your debt qualify as self-employment income. This type of income often requires upgrading to an expensive \"Self-Employed\" package.Below, we clearly lay out which tax situations each software supports for free (and which situations aren’t supported). That way student loan borrowers can figure out what software will work for them.This year, our top software options for student loan borrowers include H\u0026R Block Free, TurboTax Free, Cash App Taxes, and FreeTaxUSA.Our overall pick for the best tax software for students is Cash App Taxes.Cash App TaxesCash App Taxes offers completely free state and federal filing for most filers. However, it does not support multi-state filing (which can be difficult for students living and working in multiple states).But, most college students are probably already using Cash App (it's the largest peer-to-peer money transfer app), so it's also a natural fit.Situations Covered By The Free SoftwareMost income sourcesAll major deductions and creditsOne state filingSituations NOT Covered By The Free SoftwareMulti-state filingInternational income (including study abroad income)K-1 FormsFreeTaxUSAFreeTaxUSA offers low-cost software that supports all situations. It’s not as easy to use as the other three software, but it has a very good user experience given the low price point.Situations Covered By The Free SoftwareAll users will qualify for free federal filingSituations NOT Covered By The Free SoftwareState tax returns - all state returns cost $14.99 per stateH\u0026R BlockH\u0026R Block offers a simple experience. It allows users to import W-2 and 1099 forms right into the software. The software then takes over generating the returns. Importantly, education credits and the student loan interest deduction are both included on the free plan.Situations Covered By The Free SoftwareW-2, Unemployment or Social Security IncomeLimited interest or dividend incomeStandard deduction onlyEducation CreditsStudent loan interest deductionEarned Income Tax CreditChild Tax CreditSituations NOT Covered By The Free SoftwareInvestment or trading incomeRental property IncomeSelf-employment incomeSaver’s Credit (retirement contributions)Dependent Care CreditHSA ContributionsOther deductions or creditsTurboTaxWhen we review the best tax software each year, TurboTax is always near the top in terms of ease of use, navigation, and support options. It also covers the student loan interest deduction on the free tier. But unlike with H\u0026R Block, you'll need to upgrade to a TurboTax paid tier if you want to claim education credits.Situations Covered By The Free SoftwareW-2 incomeLimited interest or dividend incomeStandard deduction onlyEarned Income Tax CreditChild tax creditsStudent loan interest deductionSituations NOT Covered By The Free SoftwareEducation credits (for current students andtheir parents)Income other than W-2 or limited interest anddividend income.Investment or trading incomeRental property incomeOther deductions or credits~37% of filers qualify for $0 federal \u0026 state filing. Simple 1040 returns only (no schedules except for Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and student loan interest).What Student Loan Borrowers Should Look For In A Tax Software Price is, of course, a top consideration when choosing tax software. But it isn’t the only consideration. Student loan borrowers should also consider how easy it is to use the software.Free and low-cost software options like Cash App Taxes and FreeTaxUSA aren't typically as easy to use. Filers using these options may expect to spend a bit more time preparing their returns. However, they clock in at lower price points.Premium software like H\u0026R Block and TurboTax makes filing very easy, even for filers with complex taxes. Users can snap pictures of their tax forms and upload them directly to the app. The app takes care of the rest. Filers can also quickly figure out how to add rental or self-employment income and the associated deductions. These features are great, but filers have to weigh the benefit with out-of-pocket costs they will expect to pay.In general, we recommend choosing premium software when you can use it for free. Filers who can’t use the free software face a more difficult decision and should decide whether to spend more time or more money filing their taxes.
