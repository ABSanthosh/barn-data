Making money with your art can feel like a long and hard process, but thankfully, selling art online has never been easier,… Do you want to know the best places to sell art? If you are an artist, then there are many ways to make extra money or even a full-time income with your art. Making money with your art can feel like a long and hard process, but thankfully, selling art online has never been easier, thanks to the many different online platforms like Etsy and Society6, as well as in-person opportunities such as farmers’ markets, art fairs, and even coffee shops. Of course, it still requires a lot of hard work, but at least you have some good options for places to sell your art, depending on your needs! Recommended reading: 16 Best Things To Sell On Etsy To Make Money Best Places To Sell Art Below is a list of the best places to sell art. 1. Etsy If you’re an artist, then I’m sure you’ve heard of Etsy. Etsy is a popular site where artists can sell their handmade work. I have bought plenty of art over the years on Etsy, and as a buyer, I really like it. To use Etsy as an artist and make money, you’ll want to start by setting up your online shop. To do this, I recommend that you get an idea of what similar artists in your niche are selling artwork for. And, you may want to try selling several different products, like originals and prints, to attract buyers with different budgets and needs.  You can promote your shop on social media to drive traffic to your Etsy shop, as well as use good Etsy SEO keywords so that potential buyers can find your listings right on Etsy (this is actually how I find most of the art that I buy on Etsy – by simply searching right on their site).

Redbubble Redbubble is a print-on-demand site where artists can sell their art designs on products like T-shirts, stickers, phone cases, home decor, and more. The artist doesn’t have to handle inventory or shipping – Redbubble is in charge of that. So, if you are looking for a site where you can primarily focus on making art, instead of filling orders, then this may be a good option for you. To use Redbubble and make the most money, you’ll have to make sure you upload designs that are high-resolution and formatted to fit different products. You can even customize your product offerings by selecting which items your art can be used on. 3. Local craft fairs and art fairs Local craft fairs and art fairs are a great option for artists to connect to their local community and show their artwork in person. I know from personal experience that I’m more likely to buy art from someone I’ve connected with than from just seeing the art online on Etsy or another online platform. I have bought several pieces of art from local fairs, and I love all of them! To succeed at local art fairs and actually make money, you’ll want to prepare an organized booth with clear signage and prices. I also think that having business cards ready to share in case people want to buy something from your shop later on is nice to have. 4. Local art galleries Local art galleries are professional venues that display artwork from many different artists. Many times these are located in busy areas or touristy areas, and therefore receive a lot of foot traffic from people passing by. To get started, you’ll want to find art galleries in your area and share your portfolio and artist statement with them. Art galleries take a commission on sales, so factor that into your pricing. 5. Saatchi Art Saatchi Art is an online gallery that is popular among artists, serious art buyers, and collectors. This platform is especially great for selling original paintings, photography, and limited-edition prints. Saatchi Art even handles shipping, packaging, and customer service. This site also helps with marketing support and helps artists gain visibility through their curated collections and marketing campaigns (they have a very popular Instagram account where they feature artwork as well, which can help sell your art). Saatchi Art takes a commission on sales, but many artists find it worth it. 6. Zazzle Zazzle is a print-on-demand service that lets artists upload designs and sell them on items like coffee mugs, clothing, stationery, and home decor. This site is a great option for artists who want to monetize their artwork without worrying about inventory, shipping, processing payments themselves, or customer service. Some important tips for Zazzle include making sure to use clear titles and relevant tags to help get your products found by possible customers online. Also, think about how your art will appear on items like mugs and phone cases because that’s what it will be printed on. Lastly, regularly add new designs (the more designs you have, the higher the chance you will make a sale!) so that more customers can find you.

Artfinder Artfinder is an online marketplace where artists can sell their artwork, including prints, paintings, photography, and even sculptures. It’s a good site for artists who want to reach serious art buyers looking for one-of-a-kind pieces. Artfinder helps make your work stand out and also helps with managing orders, shipping, and payments. The platform does charge a commission and subscription fee, but many artists find this is worth it because of the focused audience. 8. Society6 Society6 is a popular site where I’ve personally bought art products, and it is great for artists, such as graphic designers. Artists can sell their designs on products like home decor, apparel, accessories, wall art, and art prints. Society6 handles the fulfillment, such as the production, shipping, and even customer service, which makes it easier for artists. 9. eBay  When you think of eBay you may not think about art, but plenty of artists sell on this site! EBay is a great option for artists looking to sell their artwork worldwide because so many people use this site. Plus, with eBay, you have full control over pricing, shipping, and listing details, but this also means you have to manage all of this yourself. But, eBay isn’t art-specific, as mentioned above, so you’ll need to create keyword-rich listings with high-quality photos to make your items stand out and get seen by potential buyers.  10. Shopify  Shopify is an e-commerce platform that you’ve likely heard of. Their platform lets artists create a completely customized online store to sell artwork, prints, and merchandise directly to customers. Now, there will be a transaction fee when you sell your art, but there won’t be a middleman, so you will get to keep a larger percentage of your sales. The downside is that you will have to design your own site and market it to buyers (such as on social media or word of mouth), and that can be difficult as well as take a long time. 11. Gift shops If you sell smaller pieces like prints, cards, jewelry, and other items like these, partnering with a gift shop can be a great way to get your artwork out into the community. Gift shops are usually happy to support local artists, but keep in mind they’ll take a commission on the sale in exchange for displaying your artwork.  12. Coffee shops Coffee shops are a great way for artists to display artwork, such as canvas prints, original artwork, and more. My local coffee shop has a handmade section where artists sell their handmade art items. This is a great way to give you exposure to local customers who can become repeat buyers.  13. Farmers’ markets Farmers’ markets are one of the best places to sell your artwork, as people are looking to support local small businesses. You also get the chance to connect with buyers and get instant feedback on your artwork. 14. Social media Social media is a great option for artists who want total control over selling their artwork. You can give followers and potential customers a behind-the-scenes look at your business, how you create art (people LOVE watching videos like this these days!), and share your personality on your profile as well. This helps followers connect with you as an individual and become more likely to connect with your art and want to buy it. TikTok, Pinterest, and Instagram are great social media platforms for artists to show their artwork and give followers an insider look at life as an artist. I personally follow many artists on social media! Frequently Asked Questions Below are the most frequently asked questions about selling art. What are ideas for art that I can sell? Some great ideas for art you can sell include original paintings, prints of your artwork, digital art and downloadable files, custom commissions, hand-painted ceramic items, and so much more.  What is the best way to sell art?  The best way to sell art depends on your goals and how much work you want to put into it. Some options, like starting your own website and creating listings yourself, as well as personally mailing the art, can take a lot of time. Other options, like using an art gallery, may allow you to focus more on the art and less on the fulfillment process. But, you may have to give up some control, and there are also commission fees to think about. What is the best site to sell artwork?  The best site to sell your artwork depends on your goals and how much control you want over the selling process. Online art marketplaces like Saatchi Art or Society6 are good sites to look into. Where is the best place to sell paintings online? The best places to sell your paintings online depend on your style and how much communication you want to have with the buyer. For example, Etsy is a great option for people who want to sell original art and prints and have people find them through search keywords. Other artists may prefer a site that handles the whole process for you – from creating the listing to shipping the art. There’s no right or wrong answer – it just depends on what you are looking for. Can you sell art on Amazon? Yes, on Amazon Handmade, you can sell art such as a graphic that you design on a T-shirt or mug, an art print, stationery, plant pots, and more. How do I price my art and sell it? Pricing your art can feel tricky at first. Start with adding up the cost of your materials and the time it took to produce each art piece. Then you can research other artists in your area to get a sense of market value. An “easy” formula is: (materials + time) x your hourly rate. Your work has value, so this is a good starting base, and it’s important to grow your confidence over time and not lowball your artwork. Best Places To Sell Art – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on the best places to sell art online and near you (in person). As you can see, there are many places to sell your art, whether you want to sell it online or in person. I have personally bought art from many of the places above, and I will continue to do so because I love supporting artists and having handmade beautifully crafted pieces in my home.
