Windows have a functional purpose for storm protection, air flow and energy efficiency, but they also need to fit your home‚Äôs aesthetic and structure.Windows can come in dozens of different styles, such as awning, casement, picture and bay, and can be made with a variety of different glass and frame materials. Some windows are made with energy-efficient materials, which can help lower your electricity bills.Here are five factors to consider when choosing replacement windows for your home, plus ways to balance cost, energy efficiency and aesthetics for a seamless transition.1. CompanyThe window company you choose to either purchase windows from or contract for your entire project can make a big difference in the final product. Some companies have in-house installation, so you‚Äôll have one point of contact for payments and service requests. Other companies outsource installation, which means you‚Äôll sign the contract with the window company, then work with a third-party company for installation. Several well-known window companies also offer additional home services, such as doors, siding and sunrooms. You may be able to bundle several services for a better price than you would get using different companies for each addition.WarrantyAnother factor to consider is the warranty on the window, parts and installation. Most companies have window warranties of at least 20 years, although some offer different coverage for glass, frames, and other parts. It‚Äôs rare for window warranties to cover installation-related issues, though proper installation is essential for the window‚Äôs function.If you plan to sell your home within the window warranty (e.g., within the next 10 years and you have a 20 year warranty), choosing a company with transferable warranties may be helpful and a selling point for potential buyers.2. CostReplacing an individual window can cost from $300 to $2,500, while whole-house window replacement projects typically cost homeowners an average of over $7,000.Prices vary depending on the company, window style, materials, size of the window and location of the window in your home. Aluminum frames, for example, can start at just $75, but they‚Äôre less energy-efficient than other materials, so they may end up costing you more in heating and cooling fees down the road. On the other hand, some energy-efficient window treatments, such as tinting or laminate, may cost more upfront but can save you 7% to 15% on annual energy costs, according to Angi, a website that connects homeowners with home service professionals.Some window companies may offer discounts on installation for large projects or zero-interest packages if you pay in full within 12 months, for example.ü§ìNerdy TipIf you opt to fund your window purchase, make sure you shop around for the best interest rates and terms for your budget. Your contractor may offer financing options, but that‚Äôs not always the right financing solution for you. Also consider a personal loan, HELOC, home equity loan or credit card, depending on the price of your window project. Our replacement window cost guide has a breakdown of costs and payment options. 3. Energy efficiencyEnergy-efficient windows can be much more cost-effective and environmentally friendly in the long run than standard windows. Several of the top window companies we reviewed are partnered with Energy Star, a government-run energy-efficiency program. Others sell Energy-Star-certified windows, which must undergo rigorous testing to earn an energy-efficient rating. Windows are typically considered more energy efficient if they have multiple panes of glass, low-emissivity glass coatings and insulating frames made of materials including vinyl and wood. Some may also have spacers or gas filling in between panes.Most window styles have an energy-efficient option, so consult with your window company of choice to see your options.4. Materials Windows can be made in a variety of materials, which can have different looks, lifespans and functions. Here are some popular pane and frame materials.Pane:Glass comes in single-pane, double-pane and triple-pane versions. The more panes, the higher the cost.Tempered glass is heat-treated to be stronger and more resistant to breaks than standard glass. This type may have fewer customization options.Low-emissivity (Low-E) glass is the most energy-efficient pane type but may reduce natural light. According to Angi, it can reduce heat loss in the home by up to 50%.Frame:Vinyl is a low-cost material that‚Äôs easy to maintain. However, it can warp with heat and may not withstand extreme weather.Wood is a classic frame choice, but it requires more upkeep to prevent rotting and warping.Aluminum is durable but highly heat-conductive, so it‚Äôs not a great choice if you live in an area with extreme temperatures.Fiberglass is energy-efficient and low-maintenance, but the most expensive option.Composite windows can recreate the look of wood with more durable materials.5. StyleWindows come in many different styles, shapes and sizes. Some, such as egress basement windows, are mostly functional. Others, such as bay and bow windows, are more aesthetic. Here are the most common types of windows:Bay windows have three panels, creating a curved appearance with a central picture window and angled windows on each side. Windows with four or more panes are called bow windows and they create a smoother, more even curve. This style is common in living and dining rooms, and can create a reading nook.Awning windows open out and upward, with a hinge at the top and often a crank at the bottom. They work well to let in fresh air in a living room, or up high in a bedroom or bathroom.Casement windows open outward to the left or right, like a door. Usually vertical, they‚Äôre a very versatile and common window choice.Single-hung windows slide open vertically and only open from the bottom. Double-hung windows can open from either the top or the bottom, providing added airflow. These styles are easy to clean and take up minimal space.¬†Picture windows don‚Äôt open. Like a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù frame, they frame the view outside and let in natural light, but not air. They‚Äôre common in kitchens, living rooms or in areas where they‚Äôre hard to reach, like above a staircase.Sliding windows open horizontally with one pane sliding in front of the other. This style can fit a variety of spaces, especially in a kitchen or opening onto a patio. Windows can also be double sliding, which is when both sides of a window slide open and there‚Äôs a stationary piece of glass in the middle.¬†Transom windows are windows on top of a door or another window‚Äôs transom, the beam on top of a door or window. They‚Äôre usually placed higher up, decorative and used to let in extra light.Skylights are ceiling windows that can provide lots of extra natural light. They can also add ventilation to a bathroom, for example, or be used for roof access.Many window companies offer customization options for windows with unique shapes, placements and functions.",
