Pros No age limits for authorized usersNo foreign transaction or annual feeExcellent cashback rate on all categories Cons No simple cashback redemptionRequires Robinhood Gold subscription In 2024, Robinhood announced the launch of its first credit card, the Robinhood Gold Card. With a rewarding flat rate across all spending categories and increased cashback on travel, we think this card is worth considering, especially if you’re already a Robinhood Gold member.The Gold Card is set to launch later this year, and you can join the waitlist now to reserve your spot. It’s a 17-gram stainless steel Visa Signature, and the card issuer is Coastal Community Bank, which is an FDIC member.We’ve reviewed all the card’s key features, fees, and reward redemption options below to help you decide if the Robinhood Gold card is a worthwhile addition to your wallet.Robinhood Gold Card OverviewHere are a few key Robinhood Gold Card details to be aware of: Rewards rate: 3% Bonus rewards rate: 5% on travel APR: 19.99% – 29.99% Annual fee: No; Robinhood Gold subscription required ($5 monthly) Welcome bonus: No FeaturesThe most notable feature of the Robinhood Gold Card is its flat-rate 3% cashback across all categories, with a bonus rate of 5% for purchases through Robinhood’s travel portal.Here are a few of the card’s other most noteworthy features we think you should know about: Family features: Robinhood doesn’t impose age restrictions for authorized users, allowing kids to build their credit. You can also track your family’s card usage, set spending limits, and lock cards. Virtual cards: For added security, you can make digital purchases using virtual cards with disposable numbers. Travel perks: The card provides trip interruption protection, Visa Signature concierge service, and travel and emergency assistance. Purchase protection: Cardholders also get purchase security, extended warranty protection, return protection, and zero liability coverage. Vehicle assistance: Additionally, the card offers a car rental collision damage waiver and Roadside Dispatch. Robinhood integration: The Robinhood credit card app is seamlessly integrated with the Robinhood investing app, so Gold members can transfer rewards to their brokerage account. RewardsAs we mentioned earlier, the Gold Card pays 3% cashback across all spending categories, except for travel bookings through Robinhood, which earn 5%.The Gold Card gives you four options for redeeming your credit card rewards: Cash-back rewards: While you can’t directly cash out your rewards for money, you can use them as cashback in your Robinhood brokerage account, where you can invest the funds or earn a competitive APY on your uninvested cash. Travel portal: You can also use points to make travel purchases through the Robinhood travel portal. Shopping portal: If you’d prefer to shop with your cashback rewards, you can apply your points toward purchases from Robinhood’s partner merchants. Gift cards: Similarly, you can redeem your rewards for gift cards from several merchants in Robinhood’s rewards portal. FeesOne of the biggest draws of the Robinhood Gold Card is its lack of fees. While you do have to be a Robinhood Gold subscriber, the card itself doesn’t have any monthly fees. There are also no foreign transaction, balance transfer, or overlimit fees.There are a few fees for actions like late payments, return payments, and cash advances, which are standard in the credit card industry. You’ll also be required to pay a membership fee for Robinhood Gold to be eligible for the card.Unlike some of its competitors, Robinhood isn’t currently offering a welcome bonus for its new Gold customers.While there isn’t a welcome offer, there is an ongoing Solid Gold referral program. If you join the waitlist for the card and make 10 eligible referrals, you’ll get an actual 10-karat solid-gold card or a comparable cash prize.Getting StartedYou can join the waitlist for the Robinhood Gold Credit Card by entering your email address on the Robinhood website. From there, you’ll be able to refer friends and get notified when the card is available.Before you apply, it’s important to take a look at the fine print. Robinhood notes that you can check your approval without impacting your credit score. Once you accept the card offer, you’ll be subjected to a hard credit pull, which can temporarily impact your score.Keep in mind that you must have a Robinhood Gold membership to be eligible for the Gold Card. Robinhood Gold comes with a 30-day free trial, but you can’t open a Gold Card until after your free trial period has ended.Pros and ConsLike any credit card, the Robinhood Gold Card has some advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few of the biggest pros and cons to consider before applying for the card:Pros No foreign transaction or annual fee: The Gold Card’s limited account fees make it an appealing choice for earning the most cashback possible. No age limits for authorized users: Gold users looking to help give their kids’ credit a boost can add them as authorized users, regardless of their age. Excellent cashback rate on all categories: With Robinhood, there are no rotating categories or cashback caps to worry about. You get the same flat rate on all spending categories, with extra rewards on travel bookings. Cons Requires Robinhood Gold subscription: While the card itself doesn’t have annual fees, it’s only available to Robinhood Gold members, who are required to pay ongoing subscription fees for Robinhood’s premium investing tools. No simple cashback redemption: If you want to redeem your rewards for cash, you’ll have to transfer them to your Robinhood brokerage cash account. From there, you can let the money sit and accrue interest, invest it, or withdraw it, which adds an extra step. Who Is the Robinhood Gold Card Best For?The Robinhood Gold Card isn’t the right fit for everyone. If you use a different investment platform and don’t want to invest with Robinhood, consider another cashback card that doesn’t require you to have a Robinhood account or subscribe to its Gold plan for a fee.If you’re already using Robinhood to invest and have been contemplating upgrading to a Gold account anyway, the card could make a subscription worth it. And if you currently subscribe to Robinhood Gold, adding the card to your wallet is a no-brainer that can help you easily earn competitive flat-rate cash back on all your purchases.Bottom line—Compare the cost of a Gold membership to the cashback you anticipate earning and the value the Gold plan would add to your investment plan to decide if the card is worth it.",
