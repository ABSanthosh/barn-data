  "text": "Note: This article is brought to you by our sponsor, T-Mobile. Phone plan costs are constantly fluctuating. This unpredictability can require shopping for more affordable plans every year or two and cutting spending in other areas to pay the bills. Thankfully, T-Mobile’s 5-Year Price Guarantee can provide financial peace of mind for several years longer than the competition. What is T-Mobile’s 5-Year Price Guarantee? T-Mobile Plans with Price Guarantee High-Speed Mobile Hotspot Save Money with T-Mobile’s Family Freedom The brand-new 5-Year Price Guarantee guarantees your monthly unlimited talk, text, and 5G smartphone data costs remain the same for five years. T-Mobile’s guarantee is two years longer than the industry average of similar price lock policies.   You also won’t have to sign a lengthy, multi-year contract with stiff early cancellation penalties. Both of the carrier’s Experience plans qualify for this industry-leading guarantee: Experience Beyond: Unlimited premium data and mobile hotspot. This is the carrier’s flagship plan with the most data, travel, and streaming benefits. Experience More: Unlimited premium data and up to 60GB of high-speed mobile hotspot. It is T-Mobile’s most popular plan thanks to its extensive features and budget-friendly price. This guarantee helps provide steady pricing for some of the most robust data and entertainment benefits traditional phone plans offer.  New and existing customers qualify after activating or switching to an eligible plan. The guarantee also applies to wearables, tablets, and mobile internet data plans you add to your plan. Let’s say that your base monthly phone plan costs $85. You pay the same amount for the next five years, plus fees, taxes, and optional services. Your rate doesn’t increase even if T-Mobile raises prices for new customers. Here is how much you can anticipate paying per month: Experience BeyondExperience More1 line$100/line$85/line2 lines$85/line$70/line3 lines$56.70/line$46.70/line4 lines$53.75/line$42.50/line5 lines$52/line$40/line *Note: Excludes taxes and fees. Pricing includes AutoPay discount and 3rd Line Free promotion. What’s Not Covered While your base plan cost is predictable for the next half-decade, there are a few variable expenses to keep your eye on: Taxes and fees Third-party services (i.e., streaming subscriptions) Per-use charges Network management practices   In most situations, your monthly taxes and streaming costs may increase from your current rate as the carrier doesn’t control these factors.  You will be happy to hear that Experience customers receive free access to multiple streaming apps, courtesy of T-Mobile.  Moreover, your five-year period doesn’t restart if you add a line or change plans.  These policies are similar to competing price locks, such as Verizon Wireless’ 3-Year Price Guarantee. T-Mobile’s prominent advantage is securing your basic monthly cost for two more years. AT\u0026T doesn’t currently offer similar guarantees for its unlimited wireless plans. T-Mobile Plans with Price Guarantee Two phone plans currently offer the 5-Year Price Guarantee. You will receive unlimited priority access to the nationwide network’s 5G premium data, along with many other valuable streaming and travel perks.  Experience BeyondExperience MoreBest forMost benefitsBudget-friendly priceTalk \u0026 TextUnlimitedUnlimitedNationwide DataUnlimited 5G \u0026 4G LTEUnlimited 5G \u0026 4G LTEMobile HotspotUnlimited60 GB of high-speed data (then max 3G data speeds)Free StreamingApple TV+, Hulu with Ads, Netflix Standard with AdsApple TV+ and Netflix Standard with AdsVideo Streaming QualityUp to 4K UHDUp to 4K UHDCanada and MexicoUnlimited talk \u0026 text.

A few other perks have different values, such as how frequently you can upgrade and which streaming plans you can watch for free in 4K video quality. Experience Beyond The top-tier plan is an excellent choice when you consume lots of data or want truly unlimited data. You also won’t experience throttling during peak network congestion as lower-tier postpaid and prepaid unlimited customers do. Priority data access is valuable as you can stream with video resolution quality as high as 4K Ultra HD, while other unlimited plans may offer HD or SD at best. Case in point, T-Mobile Experience Beyond offers the most hotspot data compared to other traditional phone plans. Verizon and AT\u0026T provide up to 200 GB and 60 GB, respectively. Although unlikely, you get unlimited excess hotspot data speed of 3G if you exhaust your monthly allocation. This particular plan is also a compelling option for frequent international travel, as you have an industry-leading allotment of high-speed data in most countries and destinations.    Experience More Experience More is T-Mobile’s mid-tier unlimited plan that balances data and entertainment benefits with a low monthly price. The 5-Year Price Guarantee provides further peace of mind against teaser rates and continually changing benefits.  You have unlimited premium data and up to 60 GB of mobile hotspot. Free streaming plans with 4K video quality and ample international data erase hidden monthly costs that other companies charge for popular services.  If you’re not a heavy hotspot user or don’t travel abroad extensively, Experience More is better than Experience Beyond.    Experience Plan Benefits Here are some of the best perks you can continually access at a competitive price.  Nationwide 5G Coverage T-Mobile operates the nation’s largest and fastest 5G and 4G LTE cellular data. You enjoy unlimited premium access instead of getting throttled after your first 50 GB (or sooner) of monthly usage, so you won’t have to curtail usage or think about buying extra gigs.  Urban and suburban areas across the country enjoy quick and reliable coverage. The coverage quality lets you use your favorite premium features at home or on the go. Moreover, the flagship Experience Beyond plan users have free nationwide access to T-Satellite. This rapidly developing feature lets you make calls, send texts, and share photos or data from your capable device when outside the range of traditional cell towers. Free Streaming Services Do you love Netflix or Hulu, but don’t want to pay for either? Watching two of the largest streaming apps on demand for free is possible as a T-Mobile Experience customer. Experience Beyond plan members also get to stream Apple TV+ at no extra cost. That’s as much as $30 of automatic monthly savings versus paying for each service out of pocket. Additionally, these services are a built-in benefit for your corresponding plan. Moreover, the T-Mobile Tuesdays promotions with the free Magenta Status loyalty program also provide free trials and discounted membership to audio and video streaming apps. Some of the offerings include MLB.TV, MLS Season Pass, and SiriusXM. Check the T-Life App weekly for the latest entertainment and travel offers to maximize your membership value. High-Speed Mobile Hotspot Both plans are among the industry’s best if you rely heavily on a mobile hotspot to stream or access the internet when wi-fi isn’t an option.  Top-tier Experience Beyond customers have as much as 250 GB of premium data compared to 200 GB and 60 GB with the best plans from leading competitors. Therefore, when you need multiple screens, you can enjoy the network’s fastest speeds on your laptop and tablet.  For this convenience, you don’t have to buy add-on data or a standalone device. It’s standard with all capable devices and easy to activate.  Hotspot data becomes more valuable as our fast-paced society demands more bandwidth and quick connection speeds. Most customers are unlikely to exhaust their monthly allowance. If so, unlimited maximum 3G hotspot speeds are available until the next bill period starts.   Free Airplane Wi-Fi T-Mobile customers are currently the only cell phone customers to enjoy complimentary travel in-flight wi-fi on four major airlines: Alaska Airlines American Airlines Delta Air Lines United Airlines The In-Flight Connection feature provides complimentary full-flight internet and streaming on most domestic flights. Select international flights also offer this perk.  No more airline wi-fi day passes as your T-Mobile account provides unlimited access to stream, browse, and text. After boarding an equipped aircraft, you place your device in airplane mode, connect to wi-fi, and enter your phone number to verify eligibility.  Fast International Data Both Experience plans provide premium data and mobile hotspot in over 215 countries across the globe with fast, reliable coverage outside of the T-Mobile network. As one customer (Mark) puts it, “Their service works flawlessly when we bounce back and forth to Mexico and Canada.” Your data speeds can be as quick and reliable as your daily usage in the United States. Complimentary roaming means you don’t need to pay for international day passes that can become surprisingly expensive for multi-day trips. You also enjoy unlimited international texting from home as you communicate with friends and family between visits. Upgrades and Phone Deals New and existing T-Mobile customers can claim the same phone deals for the latest Android and iPhone models.  You can browse the latest offers online with multiple free and zero-down deals, including the Google Pixel 9 and iPhone 16. Note: You can get iPhone 16 Pro on Us with no trade-in needed’.Most offers pay down your device through 24 monthly bill credits and don’t require trade-ins.   Historically, cell phone plan providers save the best deals and promotions for new customers. This “new customer envy” likely means you may have previously switched carriers every few years to buy a discounted phone and risked paying a higher plan cost.  The 5-Year Guarantee is refreshing since you won’t feel pressured to upgrade now if your current device still functions properly. You can also upgrade now and at least once more during the plan guarantee period and enjoy a hassle-free experience. When you’re ready to get a new phone, you are automatically upgrade-ready yearly with Experience Beyond and every two years with Experience More. Multiple Plan Discounts Along with not facing surprise price hikes, you can also apply several discounts to reduce your monthly cost: AutoPay: $5 monthly discount per line (up to $40/month) when using an eligible payment method (i.e., debit card or bank account).  Age 55+: Preferred rates for customers age 55 or older Employer discounts: For first responders and veterans and their families T-Mobile offers other limited-time promotions that can reduce your plan cost, such as the “3rd line free” to help families save money with multi-line plans.  No Contract Commitments You don’t have to sign an annual service contract to get the best rates or the longest price guarantee period. It’s also possible to bring your own device or choose from free and zero-down phones. If you get a new device through T-Mobile, you receive 24 monthly bill credits to pay off your device. Terminating your plan early requires a finance agreement for the remaining balance. You can also pay off your device balance early penalty-free.  As a result, the month-to-month pricing means you can keep your plan as long as necessary without strings attached.  Save Money with T-Mobile’s Family Freedom If you’re still paying off devices with your current plan, the Family Freedom promotion initiative helps repay your outstanding balance and allows you to switch to T-Mobile at the lowest possible cost. T-Mobile’s Family Freedom initiative makes it easy to upgrade by allowing you to trade in up to four devices from a postpaid plan and receive up to $3,200 on a virtual prepaid card. You can even get an iPhone 16 Pro on us—no trade-in required. Choose from the latest Apple and Android devices at T-Mobile’s best prices to match your budget and lifestyle. This feature helps you combine upfront savings with the ongoing savings from the wireless plan price lock.   Looking to switch carriers? The Family Freedom Plan initiative makes it easier than ever. Bring your number, trade in your device, and get a new smartphone with a great plan. Limited-time offer—credit approval and service requirements apply. Stay connected with up to four lines and enjoy more freedom for your whole family. Final Thoughts T-Mobile’s 5-Year Price Guarantee helps you lock in customer-first pricing, making it easier to fit premium phone perks into your budget. This financial predictability is a compelling incentive for individuals and families seeking high-speed data, travel perks, and on-demand entertainment. Competitive phone deals, month-to-month pricing, and discounts on the best unlimited phone plans help stretch your dollar further if you frequently use your phone.",
