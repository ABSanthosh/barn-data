But figuring out where to… Are you looking for the best places to sell your old toys and make extra cash? Whether your kids have outgrown their toys, or you’ve come across a stash of vintage collectibles, selling old toys can be a great way to declutter and earn extra money at the same time. But figuring out where to sell them can feel overwhelming, especially with so many options available. In this guide, I’ll share the best places to sell old toys, both online and locally, to help you decide what works best for you. You’ll also learn tips for figuring out the value of your toys, how to sell them quickly, and even which 90s toys are still worth something today. From online marketplaces to in-person stores, there’s an option for every type of toy and seller. Best Places To Sell Old Toys Below are the best places to sell old toys for cash. 1. eBay  eBay is one of the best places to sell old toys because you can reach a large audience worldwide. If you have valuable toys, eBay is a perfect place to list them because collectors are looking for them on eBay. You can also use eBay to get an idea of how much your old toys are worth. eBay also has the option of choosing different pricing strategies, including Auction or Buy It Now. Auction is typically better for rare or collectible items since this usually attracts competitive bidding, while Buy It Now is more common for toys with predictable value. 2. Once Upon a Child  Once Upon a Child is an in-person store that specializes in buying and selling gently used children’s items. They have items for parents to buy and sell items like toys, clothes, and baby gear.  Selling old toys at Once Upon a Child is a good option if you’re looking for a more convenient process since you don’t need to create any accounts or online listings to get your products out there for sale. Instead, you just go to your local Once Upon a Child store and take your items to the store. The items will be inspected while you’re at the store, so there’s no waiting for an item to sell. Once Upon a Child pays store credit or cash for accepted items. You also don’t need to worry about shipping or packaging items, making this a great option for people looking to get rid of things right away. 3. Kid to Kid Kid to Kid is similar to Once Upon a Child in that they buy and sell gently used children’s items, including toys, clothes, and baby gear. This store focuses a lot on clothes, toys, books, shoes, baby equipment, maternity wear, and also seasonal items like Halloween costumes or winter clothes. To sell old toys at Kid To Kid, take your clean, gently used items to the store, and they’ll evaluate them on-site. For accepted items, they’ll give you store credit or cash at your visit. Store credit may be a better option because stores will give you more money this way (of course, only take the store credit if you plan on shopping here and need to shop). 4. Etsy  Selling old toys on Etsy can be a great option if your toys fall into categories like handmade or vintage since this is what Etsy specializes in. Etsy also has the benefit of reaching a worldwide audience, which is a great option if your item is a collectible or rare. Etsy provides many resources and guides to help you price your items and run a successful Etsy store. Keep in mind that Etsy does charge fees for selling on its website. I shop on Etsy all the time, and I have bought toys as gifts for family members (such as my niece!). So, I know that people buy toys on Etsy. 5. Facebook Marketplace  Facebook Marketplace is a great option for selling old toys because you can reach people locally and all over the world. Selling locally on Facebook Marketplace has its pros and cons, with benefits like no fees, meeting people locally to sell an item right away, and not having to deal with packaging the item to ship. However, selling locally narrows your audience and might make it harder to sell an item. 6. Mercari  Mercari is an online buying and selling marketplace with millions of active buyers. All sales are done online, so you never meet anyone in person, making this a more easy option for sellers who like to avoid face-to-face interactions. The Mercari app does charge a listing fee, so you will want to think about how this will impact the amount of money you can make. 7. Sell Your Toys Now  Sell Your Toys Now is a unique platform that focuses on buying collectible toys directly from the seller. This website is the best option if you have a rare, collectible, or vintage toy that you want to get rid of quickly. Instead of listing your item and waiting for a buyer to buy your item, Sell Your Toys Now buys it directly from you. Sell Your Toys Now buys a wide variety of toys and dolls, including those from Disney, Barbie, Star Wars, Hot Wheels, Beanie Babies, Lego, and more. All you have to do is download their phone app and scan your toy’s barcode to get a price quote. 8. Garage sales If you want to get rid of old toys right away and they don’t have high value, you can try selling them at your very own garage sale. This is a great idea, especially if you have many other items to get rid of and nothing of high value. At a garage sale, toys are usually priced quite affordably since buyers expect to find bargains. Here’s a general guideline for pricing toys for a yard sale or garage sale: Small toys (like action figures or dolls): $0.25 to $2 each, depending on condition and brand. Board games or puzzles: $1 to $5 (make sure all pieces are included). Larger toys (like ride-on toys or playsets): $5 to $20, depending on size, brand, and condition. Vintage or collectible toys: Prices can vary widely, but they might go for more if the seller understands their value. Pricing toys low encourages quick sales, but if you believe an item is valuable, research its worth before setting the price or think about selling it through an online marketplace.

This is also a great option if you don’t have a Facebook account because Facebook Marketplace requires a Facebook account to sell items. Craigslist is a local-only site, so you can post listings for your city and find nearby buyers. This makes it great for quick, in-person sales, especially if you want to avoid shipping. However, since it’s local, fewer people will see your items compared to global websites. And, just like with any other site where you’re meeting a stranger in person, it’s important to take precautions to stay safe. I recommend that you meet the buyer in a public, safe space like a police parking lot or coffee shop. Have a friend go with you or tell somebody where you’re going to meet this person too. Frequently Asked Questions Below are frequently asked questions about selling old toys for cash. How do I know if my toys are worth money? Most toys are worth something, but, of course, some are worth more than others. You’ll need to do some research to figure out how much your toys are worth. Things to look out for are the brand, age, rarity, and condition of the toy. You can look up your toy on eBay to see what similar items are going for as a way to start. Toys that are worth more money generally are limited edition toys, discontinued items, or toys tied to popular franchises. But, you can also sell toys that your kids play with – I see these for sale all the time online. How can I sell my old toys fast?  If you want to sell your toys fast, use selling platforms where you can sell items locally, like Facebook Marketplace or Once Upon A Child. If you have collectible toys, then you may want to try the site Sell Your Toys Now.

You can look for the model number or production year on the toy and use online platforms like eBay or Etsy to get ideas of their value. You can also check out online price guides or visit toy collector forums to get an idea of the value of your toys. If you have a barcode, then Sell Your Toys Now is also a great place to look as you can just scan it and they will give you a price. Are any toys from the 90s worth anything? There are quite a few toys from the 1990s worth money, especially if they are rare or in high demand.

Craigslist\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCraigslist is a great option to sell toys if you’re looking to sell locally and don’t want to deal with fees. This is also a great option if you don’t have a Facebook account because Facebook Marketplace requires a Facebook account to sell items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCraigslist is a local-only site, so you can post listings for your city and find nearby buyers. This makes it great for quick, in-person sales, especially if you want to avoid shipping. However, since it’s local, fewer people will see your items compared to global websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, just like with any other site where you’re meeting a stranger in person, it’s important to take precautions to stay safe. I recommend that you meet the buyer in a public, safe space like a police parking lot or coffee shop. Have a friend go with you or tell somebody where you’re going to meet this person too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are frequently asked questions about selling old toys for cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I know if my toys are worth money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost toys are worth something, but, of course, some are worth more than others. You’ll need to do some research to figure out how much your toys are worth. Things to look out for are the brand, age, rarity, and condition of the toy. You can look up your toy on eBay to see what similar items are going for as a way to start. Toys that are worth more money generally are limited edition toys, discontinued items, or toys tied to popular franchises. But, you can also sell toys that your kids play with – I see these for sale all the time online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow can I sell my old toys fast? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to sell your toys fast, use selling platforms where you can sell items locally, like Facebook Marketplace or Once Upon A Child.
