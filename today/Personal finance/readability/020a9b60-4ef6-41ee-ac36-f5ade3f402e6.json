  "text": "Morning friends! A blogger friend of mine recently came out with a new book, and it’s centered around one of the things that occupies my brain way more than I care to admit ;) The purpose of life. And apparently I’m not alone, as this “purpose anxiety” apparently affects 91% of people! Crazy! So odds are you’ve struggled with this too, which makes this book a perfect read – and giveaway! – for everyone today. It’s called, “The Purpose Code“, and here’s more about it via Amazon: ****** “The Purpose Code” How to unlock meaning, maximize happiness, and leave a lasting legacy Purpose can change your life. Having a sense of purpose has been scientifically proven to help people find happiness, longevity, and health. But lots of us are also worried about purpose―purpose anxiety has been estimated to affect as much as 91% of people. What’s going on? And how do we do purpose the right way―to unlock all its many benefits, set goals in life, make a mark and journey from anxiety to legacy? This question set hospice doctor and writer Jordan Grumet on a quest, and The Purpose Code shares his remarkable findings to help you change your future forever. The result is a self-development book like no other. It turns out that we fundamentally misunderstand purpose and the role it plays in our lives. In fact, there are two different types of purpose. One will lead to anxiety and disillusionment; the other will lead to connection and lasting legacy. In The Purpose Code, Jordan will: Chart a course for you to reach happiness through understanding the deep human truths behind the concepts of Meaning and Purpose (including life review therapy and simple ways of healing generational trauma) Equip you with a practical and proven framework for unlocking your real purpose, and show you the life-changingly enjoyable way to climb to goals, regardless of your situation in life Arm you to differentiate between the two types of purpose when finding life purpose (and show you the hidden reasons why one is always more fulfilling than the other) Set you on the way to building a genuinely lasting impact long after you’re gone. Finding happiness has never been about creating big audacious goals that we may or may not be able to achieve. True contentment comes from filling our lives with enriching activities that lead to connection and, ultimately, legacy. Swap grand but ultimately empty success books for this small goals book, and begin creating your true purpose today.
