  "text": "In 1997, Gary Winnick founded Global Crossing, a company with the bold vision of laying undersea fiber-optic cables to build a global IP-based telecommunications network. It was a massive infrastructure play, designed to form the core transport layer for the internet, connecting data centers and network hubs worldwide. But as visionary as the plan was, none of it mattered without one crucial component: the last mile. That final connection to consumers and businesses determined whether the network could fulfill its promise. Global Crossing became one of the most hyped companies during the dot-com boom, peaking at a $47 billion market capitalization. The demand for internet bandwidth surged – just as predicted. But by 2001, the bubble burst. The company had overbuilt its capacity and couldn’t generate enough revenue to cover its debts. In January 2002, it filed for bankruptcy with $12.4 billion in liabilities. The lesson? You can be early and even right, but if you don’t complete the journey at the right time, the opportunity slips away. As growth investors, it’s a reminder to take some profits from time to time when excitement runs high. Not every rocket ship reaches the moon. Ah, those were the days. I was trading tech and internet stocks on the 49th floor of 1 New York Plaza like a man possessed. Such a career-limiting move in retrospect! I even traded GBLC but can’t recall whether I made or lost money (probably lost because day trading seldom works out). Why Completing the Last Mile Is Everything If there’s one mantra my wife is tired of hearing, it’s this: Finish the last mile. Looking back, I didn’t fully appreciate how much Global Crossing’s rise and fall shaped the way I operate today. When you no longer have a steady paycheck—as I haven’t since leaving my finance job in 2012—there’s no one to catch you if you slip. No meetings? Fantastic! Forget to follow up? Oh well. But also, no paycheck and no accomplishment. Everything depends on your ability to follow through. In contrast, as an employee, you could take two weeks off and still get paid. At large companies, your absence might barely register if you take a three-month sabbatical. But when you're on your own—whether as a retiree or solopreneur—the last mile is all on you. Without finishing the final leg, all the planning, effort, and setup amounts to nothing. A Recent Missed Last Mile That Bothers Me I’m sharing this story because I dropped the ball, and I want to be accountable. As part of promoting Millionaire Milestones: Simple Steps To Seven Figures, I offered readers a unique chance for a 1-on-1 financial consultation. The promotion: buy 55 hard copies at a bulk discount, which would total roughly 40% less than my normal consulting rate, and in return, get a personalized session. Clients could gift the books, and I’d get to help someone directly and spread the word. Even though I'd make no money, it's still a win-win. This promotion ends May 10 and probably won’t return until my next book drops in late 2027 or mid-2028. If you're interested, you can fill out the short form at the end of this page. One prospective client accepted the offer. We exchanged emails, and he filled out the onboarding questionnaire. I reviewed his info, and he proposed a date and time. I mentally confirmed, opened my calendar, created a Google Meet invite, wrote a note about looking forward to the call… and pressed save. Unfortunately, I forgot to actually send the calendar invite! Off we went on a five-night Tahoe ski trip. I even took a few consulting calls during downtime and returned feeling recharged. It's crunch time! But I didn’t realize until the following Thursday morning, four days after we had returned, that I had never confirmed the meeting with him. There was no email, no invite sent. Just silence on my end, with the belief I had a call lined up all along as it was in my calendar. When I finally responded and sent the calendar invite at 7 a.m. Thursday morning, the day of the supposed meeting, it was too late. His day had filled up. Worse, his last email to me was 11 days ago. Imagine paying for 55 books and then hearing nothing in return. I felt terrible. Why I’m Now Bad at Meetings (And What I’m Doing About It) In my finance days (1999–2012), meetings were everything. When helping IPO candidates pitch to clients, I’d sometimes attend 7–8 meetings in a single day. Being punctual and prepared wasn’t optional, it was expected. I'd also often meet with clients for meals or drinks. There was no way I could ghost them if I wanted to build good relationships. But now? I average maybe one business-related meeting a week. I limit consulting to one or two sessions per month to maintain my freedom. That’s why you won’t find my consulting page unless you search for it. The demand is overwhelming, and taking it on would recreate a full-time job, causing my lifestyle to decline. The result? My “meeting muscle” has atrophied. Sometimes I forget appointments that are in my calendar. Alerts pop up, and I’ll still mentally dismiss them, as if they were invisible. Since 2012, my brain has been rewired to operate on my schedule, not someone else’s. So here’s what I’ve started doing since early 2025: Check my calendar every morning Set two alarms for every meeting: 30 minutes before and 5 minutes before Why two alarms? Because I’ve still missed meetings in the past after the 30-minute one goes off. Oh boy… the rewiring for meetings takes time. Success Comes From Closing the Loop You can brainstorm, plan, and prepare endlessly, but if you don’t complete the final step, none of it matters. The last mile is where results happen. Here are some common examples: 1. Job Hunting Plan: Build a resume, research companiesMiss: Never apply or skip interviews out of fearResult: No job, no progress, no money 2. Fitness Goals Plan: Buy gear, get a trainerMiss: Don’t go consistentlyResult: No transformation 3. Starting a Business Plan: Build a site, come up with an idea Miss: Never launchResult: No customers, no revenue, no breaking free from from a job you dislike 4. Writing a Book Plan: Draft 90%, reviseMiss: Never reach out to agents, never get publishedResult: Zero readers, zero impact, no legacy left 5. Investing Plan: Do research, understand the risks and rewardsMiss: Never investResult: Money stays idle, slowing lagging behind inflation as your peers who took risks get richer 6. Education Plan: Pass exams, attend class when you're not hungoverMiss: Only attend for three years and drop out to start a bandResult: No degree and $60,000 of student loan debt 7. Relationships Plan: Come up with a witty opening line to reach outMiss: Never call, meet up, or send the messageResult: Missed connection, no joy, no love, no family, only more loneliness 8. Financial Planning Plan: Create strategy, hire a financial professional, or take advantage of my promotionMiss: Don’t implementResult: Great plan, no results, and being filled with regret when you're 65 The Finish Line Is Where the Magic Happens We all know people who start with incredible energy but never follow through. I’ve been guilty of that more times than I’d like to admit. But the real value, the growth, the reward—it all lives in the last mile. Whether you're building a business, planning for retirement, or simply trying to keep your promises: finish the last mile. The world rewards follow-through. Readers, are there things you’ve started but didn’t complete that crucial last mile? If so, what held you back? Sometimes, not finishing is a sign it’s time to move on—and quitting can actually be the smarter choice if progress has stalled. Do you have any examples where walking away turned out to be the better decision? A realization after the fact: After a 10-minute sit-down with my wife at the dining table, she helped me realize a couple of things. First, the prospective client I forgot to send the invite to had never actually ordered the 55 books—which is huge! That made me feel a lot less bad about forgetting to send the calendar invite. Second, the prospective client could have followed up after several days. Communication goes both ways. Order A Copy Of Millionaire Milestones Today Huge thanks to everyone who’s pre-ordered a hard copy of Millionaire Milestones: Simple Steps to Seven Figures so far. From what I see, Amazon currently offers the best price with a lowest price guarantee. This book is my attempt at writing a modern-day version of the classic The Millionaire Next Door. Times have changed, and so have the many different ways to achieve millionaire status. Click the image to order a copy on Amazon today Unfortunately, thanks to inflation, $3+ million is the new $1 million—and by the end of this decade, $5 million might take that title. Without proper saving, investing, and calculated risk-taking, building outsized wealth is only getting harder. Lucky for us, we have the knowledge and resources to outperform. I hope you enjoy the read!",
