I’ve been making over $4,000 a month for more than 10 years now, and I personally know how amazing it can be to finally reach that income level that you’ve always been hoping for. If you’re looking to earn $4,000 a month full-time or… Do you want to learn how to make $4,000 a month? I’ve been making over $4,000 a month for more than 10 years now, and I personally know how amazing it can be to finally reach that income level that you’ve always been hoping for. If you’re looking to earn $4,000 a month full-time or if you want to make that much extra on top of what you already earn, there are many different ways to get there. You can make $4,000 a month from side hustles, remote work, starting a small business idea, and more. Some ideas include blogging, freelance writing, flipping items, selling digital products, and even baking dog treats at home. Best Ways To Make $4,000 a Month Below are the top ways to make $4,000 a month. 1. Start a blog Blogging can be a great way to make $4,000 a month from home. And, I know this because blogging changed my life. I started my blog, Making Sense of Cents, over 10 years ago while I was paying off student loans. I had no idea what I was doing, but I stuck with it. This blog eventually helped me quit my day job and travel full-time, and I have made over $5,000,000 over the years. With a blog, you can earn money through affiliate marketing, ads, sponsored content, selling your own products (I’ve seen bloggers sell everything from candles to courses to guided travel trips), and more. It takes time and effort to build, but the income potential is huge. You could even start a YouTube channel too! Personally, it took me a little over one year to earn $4,000 a month from my blog. At around 2 years of blogging, I was earning about $10,000 a month, and now I earn much more than that. I really enjoy blogging not only because of the great income I am able to earn, but also because I have a flexible schedule, can help people with my content, and get to work from home (or while traveling)! An article that I wrote that you may like is How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog. Plus, you can sign up for my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I teach you how to start a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken this! 2. Sell printables or digital products Selling digital products, like budget printables, planners, business templates, wall art, gift tags, wedding invites, or educational worksheets, is a great way to make money semi-passively. You create the product once, and then you can sell it over and over again with no inventory or shipping. Some sellers make thousands per month with their products, which I think is amazing.

Proofreading If you’re good at spotting grammar mistakes, proofreading might be a perfect way to make money from home. Proofreaders check for errors in blog posts, essays, social media content, websites, sales pages, and even books. You don’t need a specific college degree, just strong attention to detail. Personally, I have a proofreader for my blogging business, and she is very, very helpful with improving my content and catching my mistakes. Recommended reading: 20 Best Online Proofreading Jobs For Beginners (Earn $40,000+ A Year). 10Proofread AnywhereThis free 76-minute workshop answers all of the most common questions about how to become a proofreader, and even talks about the 5 signs that proofreading could be a perfect fit for you. 4. Bookkeeping Bookkeeping is a high-paying, flexible job that you can do completely online and from home. Small business owners hire freelance bookkeepers all the time to help with their finances, and you don’t need to be a CPA or accountant to get started (nor do you need an accounting degree). As long as you’re good with numbers, organized, and willing to learn software like QuickBooks, this can be a great job from home. And, this is a job that is in high demand and will be for a long time, as businesses need bookkeepers. Some bookkeepers earn $300 to $1,000+ per client each month. With a few clients, you can reach your $4,000 goal quickly. Recommended reading: How To Make $40,000 As A Beginner Bookkeeper 10Bookkeeper Launch CourseThis free training will teach you what you need to know to become a virtual bookkeeper and make money from home. 5. Make and sell dog treats Pet businesses are super popular right now, and dog treats are a fun way to make money. If you like baking and love animals, you can create homemade, healthy dog treats and sell them online, at local farmers markets, or even wholesale to pet shops. Many pet owners are looking for new and interesting options and are willing to pay more for high-quality homemade pet treats. Recommended reading: How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With No Baking Experience) 6. Print on demand Print-on-demand lets you design and sell custom products like T-shirts, mugs, tote bags, candles, and greeting cards without buying inventory or shipping anything yourself. You upload your design to a platform like Printify, Redbubble, or Teespring, and they handle most of the work. You earn money every time something you designed sells. Print-on-demand is extremely popular these days, and I buy print-on-demand items all the time (and you probably do too even if you don’t realize it). For example, recently I wanted to get a thank-you card for my daughter’s preschool teacher. I searched for “toddler daycare teacher thank you card” on Etsy to try to find something that was more personalized to a preschool teacher instead of something generic that you’d find at the grocery store. Another example of something I recently bought was for my husband – he’s been very interested in growing mango trees lately, so I wanted to find him a funny shirt with a mango on it. I was easily able to find mango shirts on Etsy and he loved how personalized the gift was. Recommended reading: How I Make $7,500 Monthly Selling Print-On-Demand Gifts 7. Manage Facebook ads for businesses Many small business owners know they should be advertising on Facebook or Instagram, but they don’t know how. If you can learn the basics of Facebook ads, you can charge clients $1,000 to $2,000+ per month to run campaigns for them. With just two or three clients, you could be earning $4,000 to $6,000 a month. You can learn more about this online business by joining the waitlist here for the FB Side Hustle Course. It’s run by my friend Bobby and my sister-in-law Ariel (as well as their team), and they are really knowledgeable in this particular subject. 8. Freelance writing Freelance writing is one of the quickest ways to start earning money online, and it doesn’t require a degree or certification. Businesses and blogs are constantly looking for writers to help with blog posts, website copy, email newsletters, and more. You can get paid per word, per article, or per project. When I started freelance writing, I was making around $25 to $50 per article. While I don’t freelance write as much as I did before, I now charge around $1,500 for an article that I write for someone. I have many friends who earn $1,000+ per article that they write as well. If you can land just 10 clients who each pay you $400 a month (or 5 who pay $800), you’re already hitting the $4,000 mark. You can learn more at 14 Places To Find Beginner Freelance Writing Jobs. 9. Become a virtual assistant A virtual assistant (VA) helps small business owners with things like inbox management, social media posting, scheduling, blog formatting, customer support, and more. You can niche down into things like podcast editing, email marketing, or Pinterest management, and that’s when you can charge even more. Many VAs start out at around $20 to $25 per hour, but experienced VAs who sell specialized services can charge $50 to $75 per hour or more. With just a few regular clients, you can hit your monthly goal. This job is also great because it’s flexible and remote, and you can work from anywhere with Wi-Fi. I have personally been a VA in the past, and I now have one who works for me and has for years. She is very much needed to run my business so I am very happy that VAs exist. Recommended reading: How To Find Beginner Virtual Assistant Jobs 10. Flip items for profit If you enjoy hunting for hidden treasures, flipping could be the perfect side hustle. It’s all about buying low and selling high. I have flipped items for profit many, many times in the past, and I even had a small reselling business when I was younger. It was a lot of fun and I earned a good income with it. You can find undervalued items at garage sales, thrift stores, estate sales, or even Facebook Marketplace, and resell them for a profit. Popular flip items include furniture, electronics, brand-name clothing, toys, and collectibles. Some people flip items part-time and earn a few hundred extra dollars a month, while others treat it like a full-time business and make $4,000+ a month. It takes some research and patience, but it can be fun and profitable. Another side hustle idea similar to this would be to do retail arbitrage (this is a very popular side hustle idea right now, and I’m seeing it all over the place on social media!). This is when you buy discounted or clearance items at stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreens, or TJ Maxx (for example, you head to their clearance section and see what you can find, like toys or popular cups) and then resell them for a profit on Amazon. Many people use the Amazon Seller app to scan barcodes right in the store to instantly see what something is selling for online. You can learn more about this at How I Made $100,000 Selling Used Items. 11. Drive for delivery or rideshare apps Gig economy apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Uber Eats, and Grubhub allow you to make money using your car (depending on where you live, you may be able to use even just a bike or scooter) and your time. You can work whenever you want, which makes this a flexible option where you can make your own schedule. Now, it may take a lot of time to make $4,000 a month, but it could be possible such as by earning bonuses while working in the app, driving at peak times, working many hours, and earning tips. Please click here to sign up for DoorDash. Recommended reading: 26 Best Gig Apps To Make Money 12. Online tutoring or teaching Online tutoring is another great way to make money, especially if you enjoy helping others learn and you have expertise in a certain subject like math, reading, science, college exams, or even English as a second language. There are also platforms where you can teach music, art, or life skills. Tutors can earn $20 to $60 per hour (or much more!) depending on the subject, your experience, and the site that you’re teaching on. Sites like Preply, Wyzant, and Outschool are good places to start. You can also advertise your services locally or through social media, such as in local parent Facebook groups to see if any parents are looking for tutors for their children. 13. Rent out a room or property If you have extra space, renting it out could be one of the easiest ways to make money. This could be a guest bedroom, basement apartment, tiny home in your backyard, a spare room used for storage, or even a camper or RV. There are even sites where you can rent out your swimming pool! You can rent out extra space on Airbnb, Vrbo, or to a long-term tenant. If you have an RV, then RVshare is a great place to list your RV for rent. Even just a few bookings a month can add up. I’ve met people who pay their entire mortgage just by renting out one room on Airbnb or even by investing in a duplex and living in one half and renting out the other side.

Start a home cleaning business If you’re looking for a flexible and scalable business you can run from anywhere, a remote cleaning business is a great option. You don’t have to do any of the actual cleaning yourself. Instead, you focus on running the business side of things: finding customers, scheduling cleanings, and hiring local cleaners to complete the jobs. So, this means you can manage the business from your phone or computer, no matter where you live. To learn more, check out this article I have: How To Start A Remote Cleaning Business 15. Use reward apps and GPT sites Okay, so this won’t make you $4,000 a month by itself, but you may be able to combine multiple side hustles and reach your monthly income goal. If you’re looking for an easy way to make some extra money from home, Get-Paid-To (GPT) sites can be one way. These sites pay you for doing things like taking pictures of your grocery receipts, answering surveys, watching videos, and playing games. Here are some of my favorite sites that I personally use: Freecash – With this site, you can play games and download apps to get PayPal cash or free gift cards. I’ve earned $302 playing games on my phone in just one week in the past! American Consumer Opinion – With this site, you can take surveys to earn extra money. Swagbucks – On Swagbucks, you can earn points by shopping online, watching videos, and playing games, which you can redeem for gift cards. I’ve really earned more than 110 gift cards over the years using this site! Fetch Rewards – This is a grocery receipt app where you simply just take a picture of your grocery receipt (from any grocery store) to earn points that can be put toward free gift cards. I recently earned a $50 gift card for free with this app. Upside – This is a gas rewards app where you can get cash back for gas or diesel purchases for your car. I used this app about one month ago and received $44 in cash back from a single fill-up at the gas station, and it was super easy. Frequently Asked Questions Here are answers to common questions about making $4,000 a month. How can I make $4,000 extra a month?

Some people make $4,000 in a day by launching a product, flipping an expensive item, or having a strong sales day in an online business.

Some ideas include blogging, rental income, affiliate marketing, selling digital products, print-on-demand, and even saving your money in a high-yield savings account. These often require work upfront, but the income can continue long after. Now, if you want to make $4,000 a month in dividends, you would have to have around $1,200,000 invested in dividend-paying stocks that yield about 4% annually. This is just an estimate, and the exact amount can vary depending on many factors like the stock (and how much it pays), your risk level, and stock market conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow To Make $4,000 a Month – Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you enjoyed this article on how to make $4,000 a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, there are many ways to reach this goal – whether you want to make extra income on the side or replace your full-time job.
