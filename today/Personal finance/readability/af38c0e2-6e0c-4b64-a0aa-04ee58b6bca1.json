  "text": "Executive Summary To earn the CFP marks, candidates must fulfill four key requirements: Education (holding a bachelor's degree and completing the required coursework through a CFP Board registered program), Exam (passing the 170-question CFP exam), Experience (gaining hands-on experience providing financial advice to the public), and Ethics (acting as a fiduciary). Among these, the Education component offers the greatest flexibility in how it can be completed. And while the rise of virtual learning during the pandemic has made it easier than ever to find and take courses from the comfort of home, having so many options to choose from can make the selection process feel overwhelming. Five primary factors can guide candidates in narrowing down their options when selecting a program. First, location – whether in-person, online, or hybrid – serves as an effective initial filter, as in-person and hybrid options are often limited to major cities. Second, delivery format – synchronous (live classes) or asynchronous (self-paced) –  is another key consideration. While synchronous classes provide structure and more direct access to instructors (which can help some students stay on track), asynchronous classes offer greater flexibility (which can be ideal for students with unpredictable schedules). Third, additional resources offered with the program – such as exam prep or tutoring access – can add significant value for some learners. Fourth, cost, including the total 'all-in' price of materials, is another critical factor, with synchronous courses generally being more expensive than asynchronous ones. Finally, familiarity with financial planning topics can influence decisions; while those with less experience (e.g., career changers) may benefit more from the live support offered by synchronous programs, individuals with substantial industry knowledge might prefer self-paced formats. Ranking these five factors from most to least significant can provide clarity and simplify the decision-making process. Once candidates identify their priorities, the next step is to evaluate specific programs that align with their preferences. For example, those seeking synchronous in-person options can use CFP Board's \"Find An Education Program\" search tool to filter results by city and explore available offerings (if any) in their area. Online learners can explore virtual providers – including the 'big five' (Dalton, Brett Danko, American College, Kaplan [College for Financial Planning], and Bryant Virtual Classroom) – which offer a variety of self-study and live class formats to accommodate different needs and schedules. Ultimately, the key point is that aspiring CFP professionals have access to a wide range of education programs and can take a systematic approach to find one that aligns with their goals and resources. By carefully evaluating their needs and preferences, individuals can select the best program to fulfill their education requirements and take the next step on their journey to earning the CFP marks!

Some may have a thirst for greater technical knowledge to better serve their clients (or to refine the services they already offer), while others may see the designation as a way to pivot into a financial advising role – either with prior experience in the financial planning industry or as a career changer entirely new to the profession. Broadly speaking, obtaining the CFP marks or another major designation can have a significant impact on an advisor's productivity. In fact, financial advisors who earn the CFP marks (or a similarly esteemed designation) experience a 38% average jump in productivity, according to the 2022 Kitces study on How Financial Planners Actually Do Financial Planning. Among the major designations available to financial advisors, the CFP marks are arguably the most widely recognized – thanks in part to CFP Board's high-profile campaigns such as \"It's Gotta Be CFP\" and, umm… this one. Not everyone who earns their CFP marks is necessarily planning to become an advisor – I'll include myself in that camp. About four years ago, I joined the Kitces.com team as managing editor, working from a foreign country in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. To say I knew little about the financial planning profession would be an understatement – my background was primarily in children's publishing. I knew a lot of fun facts about mammals but very little about financial planning beyond \"financial advisors exist\". Thankfully, I've had some wonderful mentors (and very patient coworkers) who have helped me develop an abiding love for the world of financial advice – and now, as part of my transition into Senior Financial Planning Nerd, I am \"taking the leap\" to get my CFP marks. While each person who starts this journey has their own different reasons, my primary motivators are: Becoming the trusted source at my (current) job. In my role, I frequently speak with advisors to discuss the issues that firms face and research possible solutions to address those issues. But I also want to gain a stronger technical foundation so I can speak to a broader range of financial planning topics with confidence and offer real insight. Looking ahead, I'd also like to gain more practical experience in the field – which will require a strong technical background as well. Ensuring (more specialized) future career growth. While I don't have plans to leave the Kitces team anytime soon, I recognize the importance of positioning myself for future opportunities. With a humanities degree in English literature, having credentials that demonstrate technical financial planning skills – alongside my expertise in research and writing – will further differentiate me in the financial planning space. Drive for (personal) financial knowledge. Like many others, I have a complex personal history with money and a complex (though largely positive) current money situation. Frankly, it's hard to find accurate and reliable information online. Gaining the knowledge that comes with earning the CFP marks won't just benefit me personally, but will also empower me to share that knowledge with the members of my family who need a stronger financial foundation. Education Requirements For CFP Certification Becoming a CFP professional is neither an easy nor a quick journey. Those looking to become CFP practitioners must fulfill four requirements in order to receive their marks: Education: Hold a bachelor's degree and complete the required coursework through a CFP Board Registered Program. Exam: Pass the 170-question CFP exam, available three times a year. Experience: Gain hands-on experience providing financial advice to the public. This can be achieved through: Apprenticeship Pathway: 4,000 hours of personally engaging with individual clients, including all seven elements of the personal financial planning process, conducted under the direct supervision of a CFP professional. Standard Pathway: 6,000 hours of broader financial planning experience, which must include at least one of the seven elements of personal financial planning. Ethics: Agree to act as a fiduciary, putting the client's needs first at all times. Among the four requirements for CFP certification, the education component offers candidates the greatest degree of flexibility in choosing how to satisfy it. While the exam and ethics requirements are rigidly defined by CFP Board, and options to satisfy the the experience requirement are often limited to those made available by employers, candidates have the freedom to choose from a wide range of education programs to fulfill the coursework requirement. Choosing the right program is an important decision – it doesn't just prepare candidates for the CFP exam, it also sets them up for success as they begin (and advance in) their financial planning careers. The CFP certification coursework covers the following eight topics: Professional Conduct and Regulation; General Principles of Financial Planning; Risk Management and Insurance Planning; Investment Planning; Tax Planning; Retirement Savings and Income Planning; Estate Planning; and Psychology of Financial Planning. After completing the coursework, candidates must take a final capstone course on Financial Plan Development, where they create a comprehensive hypothetical financial plan. The good news is that much of the coursework is designed to help candidates prepare for the CFP exam. However, that doesn't mean that the coursework isn't long and intensive. According to CFP Board, fulfilling the educational requirement typically takes 12–15 months. For many candidates, this is followed by an additional two to three months focused on exam preparation. During this time, successful candidates can expect to spend a substantial amount of time devoted to studying. According to CFP Board, the majority of exam passers spend 11 hours or more studying for the CFP Exam every week. The Current Landscape of CFP Board-Approved Education Programs In 1972, when the first group of students enrolled in coursework to meet the education requirement for CFP certification, the only option available was an in-person program consisting of synchronous courses, with the first live online class emerging in 2003. Today, 252 of the 385 available options (as of the writing of this article) are categorized as classroom or blended programs. While this may give the impression that the majority of programs are, in fact, still in-person, the majority of these classroom programs are affiliated with matriculated undergraduate or graduate school programs (247 of 385), which generally limit their availability to candidates not enrolled as full-time students. Furthermore, at least in my experience, listed classroom programs aren't always up to date. That being said, it appears that most major metropolitan areas in the US offer at least one live in-person program. CFP Board's \"Find An Education Program\" search tool offers candidates an overview of their local education options. To narrow results effectively, select the \"Certificate\" option when searching (unless pursuing a Bachelor's degree or another university program) and filter by state. For candidates near state borders, it may be helpful to check nearby states for additional options (so candidates in Cincinnati, for example, may also want to see if there are programs in northern Kentucky). Once a program is identified, candidates can follow up directly with local providers or universities for the most accurate and current details. As noted above, local programs may not always keep their information up-to-date, so it's worth following up with the program itself to verify dates, costs, and other information. The \"Big 5\" Virtual Programs For Meeting CFP Certification Requirements When it comes to virtual education programs for meeting CFP certification requirements, there are five major players: Dalton Education, Brett Danko, The American College of Financial Services, The College for Financial Planning – A Kaplan Company, and Boston Institute of Finance – Bryant University's Virtual Classroom Program. Notably, while many in-person educational offerings follow the Brett Danko education curriculum, it was difficult to determine the location of these programs from looking online, and they greatly varied in cost, so I've left them off the list. That being said, using CFP Board's program search tool, filtered by a candidate's individual city, will help a candidate determine if that in-person offering is in their area. There is a lot of promotional and descriptive text to evaluate when choosing a CFP Board-approved educational program. While many features are common across providers, certain offerings are important to confirm when making a selection. In addition to differences in cost and instructors, truly differentiating factors that vary between providers include: CFP exam prep materials or guarantees: Some programs offer comprehensive prep resources or even guarantees that students will pass the exam, often for an additional cost. Flexibility in timing and deadlines: Self-study programs often differ in how they handle time limits to complete the program. For example, Kaplan has a cap on the amount of time per unit. Others, such as Boston's Bryant Virtual Classroom, offer access to all course materials for a set period but allow candidates to work at their own pace during that time. On the other hand, candidates may want to be cautious about programs that do not offer these resources unless they are very confident they don't need them: Accessibility to tutors or instructors: Whether for questions or personalized guidance. Access to recorded classes: A key resource for reviewing material after live sessions are held. Payment flexibility: Options to pay upfront in one lump sum or purchase courses individually as needed. Payment flexibility may not always be clear on the website (or offered as an option during purchase checkout), but if it's needed, it may be worth contacting the program to ask about possible accommodations! Determining Which Program Is 'Best' For You Sifting through programs that fulfill CFP certification education requirements can feel overwhelming. Having a clear understanding of the factors that matter most can act as a powerful filter when deciding which program to pursue. Candidates will need to evaluate several key considerations, including where or how they'd like to take their education, the type of structure that works best for them, any budgeting constraints, and their desired pace of completion. Education Location Options The first consideration for future CFP professionals is whether to complete their coursework in person, online, or in a hybrid online/in-person setting. This serves as a powerful initial filter since in-person and hybrid options are often limited to major cities. While proximity plays a significant role in determining the feasibility of an in-person program, candidates should also consider their other personal preferences. For some, the tangibility and camaraderie of a classroom experience might be more appealing, while others may value the inherent flexibility of attending online from virtually anywhere. Synchronous Vs Asynchronous Online Learning For candidates opting for an online program, the next choice is between synchronous (live classes) or asynchronous (self-paced) formats. The flexibility of self-paced courses allows candidates to work through the course requirements at their own speed – faster or slower than the typical 12–15 month average. However, they also forgo the structure of a synchronous cohort and the benefit of set classroom hours. To compensate, many asynchronous programs ensure that on-demand help is available to support students. Synchronous courses, on the other hand, follow a more structured schedule, with each individual course typically lasting four to six weeks. Notably, most online synchronous courses don't allow students to enroll in multiple classes simultaneously – so if an online synchronous program claims it'll take ten months… then it will probably take the full ten months. Additional Resources Provided The majority of education programs surveyed also have a broader CFP Exam prep program – often as an add-on to be purchased – to support candidates in preparing for the exam. These may include exam prep, tutoring, or an exam guarantee. Each of these features may increase the overall price of a program, but they may be invaluable for candidates who benefit from additional structure and resources to retain information. Cost Candidates may also consider the cost of various programs, as well as any additional study materials, such as books that may be purchased. Earning CFP certification often requires a multi-thousand-dollar investment that covers not just the program tuition but also additional study materials (e.g., books, flash cards, audio materials, practice exams), exam prep courses, and the cost of sitting for the CFP exam itself. Scholarships may help offset costs and can often be sourced through employers, scholarship lists, or the education provider itself. Candidates on a tight budget may consider self-paced, fully online programs without all the extra bells and whistles, such as supplemental study materials or exam guarantees. However, this approach requires careful consideration of their individual learning styles and educational needs. Prior Familiarity With Financial Planning Topics Candidates' prior experience with financial planning may make a significant difference in how much support they need to prepare for the CFP exam. To use a parallel example, in my own undergraduate program (remember that English literature degree?), I was required to complete two years of study in a foreign language. Testing was offered to gauge prior experience, and I sat in an unusual spot after three years of high school-level French. I could speak in multiple tenses and read fluently, but oddly enough, I couldn't count past 29. Candidates pursuing their CFP marks may find themselves in a similar situation with financial planning topics. They may be immensely familiar with certain topics – either through their job responsibilities or personal life experience – yet much less familiar with topics that are outside their frame of reference. In my case, I started with an accelerated French foundations course (eight credit hours in one semester!) to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. Similarly, candidates preparing for the CFP exam may want to review practice exams or flashcards to gauge their familiarity with the core topics. Those with less familiarity with financial planning may benefit from programs with more structure and access to tutoring. Conversely, those with more experience may prioritize speed and independence, focusing on the specific areas where their knowledge is weaker. Bringing It All Together Ultimately, how candidates fulfill their education requirement for CFP certification largely depends on their individual circumstances, including time, employer support, and location – as well as their own learning style. Some candidates thrive in a structured classroom environment with deadlines provided by instructors to keep them accountable, while others prefer the flexibility to move through their coursework as quickly (or slowly) as they'd like. However, it's rare to find a program that excels in every area, so candidates may benefit from ranking their priorities – such as location, speed, cost, flexibility, and instructor support – from most to least important. For example, location was the most important aspect for me. As someone who has moved about once every 12 months in my adult life and frequently travels to visit my family scattered across the country, I knew that an in-person program was going to be a recipe for disaster. As such, finding an entirely virtual option was crucial. On the other hand, cost ranked lowest for me because of the generous education stipend offered through my job at Kitces, which allowed me to spread the program costs across (at least) two calendar years. After spending too many hours poring over CFP review sites, I ultimately chose the Dalton Education program to meet my education requirement. It offered a fast, synchronous online option with live instruction, which matters immensely to me. Having access to real-time guidance will help me 'protect and respect' the time needed to complete the coursework while giving me the structure and deadlines needed to push through the 'not-so-fun' parts. Plus, the virtual cohort allows me to connect with classmates throughout the journey. (If you're starting your own education program to meet the CFP exam requirement in the next 12 months, I'd love to connect!) Other Keys To Success From speaking with those who have obtained their CFP marks, several consistent recommendations have surfaced for navigating the process successfully: Set 'non-negotiable' study time, and be prepared to study on weekends. Successfully maintaining a commitment to good study habits relies on two principles: 1) Protect the time by making study or class time the top priority), and 2) Respect the time and use it purposefully to actually focus, study, and stay present in class. Prioritize absorbing principles, not just memorizing facts. In preparing for the CFP exam, understanding the 'why' behind the material is crucial to long-term retention and success. While some rote memorization is necessary, taking the time to grasp the underlying principles will help immensely, both during preparation and on the exam day itself. Use the resources provided – and then some. Candidates who have taken the exam have emphasized the importance of using the available resources, such as instructors, supplemental materials, and practice exams, to adapt the material to their own learning style. Get buy-in from family and friends. Getting one's CFP marks is a major undertaking. Candidates may benefit from communicating with family and friends about the time commitment involved in preparing for the CFP exam. Not only does having these people 'in their corner' make the commitment easier to bear, but being clear with those who would be impacted by the time the candidate needs to spend on studying can also help manage relationships during this intensive period. Build a cohort of like-minded people. Building a network or study group of those in the same boat can be invaluable – mentors and personal networks can go a long way to provide camaraderie and support, but sharing the journey and problem-solving with fellow candidates who are 'in it' together with the candidate can also make a big difference. Pace yourself, and be kind to yourself. This is a marathon, not a sprint. While consistency and dedication are important, it's equally crucial to acknowledge personal limitations. Flexibility and self-compassion will allow candidates to navigate unexpected challenges. Because in the 12+ month journey of getting one's CFP marks, setbacks are bound to happen – so candidates should plan to pivot and be ready to face the unexpected! Ultimately, it's hard to go wrong with choosing the right program to fulfill the CFP education requirement; there are many great options in an increasingly virtual landscape. The real question comes down to the resources and priorities candidates bring to the table. To those starting their CFP journey: We're in this together!

Having a clear understanding of the factors that matter most can act as a powerful filter when deciding which program to pursue. Candidates will need to evaluate several key considerations, including where or how they\u0026#39;d like to take their education, the type of structure that works best for them, any budgeting constraints, and their desired pace of completion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"education-location-options\"\u003eEducation Location Options\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first consideration for future CFP professionals is whether to complete their coursework in person, online, or in a hybrid online/in-person setting. This serves as a powerful initial filter since in-person and hybrid options are often limited to major cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile proximity plays a significant role in determining the feasibility of an in-person program, candidates should also consider their other personal preferences.

The flexibility of self-paced courses allows candidates to work through the course requirements at their own speed – faster or slower than the typical 12–15 month average. However, they also forgo the structure of a synchronous cohort and the benefit of set classroom hours. To compensate, many asynchronous programs ensure that on-demand help is available to support students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSynchronous courses, on the other hand, follow a more structured schedule, with each individual course typically lasting four to six weeks. Notably, most online synchronous courses don\u0026#39;t allow students to enroll in multiple classes simultaneously – so if an online synchronous program claims it\u0026#39;ll take ten months… then it will probably take the full ten months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"additional-resources-provided\"\u003eAdditional Resources Provided\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of education programs surveyed also have a broader CFP Exam prep program – often as an add-on to be purchased – to support candidates in preparing for the exam. These may include exam prep, tutoring, or an exam guarantee. Each of these features may increase the overall price of a program, but they may be invaluable for candidates who benefit from additional structure and resources to retain information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cost\"\u003eCost\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandidates may also consider the cost of various programs, as well as any additional study materials, such as books that may be purchased. Earning CFP certification often requires a multi-thousand-dollar investment that covers not just the program tuition but also additional study materials (e.g., books, flash cards, audio materials, practice exams), exam prep courses, and the cost of sitting for the CFP exam itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScholarships may help offset costs and can often be sourced through employers, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/cfp-scholarships-list/\"\u003escholarship lists\u003c/a\u003e, or the education provider itself. Candidates on a tight budget may consider self-paced, fully online programs without all the extra bells and whistles, such as supplemental study materials or exam guarantees. However, this approach requires careful consideration of their individual learning styles and educational needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-nav-title=\"Prior Familiarity With Planning Topics\" id=\"prior-familiarity-with-financial-planning-topics\"\u003ePrior Familiarity With Financial Planning Topics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandidates\u0026#39; prior experience with financial planning may make a significant difference in how much support they need to prepare for the CFP exam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use a parallel example, in my own undergraduate program (remember that English literature degree?), I was required to complete two years of study in a foreign language. Testing was offered to gauge prior experience, and I sat in an unusual spot after three years of high school-level French. I could speak in multiple tenses and read fluently, but oddly enough, I couldn\u0026#39;t count past 29.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandidates pursuing their CFP marks may find themselves in a similar situation with financial planning topics. They may be immensely familiar with certain topics – either through their job responsibilities or personal life experience – yet much less familiar with topics that are outside their frame of reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my case, I started with an accelerated French foundations course (eight credit hours in one semester!) to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. Similarly, candidates preparing for the CFP exam may want to review practice exams or flashcards to gauge their familiarity with the core topics. Those with less familiarity with financial planning may benefit from programs with more structure and access to tutoring. Conversely, those with more experience may prioritize speed and independence, focusing on the specific areas where their knowledge is weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bringing-it-all-together\"\u003eBringing It All Together\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, how candidates fulfill their education requirement for CFP certification largely depends on their individual circumstances, including time, employer support, and location – as well as their own learning style. Some candidates thrive in a structured classroom environment with deadlines provided by instructors to keep them accountable, while others prefer the flexibility to move through their coursework as quickly (or slowly) as they\u0026#39;d like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it\u0026#39;s rare to find a program that excels in every area, so candidates may benefit from ranking their priorities – such as location, speed, cost, flexibility, and instructor support – from most to least important. For example, location was the most important aspect for me. As someone who has moved about once every 12 months in my adult life and frequently travels to visit my family scattered across the country, I knew that an in-person program was going to be a recipe for disaster. As such, finding an entirely virtual option was crucial. On the other hand, cost ranked lowest for me because of the generous education stipend offered through my job at Kitces, which allowed me to spread the program costs across (at least) two calendar years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program.png\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"Ranking Factors To Help Candidates For CFP Certification Choose The Right Education Program\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program.png\" alt=\"Ranking Factors To Help Candidates For CFP Certification Choose The Right Education Program\" width=\"3125\" height=\"2132\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program.png 3125w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-300x205.png 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-1024x699.png 1024w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-768x524.png 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-1536x1048.png 1536w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-2048x1397.png 2048w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-2000x1364.png 2000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 3125px) 100vw, 3125px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program.png 3125w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-300x205.png 300w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-1024x699.png 1024w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-768x524.png 768w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-1536x1048.png 1536w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-2048x1397.png 2048w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04-Ranking-Factors-To-Help-Candidates-For-CFP-Certification-Choose-The-Right-Education-Program-2000x1364.png 2000w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending too many hours poring over CFP review sites, I ultimately chose the Dalton Education program to meet my education requirement.
