That’s why I was excited to try out Boldin (formerly known as NewRetirement). If you’re someone who wants to know if you’re on… Wondering if Boldin is the right tool to help you plan for retirement? This Boldin Review will break down everything you need to know. Financial planning can feel confusing and even scary. That’s why I was excited to try out Boldin (formerly known as NewRetirement). If you’re someone who wants to know if you’re on the right track, when you can retire, or how to make your money last as long as possible, this tool can help. Boldin is different from other financial tools because it goes deep into your retirement plan. It doesn’t just show your net worth or your spending. It helps you make smart, long-term decisions around social security, taxes, healthcare, estate planning, and more. If you want to take financial planning into your own hands, I think Boldin is a great financial tool to use. You can run scenarios to make better decisions and have more control over your money. You can get a full assessment of your finances, such as your savings rate, investments, and more, and create a financial plan that works for you. Personally, I ended up spending a few hours on the platform just testing different scenarios, tweaking information I entered, and really digging into the details. It was fun to see how small changes could make a big difference in my retirement plan, and I found it super helpful to visualize everything so clearly. Please click here to try out Boldin for free. Boldin Review In this Boldin review, I’m going to walk you through what it is, how it works, who it’s for, and whether or not it’s worth the cost. What is Boldin? Boldin is a retirement planning software that helps you create a detailed financial plan. It was originally launched as NewRetirement, and in 2024, it changed its name to Boldin. With Boldin, you can model your entire financial journey. That includes your savings, expenses, investments, taxes, Social Security, housing decisions, retirement, and more. It helps you answer questions like: Am I saving enough? Should I save or pay off debt? How much house can I afford? When can I retire? Can I retire early? Will I run out of money? Should I convert to a Roth? Can I afford to help my kids or give to charity? It’s built for everyday people who want to understand their money better and make smart choices – with or without a financial advisor. I decided to test Boldin because I want to find things that are easy to use, helpful, and affordable for my readers. When I heard that Boldin lets you build your own financial plan without hiring an advisor, I knew I had to give it a try. What stood out to me is how in-depth Boldin is. You’re not just entering a few numbers. You can actually build a full financial roadmap and test out different life decisions to see how they affect your future. It’s like having a powerful retirement calculator, financial coach, and tax planner all in one. Ready to see what your retirement plan looks like? Click here to create your free Boldin account. It takes just a few minutes to get started. What does Boldin help you do? Boldin is all about retirement planning, and it goes way beyond just tracking your investments. Here are some of the things you can do with Boldin: Get a clear picture of your net worth Estimate your retirement income and expenses Optimize the best age to claim Social Security Learn about Roth conversions and tax planning Model different housing decisions, like downsizing or moving somewhere different See how different investment returns affect your plan Plan for healthcare and long-term care costs Forecast estate value and legacy goals (how much money do you want to leave your children?) Run detailed “what-if” scenarios Whether you’re wondering when to retire, if you can travel more, or if it’s safe to spend a little extra, Boldin can help you find the answer. What I like about Boldin is that it’s very easy to use. You can spend 10 minutes inputting your information into the platform and calculator, or you can spend hours and run tons of different scenarios. Who is Boldin for? Boldin is a great fit for: People who are planning for retirement Anyone curious about optimizing taxes, Social Security, or healthcare Early retirees and FIRE movement followers DIY money managers who want to avoid high advisory fees Real people use the platform to: Decide whether to retire now or later Model the impact of buying a second home Figure out the best time to claim Social Security Plan for healthcare costs during early retirement People say that Boldin gives them peace of mind, more confidence, and helps them avoid costly mistakes. How does Boldin work? Boldin is a tool that helps you build your own personalized retirement plan. You can create a free account in just a few minutes and immediately start adding in your information. To get started with Boldin, here’s what you have to do: Sign up for a free account on the Boldin website. Enter your personal financial information, such as income, assets, savings, retirement goals, and expenses. You can enter as much or as little as you want to enter (there are over 100 data points you can enter, if you want to). Use the planning tools to build and customize your retirement plan. This includes adding life events like downsizing your home, retiring early, or doing a Roth conversion. Explore your dashboard to view projections, compare what-if scenarios, and get clarity on whether your plan is on track. One of my favorite things about Boldin is how detailed and flexible it is. You can go as deep as you want, and you don’t even need to link your accounts if you prefer entering things manually. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to plan their own retirement and feel confident about their future. Boldin’s Best Tools After using the tool myself, here are the features that I think are worth it: 1. What-if scenario comparisons Want to know what would happen if you retired at 40 instead of 65? If you took social security a couple years early? Or moved to a different state? You can create and compare different versions of your plan. Plus, every time you run a scenario or make a change to your plan, you will get instant feedback from Boldin. I think this is so helpful for decision-making and understanding your options. 2. Roth Conversion Explorer This feature helps you explore when and how much to convert from a tax-deferred account to a Roth IRA. It looks at your tax bracket and income projections. You can test out different start/stop years, amounts, and see the impact over time. It’s one of the most advanced Roth conversion tools I’ve seen. 3. Recommendations on how to improve Boldin sends you alerts that can help you retire sooner and manage your money better. For example, you may get an alert that says, “Based on your data, if you paid an additional $250 each month, your mortgage could be paid off before you retire.” These little actionable tips are very helpful! 4. Classes and live events Boldin PlannerPlus users can join live sessions to ask questions and learn directly from Boldin experts. It’s a great way to get support and see how others are using the tool. For example, some of the classes and events I see right now include (there are multiple live events each week, plus classes you can access at any time): Raising Financially Savvy Children Discussing Finances with Your Partner Buy or Rent a Home 15 or 30 Year Mortgage HSA Account Fundamentals Tax Planning Retirement Income Planning Estate Planning 5. Real-time monitoring of your personal financial situation With Boldin, you can get a quick snapshot of where you stand and what you need to do. Yes, you can see your net worth, and you can also create a “watchlist” – which I really, really love. This is probably one of my most favorite features on Boldin. For example, you can watch your: savings rate retirement savings projection cash flow earliest possible retirement date retirement countdown total debt ratio And more. There are around 25 different metrics you can watch. Wondering what your chance of financial success is? With Boldin, you can build your own financial plan and learn ways to do better. How Much Does Boldin Cost? Boldin has both a free plan and a paid plan called PlannerPlus. Free plan – You get access to the basic dashboard, some calculators, and simple projections. This plan is great if you’re just starting out and want a quick overview of your retirement picture. You can get familiar with the platform and explore your finances without spending any money. PlannerPlus – This plan costs $10 a month or $120 per year and comes with a 14-day free trial. With PlannerPlus, you get everything in the free plan, plus you get to use all of the premium tools, such as Roth conversion tools, tax strategies, detailed budgeting and income planning, live classes, Monte Carlo analysis (to test your plan against risk), real-time net worth analysis, a full library of classes and weekly live events, the option to link your accounts for real-time updates, and more. PlannerPlus is best for people who like to run different scenarios, optimize tax strategy, or plan for healthcare and long-term care costs. The upgrade is definitely worth it. Which plan do you need? Stick with the free plan if you want a basic overview of where you stand. Go with PlannerPlus if you want detailed insights, powerful tools, and ongoing support as you prepare for (or live in) retirement. Personally, I think you get a lot of great features with either plan. I tested out both the free plan and the PlannerPlus plan (I personally have the PlannerPlus right now), and I think the information you get in each is great. Pros and Cons of Boldin Here’s what I think are the pros and cons of Boldin: Pros: Easy-to-use financial planning tools Helpful visual charts and graphs Affordable pricing and even a free plan Doesn’t require linking your accounts Super personalized and goal-based Cons: May feel overwhelming at first if you want to add all of your information. I will say, though, that it’s fairly easy to add everything! No mobile app. For me, I don’t care about this, but if you want to use it on your phone, you’ll just have to log in through an internet browser instead. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about Boldin. Is Boldin Planner Plus worth it? Yes, I believe Boldin’s PlannerPlus is worth it if you’re serious about planning your retirement. The free version is a great place to start, but PlannerPlus gives you access to the more powerful features that really make a difference – like tax strategy modeling, Roth conversion tools, real estate planning, and detailed what-if scenarios. For example, you can model scenarios like different budgets (such as pre-retirement, early retirement, and late retirement), model Roth conversions to see the impact on your taxes, model relocating your primary residence (you can see how downsizing or relocating to another state can impact your retirement), model withdrawal strategies for taxes, and more. You also get access to live classes where you can ask questions and get help. For $10 a month or $120 a year, it’s an affordable way to get more control over your future and make smarter decisions. If you’re thinking about retirement or already retired, PlannerPlus can help you feel more confident and prepared. Do I need to link my accounts? No, you do not need to link your accounts to Boldin if you don’t want to. You can enter everything manually if you prefer. Does Boldin work for couples? Yes! You can model plans for one or two people, and it’s great for joint planning. Is Boldin better than Empower? Boldin and Empower are different and they serve different purposes, so it really depends on what you need. Empower (formerly Personal Capital) is great for tracking your net worth and viewing your investments. It’s a good dashboard if you’re focused on investment management and want to see your net worth. Boldin, on the other hand, is focused on planning. It helps you think through retirement timing, tax strategies, spending in retirement, healthcare costs, and more. If you want to understand your future financial picture and actively plan for it, Boldin is a good choice. In fact, many people use both tools together – Empower for investment tracking and Boldin for retirement planning. That way, you get the best of both worlds. Can I use Boldin with a financial advisor? Yes, many Boldin users share their plans with advisors or use it to guide financial planning meetings. Is Boldin easy to use? I found Boldin very easy to use. You can set everything up in just a few minutes, or you can spend hours and really dive into all of the different features. It really just depends on what you are looking for. Is Boldin safe to use? Yes, Boldin is safe to use. Boldin uses bank-level encryption and follows strict data privacy standards. And, you can use the platform without linking your actual bank or investment accounts. That means you keep control and can enter everything manually if you’d like. Why did New Retirement change to Boldin? The company changed its name from NewRetirement to Boldin in 2024 to better reflect its mission. The new name, Boldin, comes from the idea of helping people be bold in retirement – to have confidence in their financial plan. While the name changed, the tool is the same. Boldin Review – Summary I hope you enjoyed my Boldin Review. So, is Boldin worth it? Yes, I think if you’re preparing for retirement or already there, Boldin is one of the best tools out there. It helps you answer the big questions and gives you real peace of mind. I think it’s great for planners like me who are always running scenarios in their heads or in spreadsheets. It’s nice to have everything laid out in an easy-to-use platform that automatically generates graphs and actionable tips for you. I personally plan on keeping my subscription that I started and referring to it regularly. Boldin helps you to: Be more organized Set financial goals See what actions you can take to manage your money better or retire earlier Make informed decisions And more. If you’re ready to take control of your future, I highly recommend checking it out. Please click here to try out Boldin for free. Have you used Boldin?
