I used to be one of those dreamers, and about 10 years ago that dream became a reality.Just a few days after Valentine’s day we had our brand new hot tub delivered. My wife and I were excited as we anxiously awaited the tub to be filled, and the water to be hot enough for us to jump in for the very first time.But if you’re not careful, buying a hot tub can be a huge time and money waster. As we quickly found out, owning a hot tub was much more expensive than we thought.Buying a hot tub is a lot like buying a car. There are almost infinite brands and models to choose from, all in varying price ranges. If you’re thinking of buying a hot tub of your own, the spending doesn’t stop the day your new jetted tub of relaxation is delivered.Here are six hidden expenses that come with being a hot tub owner: 1. Installing an electrical outletBefore we could even think about getting a hot tub, we first needed a 220-volt electric line run to where the hot tub would be located. This cost us close to $1,000. It was expensive, but at least the same line can be used for a faster charging station if we get an electric car one day.2. A sturdy foundationA hot tub needs a sturdy foundation to sit on. Whether it’s a deck, a cement slab, or something comparable, you’ll likely have to install special reinforcements. Luckily for us, we already had a cement slap available. But if you don’t, you’ll need to take this expense into account.3. Increasing electricity billWe asked the salesman how much having a hot tub would increase our electricity bill. He told us about $30 a month, maybe a little more when it was cold outside. He wasn’t even close! It’s been $50 minimum each month in the summer and well over $100 during the winter months.4. Replacing filtersThe hot tub we have requires a total of three filters which costs about $45 a piece. These filters need to be replaced every 4-6 months, so we had to create a recurring budget for this expense. I’m sure we could stretch out the frequency we replace the filters a bit, but the costs will still add up.5. Chemical monitoringHot tubs are a lot like fish tanks; they require constant monitoring of their pH levels, as well as some sort of sanitation system whether it be Chlorine, Bromine, or something similar. A full set of monitoring strips and chemicals cost $100, and will last about two months.There’s also a learning curve to figuring out how to keep everything in balance. If the pH level is too low, then the water may be cloudy. pH level too high and the chlorine may not work as well in killing germs. Chlorine too high and you will scorch your skin when you dip in the tub, but too low and there will be germs. You get the picture.6. Constant repairs and upkeepHere’s another parallel between owning a car and a hot tub. It’s not if your hot tub will break down, but only a matter of when. Our tub came with a full 5-year warranty, but we’re on our own after that. The pumps failed, pipes leaked, and even our main computer board went out once. The cost of upkeep and repairing a hot tub can be hundreds of dollars, and that’s if you can figure out how to repair it yourself.The place on our patio where our hot tub once sat is now since empty, as we sold it a few years ago. The reason we decided to get rid of it is that the cost to keep it was just too high.For the eight years we owned the hot tub we had countless good times relaxing in it both alone and with friends. So, if we could afford the costs we would definitely own one. We still have great memories of the old one though! One day we might buy another one, but this time we’ll be able to make an educated decision as to whether we could afford the real cost of owning a hot tub.Have you ever owned a hot tub? What cost surprised you the most to maintain it?If you are still interested despite the costs, then here are three of the more popular ones from Home Depot to consider:Coronado DLX (LS600DX) 65-Jet, 7-Person SpaGlory 7-Person 40-Jet Premium Acrylic Lounger Spa Hot Tub with 2 Backlit LED Waterfalls and StepsBahama DLX (LS350DX) 28-Jet, 5-Person SpaTagged as: Housing, Money Tips, Personal",
