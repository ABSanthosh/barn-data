  "text": "The Alaska Airlines baggage weight limit for checked bags is 50 pounds. If your bag is heavier — or more than 62 linear inches (linear inches are the length, width and height measurements added together) — you might incur fees.Overweight bag feesAn Alaska Airlines checked bag weight of 51 to 100 pounds incurs a $100 fee, plus any other applicable baggage fees such as the standard checked bag fee. The fee for exceeding linear dimension limits is $150 per bag.The maximum Alaska Airlines baggage allowance weight — regardless of whether you’re willing to shoulder the fee or not — is 100 pounds. Luggage may not exceed this weight limit.Exceptions for active-duty militaryAn exception for the maximum 50-pound checked luggage rule is made for active-duty U.S. military personnel. With a valid military ID, you’re permitted up to five free checked bags weighing up to 70 pounds and up to 115 linear inches each.Military personnel who exceed the 70-pound checked bag limit will incur a $100 overweight baggage fee.Dependents who are traveling with active-duty military personnel must abide by the standard 50-pound maximum weight and 62 linear inch limits. However, dependents of active U.S. military personnel receive the added benefit of having their first two bags checked for free.Oversized bag feesIf your bag has a linear dimension of 63 to 115 inches, you'll pay an additional $150 fee. Bags can't exceed 115 linear inches. It's possible for a bag to incur two fees: one for being overweight and one for being oversized. If your bag falls under both categories, that's a $250 fee.Alaska Airlines weight limit for carry-on luggageFor carry-on luggage, an explicit Alaska Airlines baggage weight limit doesn’t apply. Passengers are permitted one free carry-on and one free small personal item. The carry-on luggage can’t be larger than 22 inches long, 14 inches wide and 9 inches high — including the handle and wheels — or up to a total of 45 linear inches.This carry-on size limitation is to ensure that the luggage can fit in the carrier’s overhead bin or a partner airline’s overhead bin as well. Examples of a personal item include a handbag or laptop bag. Other belongings, like a coat, a personal pillow or an umbrella, don’t count toward your carry-on item restrictions, but a diaper bag does count as a personal item.Avoid going over the Alaska Air baggage weight limitThe Alaska Airlines weight limit policy is fairly straightforward, but it’s easy to overlook, especially if you’re packing multiple bags, traveling with a large party or packing at the last minute. Before heading to the airport, ensure that you’ve done your due diligence by weighing your checked bags in advance. If you find you exceed the standard weight limit, consider if you’re willing to spread the load and pay a lower $45 fee for a second checked bag, or simply leave nonessential items at home.How to maximize your rewards",
