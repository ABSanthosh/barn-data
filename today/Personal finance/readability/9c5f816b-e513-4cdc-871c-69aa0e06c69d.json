Yes, yes, I would start a blog right now, even if I was brand new. There would be no question about it. I am actually very excited… One question I get a lot is “Would I start another blog in 2025?” In fact, I just had a friend ask me this question the other day. Yes, yes, I would start a blog right now, even if I was brand new. There would be no question about it. I am actually very excited about blogging in 2025, and I have many ideas (too many to be honest!) that I am trying to find time for. Blogging has changed a lot since I first started over a decade ago. With new platforms, AI tools, and different ways to make money online, some people wonder if starting a blog is still worth it in 2025. For me, blogging has allowed me to earn more than $5,000,000 over the years, work just a few hours a day, and live a flexible, travel-filled life with my family. I really, really love blogging, so I would definitely do this all over again. Yes, if I were starting new in 2025, there are definitely things I’d do differently – and some things I’d keep exactly the same. In this article, I’m sharing what I’ve learned so you can build a successful blog faster and smarter than I did. Also, you can learn how to start a blog in my free How To Start A Blog Course. In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken it! What I’d Do Differently if I Were Starting a New Blog Here’s what I’d do differently if I were starting my blog today. 1. Focus on multiple income streams from day one Mistake: Relying too much on sponsored posts in the beginning. When I first started making money from my blog, I thought sponsored posts were the best way to earn a living. And in some ways, they were a great way to start – they brought in quick income and helped me establish relationships with brands. But I soon realized that relying too much on sponsorships wasn’t sustainable. If I stopped creating sponsored content, the income would dry up. Plus, working with brands often meant deadlines, contracts, and pressure to meet expectations, which made my blog feel less like my own. What I’d change: If I were starting over in 2025, I would work on different income streams right from the start. I’d focus on affiliate marketing, digital products, display ads, and still do sponsored partnerships (I think they are still great!). Many of these income streams work for you around the clock, meaning you can make money even when you’re not actively writing content. Lesson: Sponsored posts can be great, but they shouldn’t be your only focus. Diversifying your income streams gives you more security and flexibility. 2. Invest in courses sooner Mistake: Trying to figure everything out on my own instead of learning from experts. In the early years of my blog, I spent so many hours trying to learn everything by myself. I watched so many videos, read hundreds of articles (probably thousands?), took every free workshop you could think of, and experimented with different strategies. A lot of what I did was like throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what stuck. Some of them worked but many didn’t – and it took me years to figure out what actually made a blog profitable. Looking back, I now realize that investing in a course early on would have saved me so much time, frustration, and wasted effort. What I’d change: If I were starting new, I’d immediately sign up for a high-quality blogging course. A good course from someone who has already done it successfully is worth it because it shortcuts your learning process and helps you avoid common mistakes. Plus, you don’t have to worry about if you’re missing a step or forgetting something. Some helpful courses that you may be interested in include: Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing – My affiliate marketing course for bloggers. I teach exactly how I’ve earned over $2,000,000 through affiliate marketing on my blog over the years. Traffic Transformation: 21 Strategies I Used to Increase My Monthly Page Views from 17,000 to 400,000+ in 10 Months is a great guide full of actionable strategies that you can put into place on your blog right away so that you can learn how to increase your blog’s pageviews. If you are feeling stuck or if you are a new blogger, check out this resource! How To Make Money Blogging Bootcamp – This free 7-day video workshop teaches everything you need to know to start and grow your blog, including how to choose a niche, create engaging content, drive traffic from Pinterest, Facebook, and SEO, build an email list, and monetize your blog. Lesson: Education can be a good investment if you want to grow a little more quickly because you can learn from people who have already done it. Yes, you can learn a lot online for free, but it can take a while to find helpful actionable tips that are actually worth your time. Plus, I find that the most detailed tips are usually within a course or training. 3. Build an email list sooner Mistake: Not making my email list a focus from the start. When I started blogging, I focused mostly on social media to grow my audience. I thought platforms like Facebook and Pinterest were the best ways to reach people. I thought building an email newsletter list sounded too techy and hard, so I procrastinated. I think I waited several years before I really focused on my email list (maybe around 5 years?). That’s basically lost income, all because I was scared. What I’d change: In 2025, I would create an email list from day one on Kit (this used to be called ConvertKit). I’d set up a helpful lead magnet (like a free guide or minicourse) and build automated email funnels to connect with my audience on a deeper level. An email list is one of the best things a blogger can have because it allows you to build a relationship with your readers and promote your content directly. Lesson: Social media is unpredictable, but your email list is yours forever. I absolutely love my email list these days, and there’s still so much more room for growth that I know I’m missing out on (I’m hoping to change that!). 4. Get help and outsource sooner Mistake: Trying to do everything myself for too long. In the beginning, I did everything on my own – writing, editing, designing graphics, managing social media, answering emails, and even handling tech issues. I even made my first few blog designs! At first, I thought this was something that I had to do so that I could save money, but in reality, it slowed down my growth. What I’d change: If I were starting a new blog, I would hire help much sooner – even if it was just a part-time virtual assistant or a freelancer for specific smaller tasks. By outsourcing things like graphic design, I could have focused more on the tasks that actually made money, like creating content and growing my income streams. And, I would definitely just buy a premade blog design instead of wasting time trying to figure that out myself. The company I would use is this one for nice looking and affordable premade site designs. Lesson: You don’t have to do everything yourself. Hiring help can help your blog grow faster. And, you don’t have to spend a lot of money in order to outsource – it mainly means not wasting so much time on things that aren’t your strong suit. For me, I am not a good web designer, so I should have just found a premade design from the very beginning (they look so, so nice these days too!). 5. Create a digital product earlier Mistake: Waiting too long to create my own product. For years, I relied on advertising to make money. While this is great, I knew I wanted to have my own product as well. It wasn’t until I launched Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing that I realized how wonderful it is to sell your own product. What I’d change: I would create a digital product much sooner. Whether it’s a course, an ebook, or even printable worksheets, having something you own and control is a game changer. Something I want to work on soon is to create more digital products as well (because I only have two!). I have a few ideas in mind and I just need to get started. Lesson: Having your own product gives you more control over your income and allows you to grow your business faster. What I’d Do the Same if I Were Starting My Blog in 2025 Here’s what I’d do the same if I were starting my blog today. Recommended reading: My Secret To Making $5 Million Online \u0026 Working Just 10 Hours A Week 1. Choose a topic I’m passionate about One of the best decisions I made when starting my blog was choosing a topic that I actually enjoyed writing about. In the beginning, I had no idea if blogging would make money, but I knew that personal finance was something I was interested in. That passion helped me stay motivated, even when my blog wasn’t earning much. If I had chosen a niche just because it was “profitable,” I probably would have burned out quickly. Over the years, I’ve seen many people start blogs in niches they think will make them rich, only to give up a few months later because they don’t truly care about the topic. Blogging takes time, and if you don’t enjoy what you’re writing about, it’s hard to stay consistent. Even in 2025, with all the changes in online content, I’d still recommend choosing a niche that excites you, because that’s what will keep you going in the long run. 2. Prioritize affiliate marketing It did take me a few years to get started with affiliate marketing, but I have been very strong with it ever since. And, I am glad I have! Affiliate marketing has been one of my biggest and most consistent income sources. It’s what allowed me to go from making a few dollars a month to earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. When I first started, I didn’t realize how great affiliate marketing could be, but once I figured it out, it became a game changer for my blog. Unlike sponsored posts, which require ongoing work, affiliate marketing allows me to earn money passively – even when I’m not working. What I love most about affiliate marketing is that it’s a win-win situation. I get to recommend products and services that I personally use and love, and when my readers find them helpful, I earn a commission. If I were starting over in 2025, I would still focus heavily on affiliate marketing, because it’s one of the best ways to create long-term semi-passive income as a blogger. The key is to be genuine and honest – only promote products that you truly believe in, and always prioritize helping your audience over making a quick sale. 3. Write high-quality, evergreen content One of the best decisions I made was focusing on evergreen content – blog posts that remain useful and relevant year after year. Some of my highest-earning posts today were written years ago, yet they still bring in traffic and income because the information is timeless. Yes, I still go back and edit them to make sure they are up to date, but most of the hard work is done. In 2025, I would still prioritize writing valuable, in-depth content that solves problems for my audience. While trendy topics can bring in short-term traffic (and I definitely still create these as well!), evergreen posts can give you long-term stability. If you’re starting a blog today, focus on creating high-quality content that will still be relevant years from now. Not only will this help you attract consistent traffic but it will also make monetization easier, as those posts can generate affiliate sales and ad revenue over time. 4. Network and make friends Blogging isn’t just about writing content – it’s also about connecting with others. Early on, I started connecting with other bloggers, joining mastermind groups, and partnering on projects. These connections helped me grow my blog faster, gain exposure, and even land new opportunities that I wouldn’t have found on my own (in fact, the very first way that I earned income on Making Sense of Cents was through a blogging friend!). If I were starting in 2025, I would still spend time on networking. Blogging can sometimes feel like a solo journey, but having a network of like-minded people makes all the difference. Whether it’s through blogging communities, social media groups, or conferences, surrounding yourself with others in the industry can give you support, collaboration opportunities, and new insights that will help you grow faster. 5. Be consistent (even when growth is slow) One of the most important things I’ve learned is that consistency is so important on a blog. When I first started my blog, I wasn’t making any money, and there were plenty of moments when I felt discouraged. But I kept showing up, writing posts, and learning as I went. Over time, my audience grew, my income increased, and my blog became a full-time business. If I had given up early, I never would have reached the level of success I have today. Blogging isn’t an overnight success – it takes time. That’s why so many new bloggers quit too soon. In 2025, I would still approach blogging with a long-term mindset. Even if growth feels slow at first, every blog post, email, and marketing effort adds up over time. For example, I recommend that every blogger writes at least one blog post each week. I also recommend being active on social media (whatever accounts you are trying to grow) and sharing consistently on there as well. 6. Focus on Pinterest and Facebook Over the years, Pinterest and Facebook have been big sources of traffic. When I first started blogging, I didn’t know how powerful Pinterest was for driving free traffic to my blog. But once I optimized my Pinterest strategy – using eye-catching pins, keywords, and scheduling – my pageviews grew and grew. Even today, Pinterest continues to bring in thousands of visitors to my site every month. Facebook has also played a huge role in my blog’s success. Having an engaged Facebook group and page has helped me connect with my audience, promote my content, and drive traffic to my blog. While social media algorithms have changed over the years, these platforms still work when used strategically. If I were starting a blog in 2025, I would still spend my time growing my reach on both Pinterest and Facebook – because even with new platforms coming out, these remain reliable traffic sources. Here are some helpful resources on this topic: Pinteresting Strategies – This is a very helpful Pinterest course that I have personally taken. The instructor teaches the traffic tricks that they used to get over 100,000 pageviews to a brand new site in less than 6 months (this is to show that you can still grow on Pinterest even in 2025!), as well as the traffic tips she uses on the main site that she’s had for years. How to Get Millions of Visitors from Facebook – This free 40-minute training shares a step-by-step process to get Facebook traffic and create viral content quickly. It covers how to create attention-grabbing thumbnails and titles, set a posting schedule, and automate your Facebook strategy, plus advanced techniques for scaling to millions of monthly visitors. How Create More Pins On Pinterest Every Day – If you want to grow your Pinterest traffic, this free 15-minute training is for you! The teacher of this training gets 600,000 monthly outbound clicks from Pinterest (with over 70 million impressions in January 2025 alone!), and he’s sharing his strategy for creating more pins every day – without using AI images. My Advice for New Bloggers in 2025 If you’re thinking about starting a blog in 2025, you’re in the right place! I think that blogging is still a good way to build an online business, earn a semi-passive income, and have more freedom in your life. However, blogging today isn’t exactly the same as it was when I started over a decade ago. There are more opportunities than ever but also more competition. If I were launching a blog from scratch right now, here’s what I’d focus on to give myself the best chance of success. Recommended reading: The 25 Most-Asked Blogging Questions To Get You Started Today 1. Choose a niche that balances passion and profitability One of the biggest mistakes new bloggers make is choosing a blog topic only based on what seems profitable. While making money is important, you also need to enjoy writing about your topic – otherwise, you’ll burn out before your blog sees success. The best approach is to find a balance between what you love and what people are actively searching for. A few great questions to ask yourself before choosing a niche: Can I see myself writing about this for years? Are people already searching for information on this topic? Are there products or services I could promote as an affiliate? Would I eventually want to create a course or digital product around this? If your topic checks all or most of these boxes, you’re on the right track! 2. Don’t rely on one income source – diversify from the start One of the biggest changes I’d make if I were starting in 2025 is focusing on multiple income streams from the beginning. Many new bloggers focus solely on ads or sponsored posts, but these aren’t always sustainable or scalable. Instead, I recommend building a mix of income streams, including: Affiliate marketing – Earn commissions by recommending products you love. Digital products – Sell an ebook, course, or printables. Ad revenue – Monetize through ad networks like Mediavine or Raptive. Freelancing or coaching – Sell services based on your expertise. By diversifying, you protect yourself from algorithm changes or changes in your monthly income. 3. Invest in learning – it will save you years of trial and error If I could go back, I would invest in courses and coaching much sooner. When I first started, I spent countless hours piecing together free information online. While this helped me get started, it also slowed me down. A good course or mentor can give you a clear road map and help you avoid the biggest mistakes that hold new bloggers back. If you’re serious about making money blogging, don’t be afraid to invest in learning – it will save you time, stress, and wasted effort. 4. Build an email list from day one Your email list is the most valuable asset you’ll ever have as a blogger. Unlike social media, which is always changing, your email list is yours – no algorithm can take it away. And that is why I highly recommend starting an email list from day one as a new blogger. A great way to grow your list is by offering a lead magnet (a freebie in exchange for an email address). This could be: A free ebook or guide A printable checklist A minicourse or email series Once people are on your list, you can build trust, provide value, and eventually sell products or affiliate offers. If you don’t have an email list yet, start today! I use Kit for my email list (and have for years!). 5. Use Pinterest and Facebook to get pageviews I recommend using Pinterest and Facebook to drive traffic to your website. People are still seeing really good pageviews from these two sources, even when they are brand new to the site. Pinterest is a search engine (not just a social media platform), and if you create eye-catching pins with good keywords, you can get traffic quite fast. Facebook is also a great way to build a community. Having an engaged Facebook group or page can bring consistent traffic to your blog and help you build a loyal audience. 6. Stay consistent Most new bloggers quit within the first 6 months because they don’t make money right away. The truth is, blogging is a long-term game. In fact, I receive many emails each month that ask “Is it possible to make $5,000 a month from a blog in 3 months?” (or some other short time frame). It personally took me 6 months to make my first $100 and 2 years to turn my blog into a full-time business (I was making around $10,000 a month around 2 years after I started my blog). If I had given up early, I never would have achieved the success I have today. Here’s what I want every new blogger to know: Success won’t happen overnight – but if you stay consistent, it may happen. Even small steps forward add up over time. Every blog post you write is building your online business. Blogging is not a get-rich-quick scheme – it takes hard work and a lot of time! If I Could Start My Blog Over in 2025 – Summary If I were starting over today, would I do it all again? The short answer: yes, absolutely! Blogging is one of the best ways to earn an income, build a flexible career (I love being able to work when I want due to my flexible schedule), and have financial freedom – but success doesn’t happen by accident. It’s important to focus on the right strategies from the start, stay consistent, and always keep learning. If you’re thinking about starting a blog in 2025, go for it!

I thought platforms like Facebook and Pinterest were the best ways to reach people. I thought building an email newsletter list sounded too techy and hard, so I procrastinated.

That passion helped me stay motivated, even when my blog wasn’t earning much. If I had chosen a niche just because it was “profitable,” I probably would have burned out quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, I’ve seen many people start blogs in niches they think will make them rich, only to give up a few months later because they don’t truly care about the topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlogging takes time, and if you don’t enjoy what you’re writing about, it’s hard to stay consistent.

And, I am glad I have!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAffiliate marketing has been one of my biggest and most consistent income sources. It’s what allowed me to go from making a few dollars a month to earning hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first started, I didn’t realize how great affiliate marketing could be, but once I figured it out, it became a game changer for my blog. Unlike sponsored posts, which require ongoing work, affiliate marketing allows me to earn money passively – even when I’m not working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I love most about affiliate marketing is that it’s a win-win situation. I get to recommend products and services that I personally use and love, and when my readers find them helpful, I earn a commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were starting over in 2025, I would still focus heavily on affiliate marketing, because it’s one of the best ways to create long-term semi-passive income as a blogger. The key is to be genuine and honest – only promote products that you truly believe in, and always prioritize helping your audience over making a quick sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.

Yes, I still go back and edit them to make sure they are up to date, but most of the hard work is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2025, I would still prioritize writing valuable, in-depth content that solves problems for my audience. While trendy topics can bring in short-term traffic (and I definitely still create these as well!), evergreen posts can give you long-term stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re starting a blog today, focus on creating high-quality content that will still be relevant years from now.

Blogging can sometimes feel like a solo journey, but having a network of like-minded people makes all the difference.

In 2025, I would still approach blogging with a long-term mindset. Even if growth feels slow at first, every blog post, email, and marketing effort adds up over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, I recommend that every blogger writes at least one blog post each week. I also recommend being active on social media (whatever accounts you are trying to grow) and sharing consistently on there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.
