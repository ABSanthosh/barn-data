  "text": "According to TopResume, 3 out of every 4 resumes are never reviewed. This means all applicants need a way to work around the system and get through the tough filters that threaten to move your resume to the ‘trash’ pile. Enter TopResume, a resume-writing service that not only gets around the modern screening technology by using optimized keywords but can also create a compelling resume for you, one that tells your career story and illustrates your value as a potential employee. Keep reading the TopResume review to learn more. What Is TopResume? TopResume has been around since July 2014, helping job-seekers be competitors in today’s job market. TopResume’s team of experts is comprised of certified career coaches, writers, hiring managers, HR, recruiters, and industry specialists in over 65 categories. They provide expert resume-writing services and career advice to over one million professionals, helping them get the interview and the job. What Sets TopResume Apart TopResume uses a combination of human expertise and resume-scanning software to help you create the most competitive and successful resume. The resume-scanning software, called applicant tracking systems (ATS), is the same software millions of employers use to sift through and sort applications. TopResume uses the system to ensure your resume stands out from the competitors and isn’t ignored by potential employers. When you use their writing services, you get: Professional and individual support from a polished writer A resume that checks all the boxes and shares your career story in a compelling and rewarding manner A resume that will get through the ATS with flying colors Pros and Cons of TopResume  Understanding the pros and cons of any resume writing service is important. Here are the pros and cons to consider, as we found in our TopResume review. Pros Free resume review: TopResume offers an opportunity to review your current resume for free. Simply upload it and receive personalized feedback, including changes you can make yourself. 60-day guarantee: If you hire TopResume for your resume writing services (the Starter package is an exception) and don’t get twice the number of interviews after your initial rewrite, they will provide another resume rewrite free of charge. Potential income boost: A TopResume commissioned study showed that recruiters perceive candidates with a professionally written resume to be worth 7% more than those without professionally written resumes. Higher rate of landing a job: In the same study, professionals who used TopResume’s services claimed to have a 32% higher rate of landing a job, and 68% of those surveyed landed a new job within three months after receiving their rewritten resume. Cons Email communication: TopResume works strictly via the computer. If you aren’t tech-savvy or don’t like communicating via email, TopResume may not be a good fit. Cost for phone consult: If you prefer a phone conversation, you can pay a fee for a 30-minute session, but everything else goes through email. Challenging to brainstorm your ideas: TopResume challenges you to go deeper than the surface when thinking about your career so the writers can craft a compelling resume.   How to Get Started with TopResume TopResume makes it easy to get started with their quick four-step process: 1. Complete the Introductory Questionnaire The introductory questionnaire takes five minutes but provides TopResume with essential information, including details about your career history, personal history, and goals. Sending them a current resume can further streamline the process because it provides your resume writer with the basics. 2. Match With a Resume Writer After completing the questionnaire, TopResume matches you with a resume writer who collaborates with you to complete the first draft. The expert you’re provided will have extensive experience in your industry and your experience level. After gathering the necessary information, your writer gets to work, providing you with a first draft within one week. 3. Review Your Draft After receiving the first draft, you have one week to provide edits or feedback. You can do this up to two times, with the process taking up to two weeks, depending on how many revisions you request. You simply leave comments on the draft for the writer to review and revise. 4. Finalize Your Revisions You get up to two rounds of revisions, but of course, if you’re happy with the first round, you can finalize the process and receive your final draft to begin your job search. Get Hired Faster with TopResumeStudies have shown that candidates found a job at a 32% higher rate when they used a professional resume-writing service like TopResume. Give yourself a competitive edge and invest in yourself and your career! TopResume Fees TopResume offers a free option to get a feel for where your resume stands. You can take the suggestions and DIY your resume or try one of the following TopResume packages. Starter ($149): You’ll receive a professionally written resume with essential keywords to ensure you get through the Applicant Tracking Systems. This package also includes a Career.io subscription for 30 days, an all-in-one career platform for every stage of your job search and career journey. Premium ($219): You’ll receive the same features as the Starter package, a professionally written cover letter, and a 60-day interview guarantee. Ultimate ($349): This package pairs you with an executive writer (top 10% of their network), a LinkedIn makeover, plus everything in the Starter and Premium package. Elite ($699): This package includes a dedicated account manager, an expert writer from the company’s top 1%, a 2-day delivery, two interview prep sessions, unlimited revisions, and everything in the above packages. Security TopResume takes security seriously and properly protects your information from loss, misuse, or alteration. They employ a powerful firewall to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to their software and maintain them regularly. Customer Service If you have questions about the service or problems with your subscription, TopResume offers several ways to contact them. While they encourage you to check out their FAQs first, they also offer email and phone support (available 9 AM to 6 PM ET Monday – Friday). Customer Reviews TopResume has a 4-star rating (out of five) on TrustPilot, and most customers are very pleased, like Teresa: Great service with carefully putting in time and effort I am trying to return to work after being a Stay-at-home mom for over 10 yrs. I decided to try out top resume and although at first there were several issues, top resume resolved them and I have more confidence in there service. The writers are very good and you can tell they spend a lot of time and thought to updating resume and cover letter. Highly recommend top resume! There are also great reviews from past clients on the TopResume website: Casey Cardoza Casey had been working in the nonprofit world for a little over 10 years and wanted to move into the financial services industry. She was eager to use her budget management experience in a different field but needed to figure out how to play up her transferable skills in a way that would attract employers. Plus, Casey was admittedly not great at self-promotion in general. Casey bought TopResume’s Premium Career Evolution package and was paired with resume writer Gemma. Gemma helped Casey determine and highlight the job skills that would be most valuable in her target field; she then optimized the new resume with the right keywords to make sure Casey’s resume would pass the employer’s recruiting software and get in front of hiring managers. Mike Williams Mike was still relatively new to the workforce and didn’t have a clear career goal in mind. He knew he wanted to use his foreign language skills but wasn’t sure what job he should target. In addition, he was unsure how to package his skills in a way that would catch — and keep — a recruiter’s attention. Mike barely had a resume to begin with, so he needed a new one that spoke to these specific selling points in a professional-looking format. Mike bought TopResume’s Starter Professional Growth package and was paired with resume writer Miranda. Miranda emphasized Mike’s Japanese translation proficiency and automotive industry experience, showing the value of his translation skills in the workplace. She also helped Mike optimize his resume with specific keywords for the automotive industry. TopResume Alternatives TopResume isn’t the only resume writing service online.
