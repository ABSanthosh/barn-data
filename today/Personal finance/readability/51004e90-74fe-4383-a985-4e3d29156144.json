Do you want to learn how to make money as a travel photographer? Photography can be an exciting way to get paid to travel. If you enjoy taking pictures and traveling, this might be your dream job. Lots of people love seeing photos from different places, and you could be the one to share them. Traveling full-time for around 10 years was an amazing experience for me. I have been able to visit beautiful places, meet new people, and take tons of pictures. I have also met many, many travel photographers – from National Geographic freelance photographers to YouTubers, travel print sellers, and more. If you love taking great photos while visiting new places, becoming a travel photographer could be a great way to make money. Best Ways To Make Money as a Travel Photographer Below are the best ways to make money as a travel photographer. Recommended reading: 25 Best Travel Jobs To Make Money Traveling The World 1. Sell stock photos Selling stock photos is a great way to make money as a travel photographer. You can upload your best travel pictures to popular stock photo websites. These sites let people buy and use your photos for their projects. When someone buys your photo, you get paid a fee. Some popular stock photo sites are Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, iStock, Depositphotos, and Getty Images. Most of the pictures within this blog post are stock photos, and I use stock photos all the time, as do other businesses. They are very helpful!

Elopements are small, intimate weddings that usually happen in beautiful locations like on the beach, in the mountains, and more. As an elopement photographer, you’ll capture special moments for couples in beautiful places. To get started, build a portfolio that showcases your landscape and portrait photography skills. Couples want to see your ability to capture both the natural beauty of a location and the emotions of the day. You may also want to research popular elopement destinations and familiarize yourself with these places so you can recommend ideal spots for couples. Pricing many times should cover your travel expenses and services, so make sure to think about the location when setting your rates. I follow a few travel wedding photographers online and I’m always amazed by how beautiful their pictures are!

Host photography workshops Photography workshops can be a great way to make money as a travel photographer. You can share your skills and knowledge with others who want to learn more about taking better pictures. I know several people who have taken in-person photography workshops, and I have personally taken an online one. So, I know how helpful they are! Photography workshops that you can teach may include: Camera basics: Teach participants how to use their camera’s settings. Many people have cameras that they do not use to the fullest (there are so many buttons on cameras these days after all!). Lighting: Explain how to work with natural light, use reflectors, or set up artificial lighting to improve pictures. Portrait photography: Teach how to pose subjects and work with natural backgrounds to capture stunning portraits, whether in a studio or outdoor setting. Travel photography: Focus on capturing landscapes, cityscapes, and cultural elements during travel. Talk about how to tell a story with your photos. Night and low-light photography: Teach how to shoot in challenging lighting conditions, like at night, during concerts, or in dim indoor settings. Building a photography portfolio: Show participants how to curate their best work, create a cohesive portfolio, and market themselves for potential clients or opportunities. Editing travel pictures for social media: Teach participants how to edit their travel photos for platforms like Instagram or blogs. I recommend thinking about what you are good at and what you think your audience would be interested in learning about. By tailoring these topics to the interests of your audience, you can create a workshop that’s helpful and sells well. 4. Start a travel blog Starting a blog is something I know well because I’ve been blogging for over 10 years. When I first started, I had no idea it would turn into such an amazing journey, allowing me to travel the world and share my experiences. Blogging has given me the opportunity to connect with people who share similar interests, as well as make money doing something that I enjoy. Starting a travel blog can be great if you want to learn how to make money as a travel photographer. You can share your photos and stories with people who love to explore new places. To become a travel blogger, pick a blog name that’s easy to remember and shows what your blog is about. Use a platform like self-hosted WordPress to set up your blog, and focus on creating good content by sharing your best travel photos and blog posts (try to post at least once a week so your audience stays interested). Once you get more visitors to your blog, you can make money in different ways. You can use affiliate marketing (such as by linking to your travel gear on Amazon), write sponsored posts, or sell your photography services and prints. Travel companies and tourism boards might also want to work with you if your blog has great photos and content that fits their needs. Recommended reading: How To Start a Travel Blog and Make Money 5. Sell prints online Selling prints online can be a great way to make money from your travel photos. Many people love decorating their homes and offices with beautiful travel images. If you want to learn how to become a travel photographer by selling travel prints, you can start by creating an online store to showcase and sell your best travel prints. Platforms like Shopify or Etsy make it easy to set up a shop quickly. I have many friends who sell prints from their travels. They specialize in animal photos, landscape photos, urban cities, and more. I actually just recently bought a print from one of them to put on my living room wall. Pricing is important and you can look at what other photographers charge for similar prints to get an idea of what you should charge. Don’t forget about shipping. Make sure to factor in packaging and mailing costs when setting your prices. You want to protect your prints during shipping. 6. Work with brands or tourism boards You can make money as a travel photographer by collaborating with brands and tourism boards. These groups tend to need great photos to show off their products or places so that they can get more customers/visitors. I have worked with many brands and travel boards/companies over the years, and I think it can be a great way to make money with travel photography. One of my very first side hustle gigs that I got through this blog (the one you’re reading right now) was because I reached out to a resort in the Caribbean and pitched them ways that I could improve their website. They paid me as well as gave me free resort stays (so that I could take pictures and become an expert on the property). You can wait for them to reach out to you, or you can contact travel companies, hotels, and tourism offices yourself. You’ll want to show them your best work and tell them how you can help. 7. Start an Instagram Instagram is a great way to share your travel photos and make money. You can start by creating an account and posting your best pictures. You’ll want to post often to keep your followers interested – at least once a day, especially in the beginning, is usually what is recommended. You can make money on Instagram by working with brands, and they might pay you to take photos of their products, or you could get paid to share a photo of a hotel or tour company. As your account grows, you can sell your own products too. This could be things like photo prints or editing presets. While I do not make a large income from my Instagram account (it’s not my main business), I have made thousands of dollars from my income over the years. It is a fun way to make an income and it pushes you to take better pictures. 8. Create and sell Lightroom presets Making Lightroom presets can be a fun way to earn money as a travel photographer. Presets are like filters that make editing photos easier and faster. I have personally bought Lightroom presets from travel photographers, and I like how easy they are to use on my personal travel photos. People buy presets because they save time and help create a consistent, professional look for their photos. Presets allow people like you and me to apply popular aesthetic styles with just one click, making it easy to stay on trend without needing advanced editing skills. They’re also a great learning tool for beginners who want to improve their photo editing techniques. To create presets, start by editing a photo in Lightroom. Play with the settings until you’re happy with how it looks. Then, save these settings as a preset. You’ll want to share photos on Instagram and other social media sites using your presets. As your photos become popular, your followers will most likely ask you about your presets – I see this being asked all the time! Once you’ve made a few presets, it’s time to sell them. You can sell them on your own website or on online marketplaces for photographers. I recommend that you show before and after photos so buyers can see what your presets do. This helps them decide if they want to buy. 9. Sell your photos to magazines or travel publications A popular way to find travel photography jobs is to sell your photos to magazines or travel publications. This could be small travel websites or even something as large as National Geographic. Magazines and travel publications are always on the lookout for great photos. You can start by researching different magazines and publications and look for ones that match your photography style and travel locations. Take time to study their guidelines as each magazine has specific rules for photo submissions. You’ll want to follow these rules carefully to increase your chances of getting accepted. When you’re ready, reach out to the photo editors. Send them a brief email with a few sample images. Keep it short and sweet. If they like your work, they might ask for more photos. They could even give you assignments to shoot specific places or events. Now, this can be a hard way to make money with travel photography, so remember that patience is key. It might take a while to hear back from editors, and don’t get discouraged if you face rejections at first (because you will most likely hear “no” in the beginning). 10. Start a YouTube channel Starting a YouTube channel can be a great way to make money as a travel photographer. You can share your adventures and photography tips with viewers around the world. I follow many, many travel YouTubers – sailors, RVers, adventurers, those who are trying to visit every country in the world, and more. Travel YouTubers are fun to watch because they take you on exciting trips to beautiful places. They show you destinations you might not have seen before and share their own stories, tips, and experiences. Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make?
