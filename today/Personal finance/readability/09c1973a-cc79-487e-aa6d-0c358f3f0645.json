Being a stay-at-home dad can be rewarding, but it can also be tough on your budget. If you’re a dad who wants to contribute financially while still being there for your kids, the good news is that there are lots of job options that let you earn money from home. You can find jobs as a stay-at-home dad that fit your skills and schedule too. Some dads become freelance writers or photographers. Others do online tutoring or virtual assistant work. There are even jobs in fields like web design and data entry that you can do from your home office. Plus, the ideas I’m sharing in today’s article aren’t just for stay-at-home dads. These are jobs for moms, aunts, uncles, grandparents, caregivers, and anyone else who wants a flexible job that lets them work from home. Best Stay at Home Dad Jobs Below are the best stay-at-home dad jobs. 1. Blogger Blogging can be a great job for stay-at-home dads. It’s also what I do working from home while raising my daughter. For me, blogging lets me travel as much as I want, have a flexible work schedule, make a great income, and write about topics I enjoy. I really love running a blogging business. I started Making Sense of Cents in 2011, and since then, I’ve made over $5,000,000 with my blog. When I began, I didn’t know it would turn into one of the best jobs for stay-at-home parents, but now it gives me the freedom to work on my own schedule and spend lots of time with my daughter. As your blog grows, you can make money from ads, sponsored content, and affiliate marketing. Some bloggers earn thousands of dollars per month. But it takes time and effort to build an audience. The best part is you can work on your blog whenever you have free time. This flexibility is perfect for busy dads. You can write while the kids nap or after they go to bed.

Printables are digital files that customers can download and print at home. They can include things like planners, wall art, or game sheets. You don’t need to be an expert to start, either, and many successful sellers have started with no special skills. To get started, think about what you’re good at. Maybe you’re organized and can make planners. Or you’re creative and can design wall art. Game printables are also popular for parties.

You can also find work on freelance websites. Some dads even start their own proofreading businesses. The pay for proofreading varies. It depends on your experience and the type of work.

Survey sites will send you surveys that match your profile and you can do them whenever you have a few minutes free. Most surveys take 5 to 20 minutes to finish. You might earn $0.50 to $5 per survey. Some special surveys pay even more. The money adds up over time. You could make an extra $50 to $100 a month just by sharing your thoughts.

Virtual assistants work from home and help businesses with tasks they don’t have time for, such as with managing social media, scheduling appointments, editing a podcast, handling admin tasks, or answering emails. Many virtual assistants earn $15 to $20 per hour when starting out. With experience, you could make even more. Some full-time virtual assistants earn over $10,000 a month. Virtual assistant work is flexible. You can often set your own hours and choose your clients. This makes it perfect for dads who need to balance work and family time.

You can use your creative skills to make money while being there for your kids. Graphic designers create visual content for businesses and individuals, such as logos, websites, social media graphics, and more. You don’t need a degree to start but having a portfolio of your work is important. You can learn graphic design skills through online courses or tutorials. Many graphic designers work as freelancers. This means you can set your own hours and take on as much or as little work as you want. 10. Online tutor Online tutors help students with subjects like math, science, or English. Many websites connect tutors with students who need help. You can set your own schedule and work when it’s convenient for you, so the flexibility is great for balancing family time and work. Pay for online tutoring varies, but some tutors make around $25 an hour or more. The more experience you have, the more you can charge. You might start with lower rates and increase them as you build a good reputation. 11. Social media manager Social media managers are in high demand. This job is great for stay-at-home dads who like being online. They spend their day posting content, talking to followers, and growing social media accounts. Many companies need help with their social media. You can work for one business or manage accounts for several clients. The pay is good too. Some managers make $300 to $3,000 a month when starting out. 12. Customer service representative Customer service rep jobs are great for stay-at-home dads. You can work from home and help people with their questions or problems. Many companies hire remote customer service reps. You might answer phone calls, respond to emails, or chat online with customers. You’ll need good communication skills and patience. Being able to stay calm when dealing with upset customers is important too, of course. Pay for these jobs can vary, and some pay hourly rates between $15 to $20 or more. 13. Web developer Web development is a great job for stay-at-home dads. You can design and build websites from home while taking care of your kids. Many companies hire remote web developers, giving you flexibility. To get started, you’ll need to learn coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are lots of free online courses to teach you these skills. You can practice by making your own website or helping friends with theirs. As a web developer, you might create new sites from scratch or update existing ones. You could specialize in front-end design, which is what visitors see. Or you might focus on back-end development, which handles how the site works behind the scenes. Web developers can earn good money. Your pay will depend on your skills and experience. You might charge hourly rates or set project fees. 14. Craft seller Selling crafts can be a great job for stay-at-home dads.

Small businesses usually need help reaching new customers online, and you can learn to run these ads and help local stores and businesses grow. Many business owners don’t have time to figure out Facebook advertising. That’s where you come in. You can set up and manage their ad campaigns from home. This job lets you work flexible hours while the kids are busy or asleep. You might start with just one or two clients. As you get better, you could take on more businesses. The best part? You could earn good money doing this. Some people make $1,000 or more per month from each client. That can add up fast if you have a few businesses you’re helping. Facebook is a huge platform for ads. More and more companies want to advertise there. This means there’s lots of work for people who know how to run these ads. There is a free webinar (you can sign up here – How To Start Your Very Own Facebook Ad Agency In 30 Days Even If You’ve Never Written An Ad Before!) that will teach you how to start this business even if you’re new. 18. Print-on-demand Print-on-demand is a fun way for stay-at-home dads to make money. You can create custom designs for T-shirts, mugs, and other items without keeping any inventory. Here’s how it works: You make a design and upload it to a website. When someone buys your product, the website prints your design and ships it to the customer. You don’t need to be an artist to do this. Many successful designs are just words or simple graphics. You can start with basic ideas and see what sells well. Popular items for print-on-demand include T-shirts, coffee mugs, phone cases, and tote bags. There are many more options too, like blankets, pet bowls, and even jigsaw puzzles. I recommend signing up for the freebie 17 Hot-Selling Print-on-Demand Products That Can Pay for Your Next Vacation and More! to learn more. 10Print-On-Demand Free GuideThis freebie will teach you about print-on-demand as well as give you a list of 17 hot-selling products you can sell via print on demand. 19. Run a dog treat bakery Starting a dog treat bakery can be a fun and rewarding job for stay-at-home dads. You can make tasty treats for furry friends right in your own kitchen. You can sell your treats in many ways. Tell your friends and family about them. Set up a booth at local farmers markets. You could even sell online through sites like Etsy. As a side job, you could make $500 to $1,000 a month baking dog treats. If you want to do it full-time, you could even earn several thousand dollars each month. I also recommend reading How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!) if you are interested in baking dog treats. 20. Stock photo photography Stock photo photography can be a great job for stay-at-home dads who want to get paid to take pictures. You can take pictures while spending time with your kids at parks, playgrounds, or around the house. Many websites and businesses need photos for their content. They usually buy these images from stock photo sites. As a photographer, you can upload your pictures to these sites and earn money when people buy them. You don’t need fancy equipment to start. A good smartphone camera can work well for many types of stock photos. Try taking pictures of everyday objects, nature scenes, or people doing common activities. It’s important to learn what kinds of photos sell best. Look at popular stock photo sites to see what’s in demand. You can also join online groups for stock photographers to get tips and advice. This job gives you flexibility because you can take photos whenever it fits your schedule. I buy stock photos all the time for my business, and so do many other people that I know. Finding quality pictures can be hard at times, so I think it would be a great business to get into. 21. Twitch streamer Twitch is a website where you can live stream yourself playing games, cooking, or just talking with viewers. To start, you’ll need a computer or gaming console and an internet connection. Set up your Twitch account and start streaming regularly. You’ll want to try to be fun and engaging with your audience. Keep in mind, it’s not easy to make a lot of money on Twitch. Only a small number of streamers earn a good income. But if you enjoy gaming and interacting with people, it could be a fun way to earn some extra cash as a stay-at-home dad. Recommended reading: How Much Do Twitch Streamers Make? 22. YouTuber Being a YouTuber can be a fun way for stay-at-home dads to make money. You can create videos about topics you love (like travel, family life, finance, food, and more) and share them with people all over the world. To start a YouTube channel, you’ll need a camera, a microphone, and some basic video editing skills. Don’t worry if you’re not perfect at first – practice makes it better! I’ve watched so many amazing YouTube channels where they just learned as they went. As your channel grows, you might start earning money from ads on your videos. You could also get paid to talk about products you like or sell your own merchandise. Recommended reading: How Much Do YouTubers Make? 23. Manage short or long-term rentals You can make money as a stay-at-home dad by managing short or long-term rentals that you own as a landlord. This job lets you work from home while helping property owners rent out their spaces. Your tasks might include listing properties online, answering questions from potential renters, and scheduling bookings. You’ll also need to handle check-ins and checkouts, and make sure the rentals are clean and ready for guests. You can start by managing a single property, like a vacation home or an apartment. As you gain experience, you might take on more rentals to increase your passive income. I know many dads who have bought properties in order to rent them out. The income is fairly passive, which can be great for someone who wants to stay at home with their kids. Recommended reading: How This 34 Year Old Owns 7 Rental Homes 24. Buy items to resell online Buying items to resell online can be a fun way to make money as a stay-at-home dad. You can search for deals at thrift stores, garage sales, or clearance sections like clothes, toys, electronics, or collectibles. You don’t need a lot of money to start and even $50 can get you going. Once you find good deals, list the items on sites like eBay, Amazon, or Facebook Marketplace. As you make sales, reinvest the money to buy more items. This can help your business grow over time. It’s important to research prices before buying anything. This helps make sure you can sell for a profit. With practice, you’ll get better at spotting good deals. One of my good friends when I was growing up had a stay-at-home dad who flipped items as a side hustle. She now does something very similar as her full-time business! I recommend watching this helpful free webinar – Turn Your Passion For Visiting Thrift Stores, Yard Sales \u0026 Flea Markets Into A Profitable Reselling Business In As Little As 14 Days. 25. Food delivery Food delivery for companies like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub is a great option for stay-at-home dads. You can work flexible hours and earn money while taking care of your kids. You’ll pick up food from restaurants and bring it to customers’ homes. It’s easy to get started – just sign up with a company and download their app. You can choose when to work based on your family’s schedule. Now, you won’t be able to bring your kids with you, but this may be a job that you do when someone else is watching your child, such as a spouse or another family member.
