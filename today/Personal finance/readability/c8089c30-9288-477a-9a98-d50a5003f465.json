From college tuition to wedding expenses to helping with a down payment on a first home, it’s easy to open your wallet in the name of love. But while generosity is a beautiful quality, it can also come with a hidden cost: your own financial security.Many retirees find themselves struggling to make ends meet because they gave too much to their children during their working years. Here are seven shocking ways helping your kids can leave you broke in retirement — and how to avoid falling into the same trap.These Things Can Keep You Broke in Retirement1. Paying for College Without a PlanCovering college tuition and expenses is one of the biggest ways parents support their kids, but it’s also one of the easiest ways to derail retirement savings. With the cost of higher education soaring, parents often find themselves dipping into 401(k)s, IRAs, or even home equity to pay for tuition. Unfortunately, these withdrawals can create significant tax burdens, penalty fees, and a loss of future growth on investments meant to support your retirement.Worse still, once that money is gone, it’s gone, unlike student loans that can be refinanced or deferred. Helping your child is admirable, but doing so without a clear plan can jeopardize your own financial well-being.2. Co-Signing Loans That Come Back to Haunt YouCo-signing a student loan, car loan, or mortgage for your child might seem like a quick way to help them build credit or afford that first home. But if your child struggles to make payments, the responsibility falls squarely on you. Missed payments can tank your credit score and leave you on the hook for the entire debt, often at the worst possible time…like right before retirement.Some parents end up paying off loans they never expected to cover, draining savings they’d counted on to support their golden years. Think twice before putting your name on the dotted line. It might come back to haunt you.3. Funding Lavish Weddings or Dream HomesIt’s natural to want to help your children celebrate milestones like weddings or buying their first house. However, lavish spending on these occasions can quickly eat away at your retirement savings. Parents sometimes take out personal loans or raid their retirement accounts to fund big weddings or generous down payments, believing they’ll “catch up later.”The reality? Most don’t. Once those funds are spent, they can’t be replaced, and the financial hit can be devastating. It’s okay to contribute to life’s big moments, but setting a clear budget that doesn’t compromise your own future is crucial.4. Providing Ongoing Financial SupportSometimes, adult children rely on their parents for ongoing help with rent, car payments, groceries, or other everyday expenses. While it might seem like a small monthly contribution, these payments can quietly drain your retirement funds over time. What starts as a temporary bridge during tough times can turn into a long-term financial lifeline that parents can’t easily turn off.Many retirees are shocked to find themselves supporting their kids well into their own 60s or 70s, long after they planned to enjoy financial freedom. Before offering continuous help, consider whether it’s enabling dependence or hindering your own ability to retire comfortably.Image source: Pexels5. Sacrificing Your Own Emergency FundParents often feel compelled to help their children during financial crises, even if it means sacrificing their own emergency savings. Whether it’s covering a medical bill, car repair, or sudden job loss, raiding your nest egg might seem like the right thing to do. But once that cushion is gone, you’re left vulnerable to unexpected expenses in your own life, like health issues or home repairs.Financial experts recommend prioritizing your own emergency fund before extending help to others. Otherwise, you could find yourself in a financial bind at a time when earning more income is no longer an option.6. Moving in Together Without BoundariesInviting your adult child (and sometimes their family) to move in can sound like a win-win: they save on rent, and you enjoy the company. But without clear boundaries, shared living arrangements can drain your finances faster than you think. Utility bills, groceries, home maintenance, and even additional wear and tear on the house all add up, often without formal rent contributions or shared responsibilities.Parents who foot the entire bill may find themselves spending hundreds or even thousands each month supporting adult children at home, all while their own retirement plans suffer. Establishing ground rules and financial expectations is key to making multi-generational living work.7. Letting Guilt Guide Your DecisionsOne of the most subtle yet powerful ways parents end up broke in retirement is by letting guilt guide their financial choices. It’s easy to feel obligated to help your kids succeed, especially if they’re struggling. But giving in to guilt often means ignoring your own needs, risking your security for the sake of keeping the peace.The truth is that financial independence is just as important for parents as it is for kids. Learning to say “no” when necessary and focusing on long-term stability ensures you can continue to support your children emotionally without sacrificing your own well-being.You Need to Set BoundariesSupporting your children financially is a loving gesture, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of your own retirement security. By setting boundaries, making informed choices, and prioritizing your own needs, you can strike a balance between helping your kids and protecting your financial future.Have you ever found yourself giving too much? Or perhaps you’ve learned a valuable lesson about saying no?Read More:7 Financial Moves That Made Retirement Way Harder Than Expected6 Reasons Why More Retirees Continue Working Than Ever BeforeRiley is an Arizona native with over nine years of writing experience.
