That can add up to a lot of money. If you’re successful in this niche you can make a lot more versus freelance blogging. The only downside is that your work may be a little less consistent.If you want to break into magazine writing one of the best places to begin your search is the Writer's Market.

Not only that, but the Writer's Market has the name of editors to pitch as well submission guidelines and pay.This is one book I’ve had on my shelf for a couple of years now and is a wealth of information.Getting Jobs Off of Popular Job BoardsWhen I first embarked upon my freelance writing journey job boards were my go-to. I scoured my favorite job boards daily applying to as many writing jobs as I could.You can find jobs like blog post writing, resume writing, and more on job boards.Problogger Job Board. Screenshot by The College Investor.Here are a couple of my favorites:Problogger Job Board – The Problogger Job Board has many opportunities in many different niches on a weekly basis. Scour this job board daily and apply to anything that seems like a good fit to you.Freelance Writing Gigs – Freelance Writing Gigs is a blog that scours the web and curates all the best new job offers on a daily basis.You can find a list of other freelance writing job board sites here.*Tip* When applying to job boards it’s extremely important that you’re only applying for jobs that you have specific knowledge in. Job Boards can be extremely competitive so the more you can position yourself as the “expert” the higher your chances of snagging that job will be.Finding Unique Gigs on CraigslistAnother one of my go-to places when I was a beginner freelance writer was Craigslist.Craigslist is a place you can find unique opportunities. There’s also the possibility of getting scammed on Craigslist so it’s important to do your due diligence and sign a contract before performing any work.To find writing gigs on Craigslist simply search big cities (like New York or L.A. for example) and then go to the “Jobs” section and click “writing/editing.”From here you’ll be able to look through the listings and find the work from home opportunities.Craiglist Job Board. Screenshot by The College Investor.My favorite job from Craigslist was writing business descriptions for directories. I would write 100 word descriptions of various business (everything from AstroTurf companies to high-end hotels) which would be submitted to directories. I only received $2 per description, but since they were fairly easy to write the money added up quickly.I usually netted at least $300 a week doing this in my spare time.Cold Pitch to Find Your Own ClientsAfter going the job board and Craigslist route for months I finally transitioned to finding my own clients. I found this method to be the absolute best for creating a steady stream of clients who I actually enjoyed working with.While finding your own clients is probably ideal, there are a few things you’ll need to do to make this work:Choose a Writing Niche – Pinpoint exactly what you want to write about.To get jobs you need to establish that you have expertise in a particular subject. Choose a topic that you enjoy writing about but also are very knowledgeable in.Build a Freelancer’s Websites or Blog – The next step is to make your own little “home” on the internet. If you already have a blog in the niche you want to write in you can simply add a “hire-me” page to your blog.If you don’t have a blog then create a freelancers website with the domain as your first and last name. You can then add an about me page, a services page, and also be sure to list contact information.Collect a Few Writing Samples – If you have published work in the niche you want to break into then you’re in good shape! Simply link to those pieces from your writer’s website.If you have no previous work then you’re going to need to find a blog or business you can submit a couple of articles to for free.Start Pitching – The next step is to narrow down business and blogs that use freelance writers and pitch them. Be sure to make your pitches customized for each particular business or blog.Rinse and repeat!Cold pitching companies can sound a little overwhelming at first but once you get the process down it becomes very simple. If you’re serious about making a living freelance writing this is one of the absolute best ways to get a steady stream of paying clients, I promise!If you want to start a freelance writing business (especially for bloggers), check out this course: Freelance Writing For Bloggers. It will teach you everything you need to know about how to start writing for online publications.If you’re interested in earning some extra income by writing I hope that one of the ideas above has inspired you to take action!Freelance writing can be a fantastic way to earn money and can even lead to full-time income if you can consistently produce quality work.Do you have any questions about earning money through freelance writing?",
