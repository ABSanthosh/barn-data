Alliant Credit Union High-Rate Checking Best for ATM Reimbursements Minimum Deposit: $0 Bonus: $0 Monthly fees: $0 See offer page for more details \u003e The Alliant Credit Union High-Rate Checking account isn’t specifically for students, but it offers many benefits students could use, including no monthly minimum balance requirements and a high interest rate of 0.25% on any balance. The largest perk for most students is the ability to use any ATM, and Alliant will automatically reimburse you for any fees that day, up to $20 a month.

Wells Fargo Clear Access Banking Best for Low Balances Minimum Deposit: $25 Bonus: $0 Monthly fees: $5 if not 13 – 24 years old See offer page for more details \u003e The Wells Fargo Clear Access Banking account is one of the best student checking accounts because students automatically avoid the monthly maintenance fee, and there are no overdraft fees. This simple checking account doesn’t pay interest, but it’s made for account holders with lower balances, such as teens. There’s no monthly minimum balance required, and students have access to many features, including Zelle, mobile deposit, and the ability to add their debit card to their digital wallet.  Wells Fargo has around 11,000 fee-free ATMs and provides 24/7 monitoring to catch fraud before it gets out of hand. The account doesn’t provide access to paper checks, and there’s no chance for overdraft since they’ll decline your purchases that exceed your limit (with a few exceptions). Pros No overdraft feeLarge ATM networkNo minimum balance requirement Cons No interest paidTransactions could be declined if you don’t have the funds Open an Account How to Choose the Best Student Checking Account Choosing the best student checking accounts is a big decision. Here are the key factors to consider: Will you keep the account after you graduate or become an ‘adult’? What are the monthly maintenance fees, and how do you waive them? How convenient are the bank’s ATMs? Does the bank offer mobile banking features you’ll use? Do you want to earn interest? Does the account require a specific monthly balance? Pros and Cons Like any bank account, there are pros and cons to student checking accounts to consider. Pros Most don’t charge monthly fees, or they are easy to waive based on age No monthly minimum balance requirements Options for overdraft coverage or to decline purchases that exceed the limit Mobile-friendly bank account management Many include budgeting or savings tools Cons Many banks don’t pay interest You can only have the account until you graduate or hit a certain age Most banks offering these accounts don’t have physical branches How to Open a Student Checking Account  It’s easy to open a student checking account, as most banks offer the option online. Be sure you have proof of your eligibility as a student, such as your student ID. You’ll also need your date of birth, Social Security number, and driver’s license or state ID. To apply, you’ll complete a quick form online and link an external bank account to fund the account. If you don’t have an external account, you may want to look for a bank where you can open the account in person so you can bring cash or a check to deposit funds.  To finalize the account, you’ll sign the account agreement and receive your account information to get started! Methodology We use several important factors to select the best student checking accounts for our readers. Each relates in some way to the cost, yield, or usefulness of these accounts. Account Fees Student checking accounts aren’t known for excessive fees. That wouldn’t be very respectful of students’ meager budgets. Still, some student checking accounts really go the extra mile to minimize fees. They don’t charge monthly maintenance fees, or they make it easy to waive those fees with student status.  Minimum Deposit and Balance Requirements The best student checking accounts have no minimum deposit or ongoing minimum balance requirements. This is a nod to the fact that students often don’t have much to spare. Account Opening Promotions There’s nothing quite like qualifying for a bank account opening promotion right out of the gate. Some student checking accounts deliver impressive opening boosts of $100 or more. Just make sure you can complete any required qualifying activities during the introductory period, if applicable. Account Yield Even a modest yield gives an account an edge in a low-rate environment. The best student checking accounts can’t quite match the top savings accounts on the market, but they typically edge out big-bank checking accounts that don’t pay interest. Age Requirements and Other Eligibility Criteria Not all student checking accounts limit eligibility to college-age account holders. Some let you in even if you’re heading back to school after a long hiatus or getting a second degree (or continuing your education) after years in the workforce. Value-Added Features Some student checking accounts come with additional bells and whistles that increase their appeal and make them better for everyday use. Examples include automated savings tools, instant P2P transfers, access to thousands of fee-free ATMs, in-app budgeting tools, and joint or custodial account capabilities.  FAQs You have questions about checking accounts for college students. We have answers. Can Anyone Open a Student Checking Account? Some student checking accounts actively restrict membership to younger individuals, most often those between 17 and 23 or 24 years old.  Others are not restricted based on age or student status — meaning you can hold onto them as long as you wish after graduating. Some offer a clear path to “graduate” to non student accounts without transferring your balances or going through the trouble of reapplying. What Happens to Your Student Checking Account When You Graduate? It depends on the bank. Often, you can convert or upgrade your student account to an adult account without reapplying or transferring your balance. If you don’t have that option, you might need to close your student account and transfer the funds to a new checking account with the same bank. Is There an Age Limit on Your Student Checking Account? It depends on the bank; some limit age eligibility to college-age students, typically between 17 and 24. Others are more lenient and allow any adult to have a student account in their name as long as they’re enrolled in a recognized degree or certificate program on at least a part-time basis. (Often, “part-time” means half-time or greater.) Can Minors Open Student Checking Accounts? Many banks allow 17-year-olds to open student checking accounts if they turn 18 during the first year of a recognized degree or certificate program. A parent or guardian’s authorization must approve accounts for these students, however. Otherwise, minors generally can’t open student checking accounts on their own. Some banks offer checking accounts for teens or high school students, typically as custodial or joint accounts shared with a parent. When Should you Open a Student Checking Account? Student checking accounts are best for people within the 17 – 24 age bracket and who attend school. They provide you with some protections regular checking accounts don’t, including automatically waiving the monthly fee.  If you carry a low balance and worry about overdrafts or want budgeting tools that many student checking accounts offer, there’s typically nothing to lose. Just be aware of when they ‘expire’ and what will happen, as many banks automatically turn it into a regular checking account that may have higher fees or different requirements.

Some offer a clear path to “graduate” to non student accounts without transferring your balances or going through the trouble of reapplying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat Happens to Your Student Checking Account When You Graduate?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt depends on the bank. Often, you can convert or upgrade your student account to an adult account without reapplying or transferring your balance. If you don’t have that option, you might need to close your student account and transfer the funds to a new checking account with the same bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIs There an Age Limit on Your Student Checking Account?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt depends on the bank; some limit age eligibility to college-age students, typically between 17 and 24. Others are more lenient and allow any adult to have a student account in their name as long as they’re enrolled in a recognized degree or certificate program on at least a part-time basis. (Often, “part-time” means half-time or greater.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCan Minors Open Student Checking Accounts?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany banks allow 17-year-olds to open student checking accounts if they turn 18 during the first year of a recognized degree or certificate program. A parent or guardian’s authorization must approve accounts for these students, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, minors generally can’t open student checking accounts on their own. Some banks offer checking accounts for teens or high school students, typically as custodial or joint accounts shared with a parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhen Should you Open a Student Checking Account?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStudent checking accounts are best for people within the 17 – 24 age bracket and who attend school. They provide you with some protections regular checking accounts don’t, including automatically waiving the monthly fee. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you carry a low balance and worry about overdrafts or want budgeting tools that many student checking accounts offer, there’s typically nothing to lose. Just be aware of when they ‘expire’ and what will happen, as many banks automatically turn it into a regular checking account that may have higher fees or different requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEditorial Disclosure: This content is not provided by the bank advertiser.
