Over the last 30 years, this cost has increased by up to to 500% — regardless of whether the school was public, private, a four-year or a two-year college. This is why it’s important to apply for scholarships and grants to help cover this ever-rising expense and to minimize your student loan debt after you graduate.College scholarships and fellowships for math, science and engineering students are among the most generous and prestigious awards.In addition to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) scholarships, you can search for other scholarships using a free scholarship search service, such as Fastweb.com and the College Board’s Big Future.
