On gym days I’ve started doing this thing where after our boot camp I reward myself by grabbing a basketball and shooting around for a while, patting myself on the back for making it. But then I started feeling guilty for having fun when I’m supposed to be “working out,” so I made this arbitrary rule that I can play for however long I want, but I’m not allowed to *leave* until I make a half-court shot :) Which in itself is pretty hard of course, but then I added a twist where when I miss it I have to RUN AFTER THE BALL and try over and over and over again, running back and forth from opposite sides of the court, until finally making it. And when that got easier because I’m now better at making shots!, I upped the game to making THREE half-court shots before leaving, and then after each one I drop to the ground and do 15 pushups for good measure 😂 I often wonder what the people around me must think watching this lunatic running around launching balls into the air and then falling to the floor, but it’s made my gym days 3x more exciting while still accomplishing the mission. I thought of this when I got the following message, only instead of silly basketball games it’s a savings one! Years ago you shared a simple grid which my husband and I call the bingo sheet – each square contains a dollar amount to put away each week and at the end of the year, if done faithfully, results in saving an extra $1k. I use this every year, but with a twist: I try to double or even triple the amount each week to save even more. This year I’m on track to hit $4k… it’s really a fun way to save, so thank you for sharing that!! – Denise B. Beautiful!! She made savings fun by taking on the challenge, and then when she was ready to up the game she threw in a twist! Because why not?! Life is boring playing it straight… Sometimes you gotta shake it up! Here’s that “bingo sheet,” made by the fabulous Jamie from MediumSizedFamily.com: [Click to download] As Denise mentioned, the game is pretty straightforward: each week just pick a new square, then throw in the corresponding amount right into savings – and BOOM! You’ll have an extra $1,000 by the end of the year, which just so happens to be the amount you should spend on me for Christmas ;) And if you really want to *see* your results, open up a brand new savings account and start saving fresh so it doesn’t get muddled with all your other dollars! You want to SEE and FEEL your progress as much as you can so it continues to motivate you. Then when you’re done, empty it out and challenge yourself next year with a twist! It really can be as easy as that. This stuff isn’t complicated, but oftentimes our *emotions* can be. I don’t know why we’re wired like we are, but keep trying new ways to keep it fun and fresh, and with a little luck you’ll be FIREd in no time… Thanks for reading today! Have a very merry holiday season, and we’ll see you out there on the courts (like a wild man) 🎄🏀 PS: If this challenge doesn’t dingle your dongle, here are 8 more to try on.
