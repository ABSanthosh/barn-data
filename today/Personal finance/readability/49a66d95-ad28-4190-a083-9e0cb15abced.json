A few years ago, I never would have thought that giving advice could turn into a way to make extra money. But after starting my website and sharing what I knew about personal finance, I quickly realized that I could make extra income. It’s amazing how your skills, whether they’re in medicine, cars, law, tech, relationships, or anything else, can become a profitable business. I love helping others and, at the same time, earning money from what I enjoy! In this article, I’ll go over: Ways to get paid to give advice Type of professionals that get paid to give advice How to get paid giving advice online How To Get Paid To Give Advice Here’s a list of 16 ways to get paid to give advice. 1. JustAnswer JustAnswer is a site that pays people to give advice and answer questions in different fields such as legal, tech, medical, veterinary, antique appraisers, and more. If you’re an expert in a field that people usually have questions in, you can monetize your expertise on JustAnswer by sharing your expert opinion. You may be wondering what kind of questions are asked on JustAnswer. Here are a few examples: How much is my antique worth? How can I lower my business taxes this year? What can I do if a sinus infection won’t go away? How do I fix my car’s alternator? To get started on JustAnswer, you need to go through an application process (with a background check) and get verified that you’re an expert by providing proof of qualifications like degrees, certifications, or other relevant experience.

Starting a blog is one of the best ways to share your expertise while creating a reliable source of income. Sharing your expertise and knowledge with a blog is a great way to diversify your income. You can make money blogging by: Affiliate marketing (where you get a commission when people make purchases through your links) Advertising revenue Sponsored content Selling services like coaching Selling products like books or courses One of the keys to successful blogging is choosing a niche or topic that you’re both passionate about and that has an audience who wants to learn more. Here are some popular blog niches you can try, depending on your expertise: Education and career – If you have experience in teaching or career coaching, this niche can focus on helping others with their career goals, job interviews, or study techniques. Personal finance – Share tips on budgeting, saving, investing, and side hustles. Many people are looking for ways to improve their finances. Health – Topics like fitness, nutrition, mental health, and self-care are helpful. Travel – If you love traveling, you can start a travel blog, sharing tips on budget travel, destination guides, family travel, or even remote work opportunities. Parenting – This niche covers a wide range of topics, from newborn care and toddler tips to advice for teenagers. You can also write about balancing parenting and work or homeschooling. Food – Share recipes, meal planning tips, or diet-specific content (e.g., vegan, keto, gluten-free). DIY and crafts – Whether it’s home improvement, crafting, or upcycling projects, this niche is popular among creative individuals looking for inspiration and guidance. Lifestyle – A lifestyle blog covers several areas like home decor, fashion, personal growth, and productivity. Tech – If you’re knowledgeable about tech, you can give advice on the latest gadgets, software, app reviews, and even tutorials for beginners. Beauty – This is a highly popular niche where you can share makeup tips, skincare routines, and product reviews. Relationships – Help readers improve their relationships or personal growth by sharing advice on communication, self-improvement, or career development. You can learn how to start a blog in the free How To Start a Blog Course. 3. Create an online course  If you’re looking for a passive way to make money by giving advice, creating an online course is a great way to do so. My sister runs a popular online course and has done very well with it. Over the years, she has helped thousands of people with her business advice for website owners. You can create a course on topics such as: Meal planning and prep – Teach people how to plan meals, prep ingredients, and create healthy, budget-friendly meals. Parenting tips – Help with topics like raising toddlers, managing screen time, or improving sleep. Home organization – Help people declutter, organize their homes, and create better living spaces. Fitness and wellness – Share workouts, stretching routines, or mindfulness practices like meditation or yoga. Photography basics – Teach people how to use their camera or phone to take better photos. I recently saw a course teaching parents how to take better family photos with their phone, and it looked so helpful! Gardening for beginners – Guide people through starting a garden, caring for plants, and growing their own fruits and veggies. DIY home projects – Sell lessons on simple home improvement or crafting projects, like building furniture or making home decor. Travel planning – Share tips on planning budget-friendly vacations, packing efficiently, and finding fun destinations. Pet care – Teach new pet owners how to care for their animals, including training, nutrition, and grooming tips. You can sell your online course on your website or course websites like Udemy, Skillshare, or Teachable (Teachable is my favorite course platform). 4. Answer surveys You won’t get rich by answering surveys, but it’s an easy way to make money by giving your opinion. Market research companies pay survey sites to find users to complete surveys for them. These paid online surveys help companies make better products and services. Here are some of the recommended survey companies to sign up for: American Consumer Opinion Swagbucks Survey Junkie InboxDollars Branded Surveys Recommended reading: 12 Best Online Surveys For Gift Cards 5. User Interviews User Interviews stands out from most market research companies because, rather than paying for typical online surveys, it specializes in focus groups. This means they seek more detailed feedback from participants on different products and companies. Their studies are usually conducted via phone or video interviews, with the average study paying over $65. Large companies like Spotify, Pinterest, GoPro, and Amazon use User Interviews to collect market insights. The platform runs over 2,000 studies each month, and last year alone, more than 77,000 participants were paid. Michelle (my sister as well as the owner of this blog) participated in a focus group through User Interviews and earned $400 for just one hour of work. She said it was simple, and the entire process was completed online through a video call. You can click here to sign up for free with User Interviews. 6. Financial advisor Financial advisors are trained professionals who give financial advice to clients. You can make money as a financial advisor by charging fees for your services, receiving commissions on financial products, or both.  A financial advisor may help with financial planning, retirement, wealth management, insurance, investments, savings, and more. To become a financial advisor, you need a combination of education and certifications. To get started, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree in finance, economics, accounting, or related field. You’ll also need an internship or entry-level job in finance, banking, or financial planning to get hands-on experience. Most importantly, you’ll need to get certified as a Certified Financial Planner and pass the licensing exams. As of this writing, the average Certified Financial Planner’s salary is between $66,000-$122,000 a year. 7. Business consultant One way to make money by giving advice is to start a consulting business and become a freelance consultant. A business consultant is someone who uses their expertise to help companies improve their business, income strategy, and profitability. Consultants get paid either by hourly rate, project-based fees, or retainer agreements. Business consultants can also make money by conducting training sessions and workshops for more money. Business consultants are in high demand as businesses are always looking for ways to improve and make more money. 8. Personal trainer If you love fitness and working with people, you can try making money as a personal trainer. Getting a NASM personal trainer certification, which is one of the top certifications in the field is helpful. This is where you’ll dial in form, workout routines, and many other important fitness-related skills. As a personal trainer, you can make money with one-on-one sessions, group classes, and even online training programs. Trainers typically charge per session or have package deals for multiple sessions. You can also make money by creating workout programs that people can purchase online. 9. Online coach You can make money working as an online coach through digital platforms. Some areas that you could coach on include: Life coaching Relationship coaching Business coaching Fitness coaching Career coaching As an online coach, you can make money with one-on-one coaching sessions, group coaching, or self-paced courses that people can buy directly from you. You can charge people one-time fees, package deals, or ongoing membership subscriptions for continued access to your guidance. To grow your income, you can use social media platforms to build your brand and get people to trust you, such as by sharing helpful free tips in graphics or captions. 10. HelpOwl HelpOwl is a platform where you can get paid to give advice online to individuals seeking help with different topics. To get started with HelpOwl, register on the website and set up your profile. Your profile should showcase your expertise, skills, qualifications, and areas of advice. You can also determine your fee structure for providing advice whether it’s per session or question. 11. Quora You’ve likely heard of Quora since it’s a goldmine for getting any kind of question answered, but did you know you can make money with Quora? Yes, it is possible to make money on Quora through a few different strategies. Quora has a partner program that lets you make money by asking questions that generate high traffic and engagement to their website. You can get paid based on the ad revenue generated from the questions you ask. Quora’s partner program is great for anyone who wants to become an online advice giver as you can share your honest opinion or answer a question in a simple comment. 12. Start a podcast  You can make money selling advice through a podcast. This method of selling advice takes a lot of work but can be worthwhile if successful. If you want to start a podcast to give advice, there are many great topics to choose from. You could talk about personal finance, relationship advice, or career coaching. Health and wellness podcasts are popular too, where you can cover fitness, mental health, and self-care. Parenting tips for new parents, small business advice, or life coaching are also good ideas. You could even share tech help, home improvement tips, or legal advice. Whatever you pick, your podcast can help people improve their lives. Once you build up your following, you can make money with ads and different sponsorships on your podcast episodes, along with affiliate links.  13. Start a YouTube channel  Starting a YouTube channel is another great way to get paid for giving advice, especially if you enjoy talking on camera. I turn to YouTube all the time when I’m looking for answers and advice. It’s a helpful resource where I can find detailed explanations on just about any topic. Whether I need tips on personal finance, blogging, or even tech solutions, there’s usually a video that walks me through the steps. I love how I can watch experts in action, and it’s a great way to learn something new quickly and visually. With YouTube, you can create videos in your area of expertise and build an audience of subscribers who value your knowledge. Whether you’re skilled in personal finance, cooking, fitness, or any other niche, there’s probably an audience looking for advice in a YouTube video. To make money on YouTube, you can monetize your channel through: Ads: Once you reach YouTube’s eligibility requirements, you can earn money from ads that play during your videos. Sponsorships: Brands may pay you to promote their products or services in your videos. Affiliate marketing: Include affiliate links in your video descriptions, earning a commission when viewers make purchases through your links. Selling products or services: You can also use YouTube to promote your own products, courses, or consulting services. Consistency is key on YouTube, so creating valuable, engaging content that resonates with your audience will help grow your channel and income over time. 14. Share advice on Fiverr Fiverr is a great spot to sell your advice if you’re looking for an online job. I searched on Fiverr and found 2,200 listings where people were offering to give advice. The topics included things like relationship advice, tax advice, fantasy football advice, blog advice, business advice, and more. You simply create a profile and a listing where you share the type of advice you specialize in. 15. Website testing (such as with UserTesting) Website testing is a simple way to make money by sharing your advice and providing feedback on the website user experience. There are several well-known website testing sites including UserTesting, TryMyUI, and Userlytics. These sites connect you with people looking for user feedback on their websites and apps.  By using website testing platforms, selling expert advice, and building a strong reputation, you can successfully make money through website testing and sharing your insights. 16. Mystery shopping Mystery shopping is a fun way to give your advice and feedback on a customer service experience, product, or store operations.  As a mystery shopper, your feedback tells companies how well their employees are treating customers, if customers are happy, and if any operational problems need fixing. There are three different ways to make money mystery shopping including: Cash and reimbursement (you’ll get paid to do the mystery shop, plus get the service/product for free). Cash payment (an example would be a phone call mystery shop when you don’t buy anything). Reimbursement (an example would be a restaurant secret shop – these typically don’t pay any money except for receiving free food). BestMark is one of the biggest mystery shopping companies with a great reputation, and they have many different kinds of mystery shopping jobs available. Ath Power Consulting is another well-known mystery shopping company that has over 500,000 secret shoppers. They complete over 10,000 mystery shops each month, and they work with many popular companies. Recommended reading: Want To Make An Extra $100 A Month?
