However, each person is bound to have certain activities and hobbies that their partner can’t stand. Although every individual and relationship is different, many women in relationships often complain about these 12 things that many men love, but women secretly hate.1. Sunday Sports MarathonsMany men relish the idea of devoting Sundays to sports. From the first kick-offs of the day to overtime decisions, the most diehard sports fans will eagerly watch games from morning until the final call. And if they follow several sports, the seasons will span most of the year.However, this passion can be a source of tension for women who don’t share their enthusiasm for team sports. While acceptable occasionally, many women feel that this routine monopolizes quality time that could be shared in more engaging activities. The sound of cheers and commentary filling the home can become a backdrop to a day where little else gets done. This might not sit well with partners looking for a more varied or interactive way to spend their weekends.2. The Thrill of Fantasy SportsFantasy sports are more than just games. They allow them to immerse themselves in their favorite sport. Additionally, it provides a community and an extension of their sports fandom.  While some only participate as a weekend pass time, it can become a full-time commitment for others.Men can spend considerable time researching players, strategizing team lineups, and making trades. For women, the intensity and time commitment can seem excessive, disruptive, and frustrating. It becomes even worse when it impacts the amount of time and attention dedicated to personal relationships or other responsibilities.3. Excessive GamingVideo games hold a special place in the hearts of many men and women alike. Not only is it a fun way to spend time with friends, but it is also a virtual escape and a way to unwind. While many people enjoy them, a greater percentage of men identify themselves as hardcore gamers.Although video games offer a sense of achievement and excitement, they can alienate partners when it becomes excessive. When a few hours turn into all-night gaming sessions, it can lead to feelings of irritation, neglect, and resentment. Many women say they feel ignored or secondary to virtual worlds, especially when it disrupts normal routines and shared moments.4. Obsession with CarsFor many men, cars are not just a mode of transport. They represent power, freedom, and status. While some view it as a hobby, it can quickly become an obsession. What starts as a passing appreciation for quality workmanship may evolve into constant enhancements, weekend drives, and endless hours of maintenance.This fascination with automotive details, performance, and the constant tinkering in the garage might be baffling and somewhat annoying to women. However, it can become a major obstacle in a relationship when financial resources and time are allocated away from other household expenses or your partner’s interests. From this perspective, it’s easy to understand why this is one of the things that men love but women secretly hate.5. The “Collector” HobbyFrom comic books to sports memorabilia, many men take pride in collecting items related to their hobbies. These objects create a nostalgic link to their past or passion. However, it can reach a point where it takes over your life and home.On the other hand, most women view these collections as clutter, especially if they take up significant living space. It can also be a source of financial strain when it consumes a large portion of your budget. The key to a happy home is striking the balance where both partners get what they need.6. The Love for Practical GiftsWhen it comes to gifts, many men opt for practicality—like tools or tech that have a clear use. While practical gifts can be useful, it may not be the best choice when buying gifts.Women usually desire more thoughtfulness or sentimentality in gift-giving—choices that reflect personal understanding or a romantic connection rather than just utility. This is even more important for relationship milestones, such as an anniversary, and other special occasions.7. The Fascination with GadgetsMen often enjoy the latest technological innovations—drones, smart watches, or advanced home systems. This enthusiasm for gadgets involves not just acquisition, but also a deep dive into learning and mastering these technologies.Meanwhile, women tend to only buy gadgets they will use regularly. When systems connections get convoluted, it can be overwhelming. Furthermore, if the gadgets encroach on home life or personal interactions, they can turn living spaces into tech showcases rather than cozy, welcoming homes.8. Indifference to Home DecorWhile many women take pride in home aesthetics, men typically show a lack of interest in home decor. Where women value creating a warm inviting environment, most men prefer functionality over style.However, this indifference can be a subtle source of irritation for women who wish for more enthusiasm or input on home choices. When making a home together, most women want the space to reflect their shared tastes instead of having to make all the decisions alone.9. Skipping the DetailsIn discussions or planning, men usually prefer a big-picture approach. However, they may overlook the nitty-gritty details that women find crucial.This difference can lead to misunderstandings or frustration, especially in situations where the details affect outcomes. This can be especially troublesome with matters that require meticulous attention, such as planning a trip, organizing an event, or managing finances.10. The “It’ll Fix Itself” AttitudeA laid-back attitude towards problems can be common among men. Whether it’s a minor repair around the house or addressing a bigger issue, their partners often hear that “things will work themselves out.”Unfortunately, this approach doesn’t work for everyone. And, it can be extremely frustrating for women who value proactive solutions or have anxiety over the repercussions of inaction. Generally speaking, most women prefer addressing issues head-on to prevent bigger problems down the line.11. Last-Minute PlanningEmbracing spontaneity can be exciting. But, frequent last-minute planning by men can be a stress point for women who appreciate the security and efficiency of advanced planning. This approach is even more troublesome during events that require coordination with others or during busy periods. In these circumstances, last-minute planning leads to unnecessary stress.12. Not Asking for DirectionsWhile often joked about, many men prefer to find their own way rather than asking for directions. Although it may be a cliché, the reluctance to ask for help has caused many disagreements. When traveling or time is of the essence, it can be a genuine source of tension for their partner.In addition to the frustration it causes women, it also shows an unwillingness to communicate. This is especially difficult for women who prefer more direct and efficient methods to reach a destination, and value communication and teamwork over pride or stubbornness.13. Skipping CelebrationsMen may sometimes downplay the importance of celebrating milestones or holidays, preferring to keep things low-key. While some prefer to avoid the extra stress, others simply don’t have the time or desire. On the other hand, many women prefer to celebrate these occasions and make lasting memories.Underplaying the importance of these events can make women feel undervalued or neglected. Celebrations are often viewed as an essential way to nurture relationships. Therefore, a lack of enthusiasm for festivities can be disappointing and may damage the relationship.Recognizing the DifferencesBeautiful romantic couple isolated on grey background. Attractive young woman and handsome man are smiling and looking at camera while making a heart sign with their hands.Every person is unique and has different interests and hobbies. However, that doesn’t mean that their partners will share the same passion. Even when there is a lack of interest, respecting the person and appreciating what makes them unique is important. Recognizing these preferences, allowing time and space for them to enjoy their hobbies, and making compromises can help bridge the gap between the things men love but women secretly hate.Jenny Smedra is an avid world traveler, ESL teacher, former archaeologist, and freelance writer.
