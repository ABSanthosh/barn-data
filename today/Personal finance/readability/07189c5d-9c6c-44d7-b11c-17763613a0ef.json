  "description": "Jlyn and her husband are 20 years from retirement, but they’ve got their eye on a second home they’ll live in when the time comes. Should they make the purchase now, or keep saving? Reese was recently laid off, and she’s struggling to choose between two financially responsible paths. Should she continue her long-term disability insurance? Or is it wiser to save money? Kip’s youngest has finally graduated from college, and he’s looking forward to an early retirement. But, with the eyewatering costs of long-term healthcare, is this still a viable path?  Former financial planner Joe Saul-Sehy and I tackle these three questions in today’s episode.",
