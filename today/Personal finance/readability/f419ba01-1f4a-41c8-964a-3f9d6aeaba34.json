Making $20,000 a month might sound like a dream, but it is… Do you want to learn how to make $20,000 a month? I’ve been making over $20,000 a month for many years, and it’s been life-changing. It’s allowed me to pay off debt, travel whenever I want, and have more freedom in my life. Making $20,000 a month might sound like a dream, but it is possible. It’s not an easy feat, but there are real strategies you can use to work toward this level of earnings. You can make $20,000 a month through a mix of different income sources. This could include starting a small business, freelancing, investing, or creating multiple streams of passive income. I will be talking about the many different ways below! Best Ways To Make $20,000 a Month Below are the top ways to make $20,000 a month. 1. Blogging Blogging is one of the most fun ways to make $20,000 a month. I’ve been blogging for over 10 years, and it has completely changed my life. When I first started, I had no idea it would grow into a business that earns over $20,000 a month consistently. When starting a blog, one way is to pick a topic you’re passionate about or have experience in. Popular topics include personal finance, travel, cooking, and family. Then, set up your blog using WordPress and a good hosting service. Don’t forget to write helpful, engaging content that keeps readers coming back. Once your blog has traffic, you can monetize it through ads, affiliate marketing (my favorite way to make money blogging is with affiliate income), sponsored posts, and selling your own products or courses. It takes time to build an audience, but with time and hard work, blogging has the possibility to become a highly profitable income stream. I recommend reading How To Monetize A Blog: How I Grew A $5 Million Blog to learn more. I also recommend signing up for my How To Start A Blog FREE Course. In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. Over 80,000 people have taken my free course too! 2. Create an email newsletter Starting an email newsletter can be a great way to make $20,000 a month. Newsletters let you connect directly with your audience, and they’re great for sharing content or promoting products. You can start an email newsletter on anything such as personal finance, homeschooling, cooking, travel, home decorating, and so much more. Next, choose an email service provider like Kit (formally known as Convertkit) (Kit is what I have used for my online business for over 8 years now) or Substack. These platforms make it easy to set up and manage your newsletter. You can make money from your newsletter by charging a subscription fee, promoting affiliate products, or selling your own digital products. The key is to focus on high-quality content that keeps your readers engaged. 3. Start a dropshipping business Dropshipping can be a great way to make money online. You sell products without keeping inventory. When a customer buys something, you order it from a supplier who ships it directly to the buyer. This means you don’t need to worry about storage or handling the products yourself. To get started, pick a category you’re interested in or that has a high demand. For example, giftable items, fitness gear, home decor, stickers, T-shirts, skincare, or eco-friendly products can be great options. Marketing is key to success in dropshipping. Use social media ads, influencer partnerships, SEO, and email marketing to attract customers to your store. While dropshipping can take time to grow, it has the potential to become a highly profitable business. Some dropshippers earn $20,000 a month or more once they’ve built a strong customer base and streamlined their processes. You can learn more at How I Make Money With My Print-On-Demand Business. 4. Become a freelance writer Freelance writing can help you earn $20,000 a month. It’s a flexible job you can do from home or while traveling. Many businesses need writers for their websites, blogs, and marketing materials. When you’re new, you might earn $50 to $100 per article. As you gain experience, you can charge more. Some experienced writers make $1,000 or more for a single article. To make over $20,000 each month, you’ll want to build relationships with your clients because good work can lead to long-term partnerships and regular income. I have been a freelance writer for years, mainly as a side hustle. I usually earn around $1,000 to over $1,500 per freelance article that I write. I also have several friends who make really good incomes from freelance writing, so I know it’s possible!

Teach online courses I have been running an online course for around eight years and have made over $2,000,000 from it over the years. Teaching online courses can be a great way to make $20,000 a month. You can share your knowledge and skills with people all over the world. Many people are looking to learn new things, and you could be the one to teach them. Topics that you can teach in an online course include: Personal finance Travel Raising a family Cooking Watercolor painting Music And so much more. People take courses on all different subjects and love to do so. If you have a skill that people would like to learn, and you market it well, this is usually one of the fastest ways to make $20,000 each month.

You don’t always need a lot of money to start and some investors begin with just $20,000 to $30,000. One method is to buy cheap houses that need a lot of work. You could fix them up and sell them for more (this is called house flipping). It can make you a profit if you’re smart about it. Another way is to buy homes and rent them out. You can use loans that let you buy a house with a small down payment, so this helps you start investing in rental property with less money. Some people make money by renting out part of their own home. You could rent out a spare room or your basement. This is an easy way to start in real estate. You can learn more at 23 Best Real Estate Side Hustles To Make Extra Money. 7. Start a YouTube channel Starting a YouTube channel can be a fun way to make money online. You don’t need fancy equipment to get started – you can just use your phone camera at first. There are many topics that you can start a YouTube channel on, such as: Travel Family Cooking Video games Beauty Unboxing Fitness Tutorials Comedy To grow your channel, you’ll need to post new videos regularly. In the beginning, you will usually want to upload at least once a week, as well as use catchy titles and eye-catching thumbnails to get more clicks. You can learn more at How Much Do YouTubers Make? 8. Become a social media influencer Becoming a social media influencer may be a way to make $20,000 a month. Social media influencers share content on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. The key is to pick a topic you love and make great posts about it, and this is because followers will see your passion in what you share. This could be fashion, cooking, travel, sports, or anything else you enjoy. The more followers you get, the more money you can make. Companies pay influencers to talk about their products. Some influencers make thousands of dollars for a single post. But it takes time to build up a big audience. You don’t need millions of followers to start making money. Even with a smaller group of fans, you can earn some cash. 9. Write ebooks Writing ebooks can be a great way to make money from home. I have many friends who have written ebooks, both fiction and nonfiction, and make a great living doing so. You can write an ebook about topics such as: Romance Self-help Fiction Travel Health Personal finance Hobbies and crafts Relationships Homeschooling Once your ebook is ready, you can sell it on platforms like Amazon Kindle. You can also sell directly from your own website. Some writers make thousands of dollars a month from ebooks. It takes time and effort, but it can pay off.

Become a photographer Photography is a creative and flexible way to earn $20,000 a month, especially if you love capturing moments and telling stories through your camera. Whether it’s weddings, family portraits, product photography, or even travel photography, there’s a high demand for skilled photographers. For example, wedding photographers can make $3,000 to over $10,000 per event, and with just a few bookings a month, you could hit your $20,000 goal. I even follow an elopement photographer on social media who charges over $14,000 for very small weddings! Marketing is important for success in photography. So, you may want to use social media platforms like Instagram to share your work and create a professional website where clients can book your services.

A membership site is a website where people pay a monthly or yearly fee to get access to special resources or a community. Think of it like joining a club that gives you tools, advice, and support you can’t find anywhere else. For example, a family-focused membership site might share parenting tips, easy meal plans, fun activity ideas for kids, printables, and even a private group where parents can share advice and connect with others going through similar stages of life. Membership sites can be started on topics like parenting, hobbies, fitness, finance, travel, business, and more. Pricing varies, but if you charge $50 a month and get 400 members, that’s $20,000! If you charged $10 a month, you would need 2,000 members. I have a friend who has a membership site and she charges around $25 a month. She has about 500 members. This is just her side business too! 12. Copywriting Copywriting is a way to work from home (or anywhere) and make money, as lots of businesses need good writers to help sell their products. Copywriters write things like ads, emails, and website content. One way to earn big is by selling package deals. For example, you could sell a startup package for $15,000. This might include writing for their website, emails, and social media. You can learn more at How to Become a Copywriter and Earn Over $100,000 a Year. 10How to Get Started in CopywritingThis free training video shows you exactly how to break into copywriting and start earning money from your writing skills, even if you’re brand new and don’t have any experience, certifications, or a portfolio. Learn how to launch your career, land hidden copywriting opportunities, and build a flexible career that works for you. 13. Create subscription boxes Subscription boxes can be a fun way to make money. You pick a theme and send out boxes of goodies each month. You can create a subscription box on many different areas, such as: snacks books beauty products crafts children’s toys clothes And so much more! After you decide on a theme, you’ll then need to find suppliers for your items. Look for good deals so you can make a profit, as well as package your items nicely to make them feel special. You can use social media to show off your boxes, such as Instagram and Facebook. It takes time to build up, but some subscription boxes make $20,000 or more each month. If you sold a subscription box for $40, you’d have to sell 500 each month. Of course, you’ll have expenses, such as the items you put in the box and shipping. You can learn more at How I’ve Made Over $1,000,000 With A Subscription Box Business. 14. Become a voiceover artist Voice acting can be a fun way to make money, and some voice actors make $20,000 or more per month. This is where you can work from home and use your voice to bring stories to life. Voice actors are needed for commercials, video games, audiobooks, cartoons, YouTube videos, and more. You can learn more at How To Become A Voice Over Actor. 15. Start a remote cleaning business Starting a remote cleaning business is a way to make $20,000 a month without doing any of the actual cleaning yourself. Instead, you manage the business side – like scheduling, marketing, and customer service – while hiring cleaners to handle the work. First, you’ll want to decide what type of cleaning services you want to offer. This could be for homes, offices, or even move-out cleanings. Then, hire reliable cleaners who can do a great job, which you can find through local job boards or referrals. You don’t need to spend a lot on marketing at first, and you may be able to find cleaning customers through methods like posting in local Facebook groups, creating flyers, or asking friends and family to spread the word. You can learn more at How To Start a Remote Cleaning Business. 16. Business consulting Business consultants can make $20,000 a month by helping companies solve problems and improve their operations. This job lets you use your expertise to guide businesses to success. A business consultant helps businesses solve problems and get better at what they do. They give advice on how to grow, make more money, and work more smoothly. Here are some ways they help: Fixing problems – They find what’s not working and suggest ways to fix it. Marketing and selling – Consultants show businesses how to attract more customers and sell more products or services. Managing money – They help with creating budgets, saving money, and planning for the future. Helping with employees – Consultants give advice on hiring, training, and keeping good employees. Handling changes – If a business is doing something new, like starting a big project or merging with another company, a consultant helps everything go smoothly. Business consultants are like coaches for companies. They give fresh ideas and expert advice to help businesses grow and succeed. Companies hire consultants all the time because they need an outside eye who is an expert to help them.
