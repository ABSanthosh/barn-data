Many of… Do you want to find the best apps to earn gift cards for free? There are lots of apps that can help you do just that. These apps let you get rewards like free gift cards or cash for things you might already be doing, like shopping online, playing games, or taking surveys. Many of these apps are free to use and only take a few minutes each day. You could earn gift cards for places like Amazon, Target, or Starbucks just by using your phone. I’ve personally earned over $1,000 in free gift cards using many of the apps listed below. It’s an easy way to save money and get free gift cards for popular stores and brands. Best Apps To Earn Gift Cards Here’s a quick list before we begin: Freecash Swagbucks Fetch Rewards InboxDollars MyPoints Rakuten Upside Honey Ibotta Ipsos iSay KashKick Survey Junkie Branded Surveys  Prime Opinion Scrambly Five Surveys HeyCash PrizeRebel Capital One Shopping Mistplay Shopkick Rewarded Play Below are the best apps to earn gift cards for free. Proof that I made money on the Freecash app. The $0.05 amounts were rewards for playing 2 minutes each day. The larger amounts like $40, $70, and $150 were for reaching certain levels. 1. Freecash Freecash is an app that lets you earn gift cards and money by doing fun tasks (and it’s also one of my favorite apps to earn gift cards for free by playing games). You can play games, try new apps, and answer surveys to get rewards. It’s easy to use and you just sign up and start doing activities. For each task you finish, you get coins. These coins can be turned into real money or gift cards. Many people use Freecash every day to make extra cash. Some offers can even pay over $300! I have personally made $302 just by playing a game on Freecash on my phone, and it only took one week. I turned it into free gift cards. When you’re ready to cash out, you have many choices. You can get PayPal money, gift cards for stores like Amazon, or even cryptocurrency. The best part is that you can get your rewards fast, usually on the same day you ask for them. Whenever I redeem my points, I almost always get the gift card delivered to me within seconds. Click here to sign up for Freecash. Recommended reading: Freecash Review – Is Freecash Legit? Proof that I’ve received over 100 free gift cards from Swagbucks. 2. Swagbucks Swagbucks is one of the best apps to earn gift cards, and you can use it on your computer or phone. It’s easy to sign up and start earning points called SB. I have personally earned over 110 free gift cards on Swagbucks over the years, so I know this is real! There are lots of ways to get points. You can take surveys, watch videos, play games, and shop online. Even searching the web can earn you points! When you have enough SB, you can trade them for gift cards. You can get gift cards to Amazon, Target, Walmart, Apple, or even PayPal cash. Sign up for Swagbucks here (and earn $5 in free bonus points). Recommended reading: Swagbucks Review – How Much Can You Earn On Swagbucks? Here’s a screenshot of the free gift cards I’ve earned from my personal Fetch Rewards app. 3. Fetch Rewards Fetch Rewards is a fun app that lets you earn gift cards by taking pictures of your receipts. It’s super easy to use and I use it for all of my grocery receipts every week! When you buy stuff at stores or restaurants, just take a photo of your receipt with your phone (you just open the Fetch app and it takes one quick moment to do). You’ll get points for each receipt you scan. You can scan receipts from all kinds of places – grocery stores, clothing shops, gas stations, and more. The more receipts you scan, the more points you earn. You can then trade these points for gift cards to popular stores like Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. Fetch Rewards is free to download and use. You don’t need to do anything special while shopping. Just buy what you normally would and scan the receipt after. You can earn extra points by buying certain products that Fetch features in the app. But you don’t have to buy those to get rewards because every receipt earns you points. You can sign up for Fetch Rewards by clicking here. Recommended reading: Fetch Rewards Review 4. InboxDollars InboxDollars is a popular app that lets you earn gift cards and cash rewards. You can make money by doing simple tasks on your phone or computer. The app has many ways to earn, such as taking surveys, watching videos, and playing games. You can also shop online and get cash back for your purchases. One nice feature is the ability to scan receipts for rewards. This means you can earn money from things you’re already buying. InboxDollars pays you in real cash, not just points. You can choose to get paid via PayPal or with gift cards. Sign up for InboxDollars here and get a free $5 bonus. 5. MyPoints MyPoints is a rewards program that gives you many ways to earn gift cards. You can get points by shopping online, buying groceries, taking surveys, and watching videos. When you collect enough points, you can trade them for gift cards. You can get free gift cards from popular places like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Starbucks. The cards range from around $5 to $25. If you prefer cash, you can also get paid through PayPal. This gives you more freedom to use your rewards how you want. You can sign up for MyPoints by clicking here. 6. Rakuten Rakuten is a popular site that lets you earn cash back on your online purchases. It’s easy to use and can help you save money while shopping. I use Rakuten for almost all of my online purchases (I only don’t use it when I have simply forgotten!), and it has saved me a lot of money over the years. I recently got $90 in cash back from one online purchase, for example. When you shop through Rakuten, you get a percentage of your purchase back as cash. The app works with many well-known stores like Amazon, Walmart, and Target. To start earning, just download the Rakuten app and create an account. Then, browse the app for stores you want to shop at. Click on the store’s link in Rakuten before you start shopping. Rakuten tracks your purchases and adds cash back to your account. You can get your earnings as a check or through PayPal. Some stores even offer bonus cash back during special promotions. The app is free to use and doesn’t require any extra work. You just shop like normal and get money back, so it’s a simple way to save on things you’re already buying. Rakuten also has a browser extension for easier use on your computer. This reminds you to activate cash back when you visit partner stores online. I highly recommend downloading this so that you don’t miss out on easy cash back. Now, Rakuten doesn’t give free gift cards, but they give you straight cash back, such as via a check or PayPal, which is really nice! You can sign up for Rakuten here and get a $30 sign-up bonus. 7. Upside Upside is a handy app that helps you earn cash back on everyday purchases. You can get money back when you buy gas, groceries, or food from restaurants, but I find that most people mainly use this app for gas (which is what I do!). The app is free to download and easy to use. You can earn up to 25 cents per gallon on gas, and if you’re a new user, then there are typically deals for up to 90 cents cash back per gallon. When you’re ready to cash out, you have a few options. You can send the money right to your bank account or PayPal. Or you can choose gift cards from popular stores like Amazon and Walmart. Upside stands out because it gives you real cash, not just points. This makes it simple to use your earnings however you want. Plus, you’re saving money on things you already buy (nearly everyone buys gas!). You can sign up for Upside by clicking here. 8. Honey Honey is a free app that can help you save money when you shop online. It’s easy to use – just add it to your web browser. When you’re ready to buy something, Honey looks for discount codes for you. You don’t have to do anything extra. Honey finds the codes and puts them in your cart, so this can save you both time and money. Honey works with over 30,000 stores. You can use it at places like Macy’s, Lowe’s, and many more. It’s great for buying clothes, food, or even planning a trip. When you shop using Honey, you can earn rewards points. These points can be traded for gift cards to your favorite stores like Macy’s, Walmart, Gap, Sephora, Nordstrom, Target, DoorDash, Nike, and more. You can learn more about Honey by clicking here. 9. Ibotta Ibotta is a popular app that lets you earn cash back on your everyday purchases, like groceries. To get started with Ibotta, download the app and create an account. Then, browse through the available offers before you go grocery shopping. When you’re at the store, buy the items that have offers that you want to buy (of course, don’t buy things just because you’re getting a deal – you should actually want/need them!). After shopping, take a photo of your receipt and upload it to the app. Ibotta will match your purchases to the offers and give you cash back. For example, you might get 35 cents cash back on grapes, $3 cash back on diapers, $1 cash back on bread, and more. It’s kind of like getting a coupon on the items. Once you reach $20 in earnings, you can cash out. You can choose from gift cards (like Walmart, DoorDash, Home Depot, Lowe’s, T.J.Maxx, and more) or have the money sent to your bank account. Personally, I like to use both Fetch Rewards and Ibotta on all of my grocery shopping receipts – it is really easy to do. You can sign up for Ibotta by clicking here. 10. Ipsos iSay Ipsos iSay is a popular site that lets you earn gift cards by taking surveys. You can use it on your phone or computer to share your thoughts and get rewards. When you sign up, you’ll answer some questions about yourself. This helps Ipsos iSay find surveys that fit you best, then you’ll get emails when there are new surveys to take. The surveys ask about things like what you buy and what you like. They might show you ads and ask what you think. Your answers help companies make better products. You earn points for each survey you finish. The number of points depends on how long the survey is and surveys are usually around 5-30 minutes long. When you have enough points, you can trade them for gift cards. You can get gift cards from places like Amazon, Starbucks, and Target. If you prefer cash, you can choose PayPal instead. Some people even use their points to donate to charity. Please click here to sign up for Ipsos iSay and get a free 250 points for joining. 11. KashKick KashKick is an app where you can earn gift cards and cash for doing fun tasks. You can make money by taking surveys, playing games, and trying out new products. One fun thing about KashKick is that you can play popular games like Monopoly GO, Yahtzee, Bingo Blitz, and Wheel of Fortune to earn money. For example, you might get $30 for reaching a certain level in Monopoly within 8 days. KashKick also has lots of survey options. These usually take less than 20 minutes and can pay between $1 and $5 each. It’s an easy way to share your thoughts and make some extra cash. You can cash out your earnings through PayPal once you reach $10. Sign up for KashKick here. Recommended reading: KashKick Review: Is It Worth It? 12.

Each survey gives you points and these points can be turned into gift cards or cash. Survey Junkie has a low cash-out minimum where you only need $5 worth of points to get your reward. The app is free to join. It’s available for both Android and iPhone users. You can easily check for new surveys whenever you have free time. Sign up for Survey Junkie here.

Each survey pays between 50 cents and $5, depending on how long it takes. You can cash out your points once you reach 500. That’s equal to $5. You can choose to get paid through PayPal or pick from over 100 gift card options like Amazon and Apple. The best part? You only need to be 16 years old to join, whereas most other survey sites require you to be 18. This makes Branded Surveys a great option for teens looking to earn some spending money.

I logged in and currently have 23 surveys that I can take, ranging from 3 minutes to 42 minutes long (most were around 10-15 minutes long, though). The surveys ask about different things like what you buy, where you shop, and what you like to do. Don’t worry – the questions are easy to answer. You don’t need to be an expert on anything.
