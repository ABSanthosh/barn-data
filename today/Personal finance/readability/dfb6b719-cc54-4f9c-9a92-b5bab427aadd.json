  "description": "In 2005, Sebastien Page nearly died from a mysterious bacterial infection that doctors couldn't diagnose for a week. A single observant physician noticed cuts on his toes from running in wet terrain and connected the dots. The experience forced Page to confront mortality — and completely changed how he thinks about goals. Page, the chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price and author of The Psychology of Leadership, joins us to share why traditional goal-setting might be sabotaging your happiness. He explains how 80 percent of millennials say they just want to get rich, and 50 percent want to become famous. But research from Harvard's 80-year longitudinal study reveals something surprising: people who climbed the social ladder weren't meaningfully happier than those who struggled financially. The real predictor of long-term happiness? The quality of your relationships with others. We explore the dark side of goals through a concept called \"goal-induced blindness.\" Page uses Mount Everest as an example — climbers have a 4 percent chance of dying, the same odds as eating four poisoned gummies out of 100. Yet people still attempt the summit because they become blinded by the goal itself. Page shares his own experience with goal-induced blindness during his demanding career in money management. The relentless travel and pressure contributed to his near-fatal infection in 2005. He learned that working less actually made him more productive. We dive into Page's framework called the \"three Cs\": core beliefs, curves, and control theory. Core beliefs are the filters through which you interpret the world — like whether you trust people or believe money should be spent versus saved. Curves refer to stress management, based on research showing optimal performance doesn't happen at zero stress. Control theory teaches you when to exercise \"strategic patience\" versus making quick decisions. Page also introduces the PERMA framework from positive psychology: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. He calls the last four \"proteins for your soul,\" while positive emotions are more like a sugar high. The discussion covers practical applications for everything from hiring decisions to relationship choices, using mathematical concepts like net present value to make better life decisions.",
