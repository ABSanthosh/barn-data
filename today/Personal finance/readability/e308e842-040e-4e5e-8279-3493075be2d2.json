If you want to get some free PayPal money, there are lots of ways to earn a quick $10 in your PayPal account. Many websites and apps give cash rewards for things you might already do online. You can make free PayPal money by taking surveys, playing games, or shopping. Some sites even give you bonus cash just for signing up. It’s easy to get started, and you could have extra income in your account today. I remember testing a few reward sites one weekend out of curiosity, and I couldn’t believe how quickly I earned a few dollars here and there – making that extra $10 in PayPal was a breeze! And, here’s how you can do it too. Best Ways To Get Free $10 in PayPal Money Instantly Below are the best ways to get a free $10 in PayPal cash quickly. Proof that I’ve made money playing games on Freecash. The $0.05 amounts were rewards for playing 2 minutes each day. The larger amounts like $40, $70, and $150 were for reaching certain levels. 1. Freecash Freecash is a website where you can earn money by doing easy tasks. You can make cash by playing games (I have personally made a little over $300 by playing a game on my phone on Freecash), trying new apps, and taking surveys. When you sign up, you’ll see different ways to earn coins. These coins can be changed into real money or gift cards. Many people use Freecash every day to make extra cash in their free time. Freecash has quick payouts and you can get your earnings through PayPal, bank transfer, or gift cards. They also have options for cryptocurrency if you prefer that. I have redeemed my points on Freecash many times, and it’s usually instant, or sometimes it may take a few minutes. Either way – it’s very quick. Click here to sign up for Freecash. You can also learn more at Freecash Review – How I’ve Made $302 With This Site Playing Games. 2. Swagbucks Swagbucks is a fun way to get free PayPal money. You can earn points called SB by doing easy tasks online such as taking surveys, watching videos, submitting your receipts, shopping online, and playing games. When you have enough SB (you need 500 points or $5 in order to cash out for PayPal), you can trade them for PayPal cash or gift cards. Many people earn between $50 and a few hundred dollars a year with Swagbucks. Some users even make over $1,000 a year. How much you earn depends on how much time you spend on the site. You can use Swagbucks anytime, anywhere. All you need is an internet connection, so it’s perfect for earning money while watching TV or during your lunch break. Sign up for Swagbucks here and get up to a free $10 bonus. You can also learn more at Swagbucks Review – How Much Can You Earn On Swagbucks? 3. InboxDollars InboxDollars is a fun way to get free PayPal money, and it’s similar to Swagbucks. You can earn points by taking surveys, watching videos, and playing games. One cool thing about InboxDollars is the variety of tasks, so you can pick what you like best. If you enjoy playing games, focus on that. If you prefer surveys, do those instead. You can also earn by reading emails and shopping online. These are things you might do anyway, so why not get paid for them? When you reach $15, you can cash out to PayPal. It might take a little time to get there, but it’s doable. Sign up for InboxDollars here and get a free $5 bonus. 4. Survey Junkie Survey Junkie pays you to share your opinions on different products and services through paid online surveys. Signing up is quick and easy. Once you’re in, you’ll fill out a profile to match you with surveys. You can then start answering questions right away. You can answer surveys anywhere and at any time. All you need is an internet connection so you can take surveys on your lunch break, while watching TV, or even during your commute (if you take public transport or if you don’t drive, of course!). For each survey you complete, you earn points. These points can be swapped for real money through PayPal or gift cards. Most surveys take between 5 and 20 minutes to finish. You’ll usually earn $1 to $3 per survey. The longer ones usually pay more. Please click here to sign up for Survey Junkie. You can learn more at Survey Junkie Review. 5. MyPoints MyPoints is an easy way to get free PayPal money from home. It’s easy to use and fun too. You can earn points by shopping online, watching videos, downloading apps, and taking surveys. For example, when I log in, some of the ways I can earn points include: $5 for checking my credit score $3.10 for clipping grocery coupons $150 for playing a game (solitaire) on my phone $300 for signing up for a bank account and setting up a direct deposit to your new bank account And more. You can redeem your points for free PayPal cash once you have $15 in points. You can sign up for MyPoints by clicking here. 6. Rakuten Rakuten is a great way to get free PayPal money when you shop online. It’s easy to use and can earn you cash back on purchases you already plan to make. I recently used Rakuten and I received around $90 cash back when I bought a kayak online. It only took less than a minute to get this free cash, so it was a no-brainer! To get started, you just need to sign up for a free Rakuten account. Then, use their website or app to shop at your favorite stores. Rakuten works with thousands of popular retailers, many that you probably already shop at. When you buy something through Rakuten, you’ll earn a percentage of your purchase back as cash. The amount varies by store, but it can be up to 40% in some cases. It’s usually around 1% to 10%, though. Rakuten pays out your earnings every three months. You can choose to get your money through PayPal or as a check in the mail. I have my payments set as PayPal. As a bonus, new members often get a $10 welcome reward after making their first purchase. This is an easy way to get free PayPal money quickly. You can sign up for a free account on Rakuten here. I just exchanged 2,500 points for $25 in PayPal cash, and it took about 10 minutes total on PrizeRebel. 7. PrizeRebel PrizeRebel is a fun way to get free PayPal money. You can sign up for a free account and start earning points right away. You can do simple tasks like taking surveys and trying out new apps. These tasks don’t take much time, but they can add up over time. Once you have enough points, you can trade them for PayPal cash. It’s easy to cash out once you’ve earned enough points. I have personally cashed out my points for PayPal money as well as free Amazon gift cards, and I’ve always received my payment very quickly. Click here to sign up for PrizeRebel. 8. Branded Surveys Branded Surveys is a good way to get free PayPal money fast from home. You can sign up for free and start taking surveys right away. The surveys are easy to do. You’ll answer questions about products, services, and your opinions. Each survey usually pays between 50 cents and $5. You can take surveys on your phone or computer, so it’s a good way to earn money while watching TV or during your free time. Branded Surveys has a point system. Each point is worth 1 cent. You need 500 points to cash out, which equals $5. There are some other smaller ways to earn points such as: You can get 5 points for answering the daily poll. It only takes a moment! You can also invite friends to join (referrals). When they reach a certain level, you’ll get 50 points. Branded Surveys even has a leaderboard. If you take the most surveys, you can win bonus points. You can get a 100-point welcome bonus when signing up for Branded Surveys (you can click on my referral link below to get an invitation). You can click here to join Branded Surveys for free. 9. Ibotta Ibotta is an easy app to earn cash back on your everyday purchases, such as at the grocery store. You just upload your receipts after you shop to earn cash that you can use to get free PayPal cash. Some examples of the cash back you might be able to earn through Ibotta include $3.00 cash back for buying face wash, $5.00 cash back for buying laundry detergent, $3.00 cash back for diapers, and $1.00 cash back for buying cereal. I use Ibotta for nearly all of my grocery receipts, and it’s a super easy way to get points. Here’s how the Ibotta app works: Look through point offers – Check the Ibotta app to see what cash-back offers are available before you go shopping (like for cereal, diapers, or shampoo). Shop in-store – Go to the store and make your purchase. Upload your receipt – Take a picture of your grocery receipt using the Ibotta app on your phone to earn cash back. The app will match your purchases to the offers you selected. I usually just do this right when I get in my car after I’m done at the grocery store. Once approved, the cash back will be added to your Ibotta account. When you reach $20 in earnings, you can cash out to PayPal. Ibotta works with many popular stores like Walmart, Target, City Market, and Kroger. You can also earn cash back on online purchases through the app, and this makes it easy to rack up rewards quickly. You can also earn cash through Ibotta through their referral program – simply tell your friends and family about the app with your referral link, and you can easily earn points (and they can earn sign-up bonuses!). You can join Ibotta here. 10. Upside Upside is an app that gives cash back when you fill up at participating gas stations. You can earn around $150 per year just by using it. While not every gas station is part of the program, there’s a good chance you’ll find a few nearby that qualify. When you first use the app, you can earn a higher cash back rate to get started. On my first try, I earned $0.74 back per gallon, so with 12.62 gallons of gas, I saved $9.33 instantly. The app is simple to use and a great way to save money on fuel. On Upside, you only need $1.00 in your account to cash out via PayPal. You can sign up for Upside here. Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to common questions about how to get free $10 in PayPal money instantly. How can I earn a quick $10 in my PayPal account? You can earn $10 quickly by doing surveys on sites like Swagbucks or Survey Junkie. These sites let you cash out to PayPal once you reach the minimum amount. Another way is to sign up for Freecash and complete offers or play games where you might get $10 in just a few hours if you pick the right tasks. Are there any reliable PayPal codes for free cash out there? Sadly, there aren’t any real PayPal codes for free cash. Be careful of scams that promise free money this way. Instead, try sites like InboxDollars or MyPoints. They give you points for doing easy tasks, which you can turn into PayPal cash. How can I get free PayPal money right now? To get PayPal money fast, sign up for Swagbucks and do a few quick surveys or download an app. You might earn enough for a small payout in just a day or two. There are plenty of other ways to earn PayPal money (and various gift cards) as well, such as by playing games. Why do rewards sites pay you PayPal money for doing tasks? Companies pay users to play games, test apps, and answer surveys because it helps them gather valuable feedback, test new products, and understand their target audience. For example, when users try out apps, answer questions, or engage with ads, companies gain insights into what works, what people enjoy, and areas for improvement. This data helps businesses create better products, refine their marketing strategies, and make data-driven decisions. Instead of spending money only on traditional advertising, they see these small rewards as a way to directly engage potential customers and get immediate, real-world feedback. Also, many of the rewards sites get paid if you sign up, so they share some of that referral bonus money with you in order to persuade you to try it out. It’s a win-win for everyone. How can I avoid PayPal scams? PayPal scams are everywhere, so you will want to be careful! To avoid PayPal scams, watch for red flags like offers that seem too good to be true, requests for personal information, and poorly written emails. Protect your account by using a strong password, enabling two-factor authentication, and only using PayPal on trusted sites. Regularly check your account for suspicious activity, and never click on unexpected links – go directly to PayPal’s website if something seems off.

This data helps businesses create better products, refine their marketing strategies, and make data-driven decisions. Instead of spending money only on traditional advertising, they see these small rewards as a way to directly engage potential customers and get immediate, real-world feedback. Also, many of the rewards sites get paid if you sign up, so they share some of that referral bonus money with you in order to persuade you to try it out.
