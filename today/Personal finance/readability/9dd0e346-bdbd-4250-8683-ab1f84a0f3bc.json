There are so many methods to selling your car such as selling privately, going through an online platform, or selling to a local car dealership. Each method of selling a car has its benefits and drawbacks. Selling a car can feel overwhelming, especially with all the different ways to do it. When I had to sell my own car, I wasn’t sure whether to go the easy route by trading it in or put in more effort for a higher price with a private sale. There are pros and cons to each option, and it really comes down to what matters most to you—speed or getting the best price. In this guide, I’ll go over some of the best methods to help you figure out the right approach for selling your car. Whether you want something quick or you’re aiming for top dollar, there’s a method for selling your stuff here for you! Best Ways To Sell A Car Below is a list of the best ways to sell a car. Recommended reading: How To Get A Free Car – 11 Places For Those In Need 1. Share your car for sale on Facebook One of the best places to sell your car is via Facebook Marketplace. Facebook Marketplace has a huge audience and is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy to sell just about anything on the platform. When listing your car on Facebook Marketplace, it’s important to include details like: Make, model, and year Mileage Condition Vehicle history (clean title, any accidents) Price Photos Any special features (heated seats, sunroof, backup camera) Maintenance records (mention if you have consistent records of maintenance)  Reason for selling Facebook Marketplace has zero listing fees and allows you to reach potential buyers in your area immediately. However, there are drawbacks to Facebook Marketplace, including potential scams, lowball offers, and the time to communicate back and forth with potential buyers who may not be serious inquirers.  2. Trade in your car to a dealership Trading in your car to a car dealer is one of the easiest ways to get rid of an old vehicle, but you must be willing to buy another car. This process is easy (I’ve done it myself) and begins with the dealership appraising your car. This includes assessing the condition of your car and giving you a trade-in value of your vehicle based on market demand, mileage, and vehicle history. If you decide to accept the offer, the trade-in value is applied to the new car you’re buying. However, there’s a major drawback in trading in a vehicle because car dealerships tend to pay way less than what you would get from a private sale. 3. Sell your car to a dealership If you’re not in the market to buy a new car, you can instead sell your car to a dealership. These days, dealerships are actively looking for popular cars and will often make you an offer. My sister once got an instant cash offer from a dealership while her car was just parked at a store! She’s also received offers through email from dealerships, and this was for an ordinary car! This way of selling a car is easy and fast because car dealerships are buying used cars from people all the time. To get started, the car dealership will perform an appraisal. The dealership handles everything including paperwork, title transfer, and payment. The benefit of selling your car to a dealership is that you don’t have to deal with private buyers and your car will likely sell quickly. However, similar with trading in a car to a dealership, you won’t get nearly as much money as you could with a private sale. 4. Sell to Cars.com Cars.com is a site specifically for buying and selling vehicles. This platform is beneficial to use because you’re posting your car on a site where people are actively searching for vehicles to purchase. To get started, you’ll want to include important information in your car listing, such as the make, model, year, mileage, condition, and any other special things the buyer should know. You’ll want to add high-quality, well-lit photos, and make sure to note any dents or scratches the potential buyer should know about. Cars.com even has a pricing tool to help you figure out a price to list your car. You’ll be in charge of communicating with potential buyers, answering questions, and the final sale process. However, this effort can be well worth it as you’ll get a much better price versus if you were to sell it to a car dealership. 5. Sell to Carvana Carvana is well known for delivering cars straight to your house, but did you know you can also sell your car on the platform? Carvana makes it super easy and convenient to sell your vehicle on their website. To sell your car to Carvana, you’ll go to the sell/trade link at the top of Carvana’s website. This is where you’ll start the process of answering questions about your vehicle. You’ll receive an instant offer for your vehicle based on the information you give Carvana. If you accept the offer, Carvana will schedule a pickup time to get your car. They’ll do a quick on-site review of your car to make sure you answered the questions truthfully and then pay you on the spot. While Carvana’s offer may be lower than what you’d get from a private sale, this can be a good option if you want to get rid of your vehicle quickly. 6. Sell on eBay A popular way people sell cars is by creating an ad on eBay. This site has an eBay Motors section that lets you create a listing for your car. You can choose auction-style, where people bid on your car, or a fixed-price option if you have a specific price you want to sell your car at. I have a family member who has sold several cars on eBay, so I know this is possible! 7. Sell to CarMax CarMax is a quick and easy way to sell a car because of its easy process. You can take your car to a CarMax location, where they will do a no-obligation appraisal. The CarMax team will inspect your vehicle and give you a written offer to you within seven days of performing the appraisal.  If you decide to accept the offer, CarMax handles all of the paperwork and pays you on the spot. Again, you probably won’t make as much as you would if you went with a private sale, but CarMax has the benefits of speed, ease, and certainty of the transaction going through. Plus, you won’t have to worry about dealing with online scammers. 8. List your car on Craigslist Craigslist has been a popular method of selling cars for a long time. The site is free and easy to use, and it takes less than ten minutes to create a listing with your asking price. When creating your car listing, include important details like make, model, year, mileage, condition, and any unique features (like any additions or changes you may have made). You’ll want to include high-quality photos taken from different angles, including the interior and exterior. Then, set the price for your vehicle and include if this price is firm or negotiable. Most importantly, always follow your gut when communicating with people on Craigslist. The platform is great for selling stuff but can bring scammy people who are trying to steal personal information or take your money. Selling your car private party to a car buyer can be worth it, you just want to be safe! 9. List your car on Autotrader Autotrader is a site where you can buy new and used cars, list your car to sell, and get an instant offer from nearby car dealerships. It costs $49 to publish a car listing on Autotrader and KBB.com (Kelley Blue Book). Though there’s a cost to list your vehicle, there are benefits to this including getting a free vehicle history report (which can increase the odds of selling your vehicle). Once you find a buyer on Autotrader, the buyer pays online and Autotrader transfers the funds to you securely for as low as 0.99% of the selling price. Frequently Asked Questions Here are the most frequently asked questions about the best ways to sell a car. What is the best place to sell my car online? The best place to sell your car online depends on how fast you want to sell your car or if you’re prioritizing making the highest profit. If you’re in a rush to sell your vehicle and want to get it off your hands ASAP, you may want to try selling the car to a car dealership, CarMax, or Carvana. However, if you have the time and you’re not in a rush to get the car off your hands, you may want to spend the extra time and effort to sell your car privately so that you can make more money. What is the fastest way to sell a car privately? If your goal is to sell your car as fast as possible privately, follow these tips: Set a competitive price and research to see what similar cars are listed for Thoroughly clean the car and maybe even get it professionally detailed Have all paperwork necessary, including title, maintenance records, bill of sale Create a detailed listing, highlighting any special features or recent maintenance List your car on multiple platforms like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Autotrader Have good communication with potential buyers and respond to their questions Following all of these tips will help you sell your car quickly. Who pays the most to sell my car? If you’re trying to get the most profit out of selling your car, stay away from car dealerships and instead sell your car privately. This is because car dealerships need to make money from selling your vehicle, so they’re going to give you much less than what you could potentially get if you sold it privately. To sell your car privately, you may want to try listing your vehicle on platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Autotrader, and Craigslist. These platforms will help you reach a wide audience and get you talking to interested buyers.  What is the best platform to sell a car?  The best platform to sell a car depends on your specific needs. Platforms like Carvana and Autotrader make it easy and convenient to get rid of your car quickly, whereas listing your car on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace can take a lot longer.  What is the best form of payment when selling a car? The best form of payment when selling a car is the safest form of payment. The best form of payment when selling a car privately is usually cash. Sometimes people will take money orders or cashier’s checks, but there is a chance that they are fake. Personal checks can bounce, whereas cashier’s checks are issued by the bank and guarantee that the money is available. You can also accompany the buyer to the bank to witness the check being issued for additional safety (this is what most people recommend if you do decide to take a check).  Should you accept cash when selling a car? Accepting cash for your car can be convenient but it has many risks such as counterfeit bills, lack of paper trail which can be problematic for tax or legal reasons, and in case of dispute doing a cash transaction can be more challenging to prove. If you decide to accept cash, make sure to meet in a safe space like a police station parking lot or at a bank. If the amount of cash is large, bring along a friend or family member as added safety. Bring a counterfeit detection pen or ask the buyer to get a cashier’s check to decrease the risk of a fraudulent transaction.  Is it safe to take a cashier’s check when selling a car? It’s generally safe to take a cashier’s check when selling a car because these checks are issued by banks. These kinds of checks are guaranteed that the funds are available. However, I do recommend that you be aware that there are counterfeit cashier’s checks. You can verify the check by contacting the bank directly. What paperwork do I need to sell my car privately? When selling your car on your own, you will usually need the car’s title and a bill of sale (with the VIN listed on it). You might also need things like maintenance records and a release of liability. You may want to ask your local department of motor vehicles or your state DMV to see what else they recommend. I also recommend taking your license plates off your car when it is sold. Best Ways To Sell A Car – Summary I hope you enjoyed my article on the best ways to sell a car. There are many ways to sell a car, and the method you choose to take depends on how fast you want to sell your car. Some people don’t want to spend any time or effort selling a car and would rather get rid of it ASAP, while others want to take the extra effort to make the most profit possible. Each method of selling a car has its benefits and drawbacks, so you’ll want to think about that when selling your vehicle. Luckily, there are many car-selling platforms, so you can choose your best option. Have you sold a car before? What do you think is the best place to sell a car?

The best form of payment when selling a car privately is usually cash. Sometimes people will take money orders or cashier’s checks, but there is a chance that they are fake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal checks can bounce, whereas cashier’s checks are issued by the bank and guarantee that the money is available. You can also accompany the buyer to the bank to witness the check being issued for additional safety (this is what most people recommend if you do decide to take a check). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShould you accept cash when selling a car?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccepting cash for your car can be convenient but it has many risks such as counterfeit bills, lack of paper trail which can be problematic for tax or legal reasons, and in case of dispute doing a cash transaction can be more challenging to prove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you decide to accept cash, make sure to meet in a safe space like a police station parking lot or at a bank. If the amount of cash is large, bring along a friend or family member as added safety. Bring a counterfeit detection pen or ask the buyer to get a cashier’s check to decrease the risk of a fraudulent transaction. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it safe to take a cashier’s check when selling a car?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s generally safe to take a cashier’s check when selling a car because these checks are issued by banks. These kinds of checks are guaranteed that the funds are available. However, I do recommend that you be aware that there are counterfeit cashier’s checks. You can verify the check by contacting the bank directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat paperwork do I need to sell my car privately?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen selling your car on your own, you will usually need the car’s title and a bill of sale (with the VIN listed on it). You might also need things like maintenance records and a release of liability. You may want to ask your local department of motor vehicles or your state DMV to see what else they recommend. I also recommend taking your license plates off your car when it is sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBest Ways To Sell A Car – Summary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you enjoyed my article on the best ways to sell a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many ways to sell a car, and the method you choose to take depends on how fast you want to sell your car. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome people don’t want to spend any time or effort selling a car and would rather get rid of it ASAP, while others want to take the extra effort to make the most profit possible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach method of selling a car has its benefits and drawbacks, so you’ll want to think about that when selling your vehicle.
