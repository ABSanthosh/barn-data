  "text": "Executive Summary There is no shortage of written content available for financial advisors to enhance their technical skills, grow in their careers, and run more successful planning practices, from books to research studies to long-form written content. Of course, given the demands of their busy schedules , finding time to dig into this content can be a challenging endeavor. Luckily, alongside the increasing popularity of podcasts on a seemingly infinite range of topics, there is a growing ecosystem of podcasts aimed at financial advisors, covering everything from practice management and career development to technical topics, such as investment, tax, and estate planning. Which gives advisors the opportunity to gain new ideas to improve their businesses (and careers) as well as stay on top of emerging planning opportunities while commuting, working out at the gym, or walking the dog. Nonetheless, given the hundreds of available podcasts targeted to financial advisors, finding the 'best' ones for an advisor's specific needs can be a challenge. With this in mind, we have compiled a list of \"Top Financial Advisor Podcasts\", with a particular focus on how advisors can find the 'right' podcasts that fit their interests and business needs, whether they are aspiring financial planners or managing large enterprises. The podcasts are organized by category (e.g., practice management, behavioral finance), with each podcast capsule including a description of the type of advisor for whom the podcast is best suited. Notably, this list highlights podcasts that we believe (based on our own listening!) offer a high signal-to-noise ratio and are tailored to the needs of those who are a part of (or hope to join) the financial advicer community (i.e., those who are in the business of selling their financial advice as opposed to financial products). Further, because choosing 'top' podcasts is inherently subjective (e.g., a financial advisor might find that they 'click' with the style of one podcast host over another covering a similar topic), we list a number of additional podcasts that are also worth checking out in each category for advisors who want to go deeper on a given topic. With that introduction, we hope you enjoy our list of the 22 'top' podcasts for financial advisors! Adam is a Financial Planning Nerd at Kitces.com. He previously worked at a financial planning firm in Bethesda, Maryland, and as a journalist covering the banking and insurance industries. Outside of work, he serves as a volunteer financial planner and class instructor for local and national non-profits. Read more of Adam’s articles here.

Practice Management The Efficient Advisor Best For: Solo advisory firm owners looking to make themselves more efficient in their practices Format: Single host Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Weekly Host: Libby Greiwe As their practice grows over time, many solo firm owners find themselves increasingly busy onboarding new clients, serving current clients, and prospecting for new clients. Which means that the processes and scheduling practices they've implemented up until this point might not be as efficient as they once were. With this in mind, The Efficient Advisor podcast, hosted by advisor coach Libby Greiwe (who built her own $1M revenue practice while working just 25 hours per week), focuses on ways advisors can leverage \"systems, processes, and business hacks\" to help them truly scale their firm (and save valuable time in the process) rather than merely grow. The podcast features episodes where Greiwe shares her own advice and tips for advisors (e.g., on how to design a \"Model Week\" schedule) along with editions where Greiwe interviews a subject matter expert on a specific topic related to practice management (e.g., how to leverage a firm's CRM to gain greater efficiency). This combination provides a balanced blend between Greiwe's expertise and insights from outside perspectives. Altogether, The Efficient Advisor podcast offers solo advisors valuable advice on growing their firms efficiently, with episodes running from 30 to 45 minutes – making it easy to fit into a busy weekly schedule! The Perfect RIA Best For: Small- to mid-sized advisory firm founders looking to maximize all aspects of their practice Format: Multiple hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 30 minutes Cadence: Three episodes per week, including a recap episode Hosts: Matthew Jarvis, Micah Shilanksi, Jamie Shilanski, Amber Kuhn After making the transition from working as an employee advisor to running a practice of their own, many new firm founders find that there are many more decisions to be made aside from providing high-quality advice to their clients, from structuring their schedules to determining which business metrics to prioritize. Similarly, seasoned firm owners might wonder whether they are truly maximizing their business processes and client value proposition. For advisors looking to build an efficient firm from the ground up or those who recognize their practice could use a business tune-up, The Perfect RIA podcast offers actionable advice covering practice management, client communication, and more. Monday episodes, typically hosted by advisory firm owners (and founders of The Perfect RIA coaching program) Matthew Jarvis and Micah Shilanski, include episodes where the hosts either discuss a particular topic themselves (e.g., a recent episode explored setting expectations and boundaries for firm employees) or interview expert guests. Thursday episodes are hosted by advisor Jamie Shilanski and dive deep into a particular practice management issue (e.g., a recent episode examined financial metrics for business planning), while Friday episodes, hosted by Amber Kuhn, offer a short recap of the week's two episodes (providing an opportunity to reinforce the key points of the week's episodes and giving time-strapped advisors a chance to see whether they want to go back and listen to the full recordings). In sum, The Perfect RIA podcast, with its hallmark no-nonsense approach, provides best practices and actionable ideas to help firm founders get out of their comfort zone when it comes to building a profitable and efficient advisory practice. Kitces \u0026 Carl Best For: Advisory firm owners who want to dissect thorny practice management decisions from different angles Format: Two hosts Typical Length: 30 minutes Cadence: Bi-weekly Hosts: Michael Kitces, Carl Richards When it comes to practice management decisions, there is not always a single 'right' answer. Rather, the best decision for a given firm owner might depend on their goals, preferences, and personality style. With this in mind, considering a variety of perspectives on key practice management issues can help firm owners better understand the broader picture and make the best decision for their needs. To help advisors make key decisions and overcome thorny problems, the Kitces \u0026 Carl podcast provides valuable insights from two (sometimes very) different perspectives. While financial planning industry 'nerd' Michael Kitces typically takes an analytical approach to practice management issues, his counterpart, client communication expert Carl Richards, brings a more relationship-based perspective to the table, whether it comes to building a practice with intentionality or asking questions that can help build stronger relationships with clients. By examining these different perspectives, Kitces and Richards provide listeners with vicarious 'thinking partners' to help them dissect a given issue from different angles and make the best choice based on their unique position. Ultimately, the key point is that because analytical and relationship-based perspectives can be valuable when approaching key practice management decisions, the Kitces \u0026 Carl podcast provides a convenient venue for firm owners to better understand both views and apply them in their own practices! Additional podcasts to go deeper: COO Roundtable (best practices for advisory firm operations professionals), Diversity in Action (for firms interested in tapping into a broader talent pool for interns and new hires). The Advisor Journey Best For: Advisors considering whether to grow their firm from a practice into a business Format: Two hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Bi-weekly Hosts: Jason Wenk, Dasarte Yarnway Many financial advisory firm owners eventually come to a point where they have to decide whether they want to keep their firm as a relatively small practice or scale it to a larger advisory business. This choice can be particularly challenging, as it involves significant implications – from the practical demands of building a larger firm to the potential impact on the firm owner's lifestyle. Amidst this backdrop, The Advisor Journey podcast, hosted by Jason Wenk and Dasarte Yarnway of RIA custodian Altruist, offers guidance to help advisors choose whether (and to what extent) to scale their firms – and, if so, how to do so successfully. The podcast features commentary from the hosts and guest speakers, including advisors who scaled their firms successfully, those who chose to step off of the growth 'hamster wheel', and industry experts in advisory firm operations, leadership, and more. Together, these perspectives offer listeners insights to help navigate their own growth journeys. In the end, because the decision of whether (and how) to scale a firm is not one to be taken lightly (given its implications for both the firm and its owner), The Advisor Journey provides valuable prospectives to help advisors in this position make better-informed decisions that align with their unique goals and situations. Financial Planning Industry Trends Rethink. Financial Advice Best For: Advisors seeking a range of perspectives on the business of financial advice Format: Two hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Monthly Hosts: Adam Holt, Derek Notman The financial advisory industry has changed significantly over the past few decades, from a predominant focus on the sale of financial products to the growing advice-centric approach seen today. And while many advisors are focused on building their own businesses and careers, staying abreast of industry trends and developments can offer insights into the broader environment in which they operate. To help advisors take a look at the 'big picture' of the industry, the Rethink. Financial Advice podcast, hosted by advisors and FinTech CEOs Adam Holt and Derek Notman, explores many corners of the world of financial advice through interviews and discussions with a range of industry thought leaders. The hosts and guests openly share their perspectives, and sometimes strong opinions, on topics shaping the profession. For instance, recent episodes have delved into the fiduciary mindset, the difference between client engagement and satisfaction, and the evolution of advisor technology. Ultimately, the key point is that even if advisors are comfortable with the current state of their practice and career, it staying informed about industry dynamics and trends can help them anticipate future changes. The Rethink. Financial Advice podcast offers a useful way to hear a variety of opinions on these key issues! The Diamond Podcast For Financial Advisors Best For:Advisors at broker-dealers thinking about breaking away and wanting to better understand the options in other industry channels Format: Multiple hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Weekly Hosts: Mindy Diamond and other members of the Diamond Consultants team Financial advisors are spread across several different industry channels, including wirehouses, independent broker-dealers, and RIAs. While the actual financial advice being provided by advisors in each of these channels might be similar, the broader environment in which they operate can differ significantly, leading some advisors to consider a transition. The Diamond Podcast For Financial Advisors, hosted by Mindy Diamond and other members of the Diamond Consultants team, explores the changing dynamics of these different channels and what they mean for advisors' careers. While early episodes had a particular (though not exclusive) focus on advisors considering a move from wirehouses to independent channels, the podcast has expanded to cover a broader range of industry trends through updates from members of the Diamond Consultants team (using the extensive data they obtain through their recruiting practice) as well as advisors (many of whom successfully broke away from the wirehouse world) and industry professionals. In sum, while a wirehouse advisor might feel comfortable in their current position, changes in industry dynamics could make a move to the independent broker-dealer or RIA channels more attractive over time. In this context, The Diamond Podcast For Financial Advisors can help industry participants stay up-to-date on key trends in compensation, mergers and acquisitions, and more – whether or not they're currently contemplating a transition. Additional podcast to go deeper: Only Fee-Only (a variety of industry perspectives for fee-only advisors). Early Career Advisors BIF Bites Best For: Candidates for CFP certification who are preparing for the CFP exam Format: Two hosts Typical Length: 20–45 minutes Cadence: Semi-monthly Hosts: Gerald Mee, Adam Scherer Given its professional and financial benefits, obtaining the CFP certification is a goal for both aspiring financial planners and experienced advisors. The path to obtain it, though, is rigorous, and candidates must complete CFP Board's Education, Exam, Experience, and Ethics requirements. The Exam requirement, in particular, can be challenging, with candidates facing a 6-hour, 170-question test of their knowledge of CFP Board's eight principal knowledge domains and topics. Given the comprehensive nature of the exam, those attempting the exam often put in significant time studying, whether on their own or through a review course. To complement this preparation, the BIF Bites podcast, a production of the Boston Institute of Finance (which is itself a CFP Education provider), offers candidates an upbeat, conversational take on planning topics covered on the exam as well as how to dissect and answer specific question types, which could appeal to both aspiring planners (who likely don't have real-world experience with many of the topics on the exam) and those with previous experience (who might not have taken an exam in many years). Altogether, given that studying for the CFP Exam is no easy feat (especially for busy students or current advisors), being able to listen to a podcast (whether at the gym, in the car, or otherwise) as a study aid can reinforce key concepts and could ultimately help the exam-taker pass on their first attempt! New Planner Podcast Best For: Aspiring and newer financial planners looking for career inspiration Format: Single host, guest interviews Typical Length: 30 minutes Cadence: Weekly Host: Caleb Brown One of the defining features of the financial advice industry is its variety of potential entry points (e.g., starting at a small firm versus a large firm) and career paths (e.g., becoming a client-facing advisor versus a financial planning specialist). However, the abundance of options can feel overwhelming, leading to concerns that one might make the 'wrong' choice. With this in mind, the New Planner Podcast, hosted by New Planner Recruiting co-founder Caleb Brown, provides aspiring and newer advisors (both students and career changers) with inspiration for their own career paths. The podcast features interviews with early- and mid-career professionals in various roles and from diverse backgrounds, as well as with industry professionals who share advice for relatively newer advisors. Topics covered by interviewees range from advancing within a larger firm, balancing work with outside interests, and starting a firm, ensuring listeners can find episodes that resonate with their current situation and future goals. In sum, the New Planner Podcast is a high-impact resource for those new to the industry, offering inspiration and insights from professionals who were recently in their shoes – helping listeners take the next step in their own careers! Additional podcast to go deeper: Military To Financial Planner Podcast (for aspiring advisors with a military background). Mid-Career Advisors Financial Advisor Success Best For: Advisors looking to learn what mid-to-late career peers did to find success as an advisor Format: Single host interviewing guests Typical Length: 90 minutes Cadence: Weekly Host: Michael Kitces Success as a financial advisor can come in many forms, from an employee advisor who advances within a larger firm to a firm owner who has built a firm that reflects their preferences and values. Nevertheless, success as an advisor doesn't come automatically; rather, advisors typically face many ups and downs on the path to creating their ideal career – challenges that aren't necessarily apparent to other advisors. The Financial Advisor Success podcast, hosted by Michael Kitces, pulls back the curtain to explore how successful advisors got where they are today, not only by discussing the career moves and strategies (e.g., service models, marketing approaches, or management styles) that have brought them success but also by examining the challenges that they faced along the way. With more than 400 episodes (at approximately 90 minutes each), listeners are able to 'go deep' with a wide range of advisors, firm executives, and professionals who support advisors on the path to success to better understand what made them successful and how they overcame bumps along the road. Ultimately, the key point is that because common markers of advisor success (e.g., AUM, industry awards) are only the 'tip of the iceberg', being able to go 'beneath the surface' can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the true path involved with becoming a successful advisor (including the ups and downs that occur beneath the surface where no one can see). The Financial Advisor Success podcast provides helpful ideas listeners can implement in their own practices and careers as well as inspiration to push through the inevitable challenges that arise along the way during a successful career as an advisor! Do Business. Do Life. Best For: Advisors seeking a better balance between their work and their personal life Format: Single host, guest interviews Typical Length: 30–60 minutes Cadence: Weekly Host: Brad Johnson Financial advisors sometimes can become laser-focused on advancing in their career, whether they are growing within a larger firm or building a firm of their own. Which can sometimes come with long hours and some level of sacrifice to their life outside of work. For advisors seeking to balance career growth with a fulfilling life outside of the office, the Do Business. Do Life. podcast, hosted by advisor coach Brad Johnson, includes episodes featuring Johnson's own insights alongside interviews with advisors and industry professionals exploring how they've achieved success in both their professional and personal lives. Reflecting the scope of the \"Do Business. Do Life.\" mission, conversations cover topics like practical strategies for work-life balance, expert advice on finding happiness and meaning, and Brad's tips for efficient scheduling to maximize time. In the end, most (if not all?) advisors want to experience growth in both their personal and professional lives, but they may sometimes need a wake-up call to realign these areas. With this in mind, Do Business. Do Life. inspires advisors and equips them with tools to bring all aspects of their lives into better balance. Additional podcast to go deeper: Becoming An Elite Financial Advisor (career development best practices from advisors and industry professionals). Career Transitions XYPN Radio Best For: Advisors who are considering whether to start (over with) their own RIA Format: Single host interviewing guests Typical Length: 45–60 minutes Cadence: Bi-weekly Host: Maddy Roche (previously Alan Moore) After working in the industry for several years (or perhaps much earlier), many advisors start considering whether they want to continue working within a larger firm or go out on their own to start an RIA. However, since this decision can feel intimidating – particularly due to the risks and uncertainty of leaving a W-2 job for self-employment– learning from those who have successfully opened their own firms can provide invaluable insights. To help advisors make this decision (and to thrive if they do decide to start their own firm), XYPN Radio, produced by the XY Planning Network, has built up hundreds of interviews with advisors who have 'made it', discussing their backgrounds (including many career changers and advisors who transitioned from the broker-dealer world), the (often difficult) early years in business, and their paths to success over time (with several follow-up episodes with guests to see how their firms have evolved since their previous appearance). Which can help advisors who are considering starting their own RIA (or those who have recently done so!) learn from the mistakes and best practices of others to design the firm of their dreams. Ultimately, the key point is that while getting a new RIA off the ground is no easy feat, a growing number of advisors have done so successfully (with bumps along the way, of course) and XYPN Radio offers inspiration and guidance for those who are thinking about making the jump! Transition To RIA Best For: Advisors seeking practical guidance on transitioning to the RIA model Format: Single host Typical Length: 15–30 minutes Cadence: Semi-monthly Host: Brad Wales One of the major themes in the world of financial advice in recent years has been the growing popularity of the RIA model, with many broker-dealer and wirehouse advisors either transitioning to an existing RIA or starting their own. Nonetheless, making this jump comes with many questions for advisors, from the ins and outs of RIA compliance to whether they will be able to bring their current clients to their new firm. To support advisors considering this transition, the Transition To RIA Podcast, hosted by transition consultant Brad Wales, offers a clear and direct approach. Each episode addresses a specific question (e.g., \"Will I officially own my book with my own RIA?\", \"Should I buy an existing RIA or start my own?\"), typically featuring insights from Wales himself and sometimes from expert guests. With episodes running just 15–30 minutes, advisors can quickly find answers to their burning questions. Further, looking through the full 100+ episode list might reveal additional questions they didn't know they had! In the end, for busy advisors considering a transition to the RIA model, the Transition To RIA podcast provides a valuable service by delivering concise, actionable answers and equipping them with the information they need to make a more informed decision! Advisor Marketing Advisor Marketing Made Simple Best For: Advisors looking for practical advice to refine their marketing tactics Format: Two hosts Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Weekly Hosts: Taylor Schulte, Kendra Wright Financial advicers are experts when it comes to technical topics such as retirement and tax planning. However, few advisors come to the table with formal marketing training. And given that new client growth is the lifeblood of new and established firms alike, advisors sometimes end up spending significant time and/or hard dollars on marketing. To help advisors get the most bang for their marketing buck, the Advisor Marketing Made Simple podcast, hosted by advisor Taylor Schulte and marketing-agency-for-financial-advisors owner Kendra Wright, helps advisors get the most out of their current marketing tactics (and perhaps consider adopting new ones). The podcast offers two types of episodes: host-only discussions between Schulte and Wright where they take on key marketing topics (e.g., the basics of marketing funnels), and \"Advice Line\" episodes where the hosts help an advisor guest with a specific marketing challenge they're facing (e.g., finding the right marketing channel for an advisor's niche). Together, these episodes provide advisors with both high-level views on marketing concepts and practical advice on how to best implement them. Altogether, while marketing can sometimes seem like a complicated challenge for financial advisors, the Advisor Marketing Made Simple podcast lives up to its name by providing clear, actionable advice that advisors can use to make their marketing strategy more efficient and attract more new clients in the process. Top Advisor Marketing Podcast Best For: Advisors seeking to demonstrate their expertise through content marketing Format: Single host interviewing guests Typical Length: 30 minutes Cadence: Weekly Host: Matt Halloran When consumers choose to engage with a financial advisor, they are buying the advisor's expertise and ability to solve financial pain points for people like them. Which means that, for the advisor, being able to demonstrate their knowledge of the issues most important to their ideal target client (and their track record of helping their current clients) can help them attract new clients. With this in mind, the Top Advisor Marketing Podcast, produced by authority marketing firm ProudMouth and hosted by Chief Relationship Officer Matt Halloran, explores the full range of ways advisors can demonstrate their expertise, from podcasts to social media to client testimonials. While some episodes are discussions with members of the ProudMouth team (often discussing advisor podcasts, a firm specialty), most are interviews with advisors who have found success through a broad range of content marketing practices (and with more than 500 episodes in the catalog, advisors are bound to find an episode that provides best practices into just about any marketing tactic they might be considering). In sum, the Top Advisor Marketing Podcast supports advisors by helping them find the content medium that suits their individual style (whether written, spoken, or visual) and that will allow them to best reach their ideal target clients! Top Advisor Podcast Best For: Advisors who want to learn best practices for specific marketing tactics directly from advisors who have used them to successfully grow their firms Format: Single host interviewing guests Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Bi-weekly Host: Bill Cates While marketing is an important component of success for companies in all industries, the unique aspects of the financial advisory business (e.g., the importance of building trust when prospective clients are handing over their life savings for an advisor to manage) mean that certain marketing tactics work better than others. In this environment, the Top Advisor Podcast, hosted by marketing expert and \"referral coach\" Bill Cates offers relevant, actionable marketing advice for listeners through conversations with advisors who have found success with a particular marketing tactic. For example, recent episodes have investigated advisors' use of different marketing media (e.g., podcasts and LinkedIn) as well as the content used to build trust with prospects (e.g., the advisor's origin story). Given the breadth of tactics covered, listeners can select episodes based on a tactic of interest, though the full catalog could provide new marketing ideas to explore as well. In the end, because marketing can come with a significant cost in terms of time and/or hard dollars, choosing a tactic with a high chance of success (particularly for a firm's ideal target client) is paramount. Which means that the lessons offered by guests on the Top Advisor Podcast could prove particularly valuable when designing a firm's marketing plan. Additional podcasts to go deeper: Financial Advisor Marketing (practical marketing tips in a bite-sized format), Steal My Strategy (marketing best practices from other industries). Behavioral Finance The Human Side Of Money Podcast Best For: Advisors who want to apply behavioral finance concepts to forge deeper connections with their clients Format: Single host, guest interviews Typical Length: 60–90 minutes Cadence: Semi-monthly Host: Brendan Frazier When it comes to the technical knowledge necessary to be an effective financial planner, the first topics that come to mind might be knowledge of portfolio construction techniques or retirement income strategies. Nevertheless, in addition to these, advisors are increasingly recognizing the value of understanding the 'why' behind clients' attitudes towards money and how to effectively communicate with them. In this environment, The Human Side of Money podcast, hosted by RFG Advisory Chief Behavioral Officer Brendan Frazier, offers behavioral finance insights that advisors can apply when working with prospects and established clients alike without having to be trained psychologists themselves. Episodes combine Frazier's own insights with those of expert guests and explore topics from holding effective introductory meetings with prospects to implementing productive \"re-discovery\" meetings with long-time clients and leveraging client feedback to create more meaningful planning conversations. Ultimately, the key point is that because an advisor's financial advice is only as good as their understanding of each client's needs as well as their ability to communicate their recommendations, the actionable concepts discussed in The Human Side of Money podcast make it a valuable addition to an advisor's podcast playlist. Standard Deviations Best For: Advisors who want to nerd out on the psychology of money Format: Single host, guest interviews Typical Length: 30–45 minutes Cadence: Weekly Host: Daniel Crosby While financial advisors have broad expertise across the different areas of financial planning, they frequently rely on specialists in particular fields (e.g., CPAs, estate attorneys) to help with particularly thorny questions. And given the importance of understanding client psychology when it comes to financial decision-making (and the unlikelihood that an advisor is a psychologist themselves!), being able to tap into this knowledge base can improve advisors' effectiveness. Amidst this backdrop, the Standard Deviations podcast, hosted by psychologist Daniel Crosby, offers expert insights into human psychology and how it applies to financial advisory practices. Over the course of more than 300 episodes, Crosby discusses these topics with a wide range of experts, from fellow psychologists to academic researchers to financial advisors themselves, providing listeners with valuable lessons, no matter whether they are junior advisors or senior firm executives. As a sample, recent episodes include an exploration into humanizing wealth management with advisory industry executive Joe Duran, the psychological value of sabbaticals with advisory firm owner Cady North, and Crosby's own views on emotions and money. Altogether, while advisors might not consider themselves experts in psychology, applying lessons from this field, with the help of the Standard Deviations podcast, can help them understand how their clients are approaching key money decisions and how to best guide them on a path to financial success. Additional podcast to go deeper: Planning \u0026 Beyond (therapist-led conversations focusing on the intersection of psychology and financial planning). Investment Planning Rational Reminder Best For: Advisors looking to nerd out on investment planning topics Format: Two hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 45–75 minutes Cadence: Weekly Hosts: Benjamin Felix, Cameron Passmore As financial advisors increasingly offer comprehensive planning services, investment management has shifted from the centerpiece of an advisor's value proposition to one of many ways they add value for their clients. Nonetheless, given the importance of investment management to the success of clients' financial plans (whether seeking growth during a client's working years or a reliable source of income during their retirement), being able to construct effective portfolios for clients remains a key part of the value an advisor provides. To help advisors better understand opportunities (and potential pitfalls) in financial markets, the Rational Reminder podcast offers an in-depth look into investment management topics ranging from portfolio theory to factor investing to expected returns. Produced by Canadian wealth management firm PWL Capital and hosted by portfolio managers Benjamin Felix and Cameron Passmore, the Rational Reminder podcasts features guests from a variety of backgrounds (from advisors to academics) to dig deep into both nerdy investment topics for advisors (e.g., a recent episode debating the possible impact of index funds on market dynamics) and issues that clients might bring up themselves (e.g., an episode examining why clients might be tempted to 'copy' the success of Warren Buffett and just invest in Berkshire Hathaway). And with more than 300 episodes in the catalog, the podcast provides a helpful index broken down by category for advisors who want to listen to episodes on a specific subject. Ultimately, the key point is that while advisors might no longer spend most of their days thinking about what's happening in markets, having a solid fundamental knowledge of portfolio management strategies can add value to their clients, and the Rational Reminder podcast offers a convenient way to stay on top of research and trends in this area! Facts vs. Feelings Best For: Advisors looking for a concise way to stay on top of recent market trends Format: Two hosts Typical Length: 45 minutes Cadence: Weekly Hosts: Ryan Detrick, Sonu Varghese Financial advisors have long produced market commentaries for their clients, whether in written form (e.g., a regular client newsletter) or as a dedicated section of client meetings. However, staying on top of market movements (and determining the possible reasons behind them) can take up valuable time that an advisor could be using for other planning activities. Amidst this backdrop, the Facts vs. Feelings podcast, hosted by Carson Group Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick and Global Macro Strategist Sonu Varghese, attempts to cut through the 'noise' with weekly, approximately 45-minute episodes that can allow advisors to efficiently stay on top of the latest market movements (and be prepared to answer any client questions that come their way). Exploring a wide range of influences on the market (from the economy to the Federal Reserve to volatility dynamics) and sometimes leveraging expert guests, advisors will come away from each episode with a more nuanced view of what is driving the market (and potential market-moving events going forward). In the end, while financial advicers frequently focus on the long run when it comes to their clients' investments, the Facts vs. Feelings podcast provides a concise way for advisors to stay up to date on recent trends, providing potential inspiration for their upcoming market commentaries and context for client questions that come their way! The Compound And Friends Best For: Advisors seeking commentary on markets and the broader business world from a diverse range of industry participants Format: Two hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 60–90 minutes Cadence: Two episodes per week Hosts: Josh Brown, Michael Batnick Investment markets are in constant motion as a range of actors (from the Federal Reserve to well-known investors) and events (from government data releases to company earnings reports) can drive major moves. So hearing from a wide array of industry professionals can provide an advisor with a more well-rounded view on what exactly is influencing their clients' investment returns. To help advisors navigate the ever-changing market environment, The Compound and Friends podcast, hosted by Josh Brown and Michael Batnick of RIA Ritholtz Wealth Management, features commentary from both the hosts and expert guests from across the investment management industry and broader business world. Discussing equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and more, listeners will come away from each fast-paced episode with greater insight into the factors driving recent market movements and insights into what might lie ahead. In addition, given the many points of view featured over time (whether bullish, bearish, or otherwise), listeners can come away with a more well-rounded view on market dynamics. Ultimately, the key point is that given the amount of time it would take to keep track of all of the factors driving investment markets, The Compound and Friends podcast offers a useful shortcut with its twice-weekly episodes, allowing advisors to make better investment management recommendations for clients (and answer their market-related questions) in the process. Additional podcast to go deeper: The Real Adviser Podcast (market and planning industry commentary with a focus on the United Kingdom and Ireland). Tax Planning Retirement Tax Podcast Best For: Advisors who want to offer more value for clients through tax planning Format: Two hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 20 minutes Cadence: Semi-monthly Hosts: Steven Jarvis, Benjamin Brandt Tax planning gives financial advisors an opportunity to demonstrate their value to clients in the form of hard-dollar tax savings. Yet, most advisors aren't tax professionals themselves and might not have the time to review every change to the tax code or each new IRS private letter ruling. With this in mind, the Retirement Tax Podcast, hosted by CPA and founder of Retirement Tax Services Steven Jarvis and financial advisor Benjamin Brandt, discusses a wide range of tax-related topics (not exclusive to topics of interest to retired clients) and does so in an engaging way (which isn't the easiest task given the subject matter). Episodes include discussions of technical tax issues (e.g., how to avoid being audited by the IRS), broader perspectives on tax planning (e.g., the psychology of tax planning), and Q\u0026As on tax-related topics that might come up in client meetings. Altogether, while one might assume that tax planning doesn't lend itself to the podcast medium, the Retirement Tax Podcast succeeds at offering advisors informative tax content in a lively, concise format. Estate Planning The Practical Planner Best For: Advisors looking for practical advice on implementing estate planning strategies with clients Format: Two hosts, guest interviews Typical Length: 25–40 minutes Cadence: Semi-monthly Hosts: Anne Rhodes, Thomas Kopelman, David Haughton Financial advisors have the opportunity to add significant value for clients through estate planning advice, from making sure that their assets transfer to their desired beneficiaries efficiently and in the most tax-efficient way possible. However, as in the case of tax planning, most advisors aren't estate planning attorneys themselves. To help advisors navigate the waters of estate planning, The Practical Planner podcast, hosted by Wealth.com's Chief Legal Officer Anne Rhodes, advisor Thomas Kopelman, and attorney David Haughton, covers the gamut of estate planning topics for both retired and working-age clients alike. Benefiting from Rhodes's and Haughton's legal expertise and Kopelman's experience as a client-facing planner, the podcast is able to get into the weeds of estate planning law while offering actionable information for financial advisors. For instance, recent episodes explore considerations for leaving assets to minors, the essentials of credit shelter trusts, and strategies for incorporating estate planning into the financial planning process. In sum, The Practical Planner podcast lives up to its name by providing practical guidance for advisors looking to up their game when it comes to providing estate planning services to clients. Additional podcast to go deeper: Future Focused: Sophisticated Estate Planning (law-firm-led exploration of estate planning strategies, particularly for high-net-worth clients). Ultimately, the key point is that there is no shortage of available podcasts to help financial advisors grow their practices, advance in their careers, and deliver better advice to their clients. Nevertheless, given the limited amount of free time available to advisors, we hope that this list helps you choose the podcasts that best meet your unique needs! What are your go-to advisor podcasts?

Of course, given the demands of their busy schedules , finding time to dig into this content can be a challenging endeavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, alongside the increasing popularity of podcasts on a seemingly infinite range of topics, there is a growing ecosystem of podcasts aimed at financial advisors, covering everything from practice management and career development to technical topics, such as investment, tax, and estate planning. Which gives advisors the opportunity to gain new ideas to improve their businesses (and careers) as well as stay on top of emerging planning opportunities while commuting, working out at the gym, or walking the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, given the hundreds of available podcasts targeted to financial advisors, finding the \u0026#39;best\u0026#39; ones for an advisor\u0026#39;s specific needs can be a challenge. With this in mind, we have compiled a list of \u0026#34;Top Financial Advisor Podcasts\u0026#34;, with a particular focus on how advisors can find the \u0026#39;right\u0026#39; podcasts that fit their interests and business needs, whether they are aspiring financial planners or managing large enterprises. The podcasts are organized by category (e.g., practice management, behavioral finance), with each podcast capsule including a description of the type of advisor for whom the podcast is best suited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotably, this list highlights podcasts that we believe (based on our own listening!) offer a high signal-to-noise ratio and are tailored to the needs of those who are a part of (or hope to join) the financial advicer community (i.e., those who are in the business of selling their financial advice as opposed to financial products). Further, because choosing \u0026#39;top\u0026#39; podcasts is inherently subjective (e.g., a financial advisor might find that they \u0026#39;click\u0026#39; with the style of one podcast host over another covering a similar topic), we list a number of additional podcasts that are also worth checking out in each category for advisors who want to go deeper on a given topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that introduction, we hope you enjoy our list of the 22 \u0026#39;top\u0026#39; podcasts for financial advisors!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-200x200.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Van Deusen Headshot\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-800x800.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-src=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-200x200.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adam-Van-Deusen-Headshot-scaled-e1690842386831-800x800.jpg 800w\" data-old-src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"\u003eAdam is a Financial Planning Nerd at \u003ca href=\"https://www.kitces.com/\"\u003eKitces.com\u003c/a\u003e.
