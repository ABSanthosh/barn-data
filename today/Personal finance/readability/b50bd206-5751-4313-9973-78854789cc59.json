Even if you have qualified before, qualifying terms can change at any time. Cash advances can be quite small (i.e., less than $50) for those with thin or damaged credit profiles and it can be hard to get increases. AlternativesThere are other alternative to using apps like Empower, especially if you don’t want to link your bank account to a third-party platform.Here are some other methods you can use get immediate access to cash funds: Salary advance. Ask your workplace if they can advance you a portion of your next paycheck. Credit cards. If possible, use a credit card to cover (charge) an unforeseen bill and then pay the balance in full on your next payday. Credit card cash advances can be a convenient way to get cash quickly, but those fees can run very high. Peer-to-peer loans.
