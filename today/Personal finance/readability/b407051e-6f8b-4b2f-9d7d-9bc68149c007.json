How are we in November already? Sara, am I alone in feeling like this year was on turbo speed?Sara Rathner:You're not. I still think 1975 was 20 years ago.Elizabeth Ayoola:I like the end of the year for two reasons. Now one, I'm a self-reflective journaling chick, and I enjoy doing my year-in-review exercises. And for two, I'm a December baby. Shout out to all my Sagittariuses. But anyway, we're going to be delving more into the former today. Welcome to NerdWallet Smart Money Podcast. I'm Elizabeth Ayoola.Sara Rathner:And I'm Sara Rathner, and for the record, I do not journal.Elizabeth Ayoola:We’ve got to talk about that more later.Sara Rathner:I know.Elizabeth Ayoola:Alright. This episode, we answer a listener's question about combining retirement accounts from different jobs. But first, Sara and I are going to talk about the worst budgeting or financial mistake that we have made this year. Now, if we want to add a splash of festivity to the topic, we can focus on holiday spending mistakes. It's your call, Sara. And yes, that means you're going first.Sara Rathner:Yeah, no pressure. Well, we could apply this to holiday spending, but we could also apply it to spending year-round, and for me, it's so easy—way too easy—to try to solve problems by buying stuff online. I can't count the number of times I thought I had a problem to solve and threw money at some small thing, and I thought it would be the solution to my problem. Then the package arrived a few days later, and I'm like, \"Why did I buy this?\" It's like death by a thousand Amazon purchases.Elizabeth Ayoola:I'm certain that so many people feel seen right now, Sara, because you shared that. And you know what? I hate to say that I can relate, but I must say that I'm proud of a new habit that I've developed. I have started returning things to Amazon that I do not need. Yes, before, I was too lazy to return them, so they would just sit around my house. Now, I think the option to drop items at Whole Foods—shout out to Amazon for that—has been a source of motivation. Nothing beats saving money by returning things I don't need and picking up a few healthy food items in the process.Sara Rathner:And if you want to think about your overall environmental impact, it's always better not to buy the item in the first place than to buy it and return it. But none of us are perfect, and returning it is also a great idea if it's something you do not actually need. So, Elizabeth, I've shared my own personal shame, one of many shames, but we're only picking one today, so we don't have to list all of them. What has been your big budgeting fail of the year?Elizabeth Ayoola:Oh my gosh. Listeners, please just stick with me, okay? I am going to have a little vent now. I'm going to go with my general biggest budgeting mistake this year because it's going to affect my holiday spending too. As some listeners may be aware, because I spoke about it earlier this year, I have moved to a different state, and it's my first time moving states since I moved back to the U.S. from London. Now, while I did budget a lump sum that I needed to move, which included rent, damn that first security deposit, new furniture because my old furniture sucked, a $2,000 U-Haul, first-quarter private school fees for my son, and so much more. But anyways, what was the mistake? I should have set a harder limit for how much I would spend and prioritized in terms of what could wait. But in the spirit of wanting my house to feel like a home, I purchased things that honestly could have waited even until next year. What I don't regret is buying quality furniture this time around, and I'm hoping that it's going to last for years to come. And yes, that includes the white sofa that I bought with a six-year-old boy in the house. I know, you guys are screaming. Overextending my budget means I'm now on a tight budget for the rest of the year, and most people will be getting hugs for Christmas. I'm currently avoiding large purchases, and I'm just focusing on what I need versus what I want. But I do have one highlight, though. All of that spending got me lots of air miles on my travel credit card.Sara Rathner:Well, maybe next holiday season you could go somewhere for free.Elizabeth Ayoola:Exactly.Sara Rathner:And I will say, as somebody with three pets and a toddler, I'm amazed anyone buys white sofas.Elizabeth Ayoola:I know, I know. But honestly, I am not an interior decor girl, but it really went with my walls because my walls are gray. And anyway, I'm enjoying living on the edge. So, for anyone planning on making a big move in 2025, please be as specific as you can about your budget. Moving can be extremely expensive, and settling into a new city or environment can be hard enough as it is, so you don't want to add financial stress to the mix. And also, a lesson in delayed gratification here. Some things honestly can wait, and it can be worth the wait when you have financial peace as a result.Sara Rathner:Yeah, I think it's really common to underestimate how much it costs to move. You've got the packing materials and the professional movers, and once you're in your new space, you want to make it feel like home. And yes, I said professional movers, because when you're 22, you could pay your friends and pizza to move your stuff. When you're 32 and you have real furniture and your friends are busy, they don't want to help you move your stuff for the cost of pizza. So, just hire some professionals and save your friendships.Elizabeth Ayoola:Say it again. And I did exactly that actually, Sara, I did exactly that.Sara Rathner:You hired professional movers...Elizabeth Ayoola:I did.Sara Rathner:...Or you paid your friends with pizza?Elizabeth Ayoola:No. What friends? Nobody was helping me move all that stuff out that you haul. I paid a professional, okay?Sara Rathner:Listen, if you have white couch money, you can hire a professional. That's it. That's my financial rule.Elizabeth Ayoola:Oh my gosh. And I have a little confession. My son has finally put a little stain on the white couch, so here goes the cost, right? Because now I'm going to pay for a professional cleaner to clean the sofa, and I was just thinking I didn't think of the ongoing maintenance costs. But anyway. With that said, let's give listeners a couple of budgeting tips for the last two months of the year. Now, I know it can be easy to ignore your budget because you're busy having fun, spending time with loved ones, and also unwinding from what has been a long, chaotic year. All those happy hormones can also trick you into living in the moment and blowing up your budget. So, what's one tip that you have for listeners, Sara, to hopefully avoid doing this?Sara Rathner:Well, this is the time of year where everyone's going out and spending a lot of money in the spirit of festivity, but talk to your loved ones and suggest alternate plans if the plans they are recommending cost a lot of money and are going to blow your budget. Let's say your friends want to go out for an expensive dinner or your family insists on buying everybody a mountain of presents. It's okay to say, \"Listen, that's just not in my budget right now.\" Like you mentioned, giving people hugs for the holidays is their gift because you just spent so much money on moving. Don't just complain. Offer up an alternative. Maybe you skip the dinner with your friends, but you meet up with them later on for a cheaper outing. Or maybe you talk with your family about doing a gift exchange where everybody draws up one name out of a hat and you only buy one gift and you set a hard budget for that gift. Your loved ones aren't going to know that you're struggling unless you speak up, and honestly, oftentimes once you speak up, you realize that you're not the only one in your circle who's struggling. So, other people want an excuse to take a break too.Elizabeth Ayoola:I love that so much, and I think it takes a lot of vulnerability to be open and tell people that you just ain't got it. And I do know that some people feel embarrassed to say that, but I think feeling embarrassed might be a little bit better than not having enough money, especially going into the new year.Sara Rathner:Yes, your embarrassment is not worth not being able to make your rent payment in January. Think of it that way. It could be that serious for you.Elizabeth Ayoola:Exactly.Sara Rathner:I would rather tell somebody who cares about me about what's going on with me than have to talk with my landlord about the fact that I have to pay a late payment because I can't afford rent on time.Elizabeth Ayoola:Absolutely. And this is a little bit off-topic, but I've been seeing things going around social media, like if you don't show up to your friend's birthday dinner... I'm sure there are a lot of December babies having some birthday things that you might have to pay for. Are you a bad friend? And putting that out there. If anybody gets upset with you because you can't attend because it's not in your budget, then you might want to reassess that relationship as well.Sara Rathner:Okay. Elizabeth, you've got more tips for us.Elizabeth Ayoola:My more formal tip now is to start thinking about what you want your finances to look like in 2025. Now, doing this can help you stay focused and it can also give you the discipline that you need to ensure you start 2025 off strong financially. For example, with interest rates trickling down, you may be hoping to finally buy a home next year. Housing market is another story, but it's going to be hard to do that if you blow your savings or hurt your credit score by maxing out your credit cards during the holidays.Sara Rathner:I like that. I think it's helpful to list a few things that you want to accomplish over the next few months so you're not just thinking about the holidays now, but rather how the holidays might affect what you want to do next year.Elizabeth Ayoola:Exactly. And as someone who sometimes can fall prey to impulse spending, I know this task especially helps me. One of my goals for 2025 is to finally start my traveling on points journey or rather take it to the next level by getting more travel credit cards, and that requires me maintaining good credit and not overspending.Sara Rathner:Well, luckily you're surrounded by coworkers who can help you with that. Including yours, truly.Elizabeth Ayoola:Oh, shout out to my coworkers. Love that.Sara Rathner:All right, listeners, we want to hear from you. What are your strategies for getting through the holiday season financially unscathed, and I don't know, still speaking terms with your relatives? So, text us or leave a voicemail on the Nerd Hotline... I'm serious. At 901-730-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D. Or email us at [email protected].Elizabeth Ayoola:Oh my gosh. Just a sidebar. I think some people might end up in a group chat about how cheap they're being this holiday because they say, \"No,\" but we don't care. We're saving money.Sara Rathner:I'm here for all of your group chats where you talk about how cheap you have to be. You can invite me to that group chat and I'll just silently sit there and applaud you.Elizabeth Ayoola:Exactly. All right, now let's turn to this episode's money question segment, where we get deep into retirement benefits. That's coming up in a moment. Stay with us.Sean Pyles:We're back and answering your real-world money questions to help you make smarter financial decisions.This episode's question comes from a listener's text message. They wrote, \"Does it make sense to amalgamate all of my retirement accounts from different jobs into one place or does it not matter?\"Sara Rathner:First of all, bonus points to this listener for typing the word amalgamate into a text message.Sean Pyles:Yes.Sara Rathner:I don't know what your bonus points are worth in real life, but you should know that you have them.To answer this question on this episode of the podcast, we are joined by NerdWallet credit card writer Jae Bratton.Welcome to Smart Money, Jae.Jae Bratton:Thanks for having me.Sara Rathner:Now, Jae typically writes about credit cards but has experience managing retirement account rollovers, so we're going to talk with her about that. But, let's start by talking about what our listener describes as \"amalgamating\" their retirement accounts, which is known conversationally as rolling retirement accounts over. Before we dive in, we just want to reiterate that we are not investment advisors. Sean, do you want to give us a quick explanation of what a retirement account rollover looks like?Sean Pyles:Sure. Rolling over a retirement account is when you take the retirement account from maybe an old employer and, you guessed it, roll it into the retirement account of your new employer or another retirement account you have, like an IRA.There are two main ways that you can do a rollover. One is a direct rollover where your former retirement account administrator connects to your new administrator and transfers the funds from your old account to your new account. Or in the case of an IRA, the institution that manages your account transfers it to another IRA or retirement plan, like a 401k.The second way to do a rollover is called an indirect rollover or a 60-day rollover, where you get a check with the entire balance of your retirement account, and then you move it into the new account yourself. This second option can give you a little more flexibility with how you manage the rollover, but it does have some drawbacks, too.Sara Rathner:Yeah, let's talk about those drawbacks. A big one is the cost. When you do an indirect rollover, the IRS automatically withholds 10% or 20% of your account balance depending on the type of account you have. And here's the thing: you have to contribute the entire amount of your original cash balance to the new account or you face penalties, and that could put people in a pretty serious cash crunch.Sean Pyles:And also, you are given a check with your retirement account balance, again, which can be a little scary to see and hold in your hand.Sara Rathner:Yeah, it's your life savings.Sean Pyles:Right.I want to give a quick example of what an indirect rollover looks like and this cash withholding from the IRS, because it can get a little confusing. For example, say I want to roll over a 401k balance of $10,000. The IRS withholds 20% or $2,000, so I only get a check for $8,000.Then, I need to come up with an additional $2,000 so I can deposit that original balance of $10,000 to the new retirement account, and if I don't do that, if I can't find that $2,000, I will face penalties from the IRS, which is not ideal.And we should say that you will get that withheld money back from the IRS, but not in time to replace it within the 60-day period.Sara Rathner:So, that sucks. No... There's no other way I could say that. That's really rough, and you're taking something that is already really administratively complicated and then making it expensive, which is no fun. Jae, that being said, let's get to your story. What was your rollover adventure like?Jae Bratton:The year was 2022. I had just been hired by NerdWallet, and I decided that it was time to get all of my retirement accounts from my former employers into one. I had two old ones from, like I said, two previous employers, and I wanted to move them into one financial institution, the one that was already holding my husband's and my Roth IRAs. I used a service which facilitates the rollover process for free, and even though I didn't need this particular feature, it also helps you find old 401ks that you may have forgotten about.Sean Pyles:That's handy. So you were doing an indirect rollover, but you had a company helping you out as sort of an intermediary.Jae Bratton:Right.Sean Pyles:Okay.And you did two rollovers, so walk us through the first one.Jae Bratton:The first rollover I would say was a little bit more straightforward. I moved about $21,000 from a Roth 401k from a former employer into that Roth IRA that I said I had already had at that particular financial institution. I was able to roll that $21,000 in my old Roth 401k into my current Roth IRA because both investment accounts are after-tax, and that means I had already paid tax on the contributions, and the big benefit of that is I get to make withdrawals in retirement tax-free. Now, when you do rollovers, it is possible to roll over a traditional 401k into a Roth IRA, but you will have to pay taxes. Accounts have to be tax-compatible if you want to avoid paying penalties.Sara Rathner:One thing that's nice about rolling into a Roth IRA like you did is that you could ignore the contribution limits on these types of accounts. For the 2024 tax year, Roth IRA contributions are limited to $7,000 a year, or $8,000 a year for those who are 50 or older, but rollovers don't count toward those contribution limits. And Jae, that's why you were able to roll $21,000 from that Roth 401k into the Roth IRA in one go. Right?Jae Bratton:Exactly. I was able to grow the balance in my Roth IRA while still playing by the rules that govern annual contribution limits, and the contribution limit for Roth IRAs is pretty low comparatively, especially when you compare it to a 401k. That was just a nice perk.Sean Pyles:That's pretty handy. Let's talk about your second rollover. What was the deal with that one?Jae Bratton:For the second rollover, again from another former employer, this time I was moving about $25,000 from a 403(b) into a traditional IRA.Sean Pyles:And for those wondering, a 403(b) is generally what employees of public schools and nonprofits get instead of a 401k, but they're pretty similar. Jae, was rolling the 403(b) into your IRA as easy as rolling over the 401k?Jae Bratton:Yeah, actually. The process was just as simple. Again, that service that I used facilitated the rolling over process and made it pretty seamless. The only difference is that in this particular rollover, my 403(b) was traditional, not a Roth, meaning I hadn't paid tax on those contributions yet. So, I rolled over the money from the 403(b) into a traditional IRA, not a Roth IRA, and whenever I go to withdraw those funds in retirement, I will have to pay taxes on that money then.Sean Pyles:Was the second rollover direct or indirect?Jae Bratton:It was direct, and that means that I did not have to pay any financial penalty on this particular rollover.Sean Pyles:Did you find that to be easier than the indirect or not?Jae Bratton:I don't have experience doing an indirect rollover, so I can't really compare, but I would just say overall the experience was fairly easy just because I had the assistance of this particular service to walk me through it.Sean Pyles:Why was it important to you to do these rollovers? To get to our listener's question, why did it make financial or personal sense to you?Jae Bratton:As I mentioned earlier, I initiated this rollover process in 2022 right when I had been hired at NerdWallet. I knew that I was going to have a retirement account with NerdWallet, a 401k, and I knew I had these two other retirement accounts hanging out in the ether. I didn't want three retirement accounts in separate financial institutions, so in 2022, I decided now is the time to streamline everything. Come our retirement, I didn't want to be hunting down retirement accounts at X number of financial institutions. I want that time to be for leisure.There is a financial component behind the motivation to roll over. I wanted to move that money from those old accounts and invest them into mutual funds of my choice.Sean Pyles:Sara, I know that you have done rollovers, or at least one in the past. Was your motivation similar?Sara Rathner:Yeah, I've done two rollovers in the past from former employers. I had traditional 401ks with both, and I rolled them into one traditional IRA at the same financial institution where I also have a Roth IRA and I also have a taxable brokerage account. So, really for me, it was about simplifying my finances and having more of my finances in one place. Even if there are several different accounts, they are still under one roof, too, and that to me is administratively easier. The more complicated your life gets financially, the more you want to simplify some stuff and have it be a little bit more under your control.Sean Pyles:And Sara, was your rollover process as easy as it seems Jae's was?Sara Rathner:To be honest, I blacked out a lot of it because it was so annoying. Really—Sean Pyles:So that's a no.Sara Rathner:Yeah. I think I started by calling customer service from both the financial institution that had my old account and then the financial institution I was going to transfer it into. I will say all of the banks and institutions I dealt with had incredible customer service, so if you have any questions, start by just calling them. They will walk you through the process. That was probably the best part, was just talking to people on the phone, which is usually not the best part. Usually, that's the worst part, but really they were incredibly helpful. And then they directed me to forms I had to fill out and I had to get them notarized, send them in. It was a series of tasks that were just annoying. It wasn't just fill out an online form and hit submit and then you get your money transferred. It's not that simple.Sean Pyles:How long did the process take you, if you remember?Sara Rathner:It depends. I didn't really realize this at the time, but I think one of the transfers was indirect, and so one day my doorbell rang and it was FedEx with an overnight envelope that contained a six-figure check from an employer I had been at for almost a decade. So you can imagine how much money I had set aside over the years, and they were just like, \"There you go.\"Sean Pyles:Have fun.Sara Rathner:Then I had to mail it to the next institution, so you're terrified because your money is just floating out there into the ether at the behest of various shipping companies and yeah, I didn't love that.Sean Pyles:Yeah, that's scary. There's got to be a better way.Sara Rathner:Yeah, one process was all electronic. I never saw a check with the money. The other one, for whatever reason, was not. You just don't know what you're going to get.Sean Pyles:Yeah.Sara Rathner:That's what I don't like about it.Sean Pyles:Let's talk a little bit more broadly about some of the pros and cons of rollovers.Our listener got to one pro with their question, and it seems like this relates to Jae and Sara, your experiences too. Having all your retirement funds in just one or two places makes it easier to manage.Jae, can you speak to any other upsides that made this process appealing to you, even if it isn't maybe the most straightforward sometimes?Jae Bratton:Definitely. But before I do that, I want to go back to something that Sara was saying. Sara was talking about how her process of rolling over some of her old retirement accounts was not as easy as maybe my experience, and I want to say that mine was maybe a little bit easier than hers and maybe other people listening, because I only was rolling over two accounts. I've mentioned this before, but I used a service to help walk me through that process. And also, like Sara, I had a baseline knowledge of retirement accounts.So, I say all that to say, I don't want to put out this impression that rolling over retirement accounts is easy. It's not. It is a complicated process made easier by some services, so I don't want the listeners to think this is something that I can do in 15 minutes, and it's not. The task of rolling over retirement accounts... We don't have to do it, but there are benefits which I will talk about. This is just another example of how the onus is on us to make sure that we are making all the right decisions to safeguard our future in retirement.Sean Pyles:It might sound counterintuitive, but weirdly, I'm okay with a retirement account rollover not being the easiest thing to do. It maybe shouldn't be a 15-minute exchange to put all of your retirement savings from one account to the next. It's a pretty significant amount of money oftentimes, and it's a very serious allocation of funds for a very important goal, funding your retirement.Sara Rathner:Yeah, but that being said, I could move tens of thousands of dollars into a brokerage account in two business days.Sean Pyles:Maybe that also isn't great. I don't know.Sara Rathner:Yeah, but at the same time, you have to think about how democratized personal finance has become because of this technology, and you no longer have to be 100% knowledgeable, 100% connected, have... You have a guy behind a mahogany desk who can put in a phone call and he does stuff for you. You don't have to live that life. You can be your average person who switched jobs a couple of times and just wants to keep their finances as organized as possible.On the one hand, putting a little friction into some financial processes definitely prevents people from making mistakes or from spending money unnecessarily. At the same time, some processes... We could utilize technology to make things less onerous than they used to be.Sean Pyles:Totally agree. I think the certified mail route that you described having to go through is pretty outdated.Sara Rathner:Yeah, what if I wasn't home to answer the door? Were you just going to leave that check in my mailbox?Sean Pyles:It's scary, but we want to make sure that people understand the gravity of what they're dealing with at the same time.Jae, I want to go back to any other upsides around rollovers that did make this intimidating process appealing.Jae Bratton:The first one I've already mentioned before, but it's worth repeating again because this is probably the main motivation for many people doing rollovers, and that is just simply simplicity. For people who have held multiple jobs like myself, that's reason enough. Many of us are going to have many jobs in our lifetime before we get to retirement, and without rolling over those accounts, you'll have to pull money in retirement from multiple pots, and I wanted mine in one big one.The second draw for rolling over retirement accounts is financial security. Many of us have had multiple jobs, and the more jobs we have, we're increasing the likelihood that we'll forget about that 401k that we've had with an employer we had 20 years ago and definitely don't want to forget about that money. And lastly, I would say that your 401k with an employer usually has limited investment options that are preselected by that employer. If you're not satisfied with those investment options or the fees attached to those funds, one way to get around that is to roll over your retirement funds into an IRA where you have much more freedom to select the investments that you want.Sara Rathner:We should also note that funds in a 401k sometimes have lower expense ratios, which basically means they cost less to invest in, and if you like the funds you're invested in but you're considering consolidating your various retirement accounts, you may want to compare the expense ratios of the funds you're invested in with your current retirement account and the funds you'd invest in through the IRA.Sean Pyles:I want to turn now to a couple cons. Sara and Jae, I think you described some just through your experiences, but really one that stands out to me is that doing a rollover requires you to take action and be really on top of your finances. If you are in your prime working years, you're maybe a little bit lazy, but decently organized, and you don't want to have to wrangle your old accounts. Jae, going through what you described or Sara, what you described, might not be appealing, and I think that's totally fair. As long as people are making sure that the money in these accounts is actually invested, maybe check on it a few times a year, then it can be fine to leave old accounts where they are. Again, just do not forget about them. Though, as we've been talking about, people might want to think about consolidating accounts as they get closer to retirement so they have fewer accounts to manage, because in general, as we get older, it can be a good idea to consolidate accounts, so your finances are just easier to account for.Sara Rathner:Yeah, and I'll also say if you're in your prime working years and you're decently organized, it might not even be laziness. You're just busy. You're busy...Sean Pyles:Yeah.Sara Rathner:You're tired, you’ve got so much other stuff to deal with, this is just another thing.Sean Pyles:That's fair.Sara Rathner:It's always something. All right, listeners, if you are interested in rolling over your own funds, we've got a handy resource for you. I recommend you check out NerdWallet's roundups of the best IRA accounts and best Roth IRA accounts.

And we'll link to those roundups in today's show notes. You can also just search for NerdWallet best IRA or Roth IRA accounts.Sean Pyles:Jae, any final thoughts about rollovers for our listeners who might be looking to amalgamate their accounts?Jae Bratton:I would just say if you're considering a rollover, speak with your particular retirement plan custodian and ask them to help you roll over the money in a way that won't incur any financial penalties.Sean Pyles:Yeah.

This episode, we answer a listener\u0026#39;s question about combining retirement accounts from different jobs. But first, Sara and I are going to talk about the worst budgeting or financial mistake that we have made this year. Now, if we want to add a splash of festivity to the topic, we can focus on holiday spending mistakes. It\u0026#39;s your call, Sara. And yes, that means you\u0026#39;re going first.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, no pressure. Well, we could apply this to holiday spending, but we could also apply it to spending year-round, and for me, it\u0026#39;s so easy—way too easy—to try to solve problems by buying stuff online. I can\u0026#39;t count the number of times I thought I had a problem to solve and threw money at some small thing, and I thought it would be the solution to my problem. Then the package arrived a few days later, and I\u0026#39;m like, \u0026#34;Why did I buy this?\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;s like death by a thousand Amazon purchases.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eElizabeth Ayoola:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI\u0026#39;m certain that so many people feel seen right now, Sara, because you shared that. And you know what? I hate to say that I can relate, but I must say that I\u0026#39;m proud of a new habit that I\u0026#39;ve developed. I have started returning things to Amazon that I do not need. Yes, before, I was too lazy to return them, so they would just sit around my house. Now, I think the option to drop items at Whole Foods—shout out to Amazon for that—has been a source of motivation. Nothing beats saving money by returning things I don\u0026#39;t need and picking up a few healthy food items in the process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd if you want to think about your overall environmental impact, it\u0026#39;s always better not to buy the item in the first place than to buy it and return it. But none of us are perfect, and returning it is also a great idea if it\u0026#39;s something you do not actually need. So, Elizabeth, I\u0026#39;ve shared my own personal shame, one of many shames, but we\u0026#39;re only picking one today, so we don\u0026#39;t have to list all of them. What has been your big budgeting fail of the year?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eElizabeth Ayoola:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOh my gosh. Listeners, please just stick with me, okay? I am going to have a little vent now. I\u0026#39;m going to go with my general biggest budgeting mistake this year because it\u0026#39;s going to affect my holiday spending too. As some listeners may be aware, because I spoke about it earlier this year, I have moved to a different state, and it\u0026#39;s my first time moving states since I moved back to the U.S. from London. Now, while I did budget a lump sum that I needed to move, which included rent, damn that first security deposit, new furniture because my old furniture sucked, a $2,000 U-Haul, first-quarter private school fees for my son, and so much more. But anyways, what was the mistake? I should have set a harder limit for how much I would spend and prioritized in terms of what could wait. But in the spirit of wanting my house to feel like a home, I purchased things that honestly could have waited even until next year. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat I don\u0026#39;t regret is buying quality furniture this time around, and I\u0026#39;m hoping that it\u0026#39;s going to last for years to come. And yes, that includes the white sofa that I bought with a six-year-old boy in the house. I know, you guys are screaming. Overextending my budget means I\u0026#39;m now on a tight budget for the rest of the year, and most people will be getting hugs for Christmas. I\u0026#39;m currently avoiding large purchases, and I\u0026#39;m just focusing on what I need versus what I want. But I do have one highlight, though.

So, for anyone planning on making a big move in 2025, please be as specific as you can about your budget. Moving can be extremely expensive, and settling into a new city or environment can be hard enough as it is, so you don\u0026#39;t want to add financial stress to the mix. And also, a lesson in delayed gratification here. Some things honestly can wait, and it can be worth the wait when you have financial peace as a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, I think it\u0026#39;s really common to underestimate how much it costs to move.

And yes, I said professional movers, because when you\u0026#39;re 22, you could pay your friends and pizza to move your stuff. When you\u0026#39;re 32 and you have real furniture and your friends are busy, they don\u0026#39;t want to help you move your stuff for the cost of pizza.

With that said, let\u0026#39;s give listeners a couple of budgeting tips for the last two months of the year. Now, I know it can be easy to ignore your budget because you\u0026#39;re busy having fun, spending time with loved ones, and also unwinding from what has been a long, chaotic year. All those happy hormones can also trick you into living in the moment and blowing up your budget. So, what\u0026#39;s one tip that you have for listeners, Sara, to hopefully avoid doing this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, this is the time of year where everyone\u0026#39;s going out and spending a lot of money in the spirit of festivity, but talk to your loved ones and suggest alternate plans if the plans they are recommending cost a lot of money and are going to blow your budget. Let\u0026#39;s say your friends want to go out for an expensive dinner or your family insists on buying everybody a mountain of presents. It\u0026#39;s okay to say, \u0026#34;Listen, that\u0026#39;s just not in my budget right now.\u0026#34; Like you mentioned, giving people hugs for the holidays is their gift because you just spent so much money on moving. Don\u0026#39;t just complain. Offer up an alternative. Maybe you skip the dinner with your friends, but you meet up with them later on for a cheaper outing. Or maybe you talk with your family about doing a gift exchange where everybody draws up one name out of a hat and you only buy one gift and you set a hard budget for that gift. Your loved ones aren\u0026#39;t going to know that you\u0026#39;re struggling unless you speak up, and honestly, oftentimes once you speak up, you realize that you\u0026#39;re not the only one in your circle who\u0026#39;s struggling. So, other people want an excuse to take a break too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eElizabeth Ayoola:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI love that so much, and I think it takes a lot of vulnerability to be open and tell people that you just ain\u0026#39;t got it.

And this is a little bit off-topic, but I\u0026#39;ve been seeing things going around social media, like if you don\u0026#39;t show up to your friend\u0026#39;s birthday dinner... I\u0026#39;m sure there are a lot of December babies having some birthday things that you might have to pay for. Are you a bad friend? And putting that out there.

Now, doing this can help you stay focused and it can also give you the discipline that you need to ensure you start 2025 off strong financially. For example, with interest rates trickling down, you may be hoping to finally buy a home next year. Housing market is another story, but it\u0026#39;s going to be hard to do that if you blow your savings or hurt your credit score by maxing out your credit cards during the holidays.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI like that. I think it\u0026#39;s helpful to list a few things that you want to accomplish over the next few months so you\u0026#39;re not just thinking about the holidays now, but rather how the holidays might affect what you want to do next year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eElizabeth Ayoola:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExactly. And as someone who sometimes can fall prey to impulse spending, I know this task especially helps me.

But, let\u0026#39;s start by talking about what our listener describes as \u0026#34;amalgamating\u0026#34; their retirement accounts, which is known conversationally as rolling retirement accounts over. Before we dive in, we just want to reiterate that we are not investment advisors. Sean, do you want to give us a quick explanation of what a retirement account rollover looks like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. Rolling over a retirement account is when you take the retirement account from maybe an old employer and, you guessed it, roll it into the retirement account of your new employer or another retirement account you have, like an IRA.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two main ways that you can do a rollover. One is a direct rollover where your former retirement account administrator connects to your new administrator and transfers the funds from your old account to your new account. Or in the case of an IRA, the institution that manages your account transfers it to another IRA or retirement plan, like a 401k.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second way to do a rollover is called an indirect rollover or a 60-day rollover, where you get a check with the entire balance of your retirement account, and then you move it into the new account yourself. This second option can give you a little more flexibility with how you manage the rollover, but it does have some drawbacks, too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, let\u0026#39;s talk about those drawbacks. A big one is the cost. When you do an indirect rollover, the IRS automatically withholds 10% or 20% of your account balance depending on the type of account you have. And here\u0026#39;s the thing: you have to contribute the entire amount of your original cash balance to the new account or you face penalties, and that could put people in a pretty serious cash crunch.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd also, you are given a check with your retirement account balance, again, which can be a little scary to see and hold in your hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it\u0026#39;s your life savings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI want to give a quick example of what an indirect rollover looks like and this cash withholding from the IRS, because it can get a little confusing. For example, say I want to roll over a 401k balance of $10,000. The IRS withholds 20% or $2,000, so I only get a check for $8,000.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen, I need to come up with an additional $2,000 so I can deposit that original balance of $10,000 to the new retirement account, and if I don\u0026#39;t do that, if I can\u0026#39;t find that $2,000, I will face penalties from the IRS, which is not ideal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd we should say that you will get that withheld money back from the IRS, but not in time to replace it within the 60-day period.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, that sucks.

I had just been hired by NerdWallet, and I decided that it was time to get all of my retirement accounts from my former employers into one. I had two old ones from, like I said, two previous employers, and I wanted to move them into one financial institution, the one that was already holding my husband\u0026#39;s and my Roth IRAs.

I moved about $21,000 from a Roth 401k from a former employer into that Roth IRA that I said I had already had at that particular financial institution. I was able to roll that $21,000 in my old Roth 401k into my current Roth IRA because both investment accounts are after-tax, and that means I had already paid tax on the contributions, and the big benefit of that is I get to make withdrawals in retirement tax-free. Now, when you do rollovers, it is possible to roll over a traditional 401k into a Roth IRA, but you will have to pay taxes. Accounts have to be tax-compatible if you want to avoid paying penalties.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne thing that\u0026#39;s nice about rolling into a Roth IRA like you did is that you could ignore the contribution limits on these types of accounts. For the 2024 tax year, Roth IRA contributions are limited to $7,000 a year, or $8,000 a year for those who are 50 or older, but rollovers don\u0026#39;t count toward those contribution limits. And Jae, that\u0026#39;s why you were able to roll $21,000 from that Roth 401k into the Roth IRA in one go. Right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJae Bratton:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExactly. I was able to grow the balance in my Roth IRA while still playing by the rules that govern annual contribution limits, and the contribution limit for Roth IRAs is pretty low comparatively, especially when you compare it to a 401k. That was just a nice perk.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat\u0026#39;s pretty handy.

The process was just as simple. Again, that service that I used facilitated the rolling over process and made it pretty seamless. The only difference is that in this particular rollover, my 403(b) was traditional, not a Roth, meaning I hadn\u0026#39;t paid tax on those contributions yet. So, I rolled over the money from the 403(b) into a traditional IRA, not a Roth IRA, and whenever I go to withdraw those funds in retirement, I will have to pay taxes on that money then.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWas the second rollover direct or indirect?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJae Bratton:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt was direct, and that means that I did not have to pay any financial penalty on this particular rollover.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDid you find that to be easier than the indirect or not?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJae Bratton:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI don\u0026#39;t have experience doing an indirect rollover, so I can\u0026#39;t really compare, but I would just say overall the experience was fairly easy just because I had the assistance of this particular service to walk me through it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhy was it important to you to do these rollovers?

So, really for me, it was about simplifying my finances and having more of my finances in one place. Even if there are several different accounts, they are still under one roof, too, and that to me is administratively easier.

Having all your retirement funds in just one or two places makes it easier to manage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJae, can you speak to any other upsides that made this process appealing to you, even if it isn\u0026#39;t maybe the most straightforward sometimes?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eJae Bratton:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely. But before I do that, I want to go back to something that Sara was saying. Sara was talking about how her process of rolling over some of her old retirement accounts was not as easy as maybe my experience, and I want to say that mine was maybe a little bit easier than hers and maybe other people listening, because I only was rolling over two accounts. I\u0026#39;ve mentioned this before, but I used a service to help walk me through that process. And also, like Sara, I had a baseline knowledge of retirement accounts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, I say all that to say, I don\u0026#39;t want to put out this impression that rolling over retirement accounts is easy. It\u0026#39;s not. It is a complicated process made easier by some services, so I don\u0026#39;t want the listeners to think this is something that I can do in 15 minutes, and it\u0026#39;s not. The task of rolling over retirement accounts... We don\u0026#39;t have to do it, but there are benefits which I will talk about. This is just another example of how the onus is on us to make sure that we are making all the right decisions to safeguard our future in retirement.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt might sound counterintuitive, but weirdly, I\u0026#39;m okay with a retirement account rollover not being the easiest thing to do. It maybe shouldn\u0026#39;t be a 15-minute exchange to put all of your retirement savings from one account to the next. It\u0026#39;s a pretty significant amount of money oftentimes, and it\u0026#39;s a very serious allocation of funds for a very important goal, funding your retirement.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, but that being said, I could move tens of thousands of dollars into a brokerage account in two business days.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaybe that also isn\u0026#39;t great. I don\u0026#39;t know.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, but at the same time, you have to think about how democratized personal finance has become because of this technology, and you no longer have to be 100% knowledgeable, 100% connected, have... You have a guy behind a mahogany desk who can put in a phone call and he does stuff for you. You don\u0026#39;t have to live that life. You can be your average person who switched jobs a couple of times and just wants to keep their finances as organized as possible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOn the one hand, putting a little friction into some financial processes definitely prevents people from making mistakes or from spending money unnecessarily. At the same time, some processes...

For people who have held multiple jobs like myself, that\u0026#39;s reason enough. Many of us are going to have many jobs in our lifetime before we get to retirement, and without rolling over those accounts, you\u0026#39;ll have to pull money in retirement from multiple pots, and I wanted mine in one big one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second draw for rolling over retirement accounts is financial security. Many of us have had multiple jobs, and the more jobs we have, we\u0026#39;re increasing the likelihood that we\u0026#39;ll forget about that 401k that we\u0026#39;ve had with an employer we had 20 years ago and definitely don\u0026#39;t want to forget about that money. And lastly, I would say that your 401k with an employer usually has limited investment options that are preselected by that employer. If you\u0026#39;re not satisfied with those investment options or the fees attached to those funds, one way to get around that is to roll over your retirement funds into an IRA where you have much more freedom to select the investments that you want.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe should also note that funds in a 401k sometimes have lower expense ratios, which basically means they cost less to invest in, and if you like the funds you\u0026#39;re invested in but you\u0026#39;re considering consolidating your various retirement accounts, you may want to compare the expense ratios of the funds you\u0026#39;re invested in with your current retirement account and the funds you\u0026#39;d invest in through the IRA.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSean Pyles:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI want to turn now to a couple cons. Sara and Jae, I think you described some just through your experiences, but really one that stands out to me is that doing a rollover requires you to take action and be really on top of your finances. If you are in your prime working years, you\u0026#39;re maybe a little bit lazy, but decently organized, and you don\u0026#39;t want to have to wrangle your old accounts. Jae, going through what you described or Sara, what you described, might not be appealing, and I think that\u0026#39;s totally fair. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs long as people are making sure that the money in these accounts is actually invested, maybe check on it a few times a year, then it can be fine to leave old accounts where they are. Again, just do not forget about them. Though, as we\u0026#39;ve been talking about, people might want to think about consolidating accounts as they get closer to retirement so they have fewer accounts to manage, because in general, as we get older, it can be a good idea to consolidate accounts, so your finances are just easier to account for.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSara Rathner:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and I\u0026#39;ll also say if you\u0026#39;re in your prime working years and you\u0026#39;re decently organized, it might not even be laziness.
