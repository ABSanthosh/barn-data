  "text": "Some companies treat their shareholders like actual owners, offering discounts and rewards on common products and services. A shareholder is someone who holds one or more shares of a public or private corporation.Most shareholder perks involve sharing dividends, which can be a good indicator of a company’s financial well-being. In recent decades, dividend investing has become a popular investment strategy – and can be a steady additional source of income for many – but dividends aren’t guaranteedCompanies Currently Offering Perks And RewardsWhile shareholder perks aren't what they once were, most large companies still have something to offer their shareholders.You can typically find a list of shareholder perks in the investor information section of a company’s website; however, we've compiled the following list of 10 companies currently offering shareholder perks, discounts, and rewards for being a partial owner.  3M (MMM)3M, shortened from the original name Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, is a technology company that manufactures industrial, safety, and consumer products.The company offers some shareholders gift boxes during the holidays (for a small fee), which are known to include a variety of 3M products sold at a fraction of their original cost.However, gift boxes can’t be requested; you have to receive a brochure with a promo code, then enter the promo code online.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)You’re likely already familiar with Amazon – the world's largest online retailer. Amazon shareholders can redeem a $5 Amazon gift card on orders over $20 when at least 10 shares are owned.At the time of writing in March 2024, 10 shares would set you back $1,789.30.This is offered through ShareClub.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Berkshire Hathaway is a multinational conglomerate holding company run by Warren Buffett. The company owns more than 60 private and public companies, like Apple, making it one of the largest companies in the world.Berkshire Hathaway shareholders convene annually in Omaha, Nebraska for a weekend-long shareholder meeting where they can access special discounts on items like specialty candy, furniture, and other items only available at the convention.Carnival Corporation (CCL)Carnival Cruise Line, a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation, is an international cruise line best known for its Caribbean cruises. It’s one of few companies that maintains a variety of shareholder perks and rewards, including onboard credits for the following:$250 USD per stateroom when sailing 14 days or more.$100 USD per stateroom when sailing seven to 13 days.$50 USD per stateroom when sailing six days or less.These benefits are currently in effect and will remain so until December 31, 2024. However, they are only available to shareholders with a minimum of 100 shares of Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc. At $17.08 a share, 100 shares would cost you $1,708.Coca-Cola (KO)We all know and love the Coca-Cola brand, which is the largest beverage manufacturer and distributer in the world.Shareholders receive dividend payouts quarterly and may also receive discounts on certain products, merchandise, and access to shareholder events.Ford Motor Company (F)Ford previously offered one of the more note-worthy shareholder perks: discounts on select new Ford car models for those who hold at least 100 shares in the company. However, that discount program ended in 2022.Now, as a special thanks to Ford shareholders, the Investor Relations Department offers a “Friends and Family” Special Vehicle Pricing Privilege (also referred to as the X-Plan). To qualify, you:Must currently own common stock shares of Ford.Must own a minimum of 100 shares of company stock.Need to have held the minimum shares for the past six months or more.If you meet this criteria, you can contact the Investor Relations team at 1-800-555-5259 or read more on Ford’s investor page.Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG)IHG is a global hospitality company that owns several well-known hospitality brands, including Regent, Hotel Indigo, Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, and Avid. Through a private website with controlled access, IGH shareholders can book hotel stays for discounted prices. Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH)Known for its fun, laid-back cruising ambiance, Norwegian Cruise Lines is another leading cruise company that offers trips across the globe. As a shareholder, you receive discounts on the Norwegian Cruise Line, as well as Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands.Shareholder benefits include:$250 USD onboard credit per stateroom when sailing 15 days or more.$100 USD onboard credit per stateroom when sailing seven to 14 days.$50 USD onboard credit per stateroom when sailing six days or less.These benefits are only available to investors with a minimum of 100 shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd at the time of sailing. At $20.70 a share, 100 shares would set you back $2,070.Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCL)Similarly, Royal Caribbean Group is a global cruise company with a fleet of 60 ships that travel to over 800 destinations worldwide. If you own at least 100 shares of Royal Caribbean Group at the time of sailing, your benefits as of 2024 include:$1,000 USD onboard credit per stateroom on a World Cruise.$250 USD onboard credit per stateroom when sailing 14 nights or more.$100 USD onboard credit per stateroom when sailing seven to 13 nights.$50 USD onboard credit per stateroom when sailing five nights or less.At $136.03 a share, 100 shares would cost you $13,603, not an insignificant sum. Willamette Valley Vineyards (WVVI)If you enjoy a good bottle of wine, this one’s for you. Willamette Valley Vineyards is a small, publicly-traded company that sustainably produces a variety of wines from five vineyards across the state of Oregon.It's one of a few companies to offer a a variety of shareholder benefits, listed on its Ownership and Benefits page. Perks include:A 25% discount on bottle purchasesPriority access to limited-production winesComplimentary wine tastings for you and three guests once a monthInvitations to owner-exclusive events and experiencesNote that you must own at least 300 shares of Preferred or Common Stock in order to claim Ownership status at Willamette Valley Vineyards. At $5.16 a share, 300 shares would cost $1,548 total.*Note: All share cost estimates were recorded at the time the article was written.Are Shareholders Perks Worth It? The value of shareholder perks depends on your individual preferences and reasons for investing. Dividends are, of course, more readily available and, depending on the success of the company, offer a more consistent return on your investment.While extra rewards may be tempting, be sure to do your own research on any company you’re considering investing in. That includes paying close attention to the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats before purchasing.Popular companies not included in the list above that pay out quarterly or annual dividends include AT\u0026T, Costco, Microsoft, Starbucks, Verizon Communications, and just about any other large cap stock. Why? They’re typically more mature investments with less volatility, which means they’re able to distribute more profits to their shareholders.On the other hand, if you travel frequently and are likely to use any of the hotels owned by IHG, you may benefit by growing into shareholder status with them. Likewise, if you’re a fan of cruises and take even one each year, you could absolutely save money by being a shareholder.Remember that shareholder rewards, benefits, discounts, or other perks should never be the sole reason you choose to invest in a company. Always check the current stock price before you place a trade to purchase shares of a company.And, if you’re completely new to investing, here’s our advice on finding the best way to get started.",
