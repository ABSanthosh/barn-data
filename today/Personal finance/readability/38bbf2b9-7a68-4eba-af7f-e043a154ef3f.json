Your total cost will include the price of the garbage disposal and labor for installation.Factors that affect the overall cost of garbage disposal installation include the disposal’s size, any special features, complexity of the job and who does the work.How garbage disposal size affects costDisposals come in different sizes and motor powers. Garbage disposals intended for residential use range from 1/3 horsepower (HP) to 1 HP or more. Larger, more powerful units cost more, but they can handle more waste, are often quieter and are less likely to jam.Horsepower ratingAverage cost1/3 HPUse: light-duty, low capacity.Best for: 1-2 people.$65 to $210.1/2 HP Use: light- to regular-duty jobs.Best for: 2-4 people.$85 to $270.5/8 to 3/4 HP Use: medium-duty jobs.Best for: 3-5 people.$100 to $425.1 to 1¼ HPUse: heavy-duty jobs.Best for: 4 or more people.$150 to $515.Source: The Home Depot and Lowe’s Home Improvement.Garbage disposal features that may increase costMaterials. Many disposals are made of aluminum, which costs less but is more likely to corrode over time. Stainless steel models are more durable and last longer, but they cost much more — usually $400 to $1,100 according to Angi.Feed type. Disposals come as batch feed or continuous feed, which is the most common. Continuous feed remains active and demolishes food scraps as they’re fed down the drain. Batch feed only grinds waste when a drain cover is in place, making it safer. Of the two, batch feed disposals are more expensive.Noise reduction. Some disposals have design elements to reduce excess vibration and noise. These particular models can come with a higher price tag.Auto-reverse. An auto-reverse feature on some models automatically reverses the grinding components to loosen food and prevent jams. These models tend to cost more.Grind stages. Basic models only have one grind stage, but higher-end models can have as many as three separate stages to handle hard food like bones or corn cobs.Power cord. Some disposals don’t come with a power cord. If you have to buy one separately, plan for about $20 or less.Protection plans. Less expensive garbage disposals may come with a one- to three-year limited manufacturer’s warranty. More expensive models can have warranties up to 10 years. Retailers may try to sell you an additional protection plan, which we think probably isn’t necessary for a product with an average lifespan of a decade.Labor costs for garbage disposal replacement For a standard garbage disposal installation, which takes about an hour, expect labor costs of around $50 to $100 per hour. This typically includes removing and hauling away the old unitInstallation complexity can affect garbage disposal costIf your new unit is similar in size and style to the old one, the installation may be quick and simple. However, extra costs can arise in certain circumstances. Plumbing adjustments are necessary.Electrical upgrades, such as installing a new outlet, are required.The previous unit is difficult to remove or caused damage that needs repair.The additional time necessary to address such situations can increase labor costs by $100 or more. Also, some areas may require permits for electrical or plumbing work, which can result in fees of $50 to $500 or more.Can you save with DIY?If you’re confident in your plumbing and electrical skills, you could save on labor by installing a garbage disposal yourself. Many disposals are designed for DIY installation under standard sinks.However, the cost of hiring a professional is likely worth the time you will save and peace of mind, especially if you aren’t familiar with garbage disposal installation. DIY might save on labor costs upfront, but a mistake that causes a leaking pipe or faulty wiring could lead to more expensive repairs down the road. Signs you need to replace your garbage disposal When your garbage disposal stops working, it can be a major kitchen headache. In that instance, you know it’s time for a replacement. But even before a disposal quits, these may be signs that you need to replace it:Frequent clogging or jamming.Persistent odors that don't go away with cleaning.Leaks beneath the sink or around the unit.Unusual or loud noises.Persistent slow draining.Inconsistent operation or frequent need to use a reset button.When properly maintained, garbage disposals last about 10 years. For an older unit, replacement is often more cost-effective than ongoing repairs.Tips to save on garbage disposal replacementGet multiple quotes. Local plumbers and tradespeople may offer different rates for the same work.Buy the unit yourself. Instead of relying on a plumber to select a garbage disposal, shop around. Home improvement stores do have sales on garbage disposals. You may get a better deal and more selection if you purchase yourself.Check for bundled services. Home improvement stores often offer installation (at an additional cost) when you buy a garbage disposal from them. Installation is usually a flat-rate for standard installs, so you know ahead of time what you will be paying. For example, according to Home Depot, the average cost for installation is $189, with a range of $97 to $339. Some stores, such as Lowe’s, provide the cost of a garbage disposal’s installation when you purchase it online.Match the old unit. Choosing the same horsepower and mount type simplifies installation.Paying for garbage disposal replacementYou may have money saved to cover the expense of replacing a garbage disposal, but if not here are some possible options.Credit cardA credit card can be an easy way to pay for lower-cost projects that you intend to pay off quickly, but credit cards tend to have higher interest rates than other financing options. When used responsibly though, credit cards can come with great benefits, such as 0% introductory APR periods that allow you to avoid interest for a set number of months or rewards so you earn cash back, travel or points. If you buy your garbage disposal from a home improvement store, you will probably be offered a store credit card (if you don’t already have one). Before you accept that offer, compare to make sure you choose one of the best credit cards for home improvements. Personal loanMany banks, credit unions and online lenders offer personal loans, with amounts usually from $1,000 to $50,000, although you can find lenders who will go as low as $250. You receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. APRs are fixed and can range from 6% to 36%, with the lower rates typically going to borrowers with better credit.Home equity loan or HELOCHome equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) don’t make sense for something as small as garbage disposal installation alone, but they could be an option if you want to pay for several home improvement projects at once. Perhaps you intend to save on labor costs by hiring a plumber to install a garbage disposal, remodel the kitchen, replace a toilet, fix a leaky faucet and put in a new water heater, all at the same time.Home equity loans and HELOCs tend to have lower interest rates than other types of financing, as well as possible tax benefits. Both options use your home as collateral.Home equity loan. This may be a good option if you won’t need ongoing access to money for additional home improvements. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically five to 30 years.Home equity line of credit. HELOCs work more like a credit card, so you have ongoing access to money as you need it. You usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit and pay interest only on the HELOC amount you use. Most lenders have an option for interest-only payments during that time, after which you’re required to pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. Planning ahead to replace your garbage disposalUsually, replacing a garbage disposal is a straightforward job—but there can also be surprises. Understanding the key factors that influence cost can help you avoid unexpected expenses. From choosing the right size and features to weighing DIY versus professional help, a little planning can go a long way.If you’re facing other plumbing upgrades or bundling home improvement tasks, consider getting multiple quotes or exploring financing options to manage costs efficiently. With the right disposal and installation plan, you’ll be back to a clean, functional kitchen in no time.Frequently asked questionsIs it worth repairing a garbage disposal instead of replacing it?If your garbage disposal is relatively new and the issue is minor — such as a clog, jam or loose connection — a repair could make sense and cost less than $100. However, for units nearing the end of their average 10-year lifespan or those with more serious mechanical or electrical failures, replacement is often the more cost-effective and reliable option.How long does it take to replace a garbage disposal?A professional can typically replace a standard garbage disposal in about an hour, assuming no complications. DIY installations may take longer, especially for those unfamiliar with plumbing or electrical work. Complex setups involving new wiring, outlet installation or plumbing adjustments could extend the job by several hours.",
