A lot of appliances you use daily (or even forget about entirely) are designed to never turn off unless you make them.The good news? You don’t need to buy solar panels or take cold showers to see a difference in your bill. Often, all it takes is flipping one setting or switch. Here are seven appliances quietly driving up your power bill, and the one switch on each that can instantly save you real money.1. Your Dryer’s Heat SettingThat “High Heat” cycle is costing you more than you think. It’s quick, yes, but it guzzles energy. Flip the setting to “Low Heat” or “Eco Mode.” It’ll take a few extra minutes, but you’ll slash the wattage. Bonus: Your clothes will last longer, too.2. Your Dishwasher’s Drying CycleMany dishwashers default to “Heated Dry” at the end of each cycle. That feature alone can tack on hundreds of extra kilowatt-hours annually. Turn off “Heated Dry” and crack the door open when the cycle ends. Your dishes will air dry for free.3. Your Refrigerator’s Temperature DialMost fridges are colder than necessary. Dialing your fridge from 34°F up to 37°F can reduce energy usage without spoiling your food. Same for the freezer—0°F is ideal. Anything lower, and you’re basically refrigerating your utility bill.4. Your Gaming Console or Smart TV’s Power ModeMany modern consoles and smart TVs stay in “Standby Mode,” quietly draining power around the clock. Dig into the settings and flip to “Energy Saving Mode” or “Full Power Down.” You won’t lose saved games or show history, but you will stop the constant draw.Image by PlanetCare5. Your Washing Machine’s Water TemperatureUnless your clothes are covered in grease or blood, you don’t need hot water. “Cold Wash” mode uses a fraction of the energy and detergents today are designed to clean effectively at low temps. Flip the dial and lower your power and water heating costs in one go.6. Your HVAC Fan SettingIf your HVAC fan is set to “On” instead of “Auto,” it’s running 24/7,  even when heating or cooling isn’t needed. That’s like leaving your car idling all day. Flip the fan setting to “Auto,” so it only runs when actively adjusting your home’s temperature.7. Your Water Heater’s ThermostatMost water heaters come cranked up to 140°F—hot enough to scald and definitely hotter than necessary. Dial it back to 120°F. You won’t notice a difference in your shower, but your power company will notice you using way less.Let the Savings Roll InThese switches might seem small, but their impact isn’t. Making a few adjustments to your appliance settings could cut your monthly utility bill by up to 50%, especially when combined. And unlike dramatic upgrades, these changes cost nothing but a few seconds of your time. The best part? You don’t need to live in the dark or freeze to save money. With the right settings, your home can stay comfortable and affordable.Which appliance setting do you think is quietly costing you the most, and what switch are you flipping first?Read More:Simple Strategies to Reduce Your Electricity Usage10 Utility Bill Savings You Can Put Into Place Right NowRiley is an Arizona native with over nine years of writing experience.
