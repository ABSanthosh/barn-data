  "text": "Happy New Year everyone! I hope you’re enjoying the time off and doing some reflecting. I’ve returned to San Francisco and am ready to relax some more! Now that I've shared my 2024 year in review, I wanted to share my goals and resolutions for 2025. Although 2024 was a great year, I still have many areas of improvement. I executed most of my 2024 goals, but failed to do the following: Produce 36 podcasts (I only produced 30) Help my wife get a job (I couldn't because she didn't want one, so I went out and got one) Write a new lullaby for my daughter after writing Cutie Baby for my son (forgot about this one, but I still can do it) My theme for 2024 was “One last year of intense focus.” I wrote in my 2024 goals post: Fatigue has set in, reminiscent of 2011 when I pondered leaving investment banking for good. That burnout prompted a much-needed change of pace. Ironically, a day job is much easier than being a stay-at-home parent! Perhaps it's a mid-life crisis at 46, where I sense my body slowing down, and time is slipping away faster than ever. The urgency to maximize the remaining years of robust health is palpable. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this pace, hence my theme. Theme for 2025: Return to Simple Living I want to return to the basics of living a simple, early retirement lifestyle. Sitting on a beach in Laie, Oahu, reflecting on the year, I was reminded of what a good life means to me: health, freedom, family, and friends. Riches, fame, or status weren’t top of mind. One of the great things about Hawaii is that all beaches are public. Even the poorest person can enjoy the same shoreline as a billionaire with an oceanfront mansion. As I walked along the beach at 8 a.m. in December, wearing just shorts, I thought about how incredible it was to bask in the free warmth of the sun. Sharing the experience with excited children dancing around and a loving wife made it all the more special. I didn’t need a lot of money to be happy. However, returning to a simple life won’t come without effort. To live by my theme for 2025, my #1 goal is the following: Main 2025 Goal: Remain Unemployed / Semi-Retired After trying part-time consulting for four months, I realized how much I dislike meetings, commuting, and being told what to do. While it was valuable to see firsthand how hard people in the startup world work, I’ve confirmed that it’s not the right fit for me at this stage in my life. The only way I'd return to work is if I got an exceptional offer from a promising AI company, with significant autonomy and enormous upside. But I assign only a 1% chance of that happening since unicorns aren't real. To get something great, you've got to go out and take it. With my liquidity back to comfortable levels, I’ve decided to stop searching for employment altogether. Staying unemployed / semi-retired simplifies my life. The only meetings I’ll attend are the ones I choose—perhaps one or two calls a week at most. Yes, earning a lot of money and gaining status in society can be appealing. However, I’m determined to beat back these desires so I can be as free as possible. Without the obligations of work, I’ll have more time to write, play sports, exercise, and spend uninterrupted moments with my family. Laie, Oahu, December 29, 2024 at 7:30 am Family Goals for 2025 Family will always be my top priority for as long as I live. Fatherhood, which began for me in 2017, is still a relatively new journey and the most challenging role to navigate. I’m committed to doing my best to foster a strong, healthy relationship with my children as they grow. I’ve come to see that some of the most troubled people I’ve encountered experienced above-average levels of childhood trauma, which includes neglect, emotional and physical abuse, accidents, rancorous divorces, death of a parent, and addiction. I know this because I’ve had the privilege of having tens of thousands of folks from all walks of life comment on Financial Samurai since 2009. And some of them have opened up about their backgrounds. My goal is to minimize such wounds for my kids while maximizing unconditional love, learning, and joy in their lives. 1) Spend more time traveling now that both kids are over 5 I’ve always disliked flying, especially with young kids who are unruly and won’t remember their travels. But now that both of my children are over 5, they’re potty-trained and mostly self-sufficient. Best of all, they’re at an age where they’ll actually remember the trips we take, making the experience much more rewarding. For 2025, I plan to do at least two of these trips: Spend a month in Honolulu while they attend summer school. Stay in Taipei for a month and attend Mandarin immersion summer school, and if that goes well, take an adventure to Beijing for a couple of weeks. Go to Tahoe for at least 5 nights during the winter so the kids can get better at skiing I grew up living in Zambia, the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia before coming to America for high school. Later, I spent 13 years working in international equities, which had me constantly traveling. I’d like my children to travel so they can experience different cultures, develop a greater appreciation for what they have, and become better communicators. 2) Read with the kids for at least 15 minutes a day, five days a week One of my goals is to cultivate a love of reading in my kids. The first step is reading to them consistently, at least five days a week. Next, I’d like them to read to me for 15 minutes daily, five days a week. Finally, I want to find books they genuinely enjoy, so they’ll want to read independently. Growing up, I loved reading Hardy Boys and The Great Brain series. But when I transitioned to Choose Your Own Adventure books, my mom wouldn’t let me read them. That restriction killed my joy for reading; I rebelled by refusing to read what I could have for a while. To encourage my kids to enjoy reading, I’ll lead by example and read more myself. Once they enjoy reading on their own, they can learn an endless amount of things. 3) Teach the kids how to play pickleball The aftercare pickleball sessions at their school filled up quickly, and private lessons cost $140 per hour. As a 4.5-level pickleball player with patience and 3 years of teaching high school tennis, I’ve decided to teach them myself. I’ve already taught them how to bike and swim, so this will be another fun skill to add. Pickleball is easier for young kids to pick up than tennis and should be more fun. Once they’ve learned the basics, I’ll teach them tennis as well. I don’t expect them to become great athletes or win college scholarships. However, knowing how to play a sport can make life more enjoyable and social. I plan to spend 30–60 minutes every weekend practicing pickleball with my kids. Playing softball during the pandemic for three years lifted my spirits. It also introduced me to new friends, including some I now play poker with regularly. Launching rockets during the pandemic helped save my sanity 4) Volunteer six times at my kids’ school Being part of a community is wonderful. In 2024, I thoroughly enjoyed volunteering at my children’s school. It was rewarding to see my kids during the day, connect with other parents, and get to know the staff. I think my kids will appreciate seeing their dad surprise them on occasion as well, and perhaps instill in them the spirit of volunteering in the future. Personal Goals for 2025 If I can do two or three things well a year, I feel it's a good year. I made the most of my final year as a stay-at-home father in 2024, while focusing on strengthening our finances. Now that both kids are in school full-time, I no longer identify as a stay-at-home parent. Moving forward, I’ll embrace my identity as a writer. 1) Market my new book—and try not to stress about its performance After over two years of hard work, I’m thrilled to release my second book with Portfolio Penguin in May 2025. Like my first book, Buy This Not That, it focuses on personal finance. I’ll share all the details by March 2025. With Buy This Not That, I poured a lot of energy into making it a bestseller—and succeeded. It’s satisfying to know I’ll always be a national bestselling author. However, the relentless marketing took a toll on my happiness, as I much prefer writing to promoting. This time, I’ll still participate in podcasts and interviews to discuss the book, as it is my commitment to Portfolio Penguin, but my main focus will be enjoying the process. Making a national bestseller list is no longer a goal. I’ve found peace in the mindset of: “If you want to read the book to improve your financial life, fantastic! If not, that’s fine too.” This approach has worked well for Financial Samurai, where I avoid heavy social media or marketing and write simply because I enjoy it. However, promoting a book while maintaining a low-key lifestyle is a contradictory act. Threading this needle will be a difficult challenge. 2) Protect my 1:30 PM–3 PM nap window Few things bring me more joy than a proper nap after lunch. Whether it’s 30 minutes or a glorious hour-long snooze, naps recharge me. For them to be truly effective, I need at least a 1.5-hour window—this eliminates stress about oversleeping or rushing to fall asleep. In 2024, I overbooked this time slot with activities like tennis, pickleball, and long lunches. While enjoyable, they often left me squeezing in short naps after 3:30 PM, which threw off my evenings and bedtime. Frankly, 2024 was overwhelming from an activities standpoint and I want to do less. Naps improve my energy for the afternoon and evening with my kids, boost my mood, and enhance creativity. Plus, studies suggest napping lowers blood pressure, reduces heart disease risk, and slows brain aging. Who wouldn’t want those benefits? In 2025, unless I’ve slept in or it’s an unmissable reunion, my 1:30 PM–3 PM window will be sacred nap time. 3) Lift weights at least once a week for 45 minutes Strength training needs to become a consistent part of my routine. My goal is to lift weights at least once a week for 45 minutes, focusing on building my shoulders, chest, and back. Although I’d like to lift two or three times a week, I suspect I’ll be too tired after sessions to fully engage with my kids or play sports. For now, once a week is a manageable starting point alongside my regular tennis and pickleball schedule. If I succeed, lifting weights 52 times in 2025 will be eight times more than I did in 2024. 4) Be OK with the occasional tardiness One of my biggest pet peeves is being late. It is disrespectful to the person waiting and often leads to unnecessary stress and danger, especially when rushing through traffic to make up for lost time. It can also be a waste of money if you're paying for a time-limited activity or lesson. I think this aversion to tardiness is hardwired into me. My father, likely influenced by his military background, was always punctual. During my 13 years in finance, hosting countless analyst, management, and client meetings reinforced the habit—being late was simply not an option when so many people depended on me. If I ever was late, it felt deeply embarrassing. Unfortunately, this obsession with punctuality has caused some tension with my wife. My goal now is to be more relaxed about occasional tardiness. I’ll also step up to help get the kids ready, so we can avoid rushing as much as possible. For instance, I initially aimed to get the kids to school on time 100% of the year. I drive 95% of the time so the last mile responsibility is on me. This goal mirrors my decade-long obsession with writing three posts a week on Financial Samurai—a stretch goal that, in hindsight, isn’t necessary. After learning that some families have 20–40 tardies annually without any consequences, I’ve decided to ease up. Allowing for a late day once a month serves as a healthy pressure-release valve for all of us. And if we happen to be late a second time in a month, no big deal! 5) Write shorter, more lifestyle-focused posts on Financial Samurai I have a tendency to dive deep into topics, often writing posts exceeding 2,000 words (this post is 3,350 words). While I enjoy being thorough, I recognize that attention spans are shrinking. Readers appreciate concise, punchy content that gets to the point. Plus, longer articles take more time, which goes against my theme for the year of relaxing more. In 2025, my goal is to write posts averaging 1,250 words. This shift will allow me to deliver value more quickly while still maintaining my voice. Shorter posts will also be easier for readers to digest, making the content more engaging overall. I’m also dropping my rigid commitment to publishing three posts a week. Instead, I will write whenever I want, to ease the pressure I put on myself. Specific Financial Goals for 2025 Since Financial Samurai is a personal finance site, let me share three key personal finance goals that align with my desire to simplify life. 1) Sell a Rental Property Before 2023, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy another rental property—and technically, I kept that promise. However, instead of selling my previous home, I chose to rent it out for cash flow after blowing up $150,000 of passive income. I remain bullish on San Francisco real estate, thanks to the tech and AI boom generating immense wealth for tens of thousands of people. We’ve also got a new mayor who should reduce government corruption and improve policies for its citizens. However, after a year of renting out the property, the tenants have given notice, and I’ve decided not to search for new ones. With the NASDAQ up ~30% in 2024, I’m optimistic that the Spring 2025 Bay Area housing market will be strong. Additionally, I’ve noticed more flexibility from real estate agents offering performance-based commission structures. As a result, I plan to sell this beautiful ocean-view property, which I purchased in mid-2020, in 2025. The timing feels right to simplify my life. Selling the property also provides an opportunity to earn up to $500,000 in tax-free profits, as I’ve lived in it for at least two out of the past five years. Ironically, owning a fourth rental property in San Francisco for a year was relatively hassle-free. The only issue was a kitchen faucet repair—likely caused by the tenant yanking out the nozzle and breaking the hose. Still, I had envisioned keeping this home, which we enjoyed during the pandemic, until my kids were grown. Too bad for them the older I get, the less I want to manage properties. 2) Reinvest 80% of online “funny money” into risk assets My love affair with real estate started in 2003 when I reinvested 100% of my dot-com bubble gains into a San Francisco condo. While the first internet bubble popped, my condo’s value held steady and even grew. Similarly, I view online income as “funny money” because I’d happily write for free. Further, I’m not sure the income will last. This mindset motivates me to reinvest most of the net profits into assets that generate passive income. I'm also OK to take more risk with this income because it doesn't seem real, unlike my arduous day job income in banking. However, I also want to enjoy life over the next three years. That’s why I plan to allocate 20% of this income to cover the gap between my expenses and current passive income. The remaining 80% will be reinvested. With some luck and disciplined investing, I hope to hit my target of an additional $80,000 in passive income or an additional $2 million in investments by December 31, 2027. 3) Invest $100,000 each in commercial real estate and AI companies I don’t want to depend solely on luck to get me to my goals. Strategic allocation is key. If I successfully sell my San Francisco rental, I expect to net between $1.2M–$1.6M after taxes, commissions, fees, prep work, and mortgage payoff. With these proceeds, I plan to reinvest: $100,000 in commercial real estate: This aligns with the asset class I’m exiting but allows me to diversify into fully passive real estate investments. Commercial real estate has lagged stocks since 2023, but historically, the two asset classes are correlated. I believe it’s due for a rebound. $100,000 in private AI companies: I believe in the AI movement and want exposure to its potential growth. My time working at a startup showed me how hard and fast these companies move. Since private companies stay private longer now, investing early offers the chance to capture significant upside. The more I invest in artificial intelligence, the less concern I have for my children's futures. Investing more in private companies given they are staying private for longer With $1M –$1.4M remaining, I’ll likely: Allocate a 70% to the S\u0026P 500 and tech stocks I’ve held for over a decade. My reasoning: If I’m not willing to sell these holdings, I should be willing to buy them. Ideally, I’ll invest after a market dip once the house sale closes. Invest 30% in Treasury bonds, especially if the 10-year yield remains above 4.5%. Maybe I’ll YOLO and buy a new car too Once the sale is finalized, I’ll write a detailed post on how I plan to allocate the proceeds. If you want to invest in commercial real estate and venture capital, check out Fundrise. I’ve invested $300,000+ with them so far and will continue to dollar-cost average in both categories all year to boost exposure. Fundrise is also a long-time sponsor of Financial Samurai. My Fundrise investment dashboard 4) Build My Children's Investment Accounts Investing for my children feels like starting a new game with the advantage of decades of experience and knowledge. Beyond their UGMA accounts, I want to focus on building their Roth IRAs as well. Their 529 accounts are at levels where I no longer want to aggressively contribute to them. Since their earnings are minimal, their income will fall well below the standard deduction for 2025, which is $15,000. This means their earned income won’t be subject to taxes. A practical income target would be $7,000, matching the Roth IRA contribution limit for 2025. What a benefit to be able to contribute tax-free income and let it grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free. The goal isn’t just to help them earn money in a tax-efficient way for future financial security. More importantly, it’s about instilling a strong work ethic and teaching them how saving and investing work. These lessons will lay the foundation for good personal finance habits, making them self-sufficient adults. When that day comes, their mother and I can breathe a little easier! A Return to Easy Living in 2025 For Sure I’ll turn 48 in June 2025, which is starting to feel old. It’s a good reminder to slow down and savor life, especially now that we’ve “run up the score” during this incredible bull market. My hope is that the good times continue, allowing me to reach my financial target by December 31, 2027, while also spending and giving more freely. However, even if the market doesn’t cooperate, I plan to stay unemployed. At this stage, trying to offset investment losses with active income feels futile. I have just 11 and 13 more years, respectively, until my son and daughter may leave the house potentially for good. I know this time will fly by, so I’m determined to make the most of it.

And some of them have opened up about their backgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal is to minimize such wounds for my kids while maximizing unconditional love, learning, and joy in their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-1-spend-more-time-traveling-now-that-both-kids-are-over-5\"\u003e1) Spend more time traveling now that both kids are over 5\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve always disliked flying, especially with young kids who are unruly and won’t remember their travels. But now that both of my children are over 5, they’re potty-trained and mostly self-sufficient.

The first step is reading to them consistently, at least five days a week. Next, I’d like them to read to me for 15 minutes daily, five days a week. Finally, I want to find books they genuinely enjoy, so they’ll want to read independently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing up, I loved reading \u003cem\u003eHardy Boys\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Great Brain\u003c/em\u003e series. But when I transitioned to \u003cem\u003eChoose Your Own Adventure\u003c/em\u003e books, my mom wouldn’t let me read them. That restriction killed my joy for reading; I rebelled by refusing to read what I could have for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo encourage my kids to enjoy reading, I’ll lead by example and read more myself.

As a 4.5-level pickleball player with patience and 3 years of teaching high school tennis, I’ve decided to teach them myself. I’ve already taught them how to bike and swim, so this will be another fun skill to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePickleball is easier for young kids to pick up than tennis and should be more fun. Once they’ve learned the basics, I’ll teach them tennis as well.

In 2024, I thoroughly enjoyed volunteering at my children’s school. It was rewarding to see my kids during the day, connect with other parents, and get to know the staff. I think my kids will appreciate seeing their dad surprise them on occasion as well, and perhaps instill in them the spirit of volunteering in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-personal-goals-for-2025\"\u003ePersonal Goals for 2025\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf I can do two or three things well a year, I feel it\u0026#39;s a good year.

Now that both kids are in school full-time, I no longer identify as a stay-at-home parent. Moving forward, I’ll embrace my identity as a writer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-1-market-my-new-book-and-try-not-to-stress-about-its-performance\"\u003e1) Market my new book—and try not to stress about its performance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter over two years of hard work, I’m thrilled to release my second book with Portfolio Penguin in May 2025. Like my first book, \u003cem\u003eBuy This Not That\u003c/em\u003e, it focuses on personal finance. I’ll share all the details by March 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/btnt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBuy This Not That\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, I poured a lot of energy into making it a bestseller—and succeeded. It’s satisfying to know I’ll always be a national bestselling author. However, the relentless marketing took a toll on my happiness, as I much prefer writing to promoting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, I’ll still participate in podcasts and interviews to discuss the book, as it is my commitment to Portfolio Penguin, but my main focus will be enjoying the process. Making a national bestseller list is no longer a goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve found peace in the mindset of: \u003cem\u003e“If you want to read the book to improve your financial life, fantastic! If not, that’s fine too.”\u003c/em\u003e This approach has worked well for Financial Samurai, where I avoid heavy social media or marketing and write simply because I enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, promoting a book while maintaining a low-key lifestyle is a contradictory act. Threading this needle will be a difficult challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-2-protect-my-1-30-pm-3-pm-nap-window\"\u003e2) Protect my 1:30 PM–3 PM nap window\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFew things bring me more joy than a proper nap after lunch. Whether it’s 30 minutes or a glorious hour-long snooze, naps recharge me. For them to be truly effective, I need at least a 1.5-hour window—this eliminates stress about oversleeping or rushing to fall asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2024, I overbooked this time slot with activities like tennis, pickleball, and long lunches. While enjoyable, they often left me squeezing in short naps after 3:30 PM, which threw off my evenings and bedtime. Frankly, 2024 was \u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/overwhelmed-not-bored-unexpected-challenge-of-retirement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eoverwhelming from an activities standpoint\u003c/a\u003e and I want to do less. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNaps improve my energy for the afternoon and evening with my kids, boost my mood, and enhance creativity. Plus, studies suggest napping lowers blood pressure, reduces heart disease risk, and slows brain aging. Who wouldn’t want those benefits?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2025, unless I’ve slept in or it’s an unmissable reunion, my 1:30 PM–3 PM window will be sacred nap time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-3-lift-weights-at-least-once-a-week-for-45-minutes\"\u003e3) Lift weights at least once a week for 45 minutes\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStrength training needs to become a consistent part of my routine. My goal is to lift weights at least once a week for 45 minutes, focusing on building my shoulders, chest, and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’d like to lift two or three times a week, I suspect I’ll be too tired after sessions to fully engage with my kids or play sports. For now, once a week is a manageable starting point alongside my regular tennis and pickleball schedule. If I succeed, lifting weights 52 times in 2025 will be eight times more than I did in 2024. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-4-be-ok-with-the-occasional-tardiness\"\u003e4) Be OK with the occasional tardiness \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my biggest pet peeves is being late. It is disrespectful to the person waiting and often leads to unnecessary stress and danger, especially when rushing through traffic to make up for lost time. It can also be a waste of money if you\u0026#39;re paying for a time-limited activity or lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think this aversion to tardiness is hardwired into me. My father, likely influenced by his military background, was always punctual. During my 13 years in finance, hosting countless analyst, management, and client meetings reinforced the habit—being late was simply not an option when so many people depended on me. If I ever was late, it felt deeply embarrassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this obsession with punctuality has caused some tension with my wife. My goal now is to be more relaxed about occasional tardiness. I’ll also step up to help get the kids ready, so we can avoid rushing as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, I initially aimed to get the kids to school on time 100% of the year. I drive 95% of the time so the last mile responsibility is on me. This goal mirrors my decade-long obsession with writing three posts a week on Financial Samurai—a stretch goal that, in hindsight, isn’t necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter learning that some families have 20–40 tardies annually without any consequences, I’ve decided to ease up. Allowing for a late day once a month serves as a healthy pressure-release valve for all of us. And if we happen to be late a second time in a month, no big deal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-5-write-shorter-more-lifestyle-focused-posts-on-financial-samurai\"\u003e5) Write shorter, more lifestyle-focused posts on Financial Samurai\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have a tendency to dive deep into topics, often writing posts exceeding 2,000 words (this post is 3,350 words). While I enjoy being thorough, I recognize that attention spans are shrinking. Readers appreciate concise, punchy content that gets to the point. Plus, longer articles take more time, which goes against my theme for the year of relaxing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2025, my goal is to write posts averaging 1,250 words. This shift will allow me to deliver value more quickly while still maintaining my voice. Shorter posts will also be easier for readers to digest, making the content more engaging overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’m also dropping my rigid commitment to publishing three posts a week. Instead, I will write whenever I want, to ease the pressure I put on myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-specific-financial-goals-for-2025\"\u003eSpecific Financial Goals for 2025\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince Financial Samurai is a personal finance site, let me share three key personal finance goals that align with my desire to simplify life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-1-sell-a-rental-property\"\u003e1) Sell a Rental Property\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore 2023, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy another rental property—and technically, I kept that promise. However, instead of selling my previous home, I chose to rent it out for cash flow after \u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/no-longer-financially-independent-blew-up-my-passive-income/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eblowing up $150,000 of passive income\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remain \u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/why-san-franciscos-west-side-will-keep-booming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ebullish on San Francisco real estate\u003c/a\u003e, thanks to the tech and AI boom generating immense wealth for tens of thousands of people. We’ve also got a new mayor who should reduce government corruption and improve policies for its citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, after a year of renting out the property, the tenants have given notice, and I’ve decided not to search for new ones. With the NASDAQ up ~30% in 2024, I’m optimistic that the Spring 2025 Bay Area housing market will be strong. Additionally, I’ve noticed more flexibility from real estate agents offering performance-based commission structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, I plan to sell this \u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/forever-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ebeautiful ocean-view property\u003c/a\u003e, which I purchased in mid-2020, in 2025. The timing feels right to simplify my life. Selling the property also provides an opportunity to earn up to $500,000 in tax-free profits, as I’ve lived in it for at least two out of the past five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIronically, owning a fourth rental property in San Francisco for a year was relatively hassle-free. The only issue was a kitchen faucet repair—likely caused by the tenant yanking out the nozzle and breaking the hose. Still, I had envisioned keeping this home, which we enjoyed during the pandemic, until my kids were grown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad for them the older I get, the less I want to manage properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"h-2-reinvest-80-of-online-funny-money-into-risk-assets\"\u003e2) Reinvest 80% of online “funny money” into risk assets\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy love affair with real estate started in 2003 when I reinvested 100% of my dot-com bubble gains into a San Francisco condo. While the first internet bubble popped, my condo’s value held steady and even grew. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, I view online income as “\u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-best-way-to-get-rich-turn-funny-money-into-real-assets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003efunny money\u003c/a\u003e” because I’d happily write for free. Further, I’m not sure the income will last. This mindset motivates me to reinvest most of the net profits into assets that generate passive income. I\u0026#39;m also OK to take more risk with this income because it doesn\u0026#39;t seem real, unlike my arduous day job income in banking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I also want to enjoy life over the next three years. That’s why I plan to allocate 20% of this income to cover the gap between my expenses and \u003ca href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/ranking-the-best-passive-income-investments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ecurrent passive income\u003c/a\u003e.
