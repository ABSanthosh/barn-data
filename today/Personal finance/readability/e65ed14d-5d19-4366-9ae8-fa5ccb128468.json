With warmer weather and longer days, there are many opportunities to turn your skills and free time into extra cash. Picking the right side job can help you reach your money goals… Are you looking for the best spring side hustles? Spring is a great time to start a side hustle and increase your income. With warmer weather and longer days, there are many opportunities to turn your skills and free time into extra cash. Picking the right side job can help you reach your money goals or save for something special. It’s fun and exciting to find new ways to make money. Think about what you like to do and get ready to make the most of this spring! Best Spring Side Hustles Below are the best spring side hustles. 1. Rent out your RV Do you have an RV sitting in your driveway or in storage? Renting it out could be a great way to make extra money. Plus, the spring months are typically when RVing picks up, so you may be able to get some renters. Many RV owners are already doing this and finding it profitable, with some owners earning between $5,000 and $30,000 a year by renting out their RVs. Platforms like RVshare make it easy. This website connects you with people looking to rent an RV. You can list your RV, set your rental price, and manage bookings through these platforms. RVshare even handles all payments and provides insurance for your RV during rentals. One thing to keep in mind is the wear and tear on your RV. Renting it out will increase its wear and tear. However, the extra income should help cover maintenance and storage costs, but it’s a good idea to set some of your earnings aside for repairs and upkeep. You can learn more at How To Make Extra Money By Renting Out Your RV. 10RVShareRVshare is one of the best money-making sites because it helps travelers save money by cutting out the middleman and offering RV rentals directly from RV owners. If you have an RV that is sitting around, then you may be able to make $100 to $300+ a day. 2. Pet sitting and dog walking If you love animals, pet sitting and dog walking can be great spring side hustles. A common rate is around $20 for a 30-minute walk, and you can change this based on your area and what other dog walkers charge. There are dog walking apps like Rover and Wag. These apps help connect you with pet owners who need walkers or sitters. This makes it easy to find work and build a client list. Pet owners might need you to do more than just walk their dogs. Sometimes, they will want overnight pet sitting or to drop in and feed their pets. You can provide these services to make more money. 3. Paid online surveys Paid online surveys are a great way to make some extra money in your free time. You can do them from home or on the go. Many survey sites are easy to use, and you can start earning quickly. The survey companies I recommend signing up for include: Swagbucks User Interviews American Consumer Opinion Survey Junkie Prime Opinion Branded Surveys Five Surveys PrizeRebel I’ve done lots of surveys over the years and have earned over 100 free gift cards and cash. What I like about them is that you can do them whenever you want – in the morning, at lunchtime, or before bed. So, if you’re looking for an easy spring side hustle to do, this could be it. 4. Proofreading Proofreading is one of the best side hustles for spring. This job can be done from home, and proofreading is where you spot and correct mistakes in texts like articles, books, or student papers. Proofreading can pay well. Beginners often make around $20 to $25 per hour. With experience, you can earn even more. Some proofreaders can make up to $50,000 a year working full-time. You can learn more at 20 Best Online Proofreading Jobs For Beginners (Earn $40,000+ A Year). 10Proofread AnywhereThis free 76-minute workshop answers all of the most common questions about how to become a proofreader, and even talks about the 5 signs that proofreading could be a perfect fit for you. 5. Blogging Blogging is a popular side hustle for spring. You can write about anything you’re passionate about, whether it’s cooking, travel, or personal finance. One of my favorite ways to earn money from a blog is through affiliate marketing. This means you recommend products or services to your readers and earn a commission when they make a purchase. It’s a win-win situation – your readers get helpful recommendations, and you get paid. Another way to monetize your blog is by displaying ads. Companies pay you to place ads on your website, and the more traffic your blog gets, the more you can earn from ads. You can also sell your own products or services. This could be anything from ebooks to online courses. I have free training that you can take – How To Start A Blog FREE Course. Want to see how I built a $5,000,000 blog? In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. 6. Gardening Gardening could be a fun way to make some extra cash in the spring, as this is typically when gardens start to bloom! One way to get started is by selling seedlings. Seedlings are young plants that many gardeners prefer over starting from seeds. They grow fast and don’t need much space. Another option is to sell fresh fruits and vegetables. People love home-grown produce because it tastes better than store-bought, so if your garden is producing more than you can eat, you can sell the extra. For me, I love going to farmers’ markets so that I can specifically get fresh fruits and vegetables from a small garden. If you’re creative, you can also make garden crafts, such as things like painted flower pots, garden signs, and birdhouses. 7. Babysitting Babysitting is a great way to make extra money in the spring. Many parents need help during spring break or weekends. With school winding down for the school year, the spring months can be very hectic for families, so having some help is always nice. You can start by babysitting for people you know. Then, as you gain experience, you can find new clients and make a steady income. 8. Flipping and reselling Flipping and reselling can be a fun and profitable spring side hustle. You buy items at a low price and sell them for more to make extra money. Here are some examples: Furniture flipping is popular and this is where you find old pieces and repaint or refinish them. Electronics are also good to flip. Old cell phones, tablets, and gaming consoles can sell well. Sports equipment is another category. Items like home gyms, treadmills, and bikes can be bought cheaply and sold for a nice profit. You don’t need a lot of money to start flipping, and you can use sites like eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or Craigslist to sell your items. I have done a lot of flipping over the years and have earned a good income from it. The spring is a great time to get started because many people are spring cleaning, so you may be able to get some items for cheap (or even free!). You can learn more at How Melissa Made $40,000 In One Year Flipping Items. 9. Bookkeeping In the spring, virtual bookkeepers are in high demand as businesses prepare for tax season and the end of the tax year. A bookkeeper manages financial records for businesses. This includes tracking income and expenses, creating invoices, and preparing financial reports. This job lets you work on your own and earn around $40,000 or more each year. You don’t need a college degree to be a bookkeeper either.

Baking and selling cookies Baking and selling cookies can be a fun and tasty way to make extra money in the spring. You can sell your cookies and baked goods at local markets, fairs, or even online through social media or a small website. Setting up a stand at community events can attract a lot of customers too. A side hustle related to this is baking dog treats! You can learn more at How I Earned Up to $4,000 Per Month Baking Dog Treats (With Zero Baking Experience!). 11. Tutoring kids Tutoring kids can be a great way to make extra money in the spring. You might help them with math, reading, or even science. One option is to tutor kids in your local area, and you can check with schools or community centers to see if they need tutors. You can usually earn around $25 an hour. Many parents look for tutors around the springtime because the end of the school year is nearing and there may be tests that their kids need to take to make sure they can pass to the next grade. 12. Handmade crafts Spring is a great time to start making and selling handmade crafts. You can get creative and turn your hobby into a way to earn extra cash. You can sell these at local fairs, festivals, or online. Some examples of crafts you can sell include candles, mugs, bath bombs, and jewelry. 13. Virtual assistant Becoming a virtual assistant is a popular side hustle for spring that pays well. Spring is a great time to start because many businesses are looking to get organized. Virtual assistants handle emails, schedule appointments, and manage social media. These tasks can be done from home, which is really nice. 14. Driving for rideshare apps Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft can be a great spring side hustle, as you don’t need to do it full-time (you can choose to only do this during the spring each year, which is nice for flexibility). Spring is a busy time with lots of events and travel. People need rides to weddings, parties, and even the airport, so you have plenty of opportunities to find passengers. 15. Social media management Social media management is a great side hustle for spring. Many businesses and influencers need help with their social media accounts such as by managing their posts, replying to comments, and growing their online presence. Social media managers usually use platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. 16. Help with spring cleaning and home organization Spring is the perfect time for a fresh start, and many people are looking to clean and organize their homes. People are willing to pay for these services, especially if they have busy schedules. You can charge by the hour or by the task. Many people need an extra hand to dust, vacuum, and declutter. You can even haul away donations or their junk for them. Home organization is another great idea and you can help people sort out their closets, kitchens, and garages. 17. Fitness training Fitness training is a way to make extra money in the spring by helping people get in shape and feel better about themselves. Spring is a perfect time for this because everyone wants to get fit for summer. 18. Yard work Yard work is a great side hustle, especially in the spring. Many homeowners need help with tasks like mowing the lawn, pulling weeds, trimming bushes, raking leaves, cleaning up garden beds, and planting flowers. 19. Deliver groceries Delivering groceries is a great way to make extra cash in the spring. Many people use services like Instacart and Shipt to get their groceries delivered. As a shopper, you pick up the items and deliver them to customers. It’s easy to get started, and you can set your own schedule. You need a reliable car and a phone as you will use an app to get orders and directions. 20. Amazon Flex Amazon Flex is a great way to make extra money in the spring. With flexible hours and the chance to work at your own pace, Amazon Flex can be an ideal spring side hustle for anyone who likes to stay busy and be independent. As an Amazon Flex driver, you use your own car to deliver packages to people. You can choose what days and times you work. Shifts are usually 2 to 4 hours long but sometimes can be up to 6 hours, and drivers tend to make between $18 and $25 per hour. 21. Power washing Power washing is a great way to make money in the spring because many people want their homes and driveways clean after winter. You can advertise your services locally, such as by sharing in local Facebook groups. You can also ask friends and neighbors if they need any cleaning done. As I was writing this article, I actually had someone knock on my door and they were selling exterior power washing services. What a coincidence! 22. Sell your clothes to thrift stores Selling your clothes to thrift stores can be a fun way to make extra money. I have done this many, many times, and it’s a great way to make cash quickly with what you already have. You can start by cleaning out your closet. Now that it’s spring and the weather is starting to warm up, you may be able to go through your winter clothes and see what you don’t need, but also your spring/summer clothes and see what you don’t like from last year. There are many places where you can sell used clothing, such as ThredUp, Plato’s Closet, Buffalo Exchange, and Once Upon a Child. 23. Sell at flea markets Selling at flea markets is a great way to earn extra money in the spring. Flea markets attract lots of people who are looking for unique and affordable items, and they typically start once the weather warms up in the spring months. There are many different types of items that you can sell at flea markets, such as handmade goods (like soaps, candles, and jewelry), electronics, children’s toys, gardening supplies, decorations, food, and more. 24. Be a tour guide Being a tour guide is a fun way to make money in the spring. A tour guide shares knowledge about local attractions, history, and culture. Tour guides usually make between $15 and $30 per hour, and the pay may depend on the location and type of tour. 25. Wash cars Washing cars can be a good side hustle in the spring. As the weather warms up, people want their cars to look shiny and clean. Plus, after a long winter, many cars are dirty from snow and salt. You don’t need a lot of money to get started and usually just need basic supplies like buckets, sponges, soap, and towels. 26. Home maintenance and repair Spring is a great time to start a home maintenance and repair side hustle. Many homeowners need help with tasks they can’t do themselves. Jobs like painting are always in demand, and people want their homes looking fresh for the warmer months. Minor repairs can include fixing leaky faucets, repairing broken tiles, or patching drywall. These small tasks are usually too much for the homeowner to handle alone, but perfect for someone with basic skills. 27. Home staging Spring is a great time to start a home staging side hustle. Many people are looking to sell their homes in the spring, and they need help making their houses look appealing to buyers. You can start by offering to arrange furniture and decorations to make homes look bigger and welcoming. 28. Bike repair and maintenance Spring is the perfect time to do bike repair and maintenance services. Many people dust off their bikes after winter and find they need some care to get them back in shape. This creates a great opportunity for you to provide tune-ups and minor repairs. 29. Photography sessions Spring is a great time to start offering photography sessions. Many people want to take pictures with the blooming flowers and green landscapes. You can offer sessions for families, couples, or individuals. People love having professional photos with colorful spring backgrounds. Outdoor sessions are popular because the natural light is amazing in spring. Plus, parks and gardens make great places for photos. I’ve had family photos taken in the spring, and it’s always so nice with everything turning green in the background! Recommended reading: 18 Ways To Get Paid To Take Pictures 30. Travel planning and itinerary services Helping others plan their travels can be a great spring side hustle. Whether it’s for a spring break trip, a family vacation, or a weekend getaway, there’s always a need for good travel plans. You can help by researching destinations, finding the best accommodations, and creating detailed itineraries. This can include booking flights, hotels, and even local attractions. 31. Outdoor adventure guide Spring is a perfect time to become an outdoor adventure guide. You can lead hikers, campers, and even kayakers through beautiful landscapes. Many tour companies hire new workers around this time, as the spring and summer months are typically their busiest times of year. 32. Sports coaching Spring is a good time to coach sports like soccer, baseball, tennis, or swimming. You can work with individuals or small groups, helping them improve their skills. Coaching kids or adults can be a rewarding way to share your passion for sports. Plus, you get to enjoy the great weather and stay active.
