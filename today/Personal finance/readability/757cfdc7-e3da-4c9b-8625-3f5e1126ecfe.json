It’s possible! Many companies and apps now give you ways to get paid for shopping that you might already do. You can make extra cash by grocery shopping, buying clothes, or even just browsing stores. These opportunities range from being a personal shopper to taking surveys about products you buy. Some options let you shop for yourself, while others involve shopping for other people. It’s a fun way to earn money doing something you enjoy. Over the years, I’ve found that there are so many ways to make money while shopping, and it’s been a great side hustle for me. From getting paid to shop for others to earning cash back on my own purchases, it’s an easy and enjoyable way to bring in extra income. How To Get Paid To Shop Below are the best ways to get paid to shop. 1. Personal shopper Personal shoppers help people buy things. They pick out clothes, gifts, and other items for clients, so this can be a fun way to get paid for shopping. To become a personal shopper, you need good taste and people skills. You should enjoy fashion and keeping up with trends. Many personal shoppers work in person in retail stores, but you can also get paid to shop online for others. They help customers find outfits and accessories. Some work for wealthy clients, buying everything from groceries to designer clothes. You can start by getting a job at a department store and looking for positions in personal shopping or styling. Another option is to work for yourself and you can find clients through word-of-mouth or online platforms. When I was younger, I had a friend who was a personal shopper for a family. My friend mainly did their grocery shopping and ran errands, but would occasionally buy gifts for when the family was attending a birthday party or a wedding. 2. BestMark I’ve done a lot of mystery shopping over the years, and it’s been a fun way to earn extra money while doing something I already enjoy. Whether it’s evaluating a store’s customer service, trying out new products, or going to a restaurant, it’s pretty easy work. BestMark is a top mystery shopping company that’s been around since 1986. As a BestMark shopper, you’ll visit stores, restaurants, and other businesses. You’ll act like a regular customer and evaluate your experience, and this might include checking product quality, service speed, and staff friendliness. After your visit, you’ll fill out a detailed report online. BestMark gives you a list to help you understand what to look for during your shop. The pay for BestMark shops varies, but you can tend to earn between $10 and $20 per task. For most assignments, you will get your meal or whatever you buy reimbursed. They usually give you a limit on what you can spend or they specifically tell you what to buy. Recommended reading: 9 Best Mystery Shopping Companies To Work For 3. Swagbucks Swagbucks is a popular website that pays you to shop online, and it’s free to join and easy to use. I’ve been using Swagbucks for almost 10 years now, and I think it’s pretty easy to earn points. To get paid to shop with Swagbucks, there are two main ways to earn points: Earn cash back when shopping online. For example, right now you can get up to 8% cash back when shopping at Macy’s, up to 4% when shopping on Amazon, up to 10% when shopping at Best Buy, and more. Earn points (SB) by submitting your shopping receipts. You can submit any receipt that you have from the last 14 days – both in-store and online receipts. You can then earn points. For example, you can get 50 points for any loaf of bread that you buy, 50 points for any bananas, 900 points for diapers, and more. When you’ve collected enough SB, you can trade them for gift cards. You can pick from lots of popular stores. If you prefer cash, you can get money sent to your PayPal account instead. I’ve redeemed over 100 gift cards from Swagbucks over the years, and I love how easy this rewards site is to use. If you join Swagbucks through my referral link, you will receive a $10 bonus. 9SwagbucksSwagbucks is a site where you can earn points for answering surveys, shopping online, watching videos, using coupons, and more. You can use your points for gift cards and cash. 4. Rakuten Rakuten is a popular way to earn cash back when you shop online. It’s free to use and super easy to get started. I have used Rakuten for years and it’s an easy way to get cash back for the online shopping that you already do. In fact, I just used it on a hotel booking, and I received 2% back, which adds up quickly for a hotel! You just sign up for an account on Rakuten’s website or app. Then when you want to buy something, go through Rakuten first. They’ll send you to the store’s site to shop like normal. After you make a purchase, Rakuten adds cash back to your account. The amount varies by store, but it’s often 1% to 10% of what you spend. Some stores even pay you 20% or more during special sales. You can get paid by check or PayPal. Rakuten sends out payments every 3 months and you need at least $5 in your account to get paid. So, why does Rakuten give you this cash back? Rakuten makes money by getting a commission from stores when you buy stuff. They share part of that commission with you as cash back. Please click here to sign up for Rakuten. Plus, you can get a $30 bonus when you spend $30 if you join right now (at the time of this writing; please double-check the current offer). 5. Stitch Fix stylist Want to get paid to shop for others? Becoming a Stitch Fix stylist might be perfect for you. This job lets you work from home and help people look their best. Stitch Fix hires stylists for women’s, men’s, and kids’ styling. They even train you, so you can start with no experience. As a Stitch Fix stylist, you’ll pick out clothes for customers based on their likes and needs. You’ll use a computer to see what items are available and choose the best ones for each person. 6. Instacart shopper Becoming an Instacart shopper is a way to make money grocery shopping on your own schedule. As an Instacart shopper, you’ll pick up and deliver groceries to customers. Instacart has full-service shoppers, where you shop and deliver groceries, as well as in-store shoppers, where you only shop in-store but don’t deliver (someone else picks up the items and delivers). To start, you need to be at least 18 years old. You’ll also need a smartphone to use the Instacart app as this app tells you what to buy at the grocery store and where to deliver it. Instacart gives you a payment card to use at stores. You’ll get this card about a week after signing up. You use it to pay for the groceries you’re buying for customers.

You can get points called “kicks” for different activities. These include scanning products in stores and uploading receipts. You don’t even need to buy anything to earn kicks. Just walking into certain stores can give you points. The app works with many popular retailers like Target and CVS. As you collect kicks, you can trade them for gift cards. To start, just download the Shopkick app on your phone. Then link your credit or debit cards to your account, because this lets you earn kicks automatically when you shop at partner stores. 8. Ibotta Ibotta is a free app where you can earn cash back on your everyday purchases. It works for both online and in-store shopping at many popular retailers. To get started, download the Ibotta app on your phone. Before you shop, browse the app for “offers” at your favorite stores. You’ll see cash back deals on specific items or entire purchases. When shopping in stores, buy the items with offers (of course, make sure these are items that you actually want to buy because the item is not free, it is simply more like getting a discount). Then, take a picture of your receipt with the app when you are done. Ibotta will match your purchases to the offers and add cash back to your account. For online shopping, start your purchase through the Ibotta app or website. Shop as usual, and you’ll automatically earn cash back on qualifying items. Ibotta works with many big stores like Walmart, Target, and Kroger. Once you reach $20 in your account, you can cash out via PayPal or choose a gift card. It’s a simple way to make your shopping more rewarding. This app is available for both Android and iOS (iPhone). You can sign up for Ibotta here. 9IbottaIbotta is an app where you can get cash back and earn free gift cards. Simply submit your receipts on your everyday purchases with your phone. 9. Ath Power Consulting Ath Power Consulting is a company where you can get paid to do mystery shopping. They have a huge network of over 600,000 shoppers across North America. Ath Power does more than 10,000 mystery shops each month. They work with many well-known brands and companies around the world. Ath Power mystery shoppers shop in person for companies, and then share their thoughts about the products and services they try. Companies can then use this information to improve what they sell to customers. 10. IntelliShop IntelliShop is a company that hires for mystery shopping jobs. You can sign up to become a secret shopper and get paid to visit stores. Most tasks pay between $5 and $20. They usually take less than 15 minutes in the store, and then after your visit, you’ll need to fill out a report. IntelliShop has jobs in stores, online, and over the phone. As a mystery shopper for any of the mystery shopping companies on this list, please remember to keep any receipts or business cards from your visit.

Care.com Care.com is a site where you can earn money by helping others with tasks like grocery shopping. You can sign up as a helper on their platform to find local gigs. The site connects you with people who need assistance, such as parents and seniors. You might help with grocery shopping, cooking, or other errands. As a helper on Care.com, you can set your own rates. Some helpers charge between $15 and $25 per hour.

Capital One Shopping Capital One Shopping is a free tool that can help you save money when you shop online. It’s a browser extension and mobile app that works in the background while you browse. When you’re ready to check out, Capital One Shopping searches for coupon codes automatically and it tries to apply them to your order to get you the best deal. The tool also compares prices across different websites. This can help you find the lowest price for items you want to buy. You can earn rewards called Shopping Credits when you make purchases through Capital One Shopping. These credits can be redeemed for gift cards to popular stores. While you won’t get paid directly to shop, you can save money and earn rewards. This can add up to significant savings over time and even free gift cards. I recently received a $71 gift card for simply using the Capital One Shopping browser extension, which was super easy to get. You can learn more at Capital One Shopping Review: Is It Worth It? 13. Fetch Rewards Fetch Rewards is a free app that lets you earn points for shopping. You can get points by scanning any receipt or shopping online through the app. I use Fetch Rewards for nearly all of my grocery shopping receipts. What I like about Fetch is that you don’t need to clip coupons or look for special offers. You just buy products and scan your receipts when you are done. It takes less than one minute to scan your receipt and earn points, so it is very easy. Fetch gives you points for every receipt you upload. You can earn extra points by buying specific brands or products. The app has special offers where you can earn extra points, such as for buying a specific brand of cheese. You can turn your points into gift cards from many stores and restaurants. Some options include Amazon, Target, and Starbucks. You can sign up for Fetch Rewards here.  10Fetch RewardsWith this app, you can scan your grocery receipts (from any grocery store or wholesale club, any time) and earn free gift cards.

Once approved, you can begin accepting delivery requests through the Uber app. Uber Eats drivers can earn around $15 to $26 per hour on average. Your earnings can vary based on factors like your location, how busy it is, and the amount that you earn in tips. You will want a reliable vehicle and a valid driver’s license, of course, for this side gig. Recommended reading: 14 Ways To Make Money Driving 15. DoorDash DoorDash is another way to get paid for delivering food. DoorDash pays Dashers weekly through direct deposit. If you need money faster, DoorDash offers a Fast Pay option. This lets you cash out your earnings right away for a small fee. Remember, you’re responsible for your own expenses like gas and car maintenance. It’s a good idea to track these costs to see how much you’re really earning. 16. Taskrabbit Taskrabbit is an app that lets you make money by doing odd jobs for people in your area. You can pick tasks that fit your skills and schedule. Some popular jobs on Taskrabbit include cleaning houses, assembling furniture, and running errands (such as shopping for others). Taskrabbit gives you the flexibility to choose when and how much you work, as well as the type of work that you want to do. 17. Walmart personal shopper You can get paid to shop as a Walmart personal shopper. This job lets you pick out items for customers who order online. You’ve probably seen Walmart personal shoppers when you’ve been in Walmart. They work for Walmart and typically have a uniform and a very large basket where they collect items for different orders. Walmart personal shoppers earn about $15 per hour on average. Most personal shoppers work full-time or nearly full-time, between 32 to 40 hours a week. As a personal shopper, you’ll walk around the store and find items customers want. You’ll need to be quick and careful to pick the right products.
