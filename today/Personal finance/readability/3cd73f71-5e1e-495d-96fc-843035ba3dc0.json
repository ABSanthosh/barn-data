When I began Making Sense… Do you want to learn how to start a travel blog? Starting a travel blog can be a fun journey that combines your love for travel and writing. You have the chance to share your adventures, tips, and personal stories with a wide audience. Starting a blog changed my life. When I began Making Sense of Cents (the blog that you’re reading right now!), I had no idea that sharing my writing would lead to financial freedom and the ability to work from anywhere. For nearly a decade, I’ve traveled full-time – by RV, sailboat, and plane – and it’s been an incredible way to live. Along the way, I’ve shared my experiences, travel tips, and stories, and it’s allowed me to connect with fellow travelers from all over the world. Whether you want to turn it into a business, a career, or just a fun hobby, a travel blog lets you connect with other travelers and inspire them to explore new places. Creating a travel blog doesn’t need to be expensive. With some basic steps, you can set up your blog and start sharing your travel experiences in no time. This guide will help you understand what you need to get started, from choosing a domain name to setting up your website and reaching your first readers. Quick note: I have a free How To Start A Blog FREE Course you can click here to join. Join over 80,000 people who have already taken the course. Want to see how I built a $5,000,000 blog? In this free course, I show you how to create a blog, from the technical side to earning your first income and attracting readers. My background with blogging Over a decade ago, I started my blog, Making Sense of Cents, without much planning. I stumbled upon an article about a blogger and thought it would be fun to share details about my own life. At first, it was just a hobby with no real expectations. I didn’t even realize you could make money from blogging back then. But around six months in, a blogger friend introduced me to my first advertiser, and I earned $100. That’s when I really started to see the potential. Since then, my blog has grown far beyond anything I could’ve imagined, and I’ve earned more than $5,000,000 over the years. Blogging completely changed my life, giving me the freedom to work from anywhere. What kept me going was my genuine love for everything related to blogging but also my love for travel. That passion made it easy to dedicate time and effort to grow the blog into what it is today, because I love running an online business that allows me to travel whenever and wherever I want. Now, I’m excited to help you start your own blog and find success too. What is a travel blog? A travel blog is a website where someone shares their travel experiences, tips, and advice. The person who writes it, called a travel blogger, posts about the places they’ve been, activities they’ve tried, and things they’ve learned. Many travel bloggers also give recommendations for places to stay, eat, and things to do. It’s a way to inspire and help others plan their own trips. Travel blogs can focus on topics like budget travel, luxury trips, family vacations, solo adventures, and so much more. Some examples of topics that a travel blog may cover include: Destination guides – Detailed information on must-see attractions, hidden gems, and local tips for specific cities, countries, or regions Travel itineraries – Pre-planned routes for weekend getaways, road trips, or long-term travel, outlining where to go and what to see Local travel tips – Yes, you don’t need to travel by plane in order to be a travel blogger! You can write articles on things to do in your own town. Budget travel tips – How to travel affordably, including finding cheap flights, budget accommodations, and saving money on food and activities Solo travel – Tips and advice for solo travelers, including safety, making friends on the road, and building confidence while traveling alone Family travel – Tips for traveling with children, including family-friendly destinations, packing lists, and keeping kids entertained (such as listing the top travel toys) Adventure travel – Guides on activities like hiking, diving, surfing, and more, plus how to plan an adventure-focused trip Cultural experiences – How to engage with local cultures, learn about traditions, and have authentic travel experiences Travel gear reviews – Recommendations and reviews for travel gear like backpacks, luggage, cameras, and more Traveling sustainably – How to reduce your environmental impact while traveling, from eco-friendly accommodations to responsible tourism practices Travel photography tips – Advice on taking beautiful travel photos, including photography tips, gear recommendations, and photo spots You can pick one or more of these topics to focus on. When you stick to one or two areas, it does help you become more known as an expert in that field, though. Recommended reading: What Is A Blog, How Do Blogs Make Money, \u0026 More Who can start a travel blog? Anyone with a passion for travel can start a travel blog! You don’t need to be a professional writer or photographer. You also don’t need to be a full-time traveler. Starting a travel blog is a great way to document your adventures and connect with others. Whether you’re traveling full-time or just on weekends, your travel blog can become a helpful resource for other travelers. Why should you start a travel blog? Starting a travel blog has many benefits. It lets you share your adventures with friends, family, and a worldwide audience. You can also make money from your blog. If your blog gets popular, you can earn through ads, sponsored posts, or affiliate marketing. Blogging can help you connect with other travelers. You may meet people who share your interests. This can lead to friendships and collaborations. I have met so many amazing people through my blog, which has been so nice over the years! Having a travel blog is like having a digital scrapbook because you can look back and remember all of your trips, which I think is absolutely amazing. A travel blog kind of “forces” you to write down your memories and take pictures. Starting a travel blog can be a fun and rewarding way to combine your love for travel with new skills and opportunities. How To Start a Travel Blog Below is how to start a travel blog and make money, step by step! 1. Choose a travel niche Choosing a niche is the first step in starting a successful travel blog. A niche is a specific topic or focus area for your blog. Picking the right niche helps you stand out and attract readers who are interested in that topic. Think about what you love most about travel. Do you enjoy food, adventure, or culture? Your niche could be anything from luxury travel to budget trips, or even solo adventures. Another great idea is to think about who you want to help with your blog. Are you writing for families, couples, or solo travelers? It’s also smart to see what’s trending. Wildlife travel, romantic getaways, and travel for digital nomads are popular niches right now. Research what’s trending and pick something that excites you. Once you have your niche, you can create content that matches what your readers are looking for. This way, you make sure your blog is both fun to read and useful. I recommend starting a self-hosted WordPress blog through Bluehost. 2. Start a self-hosted WordPress blog To start a travel blog, you’ll need a blogging platform. WordPress is my favorite choice, and it’s what I use for my blog. WordPress is where you create and manage your blog posts. It’s like the main hub for your blog. You can log in, write new posts, add pictures or links, and publish them for your readers. It’s a simple tool that makes running your blog easy. Plus, one of the best things about WordPress is that you don’t need to know how to code. It’s user-friendly and has lots of ways to customize your blog. Here are the steps to start a self-hosted WordPress blog: Get a web hosting service. A popular choice for new bloggers is Bluehost (you can start your own blog for as low as $1.99 per month). Install WordPress. Most web hosts have a one-click installation to make it as painless as possible. You can see my full tutorial for this at How To Start A WordPress Blog On Bluehost. There are step-by-step directions included here if you want more detail and/or want to see screenshots of the exact things you should click on. Plus, if you use my tutorial, you can get the lowest pricing as well as a free domain name! 3. Pick a travel blog name Deciding on a travel blog name is a big step. You want it to be fun and easy to remember. It’s also good to make it tell what your blog is about. Here are some more tips: Think about what makes your travels special. Are you an adventurer, a foodie, or a luxury traveler? Use that in your name. Using “.com” is the best choice. It’s what most people type first. Avoid names that are hard to spell or have numbers in them. Simple is best. You don’t want people to get confused or forget your name. Before you decide, check if the name is available on social media. You’ll want the same name on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, and other sites. Take your time and have fun with it. Your blog name is the first thing people see, so make it catchy and memorable. Don’t forget, you can get your domain name (your blog name) for free when you sign up for Bluehost! Click here to claim your free domain name. 4. Design your blog layout With a travel blog, your site design is very important. Your travel blog’s design and layout are important because readers like to see a clean and easy-to-navigate blog design. It makes it easier for them to find what they are looking for, and this helps to keep them on your site longer. Plus, we’ve all seen a bad site design in the past, and when that happens, usually you don’t stay reading that blog for very long (right?!). So, your blog design is important because you want readers to continue reading and to even come back in the future! There are three options for designing your travel blog: Creating your blog design yourself (DIY such as with paid or free themes) Paying a blog designer for a custom site design Buying a premade blog layout – this is what I recommend bloggers do! Doing it yourself is usually the cheapest, but it can take a lot of time. Paying for a custom site design is usually fairly expensive. My favorite option – I’m a big fan of simply buying a premade blog design. They are a lot more affordable than a custom design and look amazing. One premade blog design site that I recommend is Restored 316. Restored 316 is super easy to use and they have a lot of great blog design options, especially for travel blogs. Please click here if you’d like to go the easy way and get an affordable premade blog design (this is what I recommend). Here’s what my About page looks like. 5. Make important pages for your blog To make your travel blog successful, start by setting up your main pages. These pages help your readers easily navigate your site. Your important pages should include: Homepage – This is the first impression visitors get of your blog. A clear and organized homepage helps readers quickly understand what your blog is about. Clearly state what your blog focuses on, such as destinations, travel tips, or itineraries, and provide links to your main sections. About page – Share your story here and explain who you are, why you started traveling, and what kind of travel experiences you write about. Contact page – Make it easy for readers, tourism boards, or brands to reach you by listing your email address. Privacy Policy page – Outline how you collect and use data, especially if you collect any personal information. For legal templates, you can search for these online or buy a premade privacy policy here. Disclosure page – If you earn money through affiliate links, sponsored trips, or partnerships, you need to be transparent about it. 6. Start social media accounts for your travel blog Creating social media accounts can be super helpful for growing your travel blog. Social media allows you to share your pictures, travel tips, and stories, making it easier for people to find your blog and follow your adventures. Social media is especially helpful for a travel blog because it allows you to reach a larger audience and engage with readers in real time. Posting pictures and videos of your trips on Instagram or TikTok, for example, can inspire people to visit your blog for more detailed itineraries and travel advice. The social media platforms you can start include: Facebook Pinterest Instagram Twitter TikTok You don’t have to be active on all of them, but claiming your blog name on each platform is a smart move to keep your brand name consistent. Then, I also recommend adding social media buttons to your blog so that readers can find you on social media from your blog. 7. Create a blog post plan A blog content plan is a simple way to organize what you’ll write and post on your blog. It helps you stay on track and reach your goals, like getting more readers or making more sales. A good content plan includes a list of topics, post titles, when to publish, and the goal of each post (like promoting something or helping your readers). It can also include keywords, picture ideas, and how you’ll share your posts. It’s basically a guide to keep your blog running smoothly and growing. Your travel blog content plan doesn’t need to be complicated, though. It can be as simple as a list of trips or destinations you want to write about. How detailed you make it is up to you. Here are some blog post ideas for a travel blog content plan: 10 Budget Travel Tips for Exploring the World How To Plan the Perfect Weekend Getaway How To Travel Abroad for the First Time: A Beginner’s Guide Top 5 Must-Have Travel Apps You Need How To Pack Light for a Two-Week Trip How To Find Cheap Flights and Save Money on Airfare 10 Underrated Travel Destinations You Should Visit Best Travel Hacks for Families with Kids Top 5 Beach Destinations for a Relaxing Vacation How To Travel Full-Time and Make Money on the Road 8. Write your first post Writing your first post can be exciting and a bit scary. I think pretty much every blogger is a little nervous to share their first blog post – this is completely normal. Here are some things to think about when writing a blog post: You can easily start with an introduction. Tell your readers who you are and what your blog is about, and share a bit about why you love to travel. After the introduction, get into the main content of your post. Share your travel experiences, tips, or plans. Divide your post into short paragraphs because this makes it easier to read. Use bullet points or numbered lists to break up the text. I also recommend that you include photos to make your post more appealing. Pictures of your travels can help bring your story to life. It is a travel blog after all, so readers most likely want to see pictures! Then, I recommend that you end your blog post with a call to action. Ask your readers to leave comments or share your post with their friends. Remember to proofread your post before publishing. 9. Find ways to make money with your travel blog You can make money from your travel blog in many ways, such as: Placing ads on your blog. Companies will pay you to show their banners or links. This can be a good way to earn an income. Affiliate marketing is another great option. You can recommend travel gear, hotels, or tours and get a commission for every sale made through your links. It’s a win-win for both you and your readers. I have a free ebook to learn more – Affiliate Marketing Tips For Bloggers. Sponsored posts can bring in extra money too. Brands might pay you to write about their products or services. Selling digital products like travel guides or ebooks can also be profitable. You could also sell paid memberships. Members could get access to exclusive content, special travel deals, or even a personal Q\u0026A session with you. Running webinars or online courses about travel planning can help you earn money. People love learning and are willing to pay for good advice. Don’t forget about social media. You can get paid for sponsored posts or partnerships on platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Freelance travel blog writing – There are websites, such as larger travel blogs, that will pay for content as well. 10. How to grow a travel blog To get readers to your travel blog, you need to promote it. Here are some ways to get pageviews on your blog: Share your travel posts and photos on social media platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. Guest post on other travel blogs. This can introduce you to new readers who are interested in travel. Email marketing is one of my favorite ways to grow a blog. You can persuade readers to subscribe to your newsletter and send them updates and new travel posts regularly. If you are looking for a way to send newsletters or emails to your readers, I recommend Convertkit. Use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to help your blog appear in search results when people look for travel tips or destinations. Create helpful video content: Many travelers love visual content, so creating travel vlogs or short clips on YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok can bring traffic to your blog. Create downloadable resources. Useful resources like packing checklists, travel itineraries, or budget travel guides can get more readers to your blog. My favorite guide that teaches many different strategies to grow your pageviews is 21 Strategies I Used to Increase My Monthly Page Views from 17k to 400k+ in 10 Months. If you are a new blogger, check out this resource! The author went from 17,000 monthly pageviews to 400,000 and shares all of her best tips in this guide.
