Making extra money can be really helpful for unexpected expenses or saving up. You might need it for rent, a car repair, or a medical bill. Or maybe you’re saving for something special and just want to earn a little more. Sometimes, you need quick cash, and $400 can make a big difference. Finding ways to make money fast doesn’t have to be hard and can be done in many different ways that fit your skills and schedule. Best Ways To Make $400 Fast Below are the best ways to make $400 fast. 1. Sell printables Selling printables can be a great way to earn money quickly. Printables are digital products that buyers download and print at home. These can be anything from planners to party decorations to holiday cards. The best part is you only need to create them once, and they can be sold many times. After creating your printable, you’ll need a platform to sell it. Etsy is a popular choice because it’s easy to set up and lots of people shop there for printables. When listing your product, make sure to use good photos and detailed descriptions because this helps buyers find your printables. I have several friends who make over $1,000 each month by selling printables, and they do it all from home! It’s a side hustle that I frequently think about starting. You can learn more at How I Make Money Selling Printables On Etsy. 2. Start a blog Starting a blog can be a great way to make $400. It may not always be fast, but once you get your blog started, you may be able to make money and create new income streams. To make money, you can place ads on your blog. You can also write sponsored posts or review products. Another way to earn is by promoting products you like through affiliate links. When someone buys a product through your link, you get a commission. For me, I love blogging and I make over $400 a day online with my blog. I also get to work from home and have a flexible schedule, and I love it! You can learn how to start a blog with my free How To Start a Blog Course (sign up by clicking here). 3. Answer online surveys Taking online surveys is a simple way to make extra money. Many companies pay for your opinions to help improve their products. You can do this from home and on your own schedule. It would take some time to make $400 by answering surveys, but it is easy and very flexible. Or, you could combine many of the side hustles on this list to reach your $400 goal faster. The survey companies I recommend signing up for and the best paying survey sites include: Freecash – This is one of my favorite rewards sites right now! You can get paid to take surveys, play games on your phone, and more. American Consumer Opinion Survey Junkie Swagbucks Branded Surveys Prime Opinion Five Surveys User Interviews KashKick Pinecone Research Many of the survey sites above give a sign-up bonus to new members and pay via free gift cards or cash to your PayPal account. I have taken many, many surveys over the years, and I like how flexible they are to answer because you can answer them in your free time (such as when watching a TV show). 4. Sell your old phones Got an old phone lying around? You can turn it into quick cash, many times up to (or over) $400. Many people don’t realize how much money is just sitting in their junk drawer. Phones, even ones that aren’t the latest model, can be worth quite a bit. You can sell your old phone on: Decluttr eBay Facebook Marketplace Craigslist And more! You’ll want to remember to erase all your personal data before selling your phone. This is very easy, though, so don’t let it stop you from selling your phone. 5. Join Freecash Freecash is a website where you can make money by doing fun and easy tasks on your computer or phone. When you join Freecash, you can get paid to test apps, play games, and complete surveys. I have personally earned $722 from this site, and I have received $720 in free Amazon gift cards. $302 of that was from playing Bingo on my phone through Freecash in just one week! Click here to sign up for Freecash for free. 6. Bookkeeping Bookkeeping can be a way to make money from home. You don’t need a college degree to start, and many online courses offer the training needed to get going. Bookkeepers help businesses manage their finances. This includes tracking income, expenses, and creating reports. Many businesses, big and small, need bookkeepers. As a result, there’s always a demand for this service. With hard work and dedication, you might earn around $40,000 a year or more. I recommend signing up for the free training – How to start a profitable bookkeeping side hustle, that can generate $2,000 to $16,000 a month (part-time)! You can also learn more at How I Made $10,000+ Monthly With A Bookkeeping Business Online. 10Brilliant Bookkeeper Side HustleThis free training will show you how to start a profitable bookkeeping side-hustle in the next 30 days—even if you have no prior experience! 7. Proofread Proofreading is a great way to make money quickly. Many writers need an extra set of eyes to catch mistakes in their work. As a proofreader, you’ll look for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. This job can be done from home, and you get to choose your own hours. You can proofread all kinds of content. This includes articles, blog posts, books, student papers, and even advertising copy. Due to the high demand for written content, there’s always a need for proofreaders. This makes it a stable way to earn money. You can learn more at How To Start A Proofreading Business And Make $4,000+ Monthly. 10Proofreading Free TrainingThis free training teaches you how to start a proofreading side hustle (and how to earn $1,000+ per month!), even if you are brand new and don’t have any previous proofreading experience. 8. Sell jewelry online Selling your jewelry online can be a way to make $400 fast. If you have items like engagement rings, luxury watches, or necklaces you no longer wear, you can turn them into cash. Start by choosing a reliable place to sell your jewelry. For example, websites like Worthy can help you sell jewelry like rings and necklaces. You can learn more at Where To Sell Jewelry: 12 Best Places For Extra Money. 9. Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a great way to make money online and it’s one of my favorite online business ideas. You can earn commissions by promoting products and services. When someone buys through your referral link, you get a percentage of the sale. This is my favorite way to make money, as it can all be done online. I can make money while on a vacation or sleeping, and it’s easy to share links to products that you already use and believe in. My favorite way to do affiliate marketing is by sharing links to products on a blog. You can learn more about this at Affiliate Marketing Tips For Bloggers – Free eBook. 10. Freelance on Fiverr Fiverr is a great way to make $400 fast by selling your skills online. You can sell services like writing, graphic design, or even voice-overs. You can easily start freelancing by creating a free account on Fiverr. You’ll choose a username and set up your seller profile where you highlight your skills and what you can sell to clients. Next, create your first gig. A gig is a service you provide. You can start small, with gigs priced at $5, and then increase your rates as you gain experience (yes, this means that you can earn more than $5 per service that you sell on Fiverr!). Also, another site to look into if you want to freelance online is Upwork! 11. Pet sitting services Pet sitting is a great way to make extra money if you love animals. Many people need help taking care of their pets when they’re at work or on vacation. This job usually involves feeding, playing with, and sometimes walking the pets. You can start by signing up on dog walking websites and apps like Rover or Wag. These platforms connect pet sitters with pet owners. You can choose your working hours and set your rates. We used to have a dog sitter (back when we had dogs), and we paid her $35 to watch each dog each night (she watched them in her own home). That means she was making $70 a night and we typically had her watching our dogs for 7 days or longer. 12. Sell handmade crafts on Etsy Selling handmade crafts on Etsy is a great way to make $400 fast. You can set up your own shop and start selling right away. People love unique, handmade items, and Etsy is the place to find them. You can sell all kinds of things on Etsy, like jewelry, woodwork, soap, and knitted items. Etsy charges a fee for each listing and a transaction fee when you make a sale, so you’ll want to make sure to price your items to cover these costs and still make a profit. 13. Sell lawn care services Selling lawn care services is a great way to make $400 quickly. If you have a lawn mower and some basic tools, you can sell your services to neighbors or people in your community. Start by mowing lawns. You can charge around $30 to $50+ per lawn, depending on the size. If you mow just 8 to 10 lawns, you’ll reach $400 fast. 14. Babysit for neighbors Babysitting is a way to make money fast. Many parents need someone to watch their kids for a few hours, so you can sell your help during weekends or evenings. Tell your neighbors and friends that you are available to babysit, or even post in local parent Facebook groups. Let them know your rates and how they can reach you. You might be surprised by how many opportunities you get. Babysitting rates can vary, but you can charge around $15 to $25 per hour, depending on where you live. 15. Drive for a rideshare service One of the fastest ways to make $400 is to drive for a rideshare service like Lyft or Uber. You get paid for each trip you complete, and you can work as much or as little as you want. To make the most money, you can focus on driving during peak hours. These are the times when people need rides the most, like mornings and evenings, making it easier for you to get more trips. Another tip is to drive during special events or on weekends. People usually need rides for events, and requests increase, which means more money for you. 16. Sell clothes Whenever I needed money fast, I would go through my closet and find clothes to sell. I did this a lot, especially when I was younger (and had more clothing, haha). Selling clothes is a quick and easy way to make extra money. You probably have clothes in your closet that you don’t wear anymore. These might be items that don’t fit, are out of style, or just don’t suit you anymore. Instead of letting them take up space, you can sell them online. There are many websites and apps where you can sell your clothes. Poshmark and ThredUp are popular choices. On Poshmark, you can create listings with photos and descriptions of your clothing. Once your item sells, you ship it to the buyer. ThredUp is more hands-off. You send your clothes to them, and they handle the selling process. If you prefer selling in person, you can look for local consignment shops or secondhand stores. These places buy gently used clothes and resell them. You might not make as much money as selling online, but it’s fast and super easy. You can learn more at 16 Best Places To Sell Clothes For Cash. 17. Become a virtual assistant Becoming a virtual assistant (VA) is a great way to make $400 fast. Virtual assistants help businesses with tasks they don’t have time for. This can include managing emails, scheduling appointments, and handling social media accounts. You can set your own hours and work from home, which is one of the best parts of this job. Whether you want to work part-time or full-time, being a VA can give you flexibility. As you gain experience, you can increase your rates. New VAs might start at $15 to $20 per hour, but experienced VAs can earn much more. You could make up to $50 per hour if you specialize in certain areas, for example. You can learn more at Best Ways To Find Virtual Assistant Jobs. 18. Rent out your extra space Renting out your extra space is a great way to make extra money. If you have a spare room in your house, you can list it on Airbnb. Many people need short-term rentals; you can charge by the night and this can add up quickly. Another way to make money with a spare room is to find a long-term renter. Back when I had spare bedrooms, I would actually rent out each room for $400. You can even rent out your storage space, a parking spot, and more. A site to start with for this is Neighbor. 19. Donate plasma Donating plasma is a quick way to make some extra money. You can make around $200 a month by donating regularly. Some centers even have bonuses that can boost your earnings to $400 in your first month. You can learn more at How To Make Money Donating Plasma. 20. Sell unwanted gift cards Have gift cards you don’t plan to use? You can turn them into cash quickly. Many places will buy them from you and pay real money. This is an easy way to make some quick cash. Some ways to sell gift cards include: Raise CardCash CardSell Gameflip GiftCash 21. Join a focus group Joining a focus group can be a great way to make money quickly. Focus groups pay you for your opinion on products, services, or ads. These groups can be either online or in person. This makes them super flexible for any schedule. Payment varies a lot, with some focus groups paying around $20 for a quick session, while others can pay up to $400 for more detailed feedback. The amount usually depends on the length and type of study. Even a one-hour session can earn you between $50 and $100. I once did a focus group that paid me about $400 for just 75 minutes. That’s more than what most focus groups pay, but usually, you can expect to earn between $50 to over $100 per hour. The amount you get paid depends on how long the study is and what it’s about, but there are some studies that pay more. One focus group company that I recommend is User Interviews. User Interviews recruits participants to answer surveys and share their feedback. 22. Sell video games Selling video games can be a quick way to make money. If you have games you no longer play, why not turn them into cash? You can sell your old video games in ways such as: Decluttr eBay Amazon Trade-In OfferUp Facebook Marketplace 23. Sell power washing services Selling power washing services can help you make $400 fast. Many people need their driveways, sidewalks, and houses cleaned. You’ll need a power washer to get started. You can buy one or rent it from a local store. You can advertise your services on social media or in your neighborhood and create flyers and business cards to hand out. You can charge by the hour or by the job. Typical rates can be between $50 and $100 an hour. You can clean a driveway in just a couple of hours, so you can probably easily make $400 in one weekend. 24. Tutor Tutoring students can be a quick way to make $400. You can help kids with their homework, teach a language, or explain tough subjects like math and science. Many parents are willing to pay good money for someone who can help their children do better in school. Online tutoring is flexible too because you can set your own hours and work from home. Websites like Tutor.com, Wyzant, and Preply are great places to start. Tutoring can pay well too. Rates can range from $15 to $60 or more per hour, depending on the subject and your experience (for example, advanced subjects like calculus or test prep can pay even higher rates). 25. Become a freelance writer Freelance writing is a great way to make $400 fast with an online business. You can write for blogs, websites, magazines, and companies. Since you work for yourself, you get to choose which projects to take on. Freelance writing pays well and beginners can earn around $50 per article, but as you gain experience, you can charge more. Some experienced writers make over $1,000 per 1000-word article. I have been a freelance writer for years and I have definitely enjoyed it. It’s a fun online job where you can work from home and choose the subjects you want to write about. 26. Sell stock photos If you love taking pictures, you can turn that hobby into cash by selling stock photos. Many websites let you upload your images for sale. Some popular ones include Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, and Depositphotos. People such as businesses, bloggers, and marketers buy these photos for their own use. You can earn money each time someone downloads your photo. You might not make $400 overnight, but your earnings can add up quickly with enough photos in your portfolio. You can learn more at 18 Ways To Get Paid To Take Pictures. 27. Rent out your car Renting out your car can be a simple way to make extra cash. There are many platforms like Turo that let you rent your car to others. You don’t have to do much. Just list your car, set the price, and wait for renters. These platforms handle insurance and payments, making it easier for you. I have rented a car while on vacation on Turo several times, and I enjoyed it each time. It is an easy-to-use site! 28. Wash cars Washing cars is a great way to make quick money. You can start by selling your car washing services to neighbors, friends, and family. You can also make flyers and put them up around your community to let people know about your business. 29. Participate in a medical study Participating in a medical study can be a quick way to make $400. Many research studies pay volunteers for medical research. You can find opportunities in local hospitals, universities, and clinics. When my husband was younger, he took part in a few medical research studies to help us make extra money. He usually earned about $1,000 for a weekend of his time. These were very in-depth, though, with lots of blood work and needles (so you may want to ask about this if that makes you squeamish).

Sell furniture If you have any old furniture lying around, like a couch, coffee table, dresser, or dining set, then you can make quick cash by selling it. You can start by listing your items or selling to places such as: Facebook Marketplace Craigslist eBay AptDeco 1stDibs Consignment shops OfferUp Etsy You can learn more at 15 Best Places To Sell Used Furniture For Cash. 31. Help people move You can make $400 fast by selling moving services. People always need help moving, whether it’s across town or to a new apartment. You can start by advertising your services on social media and local websites like Craigslist and by letting your friends and family know you are available too. You can charge by the hour or by the job. Some movers charge $50 an hour, so you could reach your goal quickly. Make sure you have the necessary tools and equipment, such as a dolly and packing supplies. 32. Drive for a delivery service Driving for a delivery service is a great way to make some quick cash. There are many gig economy apps like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber Eats, and Grubhub that hire drivers to deliver food and groceries. You can sign up easily and start working in a few days. You get to pick your own hours, making it a flexible job. This means you can work in the mornings, evenings, or weekends. Plus, you can make between $12 and $20 per hour and often get tips on top of that. 33. Transcribe audio files Transcribing audio files into text is a good way to make extra money. As a transcriptionist, you listen to audio recordings and type what you hear. This job requires good listening and typing skills. You don’t need a lot to get started. Just a computer, internet access, and a pair of headphones will do. Many companies pay per audio hour, not the time it takes you to transcribe. Rates can range from $15 to $30 per audio hour. Once you get the hang of it, you might earn $400 a month. You can learn more at 18 Best Online Transcription Jobs For Beginners To Make $2,000 Monthly. 34. Clean houses Cleaning houses is a way to make $400 quickly. People are always looking for help to keep their homes tidy. You can sell your cleaning services to friends, neighbors, or find clients online (you can post an ad on sites like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist). You don’t need much to start. Basic cleaning supplies like sponges, sprays, and rags will do, which is great. You can charge per hour or per job. So, if you charge around $20 to $25 an hour, you can make $400 in just 2 days of work. 35. Sell your wedding dress One quick way to make some cash is by selling your wedding dress. You can get a good amount of money, especially if your dress is from a popular designer or in great condition. There are several websites and stores that buy used wedding dresses. Or, if you want to sell locally, try visiting consignment shops. These stores may take your dress on consignment and pay you when it sells. Or, they might buy it outright, giving you money up front. 36. Do junk removal Junk removal can be a quick way to make $400. Many people need help getting rid of old furniture, appliances, or just clutter. You don’t need special skills, just some muscle and a vehicle to carry the junk. You can find work by advertising on websites like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. Local community boards are also good places to post your services. You can charge by the hour or by the job. Many junk removal services charge a minimum fee of around $100 to $150 per load (and go up from there depending on weight and size). With some hard work, it’s possible to reach the $400 mark in a day or two. 37. Host a garage sale Hosting a garage sale is one of the quickest ways to make $400, especially if you have items you no longer use. You can start by decluttering your home and picking out things like clothes, toys, furniture, kitchen items, and electronics that are just taking up space. The average household has hundreds of thousands of things (yes, that’s not a typo!), so there’s probably something you can sell. Once you’ve gathered your items, pick a weekend to host your sale, preferably when the weather is nice. To attract more buyers, advertise your sale on social media, local community boards, and garage sale websites. You can even team up with neighbors or friends to increase foot traffic. By the end of the weekend, you can easily reach your $400 goal while also clearing out clutter from your home!
