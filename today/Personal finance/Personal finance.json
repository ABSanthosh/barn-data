    "description": "I’m still here! I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "description": "Brian and Michael, both 34, live with their two cats in central Connecticut. Michael works as a project coordinator for a state behavioral health agency serving young people and has a side job as an advocate and disability leadership coordinator. Brian is a quality assurance manager for a state-run hospital. The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back. They’d like our advice on how to unlock this next level of adulting and, crucially, how to be permanently debt-free. What’s a Reader Case Study? Case Studies address financial and life dilemmas that readers of Frugalwoods send in requesting advice. Then, we (that’d be me and YOU, dear reader) read through their situation and provide advice, encouragement, insight and feedback in the comments section.

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/578-the-hidden-cost-of-playing-it-safe-with-money-with-dr-margie-warrell/",
    "description": "Fear blocks smart money moves. Ask Harvard Business Review advisor Dr. Margie Warrell, who guides Fortune 500 companies through strategic risk-taking. Her client roster includes NASA, Morgan Stanley, and Google. Her understanding of courage started at home. Her 13-year-old daughter landed an Australian TV role. She flew to LA for acting classes. There, she learned the hard truth: Success meant waiting tables for 20 years. The daughter's verdict was clear: \"Mum, I don't want it enough.\" This reveals what Dr. Warrell calls the courage gap. It's the space between your current life and the life you could create through brave action. For investors, this gap appears daily. It's the distance between dreaming of financial independence and taking concrete steps toward building wealth. Drawing on her doctoral research and Fortune 500 consulting experience, Dr. Warrell outlines five critical steps to bridge this gap: 1. Focus on what you want, not what you fear. Our brains have a negativity bias — we're twice as sensitive to potential losses as potential gains. This explains why market downturns feel more intense than upswings. 2. Rewrite your story. The narratives we tell ourselves shape our actions. Perhaps you see yourself as \"too risk-averse\" to start a business or \"not smart enough\" to understand investing. Reframe these stories so you can take smart financial risks. 3. Embody courage physically. Fear lives in our bodies — whether it's anxiety about making your first investment or launching a side business. Try simple practices like deep breathing when facing big financial decisions. 4. Step into discomfort. Growth and comfort can't coexist. Every successful investor and entrepreneur started as a beginner. Financial literacy and business acumen develops through consistent practice. 5. Find the treasure when you trip. Market corrections, failed business ventures, and investment mistakes are learning opportunities. Dr. Warrell emphasizes that courage isn't about waiting until you feel confident — it's about acting despite your fears. This applies whether you're making your first stock purchase, buying your first rental property, or quitting your job to start a business. The takeaway: While you can't control market conditions or business outcomes, you can control your response to financial fears.",
