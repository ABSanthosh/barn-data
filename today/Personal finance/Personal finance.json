I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

    "link": "https://affordanything.com/608-the-stoic-path-to-wealth-with-billionaire-investor-and-philanthropist-robert-rosenkrantz/",
    "description": "At age seven, Robert Rosenkrantz made a decision that would shape his entire life: he would take full responsibility for his future. As a child, Rosenkrantz watched his parents struggle financially. His father was unemployed for two years, and his mother worked as a drugstore clerk. Their financial insecurity was painfully obvious to young Robert. He never knew if the electricity or telephone service would be shut off. But rather than seeing this as an obstacle, he saw it as a path to self-reliance. By age 14, Rosenkrantz was managing investments for his family. By 35, he had amassed $400,000 — equivalent to about $4 million today. Then came the pivotal moment that changed everything: a negotiation with wealthy entrepreneur Joe Mailman. When Mailman expressed concerns about traditional investment structures that created a \"heads you win, tails I lose\" scenario, Rosenkrantz made a bold counter-offer. He put his entire liquid net worth at risk in exchange for a 50/50 profit split with no carried interest. \"First deal, we lost $100,000. The second one, we made $100 million,\" Rosenkrantz says during the interview. \"So it averaged out.\" Now 82, Rosenkrantz joins us to discuss his book, \"The Stoic Capitalist,\" and the principles that guided his career. For over 35 years, he's carried the same negotiation card from \"Getting to Yes\" in his wallet — a reminder that negotiation isn't about winning, but solving problems together. We talk about his counterintuitive investment philosophy: look for companies that require minimal specialized talent, like laundromats or self-storage facilities. He says these often make better investments than those needing exceptional management, like restaurants. This principle guided his first major success, a lawn and garden products business that essentially put dirt in bags — a simple operation that became a regional monopoly and eventually sold for $100 million. Today, Rosenkrantz funds scientific research on longevity and hosts debate programs that present balanced perspectives on contentious issues. His philanthropy includes backing a groundbreaking study that has extended worm lifespans from 15 days to over 250 days — potentially the longest lifespan extension ever achieved in any organism. When asked about retirement, he responds: \"How do you spell that?\" His advice for decision-making comes straight from stoic philosophy: focus only on what you can control — the present and future, not the past. This means disregarding sunk costs completely when making decisions and using reason to regulate emotions. For Rosenkrantz, counting the zeros — focusing only on opportunities with enough potential impact — helps prioritize time and delegate effectively. At 82, he still practices these principles daily, considering himself \"biologically more like 70 and getting younger.\"",

A full two months after the death of my mother, the fog has lifted and I find that I'm motivated to pursue productive pursuits once more. I spent much of the past several weeks doing some serious soul-searching. It's clear to me (and to Kim) that above all else, I need to make 2023 the year of me. 2023 — The Year of Me More than a decade ago, I got into the habit of theming my years and months. It was fun! It was also fruitful. Whenever I decided to devote a span of time to one thing, I had great results, whether it was with fitness or writing or dating. This habit of theming lasted for a couple of years, then fell by the wayside.\u003c/",

    "description": "A memory came to me this morning while I was walking the dog, a memory of those days when I was fresh out of college and just beginning to work for my father at the box factory. A salesman had come knocking on our door. This was strange since the box factory was (and still is) located in a rural area. But somehow this guy had found us and he was there to make his pitch: He was a salesman who trained salesmen. (And, presumably, saleswomen although this wasn't part of the spiel in 1992.) Dad, amused, introduced this fellow to me. \"This is J.D.,\" Dad said. \"He's our salesman. Talk to him.\" So, this guy sat down with me in a back room of the shabby trailer house that served as company HQ. (This was the very trailer house I'd grown up in. And trust me when I say it was a pit, a sty. It was just as bad as you're imagining. Maybe worse.)",
