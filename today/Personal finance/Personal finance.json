    "link": "https://affordanything.com/565-codie-sanchez-from-wall-street-to-washing-machines/",
    "description": "When Codie Sanchez worked in finance, she wasn't planning to buy a laundromat. But facing 60-70 hour workweeks and realizing she didn't want her boss's job, she started looking for an exit strategy. Instead of buying a fancy car during her \"midlife crisis,\" she purchased that first laundromat - a decision that would lead her to acquire multiple laundromats, car washes, and other local businesses. Codie joins us to break down how regular people can buy and run profitable local businesses, even without previous ownership experience. These \"Main Street\" businesses - think laundromats, car washes, landscaping companies, and other local services - often generate steady cash flow without requiring complex technology or massive scale. She shares eye-opening stats about business ownership in America: while 80 percent of Americans owned a business in the 1800s, today that number has dropped to just 6 percent. Meanwhile, private equity firms have increased their ownership of small businesses from 4 percent in 2000 to 20 percent by 2020. But there's good news for aspiring business owners. Codie breaks down 21 different ways to finance a business acquisition, from seller financing to equipment loans. She explains that 60 percent of businesses sell with some form of seller financing, making ownership more accessible than many realize. Want to avoid common pitfalls? Codie introduces her RICH framework: - Research: Define what type of business fits your goals and skills - Invest: Get skin in the game, but never risk bankruptcy - Command: Use systems and metrics to avoid accidentally buying yourself a job - Harness: Build toward bigger goals if desired She emphasizes starting small — master one business before attempting to build an empire. A successful acquisition requires understanding the \"roadmap to making money\" - the 5-7 key steps that drive profit in any business. The numbers tell an encouraging story: while 90 percent of startups fail within 10 years, small business acquisitions have a 75-95 percent success rate. Codie attributes this to buying proven business models rather than starting from scratch. Perhaps most importantly, she challenges the notion that \"boring\" businesses can't generate serious wealth. From a roofing company founder becoming one of the world's wealthiest women to a garbage collection entrepreneur building a billion-dollar enterprise, Main Street businesses have created numerous millionaires and billionaires.

Sure, we added 227,000 jobs - way more than anyone expected. Healthcare and hospitality are booming. But here's what you need to watch: our unemployment rate just climbed to 4.2%. When you look at how many people are joining or leaving the workforce, you'll spot some interesting signals about where we're headed. You've probably heard about these new trade proposals making waves. They're targeting our biggest trading partners - Mexico, Canada, and China. Let's talk about what tariffs really mean for your wallet. Some industries win, others lose. Your grocery bill? That might change. Your job prospects? That depends on your industry. We'll help you connect these dots. This matters because you need to know how these shifts affect your money, your job, and your business decisions. Our markets are changing. Our policies are evolving. But when you understand what's happening, you can make smarter moves. Join us as we break down these economic changes into practical insights you can actually use.",

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",
