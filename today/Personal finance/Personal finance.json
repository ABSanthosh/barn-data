    "link": "https://affordanything.com/567-lessons-from-high-stakes-decisions-with-polina-marinova-pompliano/",
    "description": "What happens when an astronaut goes blind during a spacewalk? For Chris Hadfield, this wasn't a hypothetical scenario. While working outside the International Space Station, cleaning solution from his helmet visor spread into both eyes, leaving him completely blind in the vacuum of space. His response? Stay calm and methodically evaluate options. He could call Houston. He could have a crew member rescue him. He could try to cry to flush out his eyes - though that's tricky in zero gravity. This story opens our conversation with Polina Marinova Pompliano, former Fortune Magazine reporter and author of the new book \"Hidden Genius.\" Through her interviews with high-performers across fields — from astronauts to investors to extreme athletes — she uncovers patterns in how people handle uncertainty and build resilience. Take trust, for example. Reid Hoffman's formula is simple: Trust = Consistency + Time. It's not enough to show up sporadically when it's convenient. Trust builds through meeting deadlines, following through on commitments, and maintaining clear communication — even during challenges. Reliable consistency compounds over time, much like interest in an investment account. Or consider Charlie Munger's approach to beliefs. Rather than defending positions \"to the death,\" he argues you should only claim to believe something if you can argue the opposition's viewpoint better than they can. This forces you to genuinely understand different perspectives rather than just reflexively disagreeing. The conversation explores how people navigate major setbacks, from Conrad Anker surviving an avalanche that killed his climbing partners to Polina's own experience of quitting Fortune magazine right before COVID hit. A key theme emerges: resilience isn't about avoiding difficulty, but about training yourself to handle it through small daily practices. Former Navy SEAL David Goggins calls this \"callusing the mind.\" By deliberately doing one uncomfortable thing each day - whether that's running in the rain or having a difficult conversation - you build your capacity to handle larger challenges. The goal isn't to become superhuman, but to expand your comfort zone step by step.",

I took an unplanned (and therefore unannounced) break from writing the blog, which was intended to be for a week, but expanded to a month and then two months… WHOOPS. I confess I needed some time off from ye olde Frugalwoods after consistently posting for 9.5 years. That’s the longest I’ve ever done any one job and I realized during this impromptu hiatus that I–gasp–MISSED writing and MISSED all of you. Sometimes one must have some absence in order for one to realize what one misses. So, I’m checking in to let you know that I haven’t died or abandoned Frugalwoods, but that I am trying to discern how often I’ll write going forward. The days of thrice weekly posts are definitively over, but on the other extreme, I don’t particularly want to take full months off again either. Thank you for your patience as I–once again–figure out what I want to do with my life. Continue reading I’m Still Alive; also, join the 7th Annual Uber Frugal Month Group Challenge! at Frugalwoods.",

The couple’s been together since 2013 and looks forward to celebrating their 10-year anniversary in November. While Brian and Michael have achieved a lot, they feel as though their debt and lack of home ownership is holding them back.
