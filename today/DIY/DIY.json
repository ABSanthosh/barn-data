With a new Find My update, you can ditch the passive approach and be more proactive about recovering your tracker by sharing its information with trusted contacts and even airlines, allowing them to track your tracker for you. Now, when you lose AirTagged luggage or Find My accessories at the airport, you can skip the stressful hours — sometimes even days — of dealing with the airline to retrieve it from who knows where.
