    "description": "Safari is always evolving, but most of its improvements happen behind the scenes, making the web feel faster, more secure, and more polished without you even noticing. There aren't any flashy new browser UI changes in iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, but it does upgrade what Safari is capable of in small but meaningful ways. With Safari 18.4, you get a handful of quiet but meaningful upgrades that make modern websites work more smoothly, securely, and responsively. Whether it's checking a site's identity, enjoying better color pickers, or having your scroll-to-text links work more reliably, these changes are the kind that web developers get excited about — and everyday users benefit from, often without even noticing. Here's what's new — and why it matters. You can now check a website's security details like a proEver tap a suspicious link and wonder, \"Is this site legit?\" Safari now helps you dig deeper. In iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4, you can tap the Page Menu icon in the address bar, hit the...more",

    "link": "https://next.reality.news/news/apple-vision-pro-sequels/",
    "description": "The Vision Pro made its splash, earned its headlines, and — for most people — quietly drifted into the \"cool, but not $3,500 cool\" category. Now, Apple appears to be rethinking its approach to spatial computing, with not one but two new headsets reportedly in the works: a lighter, cheaper version of the Vision Pro and a more powerful model that tethers to a Mac via USB-C. If that feels like a pivot, that's because it is. After positioning the Vision Pro as a self-contained, all-in-one leap into the post-screen future, Apple seems to be hedging. One model trims features to chase a wider audience. The other leans into performance, even if that means bringing back a cable. The company hasn't confirmed anything (because of course it hasn't), but the message is clear: Apple's spatial road map now forks in two, and both paths lead away from the Vision Pro we know.
