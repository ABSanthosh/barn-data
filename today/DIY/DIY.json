    "description": "Your iPhone has a powerful feature that can keep your secrets hidden from other people. With it, you'll never have to worry about sharing or showing someone something embarrassing or incriminating ever again. No matter who you are, you likely use your iPhone's Photos app a lot since anything you take a picture or video of using the stock Camera app — and many other camera apps — lands there. And the chances that you have an image or video you don't want anyone ever to see are high. It could be evidence to implicate you in cheating or lying, pictures of your feces to show your doctor, unedited or sexualized selfies, screenshots of login credentials or tax documents, spy pics, saved nude sexts, or practically anything else you'd like to remain for your eyes only. Since it's easy to accidentally include one of your for-you-only photos or videos when sharing an album with iCloud friends, texting a group of images, AirPlaying a slideshow, or viewing your Photos widget on the Home Screen or...more",

    "description": "The thinnest Galaxy ever feels incredible in the hand, but its diet comes with sacrifices you need to know about before spending $1,099. Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is the most head‑turning phone the company has built in years. At just 5.8 mm thick, it's slimmer than the S25 Plus, yet it has a flagship‑grade processor and the same 200 MP primary camera you'll find in the Ultra. Sounds perfect, right? Not quite. Shrinking a phone to near‑razor thinness forces compromises in battery life, camera versatility, and charging speed — all while matching the S25 Plus's $1,099 price. Below, you'll find the full specs, initial impressions, real‑world battery numbers, preorder bonuses, and a reality check on who should — and shouldn't — buy this skinny legend.
