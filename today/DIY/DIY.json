    "description": "Apple's official feature list for the Music app on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 may highlight only one update, but there's much more happening under the surface than that. Whether you subscribe to Apple Music, the latest version brings hidden gems that enhance your up-next queue, playlists, and overall experience. At first glance, the new features and changes might seem subtle or even nonexistent on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, both released on Sept. 16, but a closer look reveals Apple's focus on refining the interface, boosting intelligence, and giving you greater control over your music library.
