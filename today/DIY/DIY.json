    "description": "How will the new tariffs impact VR and AR? In short, they'll likely make headsets more expensive, slow down production, and force some serious changes in how these devices are made and sold. What you need to know: VR and tariffsNew tariffs are already active — The US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, and China responded with 84% tariffs on US goods. Most countries are affected, not just China. Headsets are about to get pricier — Components for VR/AR devices are heavily globalized, and tariffs will likely drive up production costs and retail prices. Mid-tier hardware is most at risk — Budget and premium devices may survive, but the $400–$800 segment could shrink or stall out. Yesterday, the US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. This morning, China hit back with an 84% tariff on US goods.

    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18.5-features/",
    "description": "Apple's iOS 18.5 update may be lighter on headline features than its predecessor, but it still brings a few quality-of-life upgrades and behind-the-scenes enhancements that make using your iPhone just a bit smoother. It's a smaller release, but if you dig into the details, you'll find thoughtful refinements across core apps and settings that help simplify tasks and give you more control. From quick access settings in Mail to faster recovery options in Photos, iOS 18.5 trims a few extra steps from your daily workflow. AppleCare \u0026 Warranty details have also been reorganized, and the Back Tap detection banner returns after disappearing in iOS 18.4. Plus, Apple Wallet may soon support digital car keys for another vehicle brand. While the long-promised Apple Intelligence-powered Siri experience is still absent, iOS 18.5 continues laying the groundwork with subtle under-the-hood changes. And as usual, many of these features may also appear in iPadOS 18.5 for iPads. Here's a full look at...more",
