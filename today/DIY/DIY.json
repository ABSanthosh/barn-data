    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/using-your-iphone-compass/",
    "description": "With so many useful native and third-party apps available on iPhone, the Compass app often goes unnoticed. It may not be as essential as Messages, Photos, or Mail, but you can still get plenty of use out of it, especially if you're a hiker, camper, or someone who enjoys outdoor adventures. One of the best features of the Compass app is that it works offline, relying on your device's GPS and magnetometer rather than cellular service. This means it's just as effective in remote areas as it is in urban settings. While navigating, you can also turn on Airplane Mode or Low Power Mode to conserve battery power. For added security, download offline maps in Apple Maps before heading out. Here's a breakdown of all the features in the Compass app, a simple yet powerful tool with everything you need on a single screen. (We're showing it off on iOS 18, but it will work similarly on older iOS versions.) Determine your direction in degreesThe Compass app displays your current direction and a...more",

    "description": "Your days as an ordinary Muggle are over — as long as you have an iPhone. With just a word or two, you can use your iPhone and newfound Muggle-born powers to cast spells or utilize charms just like Harry Potter and team. Only your \"wand\" is from Apple, not Ollivanders in Diagon Alley. Whether you're a Muggle-born witch or wizard, there are at least three spells and summoning charms built into Siri that you can conjure up on your iPhone using Talk to Siri or Type to Siri. And you don't even need to attend Hogwarts to learn them! But why stop there? You can also program Siri to use even more incantations from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter — the possibilities are endless, limited only by your imagination. Don't Miss Out: Huge Savings on Babbel Language Learning – Lifetime Subscription (All Languages) Siri tipsThere are two different Siri modes: Talk to Siri or Type to Siri. For Talk to Siri, you can say \"Hey Siri\" and/or \"Siri\" followed by your spell. If you don't want to use a...more",
