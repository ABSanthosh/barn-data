    "description": "Why are there no official Star Wars emoji in the Unicode Standard? We've got the Vulcan Salute from Star Trek, so where's the force choke hand gesture?! While you may never see Star Wars officially invade your emoji keyboard, there are ways to send Star Wars emoji and stickers to your friends in your favorite chat app. What are Star Wars emoji?First, before you start spamming your conversations with Baby Yoda and Darth Vader, know that none of these are official emoji. Actual emoji on your device's keyboard are part of the Unicode Standard, which receives updates frequently. For instance, Apple pushed out its latest emoji update with iOS 18.4. However, just because the Star Wars emoji in this guide aren't official emoji doesn't mean they aren't technically emoji.

And if you happen to be reading on May 4, may the 4th be with you. Seasoned denizens of the galaxy far, far away have been trading ASCII X‑wings since dial‑up. Today, iOS gives us far cleaner weapons: Disney‑licensed sticker packs, emoji‑like cutouts you can lift straight from Photos, and a few other sneaky Force tricks. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just here for the Baby Yoda stickers, you'll find everything you need in this guide — no risk of wandering into the Mos Eisley cantina unarmed. All these holocron-grade tricks live in Messages, but any app that handles emoji and stickers can decode them.
