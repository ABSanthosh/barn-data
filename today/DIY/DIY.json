    "description": "If you can't always see what you're typing very well on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, you no longer have to adjust the font size for the app or entire system just to read your writing more easily. One of Apple's newer Accessibility features gives you a customizable, magnified view in a floating window so you can see every character with crystal-clear clarity in real time.

If you primarily use a third-party web browser like Chrome or Firefox on your computer or tablet, changing your default iOS web browser allows you to have a synced web browsing experience across all your devices. Whether you're a fan of Chrome's seamless sync with your Google account, Firefox's privacy features, or another browser's unique tools, you can set it as your default for all hyperlinks across your iPhone.
