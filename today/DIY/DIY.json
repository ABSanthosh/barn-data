    "description": "The thinnest Galaxy ever feels incredible in the hand, but its diet comes with sacrifices you need to know about before spending $1,099. Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is the most head‑turning phone the company has built in years. At just 5.8 mm thick, it's slimmer than the S25 Plus, yet it has a flagship‑grade processor and the same 200 MP primary camera you'll find in the Ultra. Sounds perfect, right? Not quite. Shrinking a phone to near‑razor thinness forces compromises in battery life, camera versatility, and charging speed — all while matching the S25 Plus's $1,099 price. Below, you'll find the full specs, initial impressions, real‑world battery numbers, preorder bonuses, and a reality check on who should — and shouldn't — buy this skinny legend.

    "description": "There's an ongoing debate about whether or not it's safe or even desirable to rinse meat before cooking it. Many fall into the anti-rinsing camp, saying that it's not effective at dislodging bacteria, especially on poultry, as we've discussed before. Meanwhile, some argue that rinsing certain meats, like bacon, can rinse away excess surface salt and may reduce shrinkage — though evidence is strictly anecdotal. Washing meat with a gentle acid: a cultural practice, not a safety guaranteeIn many West Indian and Caribbean kitchens, it's a common practice to rinse chicken and fish with a mild acid like lemon, lime, or vinegar prior to cooking. For example, Haitian stewed chicken (poule en sauce) is prepared by washing the chicken with sour orange juice or vinegar before cooking. Cooks say it freshens the smell, removes surface slime, and adds subtle tang.
