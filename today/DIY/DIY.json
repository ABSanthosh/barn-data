With just a few Terminal commands, you can convert audio and video files into accurate text in minutes. If you've never touched Terminal before, don't worry — setting up Whisper on macOS Sequoia 15 is easier than it looks and worth it.

Whisper is a free, open-source speech-to-text neural network from OpenAI that runs entirely on your machine — no internet required after setup. Once you get it going, it's fast, secure, and dead simple — and it can chew through just about any audio or video format you throw at it.
