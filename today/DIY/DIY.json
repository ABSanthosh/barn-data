    "description": "Even if you don't know a gundark from a gonk droid, you can still sling Baby Yoda stickers and lightsaber emoji like a seasoned Jedi Master. And if you happen to be reading on May 4, may the 4th be with you. Seasoned denizens of the galaxy far, far away have been trading ASCII X‑wings since dial‑up. Today, iOS gives us far cleaner weapons: Disney‑licensed sticker packs, emoji‑like cutouts you can lift straight from Photos, and a few other sneaky Force tricks. This guide walks through every reliable method — explaining lore along the way so casual fans don't feel like they've wandered into the Mos Eisley cantina unarmed. All these holocron-grade tricks live in Messages, but any app that handles emoji and stickers can decode them. And while the walkthrough uses an iPhone, every method works just as slickly on an iPad — no Jedi temple access required. Raid the free sticker vault in Disney's Star Wars appThink of the official Star Wars app as a...more",

    "link": "https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/pinned-tabs-safari/",
    "description": "Pinned tabs in Safari lock your most-frequented sites to the very top of each Tab Group, so the pages you rely on are never more than two quick taps away. Whether you juggle dozens of tabs at work, plan a vacation in a dedicated group, or jump between personal and professional Safari profiles, pins keep your most important websites front and center. While you could pin tabs in Safari on macOS since 2015, pinning tabs wasn't possible on iPhone and iPad until the Safari 16 update came with iOS 16 and iPadOS 16. Combined with Tab Groups, tab pinning is the easiest way to create topic‑specific \"bookmarks\" that live inside the browsing context you're already using. Add Safari profiles into the mix, and you have a three‑layer system (Profiles → Tab Groups → Pins) that can keep even the busiest browser beautifully organized.
