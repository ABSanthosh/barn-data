    "description": "With Apple's Photos app, you no longer need a third-party tool on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to blur or pixelate faces in your photos, helping you safeguard identities when sharing online. Introduced in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, the Photos app has a built-in Clean Up tool that can remove and intelligently replace unwanted and distracting elements in photos, such as photobombers, imperfections, embarrassing objects, and other details you don't want anyone else to see. But it also has a hidden superpower: it can pixelate people's faces with a safety filter. Don't Miss: How to Remove Unwanted Objects, People, and Distractions in Photos on Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac To use the new safety filter in Photos, you'll need to be running the latest software, but you'll also need a device that supports Apple Intelligence — the backbone of the new privacy filter. That means it only works on the iPhone 15 Pro series, any iPhone 16 model, and iPads or Macs with M1 or A17 Pro chips...more",

    "description": "When typing an email or website address in a compatible input field on an iPhone, most people will manually type in the domain extension. But there's a much faster way to enter domain suffixes for email addresses and website URLs that you should be using on your keyboard. Even better, there's a way to customize what domain extensions appear in the keyboard shortcut. Domain extensions or suffixes, officially known as top-level domains (TLDs), are the last part of an email or web address, following the root domain, and they begin with a dot. I'm sure you all know about .com and other popular TLDs like .edu, .gov, .net, .co.uk, and .org. Here are a few examples: gadgethacks.com gthx.app test@gadgethacks.com Typing domain extensions fasterThere's a hidden keyboard shortcut on your iPhone or iPad that allows you to type TLDs more quickly. To use it, simply touch and hold (or long press) the period (.) key on your keyboard, keep your finger on the screen, and then slide your finger to a TLD...more",
