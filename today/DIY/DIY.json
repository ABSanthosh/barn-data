    "link": "https://ios.gadgethacks.com/news/ios-18.3-features/",
    "description": "Apple is gearing up to release iOS 18.3, its latest software update for iPhone, and it could hit devices as early as the last week of January. While it's not as feature-packed as the previous updates for iOS 18.2 and iOS 18.1 were, there are still a few important changes you'll want to know about. Aside from the return of a critical Calculator feature, most of the changes in iOS 18.3 apply to iPhone models that support Apple Intelligence. Those would be the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models. The new emoji from Unicode 16 are also missing from this update but are expected to arrive with iOS 18.4. Note: Many of these features and changes also apply to iPads running iPadOS 18.3 and Macs running macOS Sequoia 15.3. Apple Intelligence Enabled by DefaultAccording to Apple's release notes for developers, you'll automatically be opted into Apple Intelligence after upgrading a supported device to iOS 18.3.

    "description": "Apple's Freeform app levels up with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, offering you new features to enhance creativity, collaboration, and organization. While some updates, like the new Scenes feature, are prominent, others are more subtle but just as powerful. This incredible app's versatile features work equally well on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. If you haven't updated to iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 yet, it's definitely worth it for Freeform's upgraded capabilities. Many of these features also work on macOS Sequoia 15. The updates cater to a wide range of users, from casual planners to professional teams working on large projects. Freeform's improvements also beautifully integrate with other Apple ecosystem features, including iCloud, Siri, and Apple Intelligence. If you enjoyed the app's earlier ability to create freehand sketches and collaborative boards, this update expands on those strengths with new tools designed to make your workflow smoother and your projects more polished.
