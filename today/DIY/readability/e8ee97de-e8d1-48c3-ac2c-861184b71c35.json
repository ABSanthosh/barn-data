  "text": "Passkeys are very useful for logging into websites without a password, but you need an external manager to store and use them. Password managers are beginning to introduce passkey support, but some big names still haven't gotten around to adding it. Fortunately, you can now cross LastPass off of that list, as you can now store passkeys on it...with a few catches. LastPass Passkey Support Enters Beta Testing for Google Chrome Only As announced on the LastPass blog, you can start using passkeys on the app's beta branch. There are a few major differences between passwords and passkeys, but the main idea behind passkeys is that your computer handles the authentication process instead of relying on a user-created password. LastPass adds a long list of restrictions at the end of its blog post that's worth checking out if you want to use this feature. Some highlights include: You can only use passkeys in desktop environments. You can only use passkeys on Google Chrome. You cannot copy or clone your passwords. You only get one passkey per service, per device, per account. Someone using your account via LastPass's Emergency Access feature cannot use your passkeys. This is all assuming you can stomach using the service. After all, LastPass has suffered multiple data breaches, so you may be better off using a LastPass alternative that supports passkeys instead.",
