It’s practical, unassuming and one of the most popular IKEA pieces for budget-friendly decor.But just when we thought we’d seen it all, design producer Justin Miller who goes by the handle @miztermiller on Instagram, gives this humble shelf a fresh twist and got us looking at the simple, chunky shelf with renewed fondness.Miller’s latest hack transforms five 74-inch LACK shelves into a sleek, floating wall-mounted bookshelf unit to spruce up the ugliest wall (as he calls it, not me) in his whole apartment. IKEA LACK Wall-Mounted Bookshelf What I love about this hack is its simplicity: Miller uses nothing but five LACK shelves, some double-sided nails, and a bit of glue. The quote, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts”, comes to mind. “Basically, I screwed four of the shelves into a box and hung them on the top bracket, so I’ll know where to put the bottom bracket,” he explains. In the tutorial video, the process is surprisingly straightforward. Miller forms the frame by attaching the left and right shelves to the outer ends of the top and bottom shelves, creating a square. To attach them without visible screws or nails, he uses double-sided nails, utilizing the little tool that comes with them to hammer them in. He also points out the end piece of the LACK shelf containing more material. That’s where you’ll want to add in a few extra nails for a more secure connection. To further strengthen the structure, Miller recommends using wood glue on the surfaces before hammering the shelves together, using a scrap piece of wood to protect the LACK shelf from the force of the hammer. When all that is done, let the wood glue dry thoroughly before moving on to the wall installation. Wall Installation Using a laser level, Miller marks the desired height for the shelves, ensuring everything is perfectly aligned. He then uses anchors to attach the frame to the drywall, repeating the process for the bottom shelf.Lastly, he added another LACK shelf near the bottom and hung a piece of art in the middle. Bringing it all together Photo Credit: Justin Miller @miztermiller | Instagram What does Miller think of the transformation of the ugliest wall in his apartment? He says, “I love it and I think it’s so much more interesting than just floating IKEA shelves.” He completes the corner of his living room with a curved desk that ties in beautifully with the new shelf unit. He’s also considering painting the wall behind the unit, which could add an extra layer of visual interest to the design. We can only wait for phase two of his room makeover to see how it all comes together, which I’m sure will turn out fabulous. Sparking ideas and adaptions His followers love the hack. It immediately sparked an idea in one commenter, “I especially love the art in the middle but I think I might use a frame TV!” Another follower saw potential beyond the living room, suggesting it would be ideal for framing up a bay window.With the new lower price on LACK shelves, ($29.99 compared to the previous $39.99), now is the best time to add these to your cart and start hacking your version of Miller’s big impact wall-mounted bookshelf.Watch Miller’s tutorial in the reel below.
