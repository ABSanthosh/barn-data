  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Justin Duino / How-To Geek Summary Samsung is unveiling the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 on July 9th with pre-reserve bonuses. Pre-reserving offers a $50 Samsung Credit, triple reward points, and a chance to win $5,000. Rumors suggest a thinner Z Fold 7 with a bigger display, a Z Flip 7 with a larger cover display \u0026 Coral Red option. Summer is heating up, and so is the foldable phone market. Samsung is gearing up to unveil its next generation of Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip devices, and if you've been eyeing a foldable, you’re about to have some new options to consider. As per usual, the rumor mill has been churning for months, but Samsung is finally set to officially announce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 during Unpacked on July 9th. But why wait when you can get a head start? By pre-reserving (not pre-ordering) your device through Samsung.com or the Samsung Shop App, you’ll get some nice bonuses. First off, you'll instantly get a $50 Samsung Credit. This is a credit you can put towards other Samsung ecosystem purchases when you finally pre-order your new phone. Thinking about a new pair of Galaxy Buds or a Galaxy Watch to go with your shiny new foldable? It doesn’t appear that you can use the $50 on the phones themselves, unfortunately. Related The Galaxy Z Flip 7 Might Have a Surprising Hardware Change Here at How-To Geek, we don't typically cover a lot of leaks or rumors because they can be, and often are, completely wrong or blown out of proportion. You never know when something's actually true until it's official. If this one is true, however, it might end up changing your summer purchase plans if you were waiting for this year's new Samsung foldables. Beyond the immediate credit, Samsung is also tossing in triple Samsung reward points on your pre-order purchase. If you're already in the Samsung ecosystem, you know how quickly those points can add up for future discounts and exclusive offers. It's a nice little incentive to keep you coming back. And if that wasn't enough, by reserving your spot, you're automatically entered into a sweepstakes with a grand prize of $5,000. Now, about the phones themselves. Leaks and rumors suggest Samsung is pushing the envelope a bit more this year. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to be noticeably thinner and lighter than its predecessors, addressing one of the biggest complaints about past Fold models. There have also been reports of a larger main display and potentially a switch back to a punch-hole camera on both the inner and outer screens for improved image quality, moving away from the less-than-stellar under-display camera technology. As for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, expect a larger cover display, bringing it more in line with the Motorola Razr line. This should make the outer screen far more useful for quick glances and interactions without needing to unfold your device constantly. We might also see a new \"Coral Red\" color option, adding a vibrant touch to the lineup. Both devices are expected to pack faster processors, and Samsung will probably match the Galaxy S25 series with a bundled six-month subscription to Google AI Pro. So, while the official reveal is still a couple of weeks away, you don't have to sit on your hands. Secure your pre-reserve bonuses now, and you'll be ready when the pre-orders open up next month. Related How Buying an Expensive Foldable Phone Has Saved Me Money I didn't have my heart set on a book-style foldable phone right away. Like many, I wrote them off as too expensive. But after taking a chance on one this year, it has turned out to be quite the cost-saving investment.",

You never know when something\u0026#39;s actually true until it\u0026#39;s official. If this one is true, however, it might end up changing your summer purchase plans if you were waiting for this year\u0026#39;s new Samsung foldables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n                \t\n\n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the immediate credit, Samsung is also tossing in triple Samsung reward points on your pre-order purchase. If you\u0026#39;re already in the Samsung ecosystem, you know how quickly those points can add up for future discounts and exclusive offers. It\u0026#39;s a nice little incentive to keep you coming back. And if that wasn\u0026#39;t enough, by reserving your spot, you\u0026#39;re automatically entered into a sweepstakes with a grand prize of $5,000.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eNow, about the phones themselves. Leaks and rumors suggest Samsung is pushing the envelope a bit more this year. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to be noticeably thinner and lighter than its predecessors, addressing one of the biggest complaints about past Fold models. There have also been reports of a larger main display and potentially a switch back to a punch-hole camera on both the inner and outer screens for improved image quality, moving away from the less-than-stellar under-display camera technology.\u003c/p\u003e        \n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, expect a larger cover display, bringing it more in line with the Motorola Razr line. This should make the outer screen far more useful for quick glances and interactions \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/flip-style-foldable-minimalist-phone-youll-actually-enjoy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewithout needing to unfold your device constantly\u003c/a\u003e. We might also see a new \u0026#34;Coral Red\u0026#34; color option, adding a vibrant touch to the lineup. Both devices are expected to pack \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-no-snapdragon/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efaster processors\u003c/a\u003e, and Samsung will probably match the Galaxy S25 series with a bundled six-month subscription to Google AI Pro.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eSo, while the official reveal is still a couple of weeks away, you don\u0026#39;t have to sit on your hands.
