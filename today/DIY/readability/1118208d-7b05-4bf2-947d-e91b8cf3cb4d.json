  "text": "Identity Theft Sign in to your MUO account Plenty of apps claim to protect your identity online, but rarely do they put their money where their mouth is. NordVPN aims to change that with its new NordProtect service, which claims to offer up to $1 million in compensation for damages if it fails to do its job properly. NordVPN's NordProtect Service Will Reimburse Lost Wages and Legal Fees A NordVPN blog details how NordProtect works. It comes with two flagship features: the first is a dark web monitor that keeps an eye on personal data leaks and alerts you if your details appear in one. The second keeps tabs on your credit score and reports when it notices strange activity, like someone taking out a card in your name. NordVPN seems so confident in its ability to protect you with NordProtect that it's willing to compensate you if it fails: Itâ€™ll take time and financial resources to deal with the consequences of identity theft. You might even have to take time off work. With NordProtect, you can apply for reimbursement of eligible expenses up to $1M. These expenses may include credit bureau reports, replacement of documents, application fees, legal fees, lost wages, and mental health counseling. NordVPN states that it will also assign you an identity restoration case manager if it accepts your case. The manager will then do all of the work required to get your identity back and prevent any further damage. If you want to use NordProtect, you'll need to perform a few steps. First, you must be in the US to take advantage of this service. Second, you need to subscribe to NordVPN Prime, which is the highest subscription tier.
