TikTok's Shop is far from alone with these issues, but you'll be much safer shopping there if you know how to spot these red flags. 4 Fake Reviews Fake reviews are common on many online platforms, including big-name marketplaces like Amazon and Temu. So, it's no surprise to see such reviews on TikTok Shop, too. When I started browsing TikTok Shop, I quickly noticed that some products had extremely high ratings, accompanied by glowing comments, all posted on the same day or within a very short timeframe. But when I scrolled further, I came across many not-so-great reviews from what I can only assume were real buyers. Now, it's possible that a few customers genuinely loved their purchases and left positive feedback right away. However, this becomes difficult to believe when the phrasing of multiple comments is similar or identical, and you have another set of reviews that describe a wide range of problems with the product. So, although it might be safe to purchase from TikTok Shop, don't make the mistake of just looking at the first few reviews. It's fairly easy for dishonest sellers to bury honest criticism under multiple positive reviews. Related Here's How I Spot Fake Reviews on Temu Temu has amazing deals, but you need to be careful about what you buy. 3 Deals That Are Too Good to Be True TikTok Shop is full of listings that seem almost too good to pass up. Numerous products, for instance, are marked down by 70% or more, and others are marked as clearance items. These are over and above vouchers that offer extra discounts if your order meets a certain dollar value. I like deals as much as the next person, but when discounts get this steep, it's not always a good sign. If what otherwise costs around $100 is marked down to, say, $20, there's a good chance that the item you receive won't be high-quality. This isn't always a problem, but if you prefer buying products that will last you a while, you're best off looking at products that aren't priced really low. Make sure to also check the reviews, images, and product descriptions before you commit to buying anything. While mixed reviews are common, it's best to skip the product if you see more negative reviews than positive. Also, pay attention to the product details and how they correspond to the images shared by the seller. If the product details mention details you can't verify in the photos, that's a clear sign to move on. 2 Knockoff Products Another risk you run when shopping on an online marketplace is the chance of ending up with a knockoff or counterfeit product. Sellers can make listings look extremely convincing by using stolen photos or generously editing their own images to hide any flaws. Some vendors even inflate the original price of the item to make it seem like you're receiving a substantial discount. Of course, this doesn't matter as much if you're not expecting the product to hold up over time, or if you don't care about it looking exactly as pictured. But if you're spending a good amount of money on something, make sure to research the seller to ensure they have a solid track record. 1 Phishing Scams via Fake Discount Codes There are various types of phishing attacks, and, unfortunately, even platforms like TikTok Shop aren't spared. According to the Better Business Bureau, a number of scammers post on TikTok, posing as disgruntled ex-employees who are eager to share secret discount codes to get back at their former employers. The website or platform they link to might look legitimate at first glance; however, when you navigate to the website and add the \"free\" items, the shipping cost starts to increase. This still feels like a deal because you're getting a discount on the actual product, but the inflated shipping fee is essentially how the scammer makes their money. What's more, when you actually receive the product (that is, if you receive anything at all), it usually looks nothing like what was advertised. Additionally, there's typically no way to submit a complaint or contact the company, and your payment and personal details are already in the hands of the scammer. Although this isn't a scam run through TikTok Shop, it's promoted on TikTok, making it easy for unsuspecting users to get pulled in. Shopping on platforms like TikTok Shop can feel fairly exciting, thanks to the steep discounts and flashy photos and videos. And while there is certainly no dearth of genuine vendors and products on the platform, TikTok Shop also attracts opportunistic sellers looking to scam unsuspecting buyers with knockoffs, fake deals, and misleading reviews. Of course, this doesn't mean you should avoid TikTok Shop altogether. Plenty of people find products they like on the platform, and you can, too, as long as you take the time to do your research.",

Sellers can make listings look extremely convincing by using stolen photos or generously editing their own images to hide any flaws. Some vendors even inflate the original price of the item to make it seem like you\u0026#39;re receiving a substantial discount.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, this doesn\u0026#39;t matter as much if you\u0026#39;re not expecting the product to hold up over time, or if you don\u0026#39;t care about it looking exactly as pictured. But if you\u0026#39;re spending a good amount of money on something, make sure to research the seller to ensure they have a solid track record.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"phishing-scams-via-fake-discount-codes\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Phishing Scams via Fake Discount Codes\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are various \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/types-of-phishing-attacks-you-should-know-about/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etypes of phishing attacks\u003c/a\u003e, and, unfortunately, even platforms like TikTok Shop aren\u0026#39;t spared. According to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbb.org/article/scams/29300-bbb-scam-alert-social-media-discount-code-shopping-scam\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBetter Business Bureau\u003c/a\u003e, a number of scammers post on TikTok, posing as disgruntled ex-employees who are eager to share secret discount codes to get back at their former employers. The website or platform they link to might look legitimate at first glance; however, when you navigate to the website and add the \u0026#34;free\u0026#34; items, the shipping cost starts to increase.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis still feels like a deal because you\u0026#39;re getting a discount on the actual product, but the inflated shipping fee is essentially how the scammer makes their money. What\u0026#39;s more, when you actually receive the product (that is, if you receive anything at all), it usually looks nothing like what was advertised. Additionally, there\u0026#39;s typically no way to submit a complaint or contact the company, and your payment and personal details are already in the hands of the scammer. Although this isn\u0026#39;t a scam run through TikTok Shop, it\u0026#39;s promoted on TikTok, making it easy for unsuspecting users to get pulled in.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eShopping on platforms like TikTok Shop can feel fairly exciting, thanks to the steep discounts and flashy photos and videos. And while there is certainly no dearth of genuine vendors and products on the platform, TikTok Shop also attracts opportunistic sellers looking to scam unsuspecting buyers with knockoffs, fake deals, and misleading reviews.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, this doesn\u0026#39;t mean you should avoid TikTok Shop altogether. Plenty of people find products they like on the platform, and you can, too, as long as you take the time to do your research.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
