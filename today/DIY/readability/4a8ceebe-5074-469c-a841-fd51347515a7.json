I ordered an outdoor dining table for our courtyard so we could enjoy meals al fresco for the next few months. I’m setting it up later today with linens and flameless hurricane candles so it’s ready to go when dinner is served. In just a few days I’ll be celebrating my silver wedding anniversary. Whaaaatt??? I know, crazy! We’ve been married 25 years so we’re taking a trip to Maui next week where we spent our honeymoon. I’m excited, I haven’t been to Hawaii since 2017 so it will be nice to return and enjoy the spirit of aloha for a few days. Favorite links from the week: The prettiest wallpapers and patterns are layered throughout this ‘manor of fact’ residence. This stunning Colorado chateau with French design elements. This lovely home is a nice blend of transitional and farmhouse design. From dated to sleek and modern in a month: this quick kitchen remodel. So many sweet moments in this family friendly craftsman bungalow. Want to preserve the scent of your summer garden flowers? Consider the French enfleurage process. How to get rid of sticky residue on glass and more helpful cleaning hacks. For those who love warm tones: these brown paint colors. I prefer light jackets to cardigans in the fall: I have two colors of these denim jackets (love them). Solo dining is on the rise. Also ten types of strangers and how to converse with them.",
