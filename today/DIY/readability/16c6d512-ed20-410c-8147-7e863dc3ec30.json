  "text": "Apple TV Sign in to your MUO account Soccer fans who are T-Mobile subscribers should be happy to hear about the newest perk from the company. Subscribers Can Nab MLS Season Pass for Free Starting on February 18, 2025, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile postpaid subscribers can nab an MLS Season Pass for free. That’s a $99 value. With the subscription, you can see all live regular-season matches, MLS Cup playoff matches, Leagues Cup, and other programming and content with no blackouts. The league starts play on February 22, 2025. To claim the perk, you can head to the T-Life app for iOS or Android. You can claim the free subscription until March 4, 2025. Since MLS Season Pass is available on Apple TV, you will need to have an Apple Account with a payment method on file. At the end of the 2025 MLS Season, the subscription automatically renews for the 2026 season for $99. So if you don’t want to pay, you will need to cancel one day before the renewal date. You can access all the MLS action with the Apple TV app. It’s available on Apple devices, many smart TVs, streaming devices, and elsewhere. If you’re not a soccer fan, T-Mobile has a variety of other perks for subscribers, like free in-flight Wi-Fi and high-speed data access outside the United States. Metro Flex Plus customers can also receive an Amazon Prime membership for free. T-Mobile hopes that perks like the MLS Season Pass can draw new subscribers and keep existing customers. If you’re in the market for a carrier, take a look at our comparison of Verizon, AT\u0026T, and T-Mobile to help you make the best decision. Giving More Users a Taste of Apple TV Even though MLS isn’t as popular as other major sports leagues in the United States, the arrival of Lionel Messi has increased interest. The free perk for T-Mobile subscribers looks to be a win for soccer fans and Apple, giving even more viewers a look at Apple’s streaming app when watching MLS action.",
