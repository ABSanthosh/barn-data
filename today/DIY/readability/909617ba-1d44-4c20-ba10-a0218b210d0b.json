We were working with a much smaller budget, so a $1,000 changing table (or even a $500 one) was not an option. Therefore, I appreciate repurposing other pieces, as Maxi Marie (@maxis.homestory) did with this IKEA KALLAX changing table hack. If you’re trying to stretch your dollars in your baby’s nursery, I think the changing table is one of the easiest things to DIY. For me, I found a second-hand dresser, solid wood, loaded with storage. My husband sanded and painted it, and we swapped out the hardware and added a changing pad on top. Maxi Marie uses this same concept with the KALLAX, going a step further and adding wheels. The popular KALLAX shelves were one of the most-searched IKEA products last year, so it’s easy to find plenty of KALLAX DIYs. The unit provides opportunities for storage (always a must in a nursery) and a smooth, flat surface for taking care of business. The best part is that this hack is simple, giving you more time to work on your nursery’s finishing touches. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA KALLAX (30 ⅛” x 30 ⅛”) Primer Paint Rollers and brushes Screw gun/drill 4 casters with brakes Heavy-duty adhesive velcro Changing pad Boxes or baskets for storage Towel rod or hooks (optional) Creating a Mobile IKEA Changing Table Photo Credit: Maxi Marie @maxis.homestory | Instagram 1. Paint the KALLAX This step is optional. You might decide to leave the KALLAX as-is. It comes in a few different finishes. However, if you decide to paint, use a quality paint-and-primer combo. Since the finish is so smooth, look for a paint that works with multiple surfaces. Even if it says no sanding is necessary, give the KALLAX a light sanding first to rough it up a bit.  2. Add the Wheels Drill holes in each bottom corner of the KALLAX and install the wheels. Make sure you use castors with brakes so the changing table doesn’t rock and roll while you’re changing diapers. 3. Attach the Changing Pad Use heavy-duty adhesive Velcro to attach the pad to the top of the KALLAX. Look for a changing pad with raised sides to add an extra layer of safety. Some pads also come with safety straps. Test the pad to ensure it is secure and doesn’t slip and slide. 4. Add Storage Use the boxes or baskets of your choice in each cubby to hold diapers, wipes, spare clothes, and supplies. You can change up the storage by adding a KALLAX shelf insert or the KALLAX doors. There are also different drawer inserts available and many other configurations, so you have a lot of flexibility in how you want to set up your storage. Maxi Marie also hangs a rod on the side for additional storage. I did the same thing with my DIY changing table, but I used a basic towel bar. Always Play It Safe When babies are involved, DIY projects take on a whole new level of commitment. It’s not just about looking good and functioning. You need to make sure it’s safe and secure. Most of the comments on this hack were positive, thinking the idea was clever and functional, especially if you’re living in a smaller place. I also love the idea of a mobile changing table. I think back to how much easier it would have been to wheel the changing table into our room at night when our son was sleeping in his bassinet. Or how during the day I could have it in the living room or anywhere else I was with my son. The creator points out getting wheels with brakes. However, what several commenters worried about was the narrow footprint of the KALLAX. They wondered if it would cause safety issues, imagining the baby would easily fall off the side. Honestly, I’ve seen changing tables about the same size. I’ve also heard unfortunate stories of babies falling from large changing tables. The rule when changing a baby is always to keep one hand on them at all times, no matter what the size of the table. So if you’re going to do this hack, just stay cautious and remember the basics. Also, since most typical changing pads will overhang the sides of the KALLAX by about an inch, use enough hook-and-loop and always make sure it stays secure.
