I find it inspiring, and I also get a little more confident when I attempt my own projects. But I have to admit, I don’t think I would look at a reusable tote and think, “Ooh, tennis shoes!” Countless hacks show that the FRAKTA can be anything when you add creativity, ingenuity, and assorted DIY skills. But this custom sneaker from Majk Novak @projektant_butow is more of a masterpiece than a hack. The talented designer crafts brilliant shoes that showcase his wide range of skills and artistry. Photo Credit: IKEA.com Watching his level of expertise and imagination in action, you can’t help but be impressed. Novak’s vision and passion for his work are evident, especially when you see his unique, custom designs. I feel it’s fair to say that it was only a matter of time before he decided to turn IKEA’s iconic FRAKTA shopping bag into a pair of snazzy sneakers. Photo Credit: Majk Novak @projektant_butow | Instagram What You’ll Need 1 IKEA FRAKTA bag Sewing machine Heavy-duty adhesive Pins Shoe forms Needle and thread Shoelaces Fabric for lining A bunch of other stuff Sorry, I couldn’t resist. Honestly, unless you’re also a shoe artist, I’m not sure you’d tackle this hack exactly as it is. After all, it’s safe to say it’s a bit ambitious. Photo Credit: Majk Novak @projektant_butow | Instagram Primarily, it’s because the artist is also a shoemaker. Therefore, he has a ton of specialized equipment designed for, you guessed it, making shoes, which the average IKEA hacker probably doesn’t have. (No matter how skilled you are at creating the ultimate BILLY built-in.) But we couldn’t resist sharing the overall concept of turning the FRAKTA into a shoe (I mean, pretty cool, right?), and the impeccable execution of the hack. If you want to learn more about the process, watch these IKEA sneakers come to life (the YouTube video below), and follow Michał on Instagram @projektant_butow. A Shoemaker and an Artist Michał Novak (Majk Novak @projektant_butow) is a custom Master Shoemaker, Footwear Technology Technician, and artisan based in Poland. He has a passion for the arts, attended acting school, and creates music when he isn’t creating footwear masterpieces.  He has over 23 years of experience in shoes, and it shows. He even jokes that he was “born in a workshop,” speaking about his parents’ shoe business. His various collections are akin to works of art, and plenty of people would love to spend a day in his shoes (get it?). If you’d really like to spend a day in Novak’s shoes and see what it’s like to be a shoe designer, he offers individual workshops and courses. I’m not sure if he has a virtual option; the site doesn’t specify, but he does invite those interested to reach out with questions. So if you’ve got a burning desire to become a Master Shoemaker, or you simply want to admire more of his incredible shoe creations, be sure to check out Michał’s website. Photo Credit: Majk Novak @projektant_butow | Instagram Where Did You Get Those Shoes?! Imagine answering this question by saying, “Oh, I hacked my old FRAKTA, no biggie.” Okay, so maybe this hack isn’t for everyone, since it obviously requires a set of very specific skills (and equipment), but it’s still really neat. So even if you can’t make them, if you’re a dedicated IKEA lover, you probably want a pair. Photo Credit: Majk Novak @projektant_butow | Instagram But no matter where you get your shoes, you need somewhere to put them. (Or show them off if they look this cool.) So here are a couple of hacks you could definitely pull off if you need some shoe storage. Check out how a wall-mounted pot-lid organizer creates a shoe display, or try out this small-space sneaker storage if you’re working with a tiny footprint (in your room, I mean, not your actual foot). Got an IKEA hack that you can’t wait to show off? Send it our way and you could be our next featured hack.",
