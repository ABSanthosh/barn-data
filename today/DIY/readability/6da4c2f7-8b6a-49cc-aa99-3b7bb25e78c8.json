All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Vineyard Perspective/ShutterstockAlthough extremely cold weather brings about some very un-chic things (see: ice inside of windows, drafts in older buildings, and lots and lots of snow to shovel), it also brought about this extremely stylish DIY trend: DIY frozen ice buckets. With Valentine’s Day and the Super Bowl coming up, there’s a lot to celebrate — and if you like doing so with a cold glass of wine or bubbly, then this fun and functional frozen hosting hack might be for you.Using two cylindrical containers (think: about the size of a coffee can for the larger container, and about the size of a Ben \u0026 Jerry’s pint, although with a harder shell, for the smaller container) and that chilly outside air — or your freezer — you can create a frozen ice bucket. The best part is, you can totally customize it by filling the edges with red berries and greenery. (For the Super Bowl, you can lean more into one or the other, depending on which team you’re rooting for.)There are a few bucket-making methods for getting the exact look you want, but the main thing to remember is that you’ll want your inner canister to be larger in diameter than the bottle of Champagne or wine you’re serving, so it can rest neatly in the ice bucket during party time. After all, the bucket is going to get smaller as the night gets longer. Read some pointers below from those who have done it themselves. Use a sturdy sprig to make something sculptural.Zoë François (@zoebakes) embraced the cold spell in Minnesota a few weeks ago by creating ice buckets with a simple, single sprig of rosehips. She used a 6-quart plastic container and a 1-quart plastic container to make her frozen ice bucket, filling the larger one with water and the smaller one with rice to create a spot for the wine bottle once the whole thing is frozen. I love her final presentation on a cake plate — an appropriate choice for the award-winning baker, and a clever way to catch any drippage during a party. Buy an ice bucket mold if you’d rather not go the DIY route.Although you can make a frozen ice bucket using mostly what you have at home, LaTawnya Evans (@mrsevansplace) saved a step and bought a frozen ice bucket mold online. The Amazon ice bucket mold comes with the plastic mold and the metal bucket — again, to help with melting and dripping.“I … dressed it up with magnolia leaves, oranges, and cranberries for the perfect holiday touch,” LaTawnya says on Instagram. Swap her oranges and cranberries for strawberry slices and rose petals, and you have a Cupid-approved Valentine’s Day centerpiece!Go for a maximalist look.You can also really load these ice buckets up with decor, as Valerie (@cottageandblossom) proved with her ice bucket that’s bursting with orange slices, greenery, and cranberries. Valerie chose to garnish the edges and bottom of the ice bucket, which is much easier than letting a layer for the base freeze before adding decorated sides (and much more maximalist!).Valerie used thrifted camping pots for her containers, and she recommends freezing your creation for at least 24 hours before your big event. When it’s time to take it out, let the bucket thaw just a bit (for about 10 minutes) to make it easier to remove the cans.Not into alcohol? Use the frozen buckets as porch decor.Valerie says she makes these ice buckets every year, and sometimes she uses them as outdoor lanterns instead of Champagne buckets. “I make these every holiday season to put outside with candles as guests arrive,” she says.“I love foraging my yard and local walking trail for interesting greenery and berries, but I always include a pop of color with extra cranberries and orange slices,” she says on Instagram. “I often leave greenery, like larger rhododendron leaves, sticking out of the ice, as it adds such drama and beauty!”",
