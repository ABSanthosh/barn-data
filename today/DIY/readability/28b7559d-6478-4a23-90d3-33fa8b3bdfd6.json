These limited-edition sandals are real, wearable, and they’re free. What Are IKEA FLIP FLÖPS? Think: classic Aussie thongs, but with a playful Scandinavian twist and a DIY spin. These FLIP FLÖPS come unassembled (because, of course, they do), with a simple three-step assembly. Even comes with a tool to help you click the straps in place. They’re the ultimate product to mark five decades of IKEA’s presence Down Under. The only gripe? They should have been called “thongs”, Aussies comment on social media.
