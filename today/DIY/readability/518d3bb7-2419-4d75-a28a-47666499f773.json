  "text": "Spotify Sign in to your MUO account Spotify With Valentine's Day just around the corner, you may be stressed about what to give your partner. It has to show that you care, be personal to them, and mean something more than money can buy. How about a Spotify playlist with custom cover art? As first announced in a post on For the Record, Spotify has added a bunch of new stickers to its cover art tool. And, just in time for Valentine's Day, the new stickers are all related to love and romance. There are 12 new stickers available to use in your custom cover art, including a flaming heart, a love snail, a pair of red lips, a neon heart, and a balloon dog. All of which can be added to your custom cover art on any new playlists you create or existing playlists you have previously created. This includes Spotify playlists created using AI. For those unfamiliar with the cover art tool, it's a Spotify feature that's currently in beta. It lets you create custom cover art for playlists, meaning that you no longer have to make do with the default cover art comprising pictures of four of the songs included. Spotify's cover art tool is currently available in 65 markets around the world, so there's a good chance you'll have access. To find out, just open a playlist you have previously created, tap the three-dot menu, and tap Create cover art. Once you tap Create cover art again on the next screen, you'll have the option to change the background, add an image, add text, and add stickers (including the new Valentine's-themed ones). All You Need Is Love (Songs for Your Partner) Spotify launched its cover art tool allowing you to create your own custom art for playlists in 2024. At the time, I enjoyed using the tool to create custom cover art for several themed playlists. However, I must admit that I haven't used it a lot since. However, Valentine's Day seems like a good opportunity to use it once again, as I'll be creating a Spotify playlist especially for my partner. These new stickers mean that not only can I show how much I care about her by choosing a specific set of songs, I can also create cover artwork that will be unique to this, and only this, playlist. What a lucky woman she is!",

How about a Spotify playlist with custom cover art?\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs first announced in \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-02-10/valentines-day-playlist-cover-stickers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea post on For the Record\u003c/a\u003e, Spotify has added a bunch of new stickers to its cover art tool. And, just in time for Valentine\u0026#39;s Day, the new stickers are all related to love and romance.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere are 12 new stickers available to use in your custom cover art, including a flaming heart, a love snail, a pair of red lips, a neon heart, and a balloon dog. All of which can be added to your custom cover art on any new playlists you create or existing playlists you have previously created.

It lets you create custom cover art for playlists, meaning that you no longer have to make do with the default cover art comprising pictures of four of the songs included.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSpotify\u0026#39;s cover art tool is currently available in 65 markets around the world, so there\u0026#39;s a good chance you\u0026#39;ll have access.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTo find out, just open a playlist you have previously created, tap \u003cstrong\u003ethe three-dot menu\u003c/strong\u003e, and tap \u003cstrong\u003eCreate cover art\u003c/strong\u003e.

These new stickers mean that not only can I show how much I care about her by choosing a specific set of songs, I can also create cover artwork that will be unique to this, and only this, playlist.
