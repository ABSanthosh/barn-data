  "text": "Instagram Sign in to your MUO account Quick LinksHow to Archive Your Instagram Posts How to View and Restore Archived Instagram Posts Instagram has a feature called Archive that allows you to remove a post from public view without deleting it. Your photos and videos are still there, but they are tucked away in a private corner of your profile where only you can see them. How to Archive Your Instagram Posts Arching posts on Instagram is really straightforward. Open your Instagram profile and scroll through your posts. Spot that photo or video that's been bugging you, and tap it to open it up. Tap the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the post, and from the menu that pops up, choose Archive. And just like that, your post vanishes from your profile. How to View and Restore Archived Instagram Posts Now, let's say you want to revisit and restore your archived posts. Just go to your profile, tap the hamburger menu (those three lines at the top), and select Archive. By default, you might land in the Stories archive. However, to switch to the posts you've hidden, tap Stories Archive at the top and choose Posts Archive instead. Scroll through your archived posts and tap a post you're ready to restore to open it up. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner of the post, and from the pop-up menu below, select Show on Profile. Your archived post will now be visible on your profile. If you archived something a while ago, the restored post won't pop up as new. It will slot back into your profile based on its original upload date. Also, archived posts keep their original likes and comments, which is great because you don't lose all that engagement you worked hard for. I love the Archive feature because it gives me room to change my mind. Deleting a post is like throwing away a photo album—it's permanent. But archiving, on the other hand, is like tucking that album into a closet for safekeeping.",

post from public view without deleting it. Your photos and videos are still there, but they are tucked away in a private corner of your profile where only you can see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-archive-your-instagram-posts\"\u003e How to Archive Your Instagram Posts \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArching posts on Instagram is really straightforward. Open your Instagram profile and scroll through your posts. Spot that photo or video that\u0026#39;s been bugging you, and tap it to open it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTap the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the post, and from the menu that pops up, choose \u003cstrong\u003eArchive.\u003c/strong\u003e And just like that, your post vanishes from your profile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-view-and-restore-archived-instagram-posts\"\u003e How to View and Restore Archived Instagram Posts \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let\u0026#39;s say you want to revisit and restore your archived posts. Just go to your profile, tap the hamburger menu (those three lines at the top), and select Archive. By default, you might land in the Stories archive. However, to switch to the posts you\u0026#39;ve hidden, tap \u003cstrong\u003eStories Archive\u003c/strong\u003e at the top and choose \u003cstrong\u003ePosts Archive\u003c/strong\u003e instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eScroll through your archived posts and tap a post you\u0026#39;re ready to restore to open it up. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner of the post, and from the pop-up menu below, select \u003cstrong\u003eShow on Profile\u003c/strong\u003e. Your archived post will now be visible on your profile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"custom_block_10\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you archived something a while ago, the restored post won\u0026#39;t pop up as new. It will slot back into your profile based on its original upload date. Also, archived posts keep their original likes and comments, which is great because you don\u0026#39;t lose all that engagement you worked hard for.\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI love the Archive feature because it gives me room to change my mind. Deleting a post is like throwing away a photo album—it\u0026#39;s permanent. But archiving, on the other hand, is like tucking that album into a closet for safekeeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
