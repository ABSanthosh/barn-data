We got the stair-style TROFAST shelf and sorted all of his LEGO bricks by color. However, displaying some of his favorites, especially his mini-figs, is a whole other story. That’s why I was eager to check out these two hacks. The first LEGO shelf idea is from Ameta Bruestle @anetas_leben, featuring the LUSTIGT display shelf. The hack takes the shelf a step further to make it a bit more LEGO-specific by adding LEGO strips. The second hack makes it easy to create LEGO scenes using the IKEA SANNAHED frame, which comes from Jennifer Bartels @die.bartels. Both of these hacks are really simple and allow you to create flexible displays that you can change up easily. I (or perhaps my son?) will attempt to recreate the LUSTIGT idea, though I think both ideas are super cute. Which one is your favorite? #1. Super-Easy LEGO Shelf Photo Credit: Ameta Bruestle @anetas_leben | Instagram What You’ll Need: 1 IKEA LUSTIGT display shelf Double-sided tape LEGO flats Basics – screwdriver, screw gun Hanging hardware 1. Prep the LUSTIGT Shelves Before assembling the LUSTIGT, apply the double-sided tape down the middle of each shelf. Place your LEGO flat pieces on the tape and press down to secure. Ameta used black pieces, but this is flexible. Choose whatever color you think works best for your LEGO pieces — you could even paint the shelves if you want. 2. Assemble and Hang the LUSTIGT Shelf Put together the LUSTIGT shelf according to IKEA instructions and hang it with appropriate hardware. If it isn’t screwed directly into a wall stud, make sure to use the right kind of anchors for your wall to keep the shelf secure. 3. Place your LEGO Pieces Finally, set up your favorite mini-figs, LEGO animals, flowers, or anything else you want to show off on your shelf. If you prefer to put larger pieces on display, use wider LEGO flats and double-sided tape, instead of the skinnier strips and pieces. The shelves are designed to move sideways, so you can stagger them to fit taller pieces. #2. Changeable LEGO Scene Maker Photo Credit: Jennifer Bartels @die.bartels | Instagram What You’ll Need: 1 IKEA SANNAHED frame (9 ¾” x 9 ¾”) 1 LEGO square baseplate (measures a little over 9.5 inches square) Heavy-duty scissors Hanging hardware (optional) 1. Trim the Square Baseplate to Fit the SANNAHED Frame To create your LEGO display in the SANNAHED frame, remove the back, mat, and the plastic front. Use the backboard to trim the baseplate to size. You should only need to snip a small bit. 2. Replace the Plastic Front With the LEGO Baseplate Reassemble your SANNAHED, but use the LEGO baseplate in place of the plastic front and leave out the mat. Put the original backboard in the frame, and that’s it! Now you’re ready to create stunning LEGO scenes anytime. Hang the frame or place it on any surface; it’s designed for either of these. Need a Larger LEGO Display? You could opt for a slightly larger version of the SANNAHED hack if you get the 19 ¾” x 19 ¾” frame. LEGO has a larger baseplate that’s about 15” square (it’s gray). You could utilize the mat that comes with the SANNAHED and trim it down a couple of inches to fit the baseplate into the larger frame. You’d gain roughly 4 to 5 more square inches of LEGO real estate over the smaller frame. These two IKEA products are popular picks when it comes to showing off your favorite things. For example, try this SANNAHED hack to keep collectibles dust-free, or switch things up with this LUSTIGT DIY if you’re a Donkey Kong fan. The possibilities are pretty much endless.",
