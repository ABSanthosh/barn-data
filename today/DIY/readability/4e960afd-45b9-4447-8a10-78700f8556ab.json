She reimagined the IKEA IVAR cabinet and gave it an unexpected twist, taking the standard IVAR cabinet hack to new territory.Sharing her innovative design on Instagram under the handle @herzenstimme, Stübing has transformed the standard hinged-door cabinet into a sleek piece with fold-down doors.“The gap between the doors has always bothered me. Now, it’s so much better,” Stübing commented on her post, highlighting the infamous IVAR gap many wrestle with. IKEA IVAR Cabinet With Fold Down Doors Stübing detailed her hacking process, explaining, “I repurposed the original shelves as the new drop-down doors, and then cut the original doors to create new shelves between these doors.” This swap maximized the use of existing materials while achieving her desired design. She elaborated on her decision-making process, citing the construction of IVAR doors: “The original doors have brackets and hinge cut-outs, which would make it difficult to remove them cleanly. That’s why I opted to use the shelves for the new doors instead. They provided a smoother, more polished look for the folding mechanism.” IKEA Pine Meets Oak Finish The makeover didn’t stop at the door configuration. Stübing stained the piece with an oak finish, taming down the yellow pine look that screams IKEA. In a clever move to increase functionality without compromising aesthetics, she added mini caster wheels to the base, which are not visible. This subtle addition allows for easy relocation within the home without altering the cabinet’s overall look. Reconfigured Style Adding to the cabinet’s modern appeal, Stübing incorporated UTRUSTA push-openers, allowing for a sleek, handle-free exterior. An unexpected bonus of using smaller doors was the creation of a niche at the top of the cabinet. This space now serves as an ideal spot for displaying decor items and provides easy access to frequently used objects.Stübing styled the transformed IVAR with a table lamp, books, and decorative elements. The result is a versatile piece that could easily serve as a stylish console or entryway furniture. With its sleek design and ample storage, it would also make an excellent bar cabinet for those looking to add a touch of sophistication to their entertaining space.
