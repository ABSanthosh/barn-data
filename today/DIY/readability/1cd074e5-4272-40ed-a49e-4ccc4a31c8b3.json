It includes homes decorated in earthy colors, nostalgic patterns, and wood tones, it’s a style that’s a nod to the English countryside. Cottagecore is also a lifestyle focused on simple living, comfort, and a connection with nature. Cottagecore homes are cozy and lived in, they possess soft lighting, organic textures, and natural materials. Cottagecore has a sense of nostalgia, it idealizes pastoral settings and the beauty of the countryside. It celebrates the idea of retreating to a simpler time, the homes are cozy, handmade crafts are valued, and the pace of life is in sync with the seasons. If you’re looking to bring this charming aesthetic into your home, these are the necessary elements: 1. Choose a Soft Earth Tone Palette amber shoppe Earth tones are present in the cottagecore aesthetic. Hues that reflect the outdoors include muted greens, desaturated blues, warm browns, creamy whites, and soft pinks. Together these earth tones create a calming and tranquil atmosphere, reflecting the serenity of a rural setting. Fabrics have tactile softness, and quaint patterns like gingham, small scale florals, and block print motifs are blended together. Delicate, understated prints work best, they add character without overwhelming a space. 2. Embrace Natural Elements tree wallpaper A connection with nature is at the heart of the cottagecore aesthetic. Natural materials such as wood, stone, cotton, and linen are layered throughout a cottagecore home as well as wood furniture and trim, particularly pieces that are vintage or second hand. Reclaimed, distressed, and imperfect surfaces are included as are darker wood stains. Stone fireplaces, exposed brick, and wood paneling are often present. Reminders of daily living are scattered throughout as well as unique or handcrafted accents. Collected items have meaning and are not mass produced. In the kitchen are potted herbs, stacks of cutting boards or copper. Open shelves and dining hutches are filled with everyday plates, bowls, vegetables from the garden or farmer’s market, and other homey touches. 3. Include Vintage and Handmade Pieces amber shoppe Cottagecore celebrates craftsmanship and tradition. The aesthetic always includes vintage or antique items as well as thrifted pieces or flea market finds that have timeworn appeal. There’s a feeling of nostalgia, the eye is drawn to one-of-a-kind pieces that have a story to tell. Elements of cottagecore reflect a slower pace and simple, intentional living. Handmade items are also part of the cottagecore aesthetic, think crocheted blankets, unique thrown or hand built pottery, framed embroidery, and pastoral or still life paintings. There’s an element of wholesome pastimes that is present where one gathers around the fire playing games, sharing baked goods, and telling stories. 4) Convey Simple Living, Warmth, and Coziness rugs direct A cottagecore home is inviting and cozy, with plenty of spaces designed for relaxation. Reading nooks with a comfy chair and places to sit with a book and cup of tea are necessary. In the bedroom, layer quilts, knitted throws, and soft linens, these create a sense of warmth and comfort. Add vintage art, a stack of books, and layers of ambient light in the form of lamps and candles to create a cozy atmosphere. Cottagecore values simplicity, so clutter is out of sight and ornate decor is avoided. Everything layered together evokes a feeling of calm. Storage solutions are both practical and pleasing to the eye, they include woven baskets and bookcases and cabinets that are filled with useful or treasured items. The key to mastering the cottagecore aesthetic is to create a home that feels like a peaceful retreat, it is solace from the stress and busyness of modern life. A cottagecore home keeps its focus on nature, vintage charm, useful meaningful decor, and the art of a romanticized and simple life.   Decor you might like if you’re a fan of cottagecore:",
