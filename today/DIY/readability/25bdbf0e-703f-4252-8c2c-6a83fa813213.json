  "text": "Skip to content When thinking of retrocomputing, many of us will imagine machines such as the Commodore 64 or Apple II. These computers were very popular and have plenty of parts and documentation available. Fewer will go back to the Intel 8008 or even 4004 era which were the first integrated circuit chips commercially available. But before even those transistor-based computers is a retrocomputing era rarely touched on: the era of programmable vacuum tube machines. [Mike] has gone back to the 1950s with this computer which uses vacuum tubes instead of transistors. The computer has an eight-bit architecture and features most of the components of any modern transistor-based computer of similar computational ability. Memory, I/O, an arithmetic logic unit including a carry bit that allows it to do 16-bit arithmetic, are all implemented using 6N3P dual triode tubes that date to the 50s and 60s and would have been used in similar computers like the IBM 700. All of this drives a flight simulator program or a Fibonacci number generator, demonstrating its general purpose computing capabilities. Of course, tubes were generally phased out in favor of transistors largely due to their power and space requirements; [Mike] needs a stepladder to maintain this computer as well as around ten minutes each time he starts it up to allow the tubes to warm up, with each module needing over three amps of current each. It’s a hugely impressive build and we’d recommend checking out the video linked below to get more details on its operation. If you’re looking for something a little more accessible to get into the world of vacuum tubes, this single-board tube computer fits the bill.",
