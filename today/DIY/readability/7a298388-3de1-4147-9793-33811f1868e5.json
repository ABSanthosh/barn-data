Clever hackers are reimagining these versatile units as architectural elements, using them to frame functional spaces in creative new ways.Just a few months back, we showcased a particularly ingenious hack where the space between PAX units could shape-shift from a desk to a bench. Now, we have another out-of-the-PAX hack — this one’s from Liz Meester, an Interior Graphic Designer who goes by the handle @bijliz on IG. Liz’s clever design features an arched niche nestled between two PAX units, creating a cozy alcove that’s both practical and eye-catching. “We are very happy with the result. We have a lot of storage space and it has become a nice work space, where I also get ready every morning,” she comments on her successful DIY project. Alcove Storage and Desk Hack However, this transformation was no walk in the park. Liz and Omar began by assembling two PAX units (19 5/8″ x 14″ | 50 x 35 cm) within the alcove, shortening the frames to fit the space and achieve a built-in look. They then framed the PAX modules with pine beams and crafted arches from wooden boards, screwing them into the frames.The real challenge came with creating the curve. “For the curve, we cut the plasterboard so that it became flexible,” Liz shares. “You can also buy flexible plasterboards, but doing it yourself is a lot cheaper.” They secured the plasterboards with plaster screws, bringing the arch to life. Custom Doors They also opted to make their own doors from 18mm MDF with lacquered foil. Liz explains that Omar sawed the doors to size on site due to sloping ceilings. She also offers a pro tip on dealing with cut MDF. “Finish the end edges of the MDF with wood glue mixed with water, which makes the end edges of the MDF super smooth.” This step makes the cut edges much easier to paint. Floating Shelves The finishing touch? Floating shelves made from the same wood as their dining table, tying the whole look together. The oak shelves were custom-made with routed sides, allowing them to slot perfectly into the wood slats flanking the niche. Finally, Liz adds textured wallpaper to the niche, elevating simple storage to a Pinterest-worthy desk nook. A Multifunctional Nook There’s so much we love about Liz’s PAX hack. It’s not just all storage: By opting for two wardrobes instead of a full wall of storage, Liz has created a design that feels open and inviting rather than imposing. The arched niche between the units adds architectural interest and breaks up the potential monotony of a straight storage wall. It has a practical worktop: This desk is so useful. It serves as a drop zone for essentials, a place to do some quick work or a spot to touch up makeup before heading out. In essence, it’s a mini command center that doesn’t sacrifice style for utility. It’s closed storage: The PAX frames offer lots of storage, all neatly hidden behind closed doors. Taking advantage of the versatility of the PAX interior fittings, they can be easily configured to store coats, bags, shoes, or any combination thereof.
