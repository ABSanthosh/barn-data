The feature arrives for the platform’s 20th anniversary and brings new AI-powered tools for professional users (like urban planners) in the U.S. Explore the Past in Google Earth Google Earth has always helped everyone see the world from above. Now, it lets you see how streets and neighborhoods have changed over the years. With the new update, you can slide through older Street View images right inside Google Earth. Want to revisit your childhood block or watch a city skyline grow? Just move the timeline slider and see how places looked in the past. Until now, historical Street View was only available in Google Maps and the Earth Pro desktop app. This update brings it to the main Google Earth app on the web and mobile, making it easier for everyone to use. Historical street view imagery in Google Earth follows from its popularity in Google Maps. The #somewhereonGoogleMaps trend captured our nostalgia for places past and present. Google Earth's 20th anniversary is as good a time as any to catch up with its milestones. A Digital Time Machine for Us The new historical Street View feature turns Google Earth into more than just a virtual globe. Now, it’s a visual time machine. You can trace your history or see how your favorite places have evolved. It’s fascinating to watch a vacant lot become a playground, or a quiet street transform into a busy neighborhood. For a long time, I have enjoyed watching a satellite view of my own house with Google Earth. Now, we can satisfy our curiosity about old places by heading to places with extensive historical records. For instance, New York, London, and Paris, etc. Here are some of my favorites, which I checked out: Freedom Tower (One World Trade Center) in Lower Manhattan, New York City: You can watch a part of modern American history as this symbolic structure rose from the rebuilding efforts at Ground Zero. The Berlin Wall in Germany is one of the most historically significant timelapses. Watch the fall of the Berlin Wall, along with the massive urban transformation that followed German reunification. Kennedy Space Center in Florida provides comprehensive historical imagery of NASA's launch facilities and the evolution of the space program infrastructure. As a space buff, I head to the SpaceX Starbase in Texas, too, to watch the company's meteoric rise. Pompeii, Italy, and its many ancient Roman attractions like the Rectangle Theater, the Theater of Pompeii, the Temple of Apollo, the Arch of Tiberius, and the Public Square. The World Islands in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are artificial islands constructed to resemble a world map. Also: Smarter Maps for Real-World Problems It's not about casual nostalgia and fun alone. Along with the time-travel feature, Google is adding powerful new tools for U.S. professionals. Soon, planners and researchers will see overlays that show tree canopy coverage and land surface temperatures. These AI-powered insights can help cities plan for more green spaces or tackle “urban heat islands” where temperatures rise due to a lack of trees and too much concrete. For decision makers, knowing where trees are missing or where temperatures spike can guide smart choices. They might plant more trees in the hottest areas or design new parks where they’re needed most. These upgrades can make cities cooler, greener, and more comfortable for everyone.",

Now, it’s a visual time machine. You can trace your history or see how your favorite places have evolved. It’s fascinating to watch a vacant lot become a playground, or a quiet street transform into a busy neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor a long time, I have enjoyed \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/globe-in-your-pc/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewatching a satellite view of my own house with Google Earth\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eNow, we can satisfy our curiosity about old places by heading to places with extensive historical records.

Along with the time-travel feature, Google is adding powerful new tools for U.S. professionals. Soon, planners and researchers will see overlays that show tree canopy coverage and land surface temperatures. These AI-powered insights can help cities plan for more green spaces or tackle “urban heat islands” where temperatures rise due to a lack of trees and too much concrete.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor decision makers, knowing where trees are missing or where temperatures spike can guide smart choices. They might plant more trees in the hottest areas or design new parks where they’re needed most. These upgrades can make cities cooler, greener, and more comfortable for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n    \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
