Or what if you fall in love with a piece, only to find it’s not available in your country? That’s what happened with Till \u0026 Romy @twice.crafted. They loved the look of the Ebba storage console from Urban Outfitters, but the item wasn’t available in Germany. (Not to mention it came with a $700 price tag.) So, naturally, they decided to hack it. The design duo discovered that it was possible to recreate the look for much less using an IKEA KALLAX unit. The result is a stunning replica that mimics the playful style and whimsy of the original. If you’re handy and up for a little DIY (and if you’re here, I would say that’s a fair bet), then you can do it, too! What You’ll Need 1 IKEA KALLAX shelf unit (30 ⅛” x 57 ⅝”) Paint and primer Smooth wood or MDF panel Wood filler Adhesive Sander Square rule (L-shaped ruler) Basics — pencil, drill, screw gun, saws  Get the Look of the Ebba Console for Less 1. Mark the Cutouts Assemble the KALLAX and place it on the MDF panel, tracing the outline. Then, start taking the KALLAX apart to mark precisely where all the cubbies line up on the MDF. You need this as a guide when making your circular and oval-shaped cutouts so that the entire face of the KALLAX remains hidden. Trace circles and ovals where you want them, making sure the cutouts won’t expose any of the KALLAX. Use a compass or similar tool to create the shapes on paper or poster board first to use as a pattern, so you get clean, crisp silhouettes. Reassemble the KALLAX but leave out any vertical panels you don’t need in the final assembly. 2. Make the Cutouts Prop the MDF across sawhorses or something similar so you can cut out your shapes easily. Use a circle jig or similar tool to make the cuts. If you’re unsure how to get a perfect circle or cutout, there are numerous how-tos on YouTube.  3. Attach the New Face to the KALLAX Reassemble the KALLAX, and apply a strong adhesive to all of the edges in the front, including around the cubbies. Position the cutout panel on top of the KALLAX and press into place, allowing the adhesive to dry. 4. Time to Fill and Paint The hacker said the game changer for this hack was wood filler — it was the key to unlocking the smooth silhouette of the original. Apply the filler to all of the holes, seams, gaps, and rough spots and let dry. Sand everything lightly, then it’s time for the final touch, a coat of paint (or two). Till \u0026 Romy chose a vibrant orange for a splash of fun. The original Ebba console comes in orange, green, or white, but since you’re making your own, you get to use any color you want. Which Way for Your Display? Like the simple KALLAX shelves and the original Ebba console, this replica can go upright or sideways. If you want to use it as a sleek TV console, then leave it horizontal. Or, stand it vertically to create a cool, modern display shelf for your favorite decor and collections. What do you think? How would you use this piece in your home, and what color would you paint it? Would you change anything? Check out the transformation and get detailed measurements and instructions in a PDF so you can make your own. And don’t miss these other KALLAX hacks, whether you’re itching to repurpose an old shelf or want to flex your DIY muscles. After you finish, submit your hack so we can see the final result!
