  "text": "Lenovo's latest concept laptop is a bit of an odd duck. Its foldable display not only provides a super-tall vertical viewing area, but it can bend back to show slideshows, videos, and other content to people who are sitting across from you. Shown at MWC 2025, the ThinkBook Flip AI PC Concept features an unorthodox outward-folding display. Half of the foldable display faces away from the user when in regular ol' clamshell mode, which may aide in collaborative experiences or business presentations. However, the user can pull this outward-facing portion of the screen forward to create a super-tall, seamless personal desktop workspace. Related The frontward-facing portion of this laptop's display measures just 13 inches in clamshell mode. It expands to 18.1 inches in super-tall Vertical Mode, effectively giving you a stealth dual-monitor setup on the go. It's a foldable screen, so it isn't really dual-monitor, but it uses Workspace Split Screen functionality to break up apps and provide an experience similar to a dual-monitor system. The laptop's underlying hardware is pretty competent, too. Lenovo went all-out with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, an unspecified amount of PCIe SSD storage, an array of Thunderbolt 4 ports, a fingerprint sensor, and one of those light-up trackpads with integrated media and numpad controls. But, as this is just a concept product, the internal hardware capabilities are kinda moot. The outward-facing foldable screen is the real hook. Lenovo hasn't revealed the laptop's display panel type or quality, though it is almost certainly OLED. I'm also compelled to mention that this concept, like all high-end Lenovo laptops in recent memory, is dripping with \"advanced AI acceleration,\" \"fluid AI-driven performance,\" and whatever other AI buzzwords are currently in season. Of course, this is just a conceptdevice. It's not a final product. But Lenovo sells plenty of weird laptops, including the dual-screen Yoga Book 9i, the Windows-to-Android ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid, and the extendo-screen ThinkBook Plus Gen 6. Most of these laptops began as concept items, so I won't be surprised if the Flip AI PC becomes a real product at some point. Plus, it's honestly one of the least outlandish concepts that I've seen from Lenovo. However, if this laptop does hit the market, its design and hardware may be slightly different from what we see today. I doubt that Lenovo would downgrade the internal hardware, as foldable laptops are naturally high-end, but Lenovo may attempt to increase the concept's durability or refine its visual style. As for whether this concept laptop would make for a good productâ€”I'm not sure, I guess it depends on your profession or your preferences. I've had some hands-on experience with the super-tall ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, and Lenovo showed me a concept device that was similar to the Flip AI PC earlier this year. Frankly, I'd rather have a normal laptop with a normal screen. I'm also concerned that an outward-facing foldable display will be too fragile, although Lenovo is pairing this concept item with a fabric cover, which may provide protection as well as privacy. To be clear, this is just one of many items that Lenovo is showing off at MWC 2025. The company also announced a bevy of real ThinkBook, ThinkPad, and Yoga Pro Aura Edition laptops at the annual Madrid technology conference. Source: Lenovo",
