  "text": "Venmo is a great way to quickly send money to friends and family. But more of us are using the service to pay bills and other common payments like rent. A new feature is making it much easier to schedule a one-time or recurring payment. Schedule Both Payment and Requests With Venmo The automatic payment feature is rolling out now and will be widely available in the upcoming weeks. You can set a one-time or recurring payment using the Venmo iOS or Android app. To begin, choose Pay/Request. After confirming the recipient, tap Schedule. You’ll then double-check the frequency and dates for the one-time or recurring payment. Select Save. Finally, confirm the payment amount, select Pay, and then Schedule Payment. The payment will be made from your Venmo balance. If there isn’t enough in the account, the backup payment option will be used. One day before the payment, you’ll see an email and a push notification with the information. You can find upcoming payment information on the Transaction page or cancel the payment through Settings in the app. It’s now also possible to set up a scheduled payment request through the app. To begin, choose Pay/Request. Confirm the recipient of the request and request dates before selecting Save. As the last step, confirm the payment amount and tap Request and Schedule Request. The recipient of the payment request will receive an email and a push notification one day before the requested payment date. Be Safe When Using Venmo Venmo is a popular way to send money to others. While it’s not perfect, Venmo is safe to use without needing to worry about your money or bank account information being available to bad actors. You can make use of a wide variety of safety features on the service, like two-factor authentication and turning off all of your transactions to be seen by the public. Another security feature I use with my Venmo account is requiring Face ID authentication each time I use the app on my iPhone. I also never send or accept money from strangers. With the automatic payment feature, I’m even more likely to use Venmo in the future to handle small bills.",
