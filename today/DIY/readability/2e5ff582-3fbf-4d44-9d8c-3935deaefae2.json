  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account Samsung is looking to clean up the list of inactive accounts under its belt. The company recently sent out a notice to customers with a Samsung account that hasn’t been used in 24 months, noting that any inactive accounts will be deleted come July 31,2025. 8 Weeks Left to Save Your Samsung Account There was a time when having an account tied to your Samsung phone might have made sense. However, if you’ve changed to a different brand of phone at any point, you might have forgotten about that old account. It's possible you even chose to move to a new one for whatever reason. If that’s the case, and your old Samsung account possibly has anything worth salvaging saved to it, then you may want to log in to that account before the end of July according to reports from SamMobile. As of the time of this article’s publishing, Samsung account holders will have just eight weeks left to save their inactive Samsung account by logging in. It’s also recommended that you at least use a Samsung device with the account linked to it, just to help prove its active. Why Account Purges Happen These kind of purges are pretty common in the tech world, and Google recently did a similar purge with Gmail accounts. One of the reasons that these purges happen is to not only cut down on resources—like how much data is saved to the servers—but also to help open up usernames and other details like that for those who might actually use them actively. The other reason, which is perhaps the most important, is that it helps get rid of any data that might be hanging around in your old Samsung account you’ve forgotten about or no longer use. If you aren’t using that account, you likely don’t need to hold onto that data. Related Samsung's Latest Public Safety Alert Is One You Should Take Seriously Samsung really wants you to know about these anti-theft features, and for good reason. Holding onto data in an account you rarely use only opens up the opportunities for bad actors to somehow get their hands on it. As such, I recommend just letting any accounts you don’t plan to use be deleted by Samsung to help clear up your data footprint. Or better yet, you can delete your old Samsung accounts yourself. It’s also entirely possible you’ve gone the entire lifetime of your Samsung device without using a Samsung account. Sure, a Samsung account isn’t mandatory to use one of the company’s devices. However, you do miss out on some great features by not signing up for one, like Samsung Pay and access to the Galaxy Store.",
