So if your wallet is feeling the burn or you want to save some extra dollars, there are a few smart ways to keep Spotify's tunes rolling without paying the full amount. 6 Try Free Trials That Most People Miss Spotify offers new users a free month of Premium to try out the service. What people miss, though, is that it occasionally runs hidden promotions where you can get two or even three months free. These exclusive offers usually pop up around Black Friday, New Year, or as surprise perks when you sign up at just the right time. Even if you've used Premium before (or are unsure if Spotify Premium is worth upgrading to), don't assume you're out of options. Spotify often tries to win back inactive users by offering another free month to tempt you back. These comeback deals can appear in your email inbox, promotions tab, or right on the Spotify homepage, so it's always worth checking what's available today. If you're unsure about which subscription suits your listening habits best, take a moment to compare the options so you're not paying for features you don't need. Set a reminder to cancel before the billing date if you only plan on using the free trial. By doing so, you can enjoy all the Premium features without worrying about unexpected charges. 5 Save Big With the Student Discount If you're studying right now, Spotify Premium won't cost you much. Spotify offers a special student plan that cuts the subscription charge in half, giving you all the same premium perks for just $5.99 per month. To qualify, you'll need to verify your student status through SheerID. This is a quick process that usually involves uploading a document like your student ID or enrollment letter. Even if you're studying part-time or taking online classes, it's worth checking your eligibility. Once verified, your discount remains valid for up to four years; however, you'll need to reverify every 12 months to keep it active. As soon as you graduate, the discount ends, and your plan will revert to the standard premium price. Along with Premium, you also get access to Hulu (with ads) at no additional cost. This bundle used to include Showtime as well, but that part has been discontinued. Even so, having Hulu alongside Spotify still makes it a solid deal. 4 Switch to Family or Duo Plans Perhaps you're no longer a student, and your trial period has already expired. However, if you share your home with someone, there are still easy ways to reduce your Spotify costs. With Spotify Duo, you and one other person under the same roof get separate Premium accounts for about $16.99 monthly, which means you're each paying roughly $8.50. It's perfect for couples or roommates who want to split the bill while keeping their listening history and recommendations separate. For bigger households, Spotify Family is an even better deal. At around $19.99 per month, up to six people living at the same address can each have their own Premium account. That works out to just over $3 per person if you split it evenly, making it one of the cheapest ways to enjoy ad-free listening. The Family plan also includes parental controls to restrict explicit content for younger listeners and a Family Mix playlist that curates music based on the listening habits of everyone in the household. Both plans require members to live at the same address, and Spotify sometimes asks for re-verification to keep the discount active. 3 Grab Discounted Gift Cards or Use Cashback Spotify gift cards aren't just for gifting othersâ€”they can be a smart way to cut your own premium costs if you know when and where to shop. Big sales events like Cyber Monday are prime opportunities to snag discounted gift cards from major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. These cards typically cover 1, 3, 6, or 12 months of Spotify Premium. Occasionally, you'll even find bundle deals where purchasing a certain amount earns you an extra bonus card. Some stores also run limited-time promotions that combine gift card discounts with free store credits. It's a tactic retailers use to drive sales during busy shopping seasons, but for you, it's an easy way to save money and gain extra benefits. To stretch your savings even further, try buying these gift cards through cashback platforms like Rakuten or TopCashback. When you purchase through their links, you earn a small percentage back as cashback. It might not seem like much at first, but stacking discounts with cashback rewards can significantly reduce your subscription costs over time. Spotify gift cards can't be used directly with the Student, Duo, or Family plans. If you're on one of these discounted plans, you'll need to switch to an individual plan to redeem the card, then revert to your original plan afterward if required. 2 Check Phone or Service Bundles Before signing up for Spotify Premium, take a moment to see if it's already included with your phone or internet plan. Many providers offer Spotify as a free or discounted perk. For example, Verizon includes six months of Premium with select Unlimited plans, while Vodafone in the UK provides similar deals with certain contracts. These benefits usually apply to both new and existing customers, so do your research before paying out of pocket. It's not only phone and internet providers offering Premium; Some smart devices also come with free trials. Google Nest speakers, like the Nest Mini or Nest Audio, often include a Spotify Premium trial when you purchase. Similarly, Roku streaming devices have partnered with Spotify to offer Premium trials. These offers change throughout the year, so before paying for Spotify Premium separately, check what your phone plan, internet package, or new smart device includes. Remember, though, that these deals usually auto-renew at the standard Premium price once the promo ends, with charges appearing on your phone bill. To avoid unpleasant surprises, be sure to cancel or adjust your plan before the trial expires. 1 Regional Pricing via a VPN (Know the Risks) Spotify Premium prices aren't the same everywhere. Depending on where you live, the monthly cost can vary significantly. In countries like Egypt or Nigeria, Premium can cost just a fraction of what users pay in the US or Europe. Some people try to take advantage of these regional differences by using a VPN to sign up at a lower rate. While this might sound tempting, there are a few things to consider. To pay for a subscription in another country, you usually need a local payment method that matches the region you're signing up in. Even if you manage that, using a VPN with Spotify isn't officially supported and can lead to performance issues like slower streaming or connection problems. Related This approach may be suitable for individuals who frequently travel or relocate abroad and have a valid local payment option. But for most users, the hassle outweighs the savings. It's worth thinking carefully before going down this route just to save a few dollars each month.",
