All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Now that summer is over and your regularly scheduled programming is more or less back on track, you might be looking at your to-do list and thinking, Where do I even begin? Full disclosure: I’m not the best person to turn to for help with your organizing projects (for advice on that, check out our 14-day Decluttering Cure), but I do have some experience with ticking through my home improvement checklist. What I’ve found, over and over again, is that if you have a big project among your to-dos, the best way to tackle it is by breaking it down into smaller pieces and giving yourself a realistic timeline to accomplish those.That’s why I’m such a big fan of the One Room Challenge, a completely free virtual program that tasks participants with making over just one room of their home over eight weeks. The One Room Challenge isn’t a frenzied two-day renovation sprint you might see on makeover TV shows; instead, it’s paced out to give you a realistic deadline, with an end goal that you set yourself. Sound fun?

Registration is now open on the site, and all you’ll need to join is an Instagram account, a TikTok account, or a blog where you can post updates alongside other participants.For those raring to go, you can register here; then, you’ll post weekly progress of your room makeover by tagging @oneroomchallenge and hashtagging #oneroomchallenge to check in on Instagram and TikTok.
