But even with new AI updates in every iOS release since iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, there's still plenty of room for growth — especially in generative AI (gen AI). And Apple seems to be leaning into that, as shown by its recent updates enabling Apple Intelligence by default and expanding language support.We've seen fun image generation features like Genmoji and Image Wand alongside practical AI-powered features like text summarization, Writing Tools, and ChatGPT integration. Siri, in particular, has already gained several notable Apple Intelligence upgrades on supported devices:A new glowing edge animation ensures Siri doesn't interrupt what you're doing in apps.Improved natural language processing makes Siri's voice more expressive, natural, and clear — all processed on-device.Better error handling allows Siri to understand and adapt when you stumble over words.Type to Siri is now easier to access — just double-tap the bottom edge of the display instead of using the Side button.Predictive text now appears on Siri's keyboard, speeding up typed requests.Smart suggestions in the Siri keyboard help streamline common queries.Conversational context retention makes follow-up requests faster and more intuitive.Deeper Apple product knowledge allows Siri to explain how features work, describe new products, and more.More visually rich responses now match app designs (e.g., weather forecasts appear styled like the Weather app).ChatGPT integration lets Siri handle more complex questions it can't answer itself, but Siri always asks for permission before sending requests.That said, some of the most anticipated Siri upgrades have yet to roll out. These features could arrive with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, but recent reports suggest potential delays due to engineering challenges and software bugs. As a result, some enhancements may be pushed to later iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 updates or even to iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, and their 2026 updates.Now, let's take a closer look at what we expect from Apple Intelligence, how it could change the way we experience Siri, and more.On-screen awareness for SiriOn-screen awareness enables Siri to understand and interact with the content currently displayed on your device. For instance, if a friend shares their new address via text, you can instruct Siri to \"Add this address to their contact card,\" and it will process the information directly from your screen.This feature relies on the App Intents framework, allowing developers to make their app content accessible to Siri and Apple Intelligence. By integrating on-screen content, Siri can provide more contextually relevant assistance. Cross-app functionality with in-app actionsSiri's enhanced cross-app functionality will allow it to seamlessly perform actions within and across multiple apps.Siri already interacts with certain apps (e.g., it can write and send texts, set timers, and add calendar entries), but it's been limited to very simple actions. And — if we're being honest — most of them could be done faster by manually tapping once or twice on your device.But with Siri's expanded AI-powered in-app actions, you could, for example, say, \"Send the email I drafted to April and Lilly,\" and Siri will identify the specific email and the app it's in to complete the task. Additionally, after enhancing a photo with a command like \"Make this photo pop,\" you'll be able to instruct Siri to “Drop it in a specific note in the Notes app,” streamlining your workflow without manual intervention.This expanded capability will work in Apple apps and is facilitated by third-party developers exposing their apps' on-screen content to Siri through the App Intents API, enabling more dynamic and context-aware interactions.Don't Miss: Unlock the Power of Visual Intelligence on Your iPhone to Translate and Explore the World Around You Personal context awarenessPersonal context awareness empowers Siri to utilize information stored on your device to offer assistance tailored to your needs. Whether you're searching for a recipe shared by a friend or need your passport number while booking a flight, Siri will be able to locate this information across apps like Calendar, Files, Mail, Messages, Notes, and Photos — whether you remember where it came from or not.Importantly, this will be achieved without compromising your privacy, as the data processing will occur on-device. More language compatibilityApple Intelligence initially launched with support for US English, with English variations for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK following shortly after. But plans are underway to expand its language offerings.Other languages, including India and Singapore English variations — as well as Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese, and more — are expected to be supported in April 2025. This expansion aims to make AI-driven features more accessible to a global audience.Regular Siri already understands these languages.Don't Miss: How to Remove Unwanted Objects, People, and Distractions in Photos on Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac More things up aheadWhile these enhancements promise a more personalized and efficient user experience, recent reports suggest that the rollout of some AI-powered Siri features may be delayed due to engineering challenges and software bugs, as mentioned before.Like how gen-AI use cases are constantly being improved, expanded on, and debugged, Apple Intelligence will likely undergo more updates and changes in the future.Don't Miss Out: Learn 16 Harry Potter Spells for Siri That Turn Your iPhone into a Magical Elder WandImages by Apple",
