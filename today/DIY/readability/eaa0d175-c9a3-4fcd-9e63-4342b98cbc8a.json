  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Samsung has released its 2025 Odyssey lineup of gaming monitors. The collection comes with the Odyssey 3D, Odyssey OLED G8, and the wide-screen Odyssey G9. They're pretty pricey, but Samsung is offering $300 Samsung credit for purchasing any new Odyssey monitor until April 27. The best model is the Odyssey 3D (G90XF model), a 27-inch monitor that brings glasses-free 3D gaming to life. This is made possible through eye-tracking technology and a special lenticular lens system, creating a realistic high-definition 3D effect that can be accessed through the Reality Hub app. The 3D doesn't require glasses, so it's a bit more like the Nintendo 3DS consoles, rather than 3D TV and movie theater screens. The 3D feature isn’t just for certain games; Samsung’s AI can also convert compatible 2D videos into 3D, giving old content a fresh look. However, users should be aware that this conversion only works when the Reality Hub is running in the background and doesn’t support all video players, DRM-protected content, or HDR mode. An NVIDIA graphics card with an RTX 3080 or better, recommended for the best performance, is required to run the 3D features. Aside from 3D, the Odyssey 3D also has a 165Hz refresh rate, a 1ms Gray-to-Gray response time, and a 4K resolution for smooth gameplay. It supports AMD FreeSync Premium and is NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible. This should reduce screen tearing and stuttering. The monitor also includes Edge Lighting, which matches the lights beneath the screen to what’s happening in the game for a more immersive experience. Samsung has teamed up with game developers like Nexon and Neowiz to make sure these games work well with the new 3D tech. The Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF model) is available in 27-inch and 32-inch sizes. The 27-inch version is especially impressive because it has the highest pixel density in its class at 166 pixels per inch, 4K resolution, and a 240Hz refresh rate, which is pretty unique for a 4K monitor. Both sizes use Samsung’s QD-OLED technology for rich colors and deep blacks, and they come with VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 certification for excellent picture quality even at a brightness of 250 nits. Related Glasses-Free 3D Gaming Is the Best Reason to Buy a Used 3DS I'm on my third and probably final 3DS console, with my New 3DS XL sleeping soundly beside my bed every night, but many people missed out on Nintendo's amazing little machine and haven't experienced the magic of autostereoscopy—glasses-free 3D. The monitors also feature Glare-Free technology, certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), to reduce reflections. To prevent screen burn-in, Samsung includes its OLED Safeguard+ system with a Dynamic Cooling System with a special Pulsating Heat Pipe for better heat control. The gameplay is smooth and responsive with a super-fast 0.03ms response time and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible. The monitor also has a sleek metal design and built-in Core Lighting+. The last model in the Odyssey series is the Odyssey G9 (G91F model), which offers an ultra-wide gaming experience on a massive 49-inch Dual QHD curved screen (1000R curvature). This monitor focuses on immersion with a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support. The Odyssey G9 also has VESA DisplayHDR 600 and HDR10+ GAMING for vivid, detailed visuals. The Odyssey G9 makes multitasking easier with Picture-by-Picture and Picture-in-Picture modes, and its Auto Source Switch+ feature automatically detects and displays connected devices. You can buy each of these monitors on the official Samsung website today. The Odyssey G9 3D 4K Gaming Monitor costs $1,999.99, the Odyssey G8 4K Gaming Monitor does not have a cost announced yet, and the Odyssey G9 Curved Gaming Monitor costs $999.99. Source: Samsung",

its 2025 Odyssey lineup of gaming monitors. The collection comes with the Odyssey 3D, Odyssey OLED G8, and the wide-screen Odyssey G9. They\u0026#39;re pretty pricey, but Samsung is offering $300 Samsung credit for purchasing any new Odyssey monitor until April 27.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe best model is the Odyssey 3D (G90XF model), a 27-inch monitor that brings glasses-free 3D gaming to life. This is made possible through eye-tracking technology and a special lenticular lens system, creating a realistic high-definition 3D effect that can be accessed through the Reality Hub app. The 3D doesn\u0026#39;t require glasses, so it\u0026#39;s a bit more like the Nintendo 3DS consoles, rather than 3D TV and movie theater screens.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 3D feature isn’t just for certain games; Samsung’s AI can also convert compatible 2D videos into 3D, giving old content a fresh look. However, users should be aware that this conversion only works when the Reality Hub is running in the background and doesn’t support all video players, DRM-protected content, or HDR mode.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAn NVIDIA graphics card with an RTX 3080 or better, recommended for the best performance, is required to run the 3D features. Aside from 3D, the Odyssey 3D also has a 165Hz refresh rate, a 1ms Gray-to-Gray response time, and a 4K resolution for smooth gameplay. It supports AMD FreeSync Premium and is NVIDIA G-SYNC Compatible. This should reduce screen tearing and stuttering.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitor also includes Edge Lighting, which matches the lights beneath the screen to what’s happening in the game for a more immersive experience. Samsung has teamed up with game developers like Nexon and Neowiz to make sure these games work well with the new 3D tech.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe Odyssey OLED G8 (G81SF model) is available in 27-inch and 32-inch sizes. The 27-inch version is especially impressive because it has the highest pixel density in its class at 166 pixels per inch, 4K resolution, and a 240Hz refresh rate, which is pretty unique for a 4K monitor. Both sizes use Samsung’s QD-OLED technology for rich colors and deep blacks, and they come with VESA DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 certification for excellent picture quality even at a brightness of 250 nits.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                \n    \n                                        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n
