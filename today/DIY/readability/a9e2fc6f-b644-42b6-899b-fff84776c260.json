We organized our spices into a built-in spice rack on the side of our kitchen island. However, I know that for many people the spices simply collect on the countertop, adding to the clutter. It makes sense to want your spices close at hand when you’re cooking. But you also want to keep your counters clear for prep space. Jules (@jules_creative.jumble) offers a solution by making a wall-mounted spice rack from IKEA’s MOPPE Mini Storage Chest. It’s a pretty simple project if you have some basic DIY skills. The hack also has a bit of versatility, meaning it doesn’t have to be for spices. So if your spice collection consists of nothing more than salt and pepper, you could use this converted MOPPE for a few other things. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA MOPPE storage cabinet Drill with rotary bit L-shaped straightedge ruler Pencil Ruler Circular saw Sandpaper Spray paint Get Your Spices Under Control With This Wall Mounted Spice Rack Hack 1. Mark the Holes on the Back of the MOPPE If you already have a MOPPE cabinet, remove the drawers and flip it over. On the back, measure and mark the center of each hole using your spice jar as a guide. Jules made four rows of six. 2. Create the Holes Use a rotary bit to create the holes. The hacker doesn’t specify what size bit she uses, but you can gauge the size using your spice containers. 3. Cut the Moppe Down to Size Use the circular saw to cut off roughly ⅔ of the MOPPE cabinet. You should be left with the back containing the hotels you just created and only about ⅓ of the frame. 4. Sand and Paint Sand the rough edges, including the holes, and wipe down the piece to get rid of sawdust. Paint your finished hack however you want. Jules protected the sides and only painted the holder black. Don’t Need Spice Storage? This Hack Has a Few Tricks Up Its Sleeve If you already have organized spices (or no spices), this hack could also work for coffee capsules. You would use the same concept, but use a K-cup or similar pod as a guide. You may be able to fit more holes in this case. Also, since the coffee pods aren’t as tall as the spice jars, you might need to cut down the MOPPE more. No coffee? How about a place to store your craft paints? What about creating a mini planter for succulents? Get the wheels turning and see what ideas you can come up with for your MOPPE cabinet makeover. You could also cut it down and skip the holes to create a shallow wall-mounted shelf. For any DIY, think about what you need in your home, and see how the things you have can transform into something that solves your problem. Is This Storage Hack Worth It? Is this IKEA transformation worth it? Well, it depends on a few things. If you already have a MOPPE cabinet that you’re not using, then sure. Repurposing it into a spice rack or coffee capsule holder is a great way to reduce waste and flex your DIY muscles. However, if you’re planning to buy the MOPPE chest just to do this hack, maybe not. The MOPPE costs 29.99, and there are plenty of coffee pod storage and spice rack options out there for roughly the same price or less. Of course, you could also make the argument that making a storage rack allows you to put your own spin on it. You can choose the colors you want and you’d also have the leftover pieces of the MOPPE for other projects. Therefore, the answer to whether or not it’s worth it is that it’s all up to you. What do you think? Would you try this wall-mounted spice rack hack or do you have something else in mind?
