  "text": "Adobe Photoshop Sign in to your MUO account One of the best perks of Google Docs is the ability to work simultaneously with others from anywhere. Now, Adobe is introducing the same feature to Photoshop, in an effort to help users work together effectively on an image. You Can Now Collaborate Live in Adobe Photoshop Announced today on Adobe's blog, you can now sign up for beta testing of a new Photoshop feature, which will allow multiple users to edit the same project synchronously. Here's how Adobe describes the update: \"Now, multiple creators can simultaneously access and edit documents from different computers — unlocking shared creativity and collaboration. This game-changing advancement, informed by community input, accelerates content creation, streamlines communication and improves creative collaboration for creators, teams and educators.\" It's easy to see how this feature will be useful to professionals who may need to divide and conquer on a design, or request clear client feedback. Moreover, Adobe markets Live Co-Editing to students and educators, as a tool to \"demonstrate workflows and teach techniques.\" You can sign up for beta testing of the Live Co-Editing feature for Photoshop via this Adobe form. Adobe's blog post suggests there may be a waitlist. A Level Up for Photoshop Review Features This isn't the first collaborative feature that Adobe has introduced to Photoshop, but it certainly could be a huge improvement. In fact, Adobe's Photoshop, Illustrator, and Fresco added document collaboration features in 2021. Later, with the release of Photoshop 24.3, Adobe refined a Share for review button that included an option called Invite to edit. This feature has supported asynchronous editing, so collaborators could work on the same document but at different times. The Share for review dialog has also allowed users to generate share links and customize comment permissions. While these features have done wonders to improve remote collaboration in Photoshop, being able to work simultaneously opens up new doors, eliminating all the back-and-forth. As more and more work becomes remote, features that allow us to work together from anywhere—in an effective way—are increasingly important. Hopefully, Adobe's Live Co-Editing update becomes a major time-saver, and not an opportunity for managers to shove too many cooks into the creative kitchen.",

In fact, Adobe\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/photoshop-illustrator-fresco-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhotoshop, Illustrator, and Fresco added document collaboration features\u003c/a\u003e in 2021. Later, with the release of Photoshop 24.3, Adobe refined a \u003cstrong\u003eShare for review \u003c/strong\u003ebutton that included an option called\u003cstrong\u003e Invite to edit\u003c/strong\u003e. This feature has supported asynchronous editing, so collaborators could work on the same document but at different times. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eShare for review\u003c/strong\u003e dialog has also allowed users to generate share links and customize comment permissions. While these features have done wonders to improve remote collaboration in Photoshop, being able to work simultaneously opens up new doors, eliminating all the back-and-forth. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs more and more work becomes remote, features that allow us to work together from anywhere—in an effective way—are increasingly important. Hopefully, Adobe\u0026#39;s Live Co-Editing update becomes a major time-saver, and not an opportunity for managers to shove too many cooks into the creative kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
