  "text": "Disney Plus Sign in to your MUO account Disney Fans of The Simpsons have a reason to rejoice, as Disney+ is offering a 24/7 channel showing all episodes of the show in chronological order. Disney+ Launches a 24/7 Stream of The Simpsons Disney+ has launched a new Stream dedicated entirely to The Simpsons. Starting today (Tuesday, March 18), Disney+ subscribers will be able to tune into a The Simpsons Stream playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In the press release announcing The Simpsons stream, Gabe Lewis, SVP of Programming \u0026 Content Curation, Disney+, said: “From day one, the fans have asked for a Stream of The Simpsons, and we’re happy to oblige. Streams on Disney+ have been a fantastic go-to experience for subscribers looking to sit back and relax with their favorite shows and movies, and we look forward to evolving the user experience and expanding the offering with more Streams, to more subscribers, later this year.” Disney has decided to kick things off by airing all 767 episodes from seasons 1-35 of The Simpsons in chronological order. That represents more than 300 hours of programming, which will take over 12 days to complete. You can find The Simpsons Stream by scrolling down the homepage until you see Streams. However, at the time of writing, it's also displayed as the main header due to Disney promoting the new channel. The Simpsons Stream features \"a programming lineup that will be refreshed monthly\", which suggests that Disney+ will not be playing all episodes chronologically on a loop forever. Instead, next month, it may focus on the Christmas episodes, a particular character, or even episodes in which the yellow-skinned Springfield family appear to predict the future. The Simpsons is an absolute bedrock of television now, having been on the air for 35 years and counting. And while it likely peaked decades ago, it's still more entertaining than much of the dross you'll find on TV these days. So, there's plenty of depth in the catalog for Disney+ to mine for this Stream. Are Viewers Seeking a Return to Cable Television? These \"Streams,\" as Disney+ calls them, are essentially just TV channels as most of us will be familiar with from watching cable. The only real difference being that they're showing one specific show ad infinitum. But Disney+ isn't alone in offering channels to its viewers. I recently explored the FAST (free, ad-supported television) phenomenon, and most of those also offer channels dedicated to specific shows or genres of show. Related I Tried Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV, and I Might Cancel Netflix FAST streaming services have become quite popular, and now I can see why. Which all suggests that viewers are seeking a return to the simpler times of yesteryear, when you didn't need to go looking for something to watch. Instead, you'd select a channel and just melt into the sofa while entertainment was directed into your eyeballs.",
