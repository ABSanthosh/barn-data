This easy-to-make hack is perfect for those looking to maximize space and keep shoes off the floor. His motivation was straightforward: during a home renovation, he needed a way to keep clothing off unfinished walls. “I didn’t want our jackets to touch an unfinished wall, and get dirty,” he explained. The result? A clean, minimalist storage solution that requires minimal tools and materials. Materials and Tools: IKEA LACK Wall shelf (white, 110×26 cm) KUNGSFORS Stainless Steel Hooks (set of 5) Paper tape Pencil Ruler 6mm brad point wood drill bit Cordless drill How To Add Hooks To LACK Shelves Photo Credit: JUMO 1. Apply paper tape along the top front edge of the LACK Wall Shelf where the hooks will be placed. 2. Divide the 110cm shelf length by 6. Draw divider lines on the paper tape (approximately 183mm each). 3, To create placement guides, position a KUNGSFORS hook against the front of the shelf. JUMO suggests a clever marking technique: “Put your pencil against the back of the hook, on the paper tape. Move the hook from left to right, dragging the pencil with it.” This line will intersect with the divider lines, giving you the exact spots to drill for the hooks. 4. Align the wood drill bit with the intersection points of your drawn lines. Carefully drill holes using your cordless drill. JUMO warns, “Be careful, the drill goes through very easily, and you’ll poke a hole in the underside with the drill point if you push too hard.” 5. Insert the hooks into the drilled holes. 6. Install the LACK shelf following IKEA’s instructions and you’re done! Lazy Hacker Tip: X Mark the Spot If you’re unsure about JUMO’s marking method (dragging a pencil across the tape guided by the hook), you can just measure the points. “But this was the fastest way, with the least amount of effort,” he explains with a chuckle, “I’m lazy!” He admits it’s a simple project. “This is probably the easiest hack here, but it does what I needed it to do.” This hack not only serves a practical purpose, and solved his immediate problem. As he puts it, “This was a perfect solution, and it looks great IMO.” The best part? It’s partner-approved. “I got plus points from the misses, who loved it,” he says.Have an IKEA hack you’re proud of? Share it with us and you might be featured next. Beefing Up What’s LACKing In The IKEA Shelf Photo Credit: IKEA.com Hanging heavy jackets on the LACK shelf might strain its wall fixings, especially on drywall. Always install the brackets on wall studs and reinforce them for extra support. Here are two ways: Add support brackets: For extra reinforcement, consider installing L-brackets underneath the shelf. Although this will negate the look of a floating shelf, the brackets can be painted to match your shelf or wall color to minimize its appearance. Add support beam: To increase its load capacity significantly, cut out the drywall behind the mounting bracket and add a wooden support beam between the studs. Screw the bracket into the stud and the support beam to maximize weight capacity. If you’re mounting the LACK shelf on a brick wall, you’ll need a slightly different approach.
