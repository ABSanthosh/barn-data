  "text": "Amazon Echo Auto $14.99 $54.99 Save $40 With the Echo Auto, you can inexpensively add Alexa to almost any car. You can now add the convenience of Amazon’s Alexa to your cars at the lowest price ever, as long as you have Amazon Prime. This hands-free device, which usually costs between $35 and $55, is now being sold for just $15 on Amazon. That’s a great deal and a worthwhile price if you've been wanting to add Alexa to your car. The Amazon Echo Auto is made to bring Alexa’s features into almost any car. It has a thin and small design, so it can fit easily inside the car without blocking the driver’s view or getting in the way. One of its best features is its five built-in microphones, which are designed to pick up voice commands clearly even when there’s background noise like music, air conditioning, or road sounds. You can ask Alexa to play your favorite songs from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify. You can also listen to live radio stations just by using your voice. For people who switch between listening at home and in the car, the Follow Me Music feature makes it easy to keep playing music without interruption, picking up right where it left off. You can make calls and reply to text messages using only your voice, so you don’t have to take your hands off the wheel. The device also lets you connect with Alexa devices at home, so you can give voice commands to your smart home devices or do things like check to see if the front door is locked, change the temperature on the thermostat, or turn off the lights, all without being at home. If you don't have Amazon Prime, the price is $55, but Keepa shows that Amazon just raised it from $35 and has been going back and forth for a while. It's $15 on Amazon with Prime, making it a great deal for anyone subscribed to the service or who wants to try out a free trial.",
