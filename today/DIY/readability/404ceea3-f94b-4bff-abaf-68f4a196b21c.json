  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account One of the best ChatGPT alternatives is getting even better. Anthropic, the developer behind Claude, has announced the arrival of Voice Mode to its mobile apps. This should give you even more ways to interact with Claude from your phone. You Can Finally Talk to Claude on Your Phone Voice Mode is still rolling out in beta on mobile devices. At the time of writing, I haven't yet found it in the Claude app on any of my devices. To check if you have access to Voice Mode, you simply need to open the Claude app on your phone—install it from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store if you haven't yet—and then load up a chat. If you have access to Voice mode, you'll see what looks like a wavelength icon in the bottom right of the chat. It should be located next to the microphone icon you use for speech to text. Claude's new Voice mode is available for both free and paid users of the language model. Paid users will also be able to use Claude's Voice mode to access their Google Docs, Calendar, Gmail, and other web searches using voice conversations. Just like ChatGPT's Voice mode, which OpenAI released late last year, you can easily switch between both voice and text chat modes seamlessly. Anthropic says that previous context is also carried over in between modes and you can choose between five different voices. Limited Availability Anthropic says that Claude's Voice mode is available in English within all of its mobile apps. It's unclear yet when or if it will be available in other languages. The company also says that those using the free version of Claude can expect around 20–30 messages before they have to wait for their session limits to reset, according to an updated support document. While that might not sound like a lot, it should at least let you try out the feature to see how useful you find it. Those with a paid Claude plan will be able to take advantage of the feature for longer periods of time. Related 6 Reasons I Use Claude Instead of ChatGPT ChatGPT is great; don't get me wrong. But Claude is so much better. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear like Anthropic has provided any real insight into how long it will take the feature to roll out across the apps. However, you can check the app store on your device for any available updates, and download them for a better chance of getting access to the functionality.
