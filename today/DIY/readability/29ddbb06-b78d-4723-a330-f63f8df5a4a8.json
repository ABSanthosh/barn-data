  "text": "IKEA might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think “Georgian townhouse,” but Sophie Murphy (@thelistedtownhouse) is here to prove that flat-pack can live beautifully alongside period features. In her elegant dining room, Sophie transformed 3 BILLY bookcases into built-ins that look like they’ve always belonged. The goal? Create a cozy, functional space with extra storage, without blowing the budget. Sophie said, “Sometimes you’ve just got to do things that are both affordable, within reach, but equally beautiful for your home.” The result is a seamless, sophisticated look that feels custom-made and totally at home in a historic setting. Here’s how she pulled it off. What You’ll Need 3 IKEA BILLY bookcases (or more or less to fit your space) 3 x 2s for framing Smooth MDF Wood filler Paint and primer Nail gun Basics — screw gun, drill, saw, tape measure, pencil Use This BILLY Custom Cabinetry Hack to Completely Transform Your Space Photo Credit: Sophie Murphy @thelistedtownhouse | Instagram 1. Assemble and Position the Bookcases Assemble the BILLY bookcases according to IKEA instructions, and line them up where you want them on the wall. Focus on the spacing, keeping the gaps even between the units. 2. Build the Frame Use the 3x2s to create a frame for the BILLY shelves. The frame provides the necessary support for the bookcases. Insert the BILLY units into the frame. 3. Add Toppers or Shelves Photo Credit: Sophie Murphy @thelistedtownhouse | Instagram To extend the BILLY bookcases to the ceiling, you can add a shelf or purchase shelf extensions from IKEA. (If you plan to add extensions or other furniture pieces, account for them when building your frame so they fit into place smoothly.) Sophie already had some spare MDF, so she went with that to save on the budget. She installed the MDF to the frame above the bookcases to continue the illusion of built-ins all the way to the ceiling. 4. Trim Everything Out Add MDF around the bookcases and edges to create the built-in look. Scribe around details, like cornices or other special features. Cutting your MDF to fit around these features allows you to keep them intact. Use decorative molding where you see fit to enhance the look. Sophie used it on the doorframe, which is a popular step when building shelves around doors. 5. Fill Holes, Prime, and Paint Finally, fill all the holes and seams, then prime and paint. Sophie recommends using primer from Zinsser (like Zinsser Bulls Eye) and an eggshell paint. How Much Does This Hack Cost? Sophie had wood from previous projects and searched Facebook Marketplace for second-hand pieces, so she spent about $200. Of course, if you plan to purchase everything new, you’ll spend more — brand-new, the BILLY bookcase is $69.99. However, Sophie recommends checking out Facebook Marketplace or similar avenues first. BILLY Built-In Bookcases Complete the Room Photo Credit: Sophie Murphy @thelistedtownhouse | Instagram Sophie loves how “homey” this hack has made the dining room feel. She said the hardest part was moving the radiator from the wall where they wanted to place the built-ins. So, if you don’t have any significant pieces like that in your way, you’re already ahead of the game. Additionally, since her home was listed, she needed a way to add built-ins that looked fitted without compromising the home’s features. The result is stunning, and Sophie certainly has mad skills, so I can see why she had to bring this idea to life. Her only second thought? Adding cupboards to the bottom — maybe. Photo Credit: Sophie Murphy @thelistedtownhouse | Instagram What about you? Would you change anything or keep this hack exactly the same? Personally, I like Sophie’s idea about adding cabinets to the bottom to provide some closed storage. If you recreate the look or come up with your own design, share your hack. We’d love to see what you come up with and how this DIY inspired you. In the meantime, make sure to follow Sophie Murphy @thelistedtownhouse for more great ideas and inspo!
