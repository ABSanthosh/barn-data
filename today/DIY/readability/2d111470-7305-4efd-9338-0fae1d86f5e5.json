If I gave her a way to get on my desk, I don’t think I would get anything done. She’d curl right up on my keyboard. But this canine-centric hack from R1Alvin gives their pups front-row seats to their workday. Now, I love the idea of providing your pups a safe, easy way to reach high places, especially as they get older. It’s a lot easier on the joints than jumping. So, this doggy ramp attached to IKEA’s TARVA nightstand makes a lot of sense. R1Alvin’s cute doggos don’t want to miss out on any action, and they love to watch the squirrels outside. The ramp gives them the leg up they need, and it looks like they have a lot of fun playing on it, too. If your pets love to be by your side 24/7 (and in your face), then this could be just the hack you need. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA TARVA nightstand Plywood 1 8-foot 1 x 2 2 angled brackets with appropriate hardware (choose the degree that gives you the desired slant) 20 ¼” threaded T-nuts 2 x 4 brace Wood glue Padding or carpet of your choice Basic — tape measure, saw, drill, screw gun Turning the TARVA Nightstand into a Dog Ramp 1. Assemble the TARVA This hack would likely work with any similar nightstand, but presuming you bought the TARVA, go ahead and put it together. Position it with the back next to whatever area you’re trying to give your dog access. 2. Build the Ramp This is the meat and potatoes of this hack. Cut the plywood to size. The hacker made theirs roughly half the width of the TARVA nightstand. Play around with a few options for the length, but you want it to give your dogs a gradual incline. Make sure you have enough space alongside the TARVA to maneuver around the ramp. Cut the 1 x 2 into several pieces that match the width of your ramp. Attach them to the plywood ramp using the threaded nuts and wood glue. This provides the pups with some steps and slip guards. Ikea Tarva Nightstand Dog Ramp Extension Mod byu/R1Alvin inikeahacks Although, since you’re going to add padding, you may decide you don’t need them. R1Alvin also added a 2×4 brace and extra plywood to the bottom for support and stability. 3. Attach the Ramp to the TARVA Use the angle brackets to attach the ramp to the side of the TARVA nightstand. Choose an angle that matches the incline you need for your ramp. 4. Add Padding to the Ramp R1Alvin didn’t have any carpet to cover the ramp, which they said was slippery for their pups. Therefore, they used a bathmat and some straps. You could use foam, cushions, carpet, whatever you think looks and works best in your space. Turning a Simple Ramp into a Playtime Paradise R1Alvin didn’t stop with a simple dog ramp. Once they realized their pups used the ramp, they added IKEA’s DVÄRGMÅS play tunnel for an extra bit of fun. Plus, they started brainstorming some other ideas, saying, “I can build out the top of the nightstand into a small dog pen, but raised high where it’s nice and secure. After that, paint the top of the crate green so it looks like a tree. Tree Woof Fort.” You really could take this idea and run with it. Turn it into the ultimate cat condo, create a cozy raised den, or even connect a few TARVA nightstands and make a doggy obstacle course. What do you think of this hack? How about this pet ramp or these doggy steps? Would your fur baby use something like this? I think mine would, but they would need a minor adjustment period first. Check out some of R1Alvin’s other adventures and doggy fun, and make sure to follow them on Reddit.
