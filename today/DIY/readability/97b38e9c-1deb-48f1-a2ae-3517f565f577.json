It speeds up airport security, adds an extra layer of protection with Face ID or Touch ID, and lets you verify your age or identity quickly without handing over your physical card.Apple first announced support for mobile driver's licenses and state identification cards in Apple Wallet in 2021, with Arizona leading the way as the first state to support the feature in 2022. Since then, Apple has officially stated that it is working with several other states and territories to bring mobile IDs to residents, including Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, West Virginia, and Puerto Rico.While the rollout has been slow (seven of the announced partner states have yet to materialize anything), nine states and one US territory currently support Apple Wallet IDs, and at least 21 other states, districts, and territories are exploring or working toward Apple Wallet implementation.Below is the complete list of supported states and territories. You may also see the terms digital, virtual, or electronic used to describe mobile driver’s licenses and state identification cards; we use the terms interchangeably in this guide.Jump to a sectionThe benefits of mobile driver's licensesList of states with mDLs in Apple WalletList of states with mDLs coming soon to Apple WalletList of all other states and their mDL progress (states, federal districts, US territories)Adding your mobile driver's license to Apple Wallet The benefits of mobile driver's licenses and IDsMobile driver's licenses (mDLs) and mobile IDs (mIDs) offer a variety of benefits, though their functionality varies by state. They provide greater convenience, enhanced security, and a more seamless way to verify identity. Here are some key advantages:Faster airport security: At select airport checkpoints, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) can scan digital IDs stored in Apple Wallet from 10 issuing states. The TSA can also scan digital IDs from five states that issue them via their own wallet apps, including Louisiana, New York, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia. This allows for quicker verification at participating locations but is not yet universal.Accepted by law enforcement in some states: Depending on local regulations, certain states permit or require police officers to accept an mDL or mID when a physical card cannot be presented. However, officers may sometimes request a physical ID as a backup.Useful in various transactions: Depending on where you live, mDLs and mIDs may be accepted by notary publics, used car dealerships, and retail stores. However, businesses are not yet widely required to accept them.Age-restricted purchases: Some retailers allow mDLs and mIDs to buy alcohol, tobacco, or other restricted products, including at self-checkouts. Acceptance varies by store and state regulations.Applying for government benefits: Some government agencies in select states may allow digital IDs when applying for services like unemployment benefits or housing assistance.Potential future uses: While not yet widespread, mDLs and mIDs could eventually be used for renting vehicles, hotel check-ins, and even voting in some states. However, adoption depends on future legislation and infrastructure.Enhanced security: Unlike physical IDs, mDLs and mIDs require Face ID or Touch ID authentication, reducing the risk of theft or fraud.Limited data exposure: You can verify your age or identity without revealing unnecessary personal details, such as your home address.Less risk of loss or damage: No more worrying about bending, cracking, or losing your ID — it's always accessible on your smartphone.As adoption grows, digital IDs could become even more widely accepted, reducing the need for physical wallets and offering a more secure, convenient way to verify identity. List of states with mDLs in Apple WalletSince Arizona's enrollment, only eight other states have allowed you to add mobile driver's licenses or state identification cards to Apple Wallet.

List of states with mDLs coming soon to Apple WalletPuerto Rico driver's licenses and state IDs were the most recent addition to Apple Wallet. Several other states have announced plans to support mDLs and mIDs in Apple Wallet in the near future. For example, Montana, Virginia, and West Virginia have all committed to bringing mDLs to Apple Wallet, as confirmed by Apple or state officials. However, no specific timeline was provided for some of them.Virginia [VA] — In 2017, HB 2229 was signed into law, authorizing — but not requiring — the DMV to issue electronic credentials to persons with valid physical credentials. In 2020, the DMV stated that it had not yet implemented electronic credentials due to budget concerns and ongoing industry studies. By 2023, Virginia's DMV director of communications said that Virginia's mID app would launch soon, and it first appeared in the App Store on April 1, 2024. As of February 2025, it's still listed as a test program. Apple Wallet status: According to its mID FAQ, Virginia is working with Apple to support Virginia driver's licenses and ID cards in Apple Wallet \"in the near future.\"Montana [MT] — In 2023, HB 519.1 was signed into law, stating that mDLs will be acceptable alternatives to physical driver's licenses starting Sept. 1, 2025.

It's anticipated that Montana will integrate mDLs into Apple Wallet by or shortly after the September 2025 deadline.West Virginia [WV] — West Virginia has developed its own Mobile ID app, which allows residents to store their mDLs on their phones.

Integration with Apple Wallet is expected shortly.Additionally, in a press release from Sept. 19, 2024, Apple announced that Japan had signed on to bring its My Number Card to Apple Wallet, marking the first international ID to support Apple Wallet. It may finally show up in iOS 18.4, currently in beta. List of all other states and their mDL progressAs of August 2024, at least 18 other states, districts, and territories have shown interest in using Apple Wallet as their primary or secondary means of issuing and storing virtual driver's licenses and IDs on mobile devices.Others have shown no interest in using Apple Wallet for mDLs but still support digital identification options, some of which already have them via standalone apps or other wallet providers. Some states, districts, and territories have shown no interest in mDL programs that we are aware of. StatesAlabama [AL] — Previously issued mDLs as passes in Apple Wallet but no longer does.

No decisions have been made on that front. Apple Wallet status: Being considered.Rhode Island [RI] — In December 2023, the DMV's assistant administrator said the mDLs were on its radar but also implied it was waiting for more services to accept mDLs for identification.

Adding your mobile driver's license to Apple WalletThe process for adding your mobile driver's license or state ID to Apple Wallet is relatively easy. It requires an iPhone 8 or newer with iOS 16.5 or later. If you have an Apple Watch, you'll need Series 4 or newer with WatchOS 9.5 or later.
