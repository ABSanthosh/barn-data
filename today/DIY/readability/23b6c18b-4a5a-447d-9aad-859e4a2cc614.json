IKEA just dropped the mic with their first-ever global talent show, and let me tell you, it’s not about building furniture – it’s about building harmony. Earlier this year, they turned the spotlight on their musically gifted co-workers, and did they deliver. Picture this: 150 talented IKEA co-workers from 21 countries, stepping away from their Allen keys and instruction manuals to share their musical gifts. The grand winner, Thomas from Austria, was overwhelmed when he found out that his colleagues worldwide had voted for him. But here’s where it gets even better – the top six winners got to record their songs at the legendary Atlantis Studio in Stockholm – the very same studio where ABBA recorded their hits. They even created a special bonus track called “Coming Home” together, written by Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group. Talk about a multi-talented boss. Streaming At All IKEA Stores \u0026 Spotify Starting October 23rd, you’ll be able to hear these amazing talents while you’re wandering through the maze of marketplace finds and hacker inspiration. The playlist features the top 15 acts and is available on Spotify and other major streaming platforms. As Cristle from IKEA USA put it, “IKEA has given us an outlet to express our talent, our gifts.” And isn’t that what we’re all about in the IKEA hacking community? Expressing ourselves through creativity, whether it’s transforming a KALLAX into a DJ booth or, hacking a LACK table into an audio rack. The next time you’re in an IKEA store, hunting for your next hack inspiration, you’ll not only smell those irresistible cinnamon buns and feel the softness of the POLARVIDE throws, but you’ll also be treated to the songs from IKEA Talents. And who knows? Maybe like me, you’ll find yourself swaying between the aisles, adding a soundtrack to your DIY dreams. Stream the playlist now on Spotify and all major streaming platforms.",
