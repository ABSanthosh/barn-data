The new LÅDMAKARE series delivers a sleek aesthetic that incorporates nicely with various styles and offers a custom look without breaking the bank. But what sets this new species apart from the other storage superstars in the IKEA ecosystem? Perhaps the LÅDMAKARE line isn’t here to compete, but rather, to play well with others, offering customers even more ways to mix and match their organizational efforts. So, which is it? Replace or enhance? After taking a closer look, it seems the answer depends on the consumer. One of IKEA’s strengths is placing the needs of the customer first, and part of that is keeping a finger on the pulse of what people want. If current products are missing the mark for some, but an easy bullseye for others, it makes sense to introduce something new to fill in the gaps. The recent line of LÅDMAKARE shelving and accessories is IKEA’s latest response to what people are asking for. LÅDMAKARE Series Marks the Start of a New Era in IKEA Storage Systems Photo Credit: LÅDMAKARE Storage Combination | IKEA.com The LÅDMAKARE series is part of IKEA’s January 2025 product launch. It made its debut in Europe before rolling out in the US. Like many of the popular IKEA systems, LÅDMAKARE is modular, allowing you to customize it in many different ways to suit your style and space. A highlight of the series is how easily you can mix open and closed storage so seamlessly. The backless design keeps things light and airy and the timeless style makes the system easy to coordinate with your other furniture and decor. Photo Credit: LÅDMAKARE Cabinet With Sliding Doors | IKEA.com The designer of the series, Friso Wiersma, says, “My idea with LÅDMAKARE was to create storage that allows for personal expression by displaying your favorite items, while offering closed storage for things you’d rather keep out of sight. It has a simple, clean look and generous dimensions, making it possible to build a solution for an entire wall. For me, it’s not just about the furniture itself but about showcasing the user’s personal stories and experiences. Just like a beautiful frame around a beloved painting.” Pieces in the LÅDMAKARE series include two sizes of shelf units, middle panels, side panels, shelves, an insert with compartments, sliding doors, and various combinations that feature different configurations of these elements. The convenient LÅDMAKARE design planner makes it possible to create your ideal custom storage solution in a matter of minutes. Photo Credit: LÅDMAKARE Insert With Compartments | IKEA.com How Does LÅDMAKARE Compare to Other IKEA Shelving Systems? Photo Credit: LÅDMAKARE Shelf | IKEA.com Like many of IKEA’s popular shelving systems, such as the enduring BILLY series and the IVAR and BROR families, LÅDMAKARE offers many options. There are different sizes to choose from and various compartments and inserts, all at a reasonable price point. But LÅDMAKARE also has a few things the other systems don’t. For example, the LÅDMAKARE shelves are slightly shallower than the middle and side panels. This smaller measurement is very much intentional, creating a gap for easier cable management in the back of the units. The side panels also have cut-outs at the bottom to fit over baseboards so you can fit your storage system snugly against the wall. Another interesting note about the LÅDMAKARE system is that you can’t make it completely closed storage. The design prohibits you from placing two cabinets directly on top of one another. Therefore, you’re going to end up with some open storage (or display space) when you use this system. But what are some key differences between the LÅDMAKARE series and other IKEA frontrunners? BILLY Photo Credit: BILLY Storage Combination | IKEA.com Designer Gillis Lundgren was tasked with the challenge of creating a simple, functional storage solution for books. Admittedly, they never expected it to become such a worldwide sensation, and today, IKEA continues to adapt and develop the BILLY series. According to IKEA’s website, someone buys a BILLY bookshelf every five seconds. This IKEA classic has made its way into many homes across the world since its introduction in 1979. The simple design keeps the BILLY adaptable to multiple styles and the various combinations offer countless storage options and looks. However, the LÅDMAKARE could take the place of the BILLY in some IKEA lovers’ hearts thanks to its more seamless design. For example, the use of a single side wall to join two shelving units helps maximize space and provides a sleeker look. In contrast, if you want to expand your BILLY storage system, you need another BILLY, which means an additional side wall. Plus, the BILLY isn’t backless, so for some, it can end up looking a bit clunkier. However, the BILLY does offer substantially more finish options compared to the LÅDMAKARE’s single oak effect finish. But, to be fair, the new series is fresh on the scene, so given time, if it continues to be such a hit, IKEA could add a few more finish options. IVAR Photo Credit: IVAR Storage Combination | IKEA.com The IVAR storage system has been a go-to for many IKEA fans for over 50 years. It’s a workhorse in many different areas of the house, offering closed and open storage options.  However, it does have a more rustic look with its unfinished solid pine construction. Of course, this also means it’s perfect for staining or painting, allowing you to give it any color or finish you desire. The line also includes steel cabinets if you want to mix things up a bit. Additionally, while all of IKEA’s storage systems require you to secure them to a wall, the IVAR needs a little more. You need the OBSERVATÖR cross brace for every second section to increase stability. BROR Photo Credit: BROR Shelving Units | IKEA.com BROR is by far one of IKEA’s sturdiest and most durable shelving systems if you need to handle a lot of weight. It also has a much more industrial or urban loft look thanks to its metal construction. One major difference between the LÅDMAKARE shelving and the others on this list is its load capacity. IKEA’s newest storage system handles the least weight per shelf at 44 pounds. BILLY comes next at 66 pounds, then IVAR at 77 pounds. Compare these two-digit figures to BROR’s impressive 286-pound load per shelf, and you can see how this system is a better fit for more intense storage needs, like garages. It also withstands moisture and dirt well, although it’s intended for indoor use just like the BILLY, IVAR, and LÅDMAKARE. Think — All for One, Not One for ALL Photo Credit: LÅDMAKARE Middle Panel | IKEA.com These differences don’t mean you need to use one system or another. That’s what’s so great about IKEA’s storage solutions — they give you options to choose the best piece for your needs.  So, you might set up a sturdy BROR system in the garage and hardworking IVAR cabinets and shelves in your pantry. A simple BILLY bookcase might be just what you need for your bedroom book nook, and the LÅDMAKARE gives you the stunning, space-saving custom look you want in your living room. LÅDMAKARE in the Wild: How Are People Using This Sleek Shelving in Their Homes? Photo Credit: LÅDMAKARE Storage Combination | IKEA.com Check out how the LÅDMAKARE can add an impact to your space with its ample storage, stylish appeal, and airy design. This wall full of shelving was just what Matlan Thihlum(@matlanthihlum) envisioned but was worried the look would be too expensive. Thanks to LÅDMAKARE, they got the look they wanted without busting their budget. Sarah Sarora (@saar.interior.tips) shows off another suggestion for how to style your LÅDMAKARE shelves. The shelves also work well as a backdrop in your dining area, like this installation from Pınar Erdur (@petitekare). There’s Always Room for More Hacks Every IKEA product seems to eventually become the subject of creative DIYers’ imaginations. For example, check out these two popular IKEA hacks. A New Built-In Bookcase Photo Credit: Claire Douglas This wall of built-ins looks like a high-end custom job that could easily cost thousands. However, Claire Douglas is the mastermind behind this sophisticated BILLY bookcase transformation. An IVAR Glow-Up Photo Credit: Alana Gennara Alanna Gennara turned simple IVAR elements into a stunning storage cabinet with a gorgeous sunburst design. Therefore, it’s only a matter of time before IKEA’s latest shelving system follows in the same footsteps as its storage combination predecessors. What do you think? Will the LÅDMAKARE lead to more clever hacks like these BILLY bookcase makeovers and other creative endeavors? Time will tell, but I think it’s a good bet that we can expect to see some interesting reimaginings of IKEA’s latest shelving system.",
