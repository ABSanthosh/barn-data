Without proper protection, these gadgets put your privacy and security at risk, but there are some simple steps you can take to secure your home. 1 Wi-Fi Routers Proxima Studio / Shutterstock If there’s one device in your home that hackers would love to get their hands on, it’s your Wi-Fi router. And that’s because your router connects all your devices to the internet. A compromised router can give hackers access to every device on your network, from your laptop to your smart fridge. Two common vulnerabilities of Wi-Fi routers are outdated firmware and the use of default login credentials. A study by the Ohio Society of CPAs found that 89% of respondents had never updated their router firmware, and 72% had never changed their Wi-Fi password. To secure your router, ensure its firmware is always up-to-date. If you’re unfamiliar with the process, refer to our guide on updating router firmware. Next, change the default login credentials to something strong and unique. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Encryption matters, too. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it—or at least WPA2—to protect your network from unauthorized access. 2 Smart Security Cameras and Doorbells Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock Smart security cameras and doorbells are meant to protect your home, but they can do the opposite if left unsecured. As with Wi-Fi routers, outdated firmware, and default passwords are the leading vulnerabilities for smart cameras and doorbells. Hackers exploit these weaknesses to access live feeds, disable devices, or even use them as a gateway to your entire network. To lock things down, start by changing the default passwords and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) if available. Ensure your camera’s firmware is always up-to-date, as manufacturers frequently release patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. Opt for models that offer end-to-end encryption for video streams, which prevents unauthorized access even if the data is intercepted. Additionally, avoid using public Wi-Fi networks to access your camera feeds, as these connections are often unsecured and easy to exploit. 3 Smart Speakers and Voice Assistants Smart speakers and voice assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri are incredibly convenient. However, these devices are always listening and can also pose a security risk. In August 2024, the NCC Group reported vulnerabilities in Sonos smart speakers that could let hackers eavesdrop on users. This is just one of several incidents where smart speakers have proven to be vulnerable devices. There’s a limit to what you can do to secure your smart speaker—especially when it’s a manufacturer-side vulnerability. However, you can minimize your risk by reviewing device permissions and disabling features like voice purchasing or remote access. Something else you can do is be cautious about connecting third-party apps or services to your voice assistant, as these can introduce vulnerabilities. 4 Smart TVs Your smart TV could also be a gateway for hackers and data trackers. Many smart TVs collect data about your viewing habits, and if hacked, they can become a portal for attackers to infiltrate your home network. Some smart TVs even come with built-in cameras and microphones, which could be exploited for spying if not properly secured. To protect yourself, start by disabling ACR and other tracking features in your TV’s settings. Every brand buries this option in a different place, but a quick search for your model should point you in the right direction. Also, avoid installing unnecessary apps—each one is a potential security risk, especially if it’s not from a trusted developer. 5 Smart Home Hubs and Automation Systems Smart home hubs let you control everything from your lights to your thermostat with a single command. But that convenience also makes them a high-value target for hackers. If a hacker breaches your hub, they could potentially control every device linked to it. The biggest risk comes from weak passwords and unpatched software. Many users set up their smart home hubs once and forget about them, leaving them vulnerable to exploits that manufacturers have already patched in newer updates. Attackers can also exploit weak authentication methods through default credentials or brute-force attacks. To keep your hub secure, use strong, unique passwords—especially if your hub requires an online account. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a must when available. Also, regularly check for firmware updates to ensure you're running the latest security patches. Another often overlooked risk is third-party integrations. Many hubs support dozens of smart devices and apps, but each connection is a potential vulnerability. Only link trusted devices, and be wary of granting excessive permissions. If a random third-party app doesn’t need access to your security system, don’t give it. Finally, consider setting up a dedicated network for your smart home devices. Many routers let you create a separate guest network, keeping your IoT devices isolated from your main computer and phone connections. This way, breaching your hub doesn't give immediate access to other devices. 6 Gaming Consoles Stepan Skorobogadko / Shutterstock If you think gaming consoles are just about fun and games, hackers would love to prove you wrong. From stored payment details to voice and camera features, these devices hold more personal data than most people realize. Kaspersky Lab reported a 13% increase in malicious software attack on games in the first half of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Hackers use stolen credentials from other sites to break into gaming accounts, especially if you’ve reused passwords. Once inside, they can make unauthorized purchases, sell your account online, or lock you out entirely. Privacy is another concern. Consoles collect data on everything from your gaming habits to your voice chats. While this can improve your experience, it also means more personal information is at risk if there’s a breach. So, what’s the fix? First, secure your gaming accounts with a rock-solid password (yes, a real one—not \"gamer123\"). Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) so that even if someone gets your password, they’ll hit a dead end. And while you’re at it, double-check your linked payment methods—it's better to remove that stored credit card than risk waking up to unexpected charges. Privacy settings are another must-check. Most consoles let you tweak what data they collect, who can see your gaming activity, and whether your microphone or camera is always listening. If you don’t want your console eavesdropping, disable voice assistants and put a cover on that camera when you’re not using it. Your home is more connected than ever, but that convenience comes with risks. Cybercriminals are always looking for weak spots, and these devices are usually the easiest targets. The good news? The tips you just learned will go a long way in keeping you safe.",

If a hacker breaches your hub, they could potentially control every device linked to it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest risk comes from weak passwords and unpatched software.

Attackers can also exploit weak authentication methods through default credentials or brute-force attacks.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTo keep your hub secure, use strong, unique passwords—especially if your hub requires an online account.

Also, regularly check for firmware updates to ensure you\u0026#39;re running the latest security patches.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAnother often overlooked risk is third-party integrations. Many hubs support dozens of smart devices and apps, but each connection is a potential vulnerability. Only link trusted devices, and be wary of granting excessive permissions. If a random third-party app doesn’t need access to your security system, don’t give it.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, consider setting up a dedicated network for your smart home devices. Many routers let you create a separate guest network, keeping your IoT devices isolated from your main computer and phone connections.
