I was away the past three weekends, first we visited my daughter in Santa Barbara, next we ran away on a 4 day trip to Kauai, and then we drove up north to visit our son at his university. Finally, a weekend to enjoy being at home! I can feel spring in the air, we had a few days of sunshine and the trees are beginning to bud, but there is still rain in the forecast. I’ve been at my law firm for five months now, I’ve learned so much, but I confess I miss this blog and and I miss having more time to be creative. I need to be better about budgeting more time for creativity. Thankfully I can work remotely so now that the time change allows for more daylight in the evenings, my plan is come home early and spend an hour gardening, making art, and little updates around the house. Happy early spring friends :) Favorite links spied this week: This elevated A frame renovation. This color and pattern filled Florida coastal home.
