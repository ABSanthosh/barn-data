  "text": "Did you know that WhatsApp for mobile didn't have a drafts feature for all this time? If you're now wondering where on earth the feature has been all this time, don't fret; Meta has now added drafts to its messenger app, allowing you to create texts to send later. WhatsApp Finally Remembers to Send That Draft About Adding Drafts As announced on WhatsApp's Threads account, you can now save a message for later. To do this, start typing to someone, then back out to the contacts list before you send the message. When you do, the preview that usually shows the last sent message in the conversation will instead say \"Draft\" in green text, followed by the message you were typing. It'll also bump that conversation to the top of the contacts list. Other than that, the new feature seems to work just as you'd expect it to. You can type a message to someone, close out the conversation for whatever reason, and then come back later and finish your thoughts. As reported by Engadget, it appears the feature is already rolling out to everyone worldwide, so there's no need to sign up for a beta or enroll in anything to get it. Just make sure you update your WhatsApp app on Android or iOS before you start wondering where the drafts are.",
