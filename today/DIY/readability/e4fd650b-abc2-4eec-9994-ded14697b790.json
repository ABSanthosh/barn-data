  "text": "Apple Watch Sign in to your MUO account A new pair of updated iPad models wasn’t the only thing Apple just unveiled. Just like in previous years, Apple has refreshed its lineup of iPhone and Apple Watch bands with some new Spring-inspired colors. A New Season of Colors for iPhone Cases Apple has added four new colors to its popular silicone case for the iPhone 16 lineup. You can now choose from Tangerine, Aquamarine, Peony, and Periwinkle. The cases are available for the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Each case is $49. More Hues To Choose from for Many Apple Watch Bands Apple’s wide variety of Apple Watch bands are a great complement to the wearable device. And four of the band options received new color choices. First up, the Solo Loop is now available in Peony, Periwinkle, and Northern Lights. Since there is no buckle, you will need to use a fit guide to find the best size for you. The band is $49. Related Every Apple Watch Band Compared Struggling to choose which Apple Watch band to choose? Here’s a description of every band option to help you find the best one for you. Just like the Solo Loop, make sure to find the best size choice before buying a Braided Solo Loop. Three new color choices include Tangerine, Aquamarine, and Peony for the $99 band. Another popular option is Apple’s Sport Loop which is lightweight and easy to wear. You can choose from a new Periwinkle or Sage hue of the $49 band. The classic $49 Sports Band is also now available in Aquamarine, Tangerine, and Periwinkle. If you have a bit more to spend and are looking for a luxurious band option, there are a pair of new Hermès bands. The Bleu Hydra En Mer is for the Apple Watch Ultra and is $449 while the Noir/Ecru Toile H Single Tour is $349. Jazz Up Your iPhone or Apple Watch Apple’s fun and unique color options provide a great way to help your Apple Watch or iPhone stand out from the crowd. I always enjoy finding unique colors, especially for my Apple Watch, and my wallet likely won't appreciate me after buying a new band or two.",
