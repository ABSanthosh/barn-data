I feel the same way about organizing — if I see a chance to get extra storage, I’m taking it. That’s why I love this hack from Haus Auf Der Apfelwiese @haus_auf_der_apfelwiese. They have a sloped low ceiling, which we all know is often the sworn enemy of storage space. They tried to make it work with three IKEA MALM dressers, but it left a lot of untapped potential below the angled ceiling. The solution utilized PLATSA cabinets with taller doors to close in every inch of space and practically double the available storage. They chose to hack the PLATSA because of its versatility and modular design. Its flexible structure made it an ideal candidate for adapting to their space. However, the PLATSA and the FONNES series aren’t available in IKEA US, so we’ll touch on some alternatives later. What You’ll Need 5 IKEA PLATSA units (60cm x 55cm x 120cm) 6 FONNES doors (60cm x 180 cm) 5 VINNÄSET knobs (three two-packs) 10 HJÄLPA hinges (one 10-pack) Heavy-duty adhesive Basics — drill, screw gun, tape measure, pencil, saw How to Create Custom Low Ceiling Storage Cabinets Photo Credit: Haus Auf Der Apfelwiese @haus_auf_der_apfelwiese | Instagram 1. Assemble the Base Frames Put together the PLATSA frames according to IKEA instructions and line them up side by side. Secure the frames to the wall and each other using the appropriate hardware.  2. Cut the Doors to Size Five of the FONNES doors are for the front of the cabinets. Measure and cut them to size, one for each unit. The sixth door is for the side panel. Measure the appropriate slope and height and cut to size. 3. Add Hinges and Attach Doors Install the HJÄLPA hinges, and attach the doors to the frames. Take your time and make sure they are even and open and close smoothly. 4. Close in the Side Use adhesive to secure the sloped panel to the exposed side of the PLATSA frames. This finishes off the built-in closet, giving it a nice, polished look. If you want to add extra stability to the side panel, use small brackets to attach the side to the top of the outermost PLATSA frame. (Do so from the inside and use screws short enough so they don’t go through the side.) Alternatively, you could use a nail gun and fill in the nail holes with wood filler, then paint the whole unit. 5. Finishing Touches After getting all of the doors in place, add the VINNÄSET knobs. You could swap these out for any style knob you choose. Also, although the hackers didn’t do this, you could add some narrow trim around the top and where the back meets the wall to further enhance the built-in appearance. According to the creator, the entire project was completed over the course of a weekend, making it a relatively quick yet satisfying DIY. What they love most about the hack is how it transformed a previously awkward nook into a space that looks completely custom-built. The final result fits so seamlessly into the room that it feels like it was always meant to be there. The hardest part of the process, they tell us, was drilling the new hinge holes at the correct height and measurement. Precision was crucial to ensure the full functionality of the doors. Their advice to others tackling a similar project is to take your time and measure everything carefully. A little extra attention to detail can make all the difference in achieving that polished, professional look. Check out the hack, and follow Haus Auf Der Apfelwiese @haus_auf_der_apfelwiese for more inspiring ideas. What If You Can’t Get the PLATSA and FONNES Pieces? If you’re in the US, you won’t find PLATSA or FONNES on the IKEA US site. But that doesn’t mean you can’t recreate this hack, you just have to approach it a little differently. One option is to do a very similar step-by-step using like-sized pieces from the BESTÅ series. Of course, depending on the size of the area you’re trying to fill, you may need smaller or larger frames and doors than what Haus Auf Der Apfelwiese used. Also, since the HJÄLPA hinges are for the PLATSA series, you’ll likely need different hinges if you switch to another frame. For example, if you go with BESTÅ frames, you might opt for the BESTÅ soft-close hinges instead. You can use the IKEA design and planning tools as a jumping-off point to determine what size units and additional products you need. If you prefer to go with a hack that features IKEA products you can get in the US, conquer a sloped ceiling using this built-in wardrobe or this mirrored PAX closet. There are also tons of other DIYs for creating storage systems within a low ceiling. Therefore, it’s worth reviewing your options to find one that makes the most sense for you and your space. After you create your own custom closet, share your hack so we can see the grand finale!
