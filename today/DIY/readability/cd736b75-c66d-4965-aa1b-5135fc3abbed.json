  "text": "Samsung Sign in to your MUO account Samsung's smart TVs are finally set to receive its One UI, the unified operating system used throughout all its devices. Based on Samsung's Tizen operating system, the update has been a long time coming, and will make it even easier to link your devices. Samsung Brings One UI to Tizen-Powered Smart TVs First spotted by SamMobile, Samsung is following up on the information revealed at its Developer Conference in early October 2024. The update brings One UI to Samsung smart TVs running Tizen OS, which will be bundled with the upcoming Tizen 8.0 update. One UI brings Samsung's smartphone interface to smart TVs and delivers some new features to boot. For example, One UI will bring a new For You tab featuring personalized recommendations, along with Live and Apps tabs to help you find more content. The Apps tab should help unify your apps across devices, too. I'm also interested to see Samsung Daily+, which Samsung is billing as \"a lifestyle service hub that provides useful daily life experiences.\" It'll live on your smart TV Home screen after the update, and I imagine it'll use your searches and other interactions to provide a content stream. That could be handy, but the phrasing also conjures up visions of Samsung and Bixby doling out useful life quotes and inspirational phrases in your living room. Elsewhere, there's a new Multi Control tool to connect multiple Samsung hardware devices to a single mouse and keyboard, plus deeper integration for Samsung SmartThings IoT devices. When Is the Samsung One UI Update Landing on Tizen Smart TVs? The Samsung One UI update is rolling out, though there is no specific timeline for it to land on your TV. Samsung advises you to \"keep your device up to date and regulary check for software updates.\" However, there is one potential drawback to note: \"Once you install this version of the OS, you cannot uninstall or revert back to the previous version.\" In other words, you're locked into One UI whether you like it or not, so consider whether you want the permanent upgrade before hitting update.",

Developer Conference in early October 2024.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe update brings One UI to Samsung smart TVs running Tizen OS, which will be bundled with the upcoming Tizen 8.0 update. One UI brings \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-one-ui-6-features-samsung-galaxy/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSamsung\u0026#39;s smartphone interface\u003c/a\u003e to smart TVs and delivers some new features to boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, One UI will bring a new For You tab featuring personalized recommendations, along with Live and Apps tabs to help you find more content. The Apps tab should help unify your apps across devices, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m also interested to see Samsung Daily+, which Samsung is billing as \u0026#34;a lifestyle service hub that provides useful daily life experiences.\u0026#34; It\u0026#39;ll live on your smart TV Home screen after the update, and I imagine it\u0026#39;ll use your searches and other interactions to provide a content stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat could be handy, but the phrasing also conjures up visions of Samsung and Bixby doling out useful life quotes and inspirational phrases in your living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eElsewhere, there\u0026#39;s a new Multi Control tool to connect multiple Samsung hardware devices to a single mouse and keyboard, plus deeper integration for Samsung SmartThings IoT devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"when-is-the-samsung-one-ui-update-landing-on-tizen-smart-tvs\"\u003e When Is the Samsung One UI Update Landing on Tizen Smart TVs? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Samsung One UI update is rolling out, though there is no specific timeline for it to land on your TV.
