  "text": "Apple Apple iPad Air (M3) 2025's iPad Air upgrade features an M3 chip, is compatible with a new keyboard folio case, and has support for Apple Intelligence. It's almost identical to the previous model in terms of look and feel. Ever since Apple's iPad range started using the company's desktop-range M series of chips, it has become a good middle-ground option for those who don't want to go all the way up to a Mac. If you're there too, the iPad Air range is currently greatly discounted, letting you save money on some of Apple's best tablets. The newly-launched iPad Air range is typically $599 for the 11-inch model and $799 for the 13-inch model. Right now, though, both models are $100 off, letting you keep an extra Benjamin in your pocket and still get the latest and greatest iPad. The new iPad Air range comes with an M3 chip out of the box. It's not exactly an M4, which is already used on the iPad Pro range, but it's still an important upgrade from what we had before. And this particular model is really good if you don't want to commit to a Pro model, which some people might consider a waste of money. This product features a Liquid Retina Display, starts at 128GB of storage (and yes, all storage models are discounted), and 12MP front and back cameras. We have support for Wi-Fi 6E, Touch ID, and despite its slim profile, it has really good battery life. And it has support for both the Apple Pencil Pro and the Magic Keyboard, so it's able to become a very portable productivity machine. Related We've never seen these particular iPads drop this low, and while they still have plenty of room to go down in price even further in the coming months (especially if Apple decides to launch newer models down the road), there's never been a better time to buy these. $100 is not a lot, but it allows you to get some accessories without going over your budget. Get yours now while this deal lasts!",

Right now, though, both models are $100 off, letting you keep an extra Benjamin in your pocket and still get the latest and greatest iPad.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe new iPad Air range comes with an M3 chip out of the box. It\u0026#39;s not exactly an M4, which is already used on the iPad Pro range, but it\u0026#39;s still an important upgrade from what we had before. And this particular model is really good if you don\u0026#39;t want to commit to a Pro model, which some people might consider a waste of money. This product features a Liquid Retina Display, starts at 128GB of storage (and yes, all storage models are discounted), and 12MP front and back cameras. We have support for Wi-Fi 6E, Touch ID, and despite its slim profile, it has really good battery life. And it has support for both the Apple Pencil Pro and the Magic Keyboard, so it\u0026#39;s able to become a very portable productivity machine.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n

the coming months (especially if Apple decides to launch newer models down the road), there\u0026#39;s never been a better time to buy these. $100 is not a lot, but it allows you to get some accessories without going over your budget.
