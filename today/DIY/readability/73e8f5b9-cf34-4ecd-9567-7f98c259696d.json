Today, IKEA hacking is everywhere, featured in the budget DIYer’s home to posh designer residences, and every place in between.While its popularity has soared, the risks associated with hacking haven’t disappeared. You might scroll through your Instagram feed and encounter an IKEA hack that seems brilliant, only to attempt it yourself and end up with a total disaster. Painting, for instance, is a prime example. Social media make it look so easy, but if you’ve ever tried it, you know it takes far more work than what’s shown on a 30-second reel.IKEA hacks are all the rage now, promising to transform affordable furniture into unique and stylish home decor. However, this promise doesn’t always hold. Let me share with you the 13 worst IKEA hacking mistakes to avoid – mistakes I’ve personally made and learned from. 1. Skimping on Preparation Photo Credit: IKEA.com Preparation is key when it comes to IKEA hacks. Rushing into a project without proper planning can lead to frustration and poor results. I always take time to measure my space – twice if I have to, gather all the necessary tools, and plot out my design. As far as possible, I envision all the steps necessary for the hack and write them down. Of course, reality doesn’t always follow the plan but like the savvy girl scout that I am, it helps to be prepared. Use the IKEA planners if you’re planning a kitchen, bathroom, or any of the storage units, such as the BESTÅ and PAX. I find it useful to picture the space and map out the workflow and storage requirements before committing to a purchase.Spend most of your time in this phase and you’ll save yourself a lot of headaches, wasted time, and money. 2. Ignoring Structural Integrity Photo Credit: Richard One of the biggest IKEA hacking mistakes is compromising the structural integrity of the furniture. Drilling too many holes, removing crucial support pieces, or hacking furniture not meant for certain spaces of the home, especially the kitchen and bathroom where heat and moisture are major factors, can lead to wobbly and unsafe furniture. Your hack might warp, peel, weaken, and collapse, causing damage and potential injury.The sooner you learn the universal IKEA laws, the better off you’ll be. The smart thing would be to plan your hacks around these limitations: First, particleboard is not made to withstand moisture, regardless of how many layers of protective coatings you slap on the surface. It will swell from constant exposure to water. Second, many IKEA pieces are not wood. They could be made of a paper filling sandwiched between particleboard and wood veneer or paper foil. These paper honeycomb structures will not hold up to any screws or nails. 3. Overcomplicating the Hack Simple is often better when it comes to IKEA hacks. Adding too many steps or modifications can complicate the project and lead to mistakes. Stick to straightforward hacks that enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the piece without making it overly complex because sometimes, less is more. 4. Not Considering the Overall Design Your IKEA hack should complement the overall design of your space. Choosing colors, finishes, and styles that clash with your existing decor can make the piece stand out for all the wrong reasons and the piece you worked so hard on might end up looking out of place. 5. Skipping Cleaning, Sanding and Priming Photo Credit: Elyse Proper surface preparation is crucial for a successful IKEA hack. A little extra effort here like taking time to clean, degrease and dry your IKEA furniture can make your hack look professional and the finish last longer. Take the time to lightly sand the surface and apply a suitable and quality primer like the Zinsser BIN Shellac Primer before painting to ensure a smooth and long-lasting finish. 6. Using the Wrong Paint or Finish Not all paints and finishes are suitable for IKEA furniture, which often has a slick surface that can be hard for paint to adhere to. After applying a bonding primer designed for laminate surfaces, use a high-quality oil or latex-based paint for a durable finish. If you prefer a matte finish, try a chalk paint like Frenchic Paint. You can usually skimp on paint when you use a quality primer beforehand, as the primer allows the paint to stick to the surface.Some paints claim to eliminate the need for primer. Each paint is different so read the manufacturer’s instructions and conduct a test on an inconspicuous area of the furniture before applying it to the entire piece. Let it dry thoroughly, following the recommended times. Then, perform the nail scratch test: if the paint passes this test, you may be able to skip the priming step. This simple precaution can save you time and ensure a better final result. 7. Overlooking Weight Limits Photo Credit: IKEA.com While it’s tempting to choose the cheapest option for a project, these less expensive pieces often indicate lower durability. They are frequently made with honeycomb structures that offer little to no support. If you’re planning to use the furniture to hold something heavy, be sure to check the product’s maximum load limits. Investing in a slightly pricier but sturdier piece can save you from potential disasters and disappointments in the long run. 8. Choosing the Wrong Tools Using the wrong tools can make your hack more difficult and lead to mistakes, so invest in quality tools that are appropriate for the job. For instance, Allen key drill bits. Getting the drill bit set was a lifesaver and saved me hours of pain turning the tiny Allen wrench. If you don’t have a set, try this hex head hack: Grab one end of the hex key with a plier and snap off the other end using another plier. Then insert that bit into your power screwdriver for your DIY hex head.Tools, if you need to buy new ones, will add to your hacking costs. So what you save in buying affordable IKEA furniture, you may end up spending on tools and materials. 9. Ignoring the Instructions Photo Credit: IKEA.com Even if you’re planning a major modification, it’s essential to understand the original assembly instructions. This knowledge helps you avoid mistakes that can compromise the piece’s integrity. I once assembled an IKEA MELLTORP table without even glancing at the manual. I thought, “How hard can that be?” I ended up with screws poking through the tabletop. I’ve learned my lesson since.Understanding the original design can inform your hacking process. I will usually download the manual from IKEA’s website and look through it as I plan the hack. I’ll note where the screws go, surfaces I can modify, and how to reassemble it after making the mods. 10. Overestimating Your Skills Ambitious projects can be exciting, but overestimating your DIY skills may lead to unfinished or poorly executed hacks. Begin with simpler projects to build your confidence and skills before tackling more complex ones. It’s essential to learn the necessary techniques, and it’s perfectly okay to make mistakes along the way. Fortunately, there are lots of resources to help you develop your abilities. Take advantage of YouTube tutorials and online classes that teach various DIY skills, such as painting techniques, woodcutting, or using power tools. This approach allows you to gradually expand your DIY repertoire while minimizing the risk of project failure. 11. Neglecting Safety Precautions Photo Credit: Depositphotos Many DIYers, myself included, in their eagerness to complete a project, overlook essential safety measures. This oversight can lead to serious injuries or accidents. Always wear appropriate protective gear, such as safety glasses, gloves, and dust masks, especially when sanding, cutting, or painting.Ensure proper ventilation when using paints or adhesives with strong fumes. Be cautious with power tools, following manufacturer instructions meticulously. Never compromise on electrical safety when modifying items with lighting components. An often overlooked safety precaution is properly managing heavy items. When dealing with weighty furniture pieces or materials, always enlist the help of a friend or family member. This collaborative approach not only makes the task easier but also significantly reduces the risk of back strain or other lifting-related injuries. There’s nothing worse than achieving the perfect hack at the price of a busted back.It isn’t just about the end result—it’s also about maintaining your well-being throughout the process. Taking shortcuts on safety can turn an exciting DIY project into a hazardous endeavor, potentially causing long-lasting harm. 12. Not Calculating Hidden Costs Photo Credit: Depositphotos While IKEA hacks are often pursued for their cost-effectiveness, the expenses associated with materials and tools can quickly accumulate. Moreover, if mistakes occur and remedial steps become necessary, costs can skyrocket—potentially exceeding the price of purchasing the dream designer sideboard you’re trying to replicate. Also consider the hidden cost of time invested in these projects, which often means time away from family or other interests. Before embarking on a hack, carefully weigh the perceived benefits against these potential expenses, both financial and personal. 13. Always Buying New Photo Credit: Depositphotos Before you hack, shop your home for furniture pieces you can repurpose or upcycle. Repurposing old pieces can breathe new life into forgotten furniture, adding character and history to your hack. Don’t rush to purchase new items, rather, search preloved markets like Facebook marketplace or the IKEA As-Is service for a more cost-effective starting point. These older pieces frequently boast superior build quality compared to newer alternatives. (We’re talking about you, EXPEDIT!)By reimagining existing items or sourcing preloved pieces, you not only save money but also reduce waste, making your IKEA hack more sustainable and potentially more rewarding. Over the years I’ve seen the most innovative hacks often stemming from seeing new potential in old or discarded items. That’s often IKEA hacking at its finest. Hacking IKEA? While IKEA hacks can be a fun and affordable way to personalize your home, it’s important to choose projects that are safe, practical, and suited to your living space. By keeping these 13 common IKEA hacking mistakes in mind as you plan your next project, you can significantly improve your chances of a smoother DIY process. Of course, we all know that even the best-laid plans can encounter unexpected challenges. Nevertheless, armed with this knowledge, you’re better equipped to navigate potential pitfalls and bring your unique vision to life. The journey of DIY is as much about learning and growth as it is about the final product. So, embrace the process, stay mindful of these tips, and as always, happy hacking!Have you tried any IKEA hacks that didn’t work out? Share your experiences in the comments below.
