All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterYou could give your kitchen island an upgrade by replacing the barstools, add a vinyl countertop that looks like butcher block and elevates the space, or, like Jamie Meier (@jamiehickshome) did, paint the base of the island for a pop of color. “I love that we have an island that gives us extra counter space and is fabulous for hosting guests, but the color was really bothering me and not blending well into my style,” Jamie says. She describes her style as “colorful, pink, eclectic, [and] cottage-style,” and the new island fits exactly that. Prepping the island was key.    One of the most important steps of the project, Jamie says, was taping off the baseboards for a clean finish, and then waiting for the paint to fully dry in between coats. “I have painted many walls and accent walls, so I knew what to do,” she says. “The process was much easier and faster than expected.”Leftover paint made the project cost $0.And not only was the DIY project fairly easy, but it was also totally free. Jamie used a leftover coral-meets-rose paint (Backdrop’s 36 Hours in Marrakesh) to transform the island, and the shade looks especially nice with the hardware on the cabinets and the barstools. “I had previously painted our bedroom wall this color and loved its warmth and versatility,” she says. And she says the most surprising part of the project was “how much of an impact this paint would have in the room; it makes it feel so much more like me and cozy and warm.”Her DIY advice? “Just go for it!” she says. “If you feel like a color change needs to be done, don’t be afraid! It’s just paint and can easily be painted back. That’s what I always tell someone if they’re renting! It makes such a big difference!”",
