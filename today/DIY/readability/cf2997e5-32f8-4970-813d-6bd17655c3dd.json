  "text": "iPhone Tips Sign in to your MUO account Quick Links Apple’s Visual Intelligence in iOS 18.2 is impressive, but it’s only available on iPhone 16 models (and above). If you have an older iPhone, don’t worry—there are great alternatives that offer similar features without requiring the latest hardware. 1 Google Lens For those familiar with Google Lens, it’s no surprise that it tops this list of best alternatives to Apple’s Visual Intelligence. Google Lens helps you to identify objects using your camera. Whether you’re curious about the name of a gorgeous flower you spotted or need to translate a menu while traveling, Google Lens makes it super easy. Its shopping assistant features have also gotten better. Google added new AI-powered capabilities to Lens in November 2024, making it the perfect shopping companion. You can use Lens to find deals online by searching for similar items with just a photo. If you already have Google Photos on your iPhone, you’re halfway there. We previously covered how to use Google Lens features in Google Photos for tasks like visual identification and translation. For real-time searches, download the Google app and tap on the Lens icon to analyze what’s in front of you instantly. 2 ChatGPT For those who love diving deeper into information and getting detailed responses, ChatGPT is an excellent companion for visual search tasks. While it doesn’t have the same real-time image recognition features as Google Lens or Apple’s Visual Intelligence, it shines when it comes to providing contextual understanding and follow-up information. You can take a photo of a product and ask ChatGPT for a deeper explanation about its features, benefits, or alternatives. Unlike standard visual search tools, ChatGPT lets you interact with the content you capture. Once it gives you an answer, you can ask follow-up questions to get even more detail or context. Plus, it works on many iPhones, so you don’t need the latest model to enjoy its features. 3 Claude Claude, developed by Anthropic, is another powerful AI tool that can act as an alternative to Apple’s Visual Intelligence, especially when it comes to understanding and interpreting images. While Claude isn't specifically designed for visual search, its ability to process text and provide in-depth answers can still add value to the images you capture with your iPhone. With Claude, you can upload a photo or describe what you’ve captured, and the AI will give you a thoughtful, context-driven response. It's particularly helpful when you need a deeper understanding of the things you encounter in everyday life, like a piece of art, a complex product, or even a piece of text. Rather than just giving you a one-time response, Claude can engage in a back-and-forth dialogue to clarify questions, offer additional information, or explore related topics. This makes it a great option if you're after a more thorough, interactive experience. While Apple’s Visual Intelligence is a powerful feature for the latest iPhone models, there are plenty of fantastic alternatives available for those using older devices. From the tried-and-true Google Lens, which offers a comprehensive visual search experience, to interactive options like ChatGPT and Claude, you can still make the most of your iPhone’s camera capabilities even without the latest hardware.",
