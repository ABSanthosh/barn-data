  "text": "Microsoft 365 Sign in to your MUO account Over the course of 2024, Microsoft has been rolling out ads for all kinds of products, including Windows 11. However, the company isn't done yet. Some people are reporting that the PDF reader that comes with Microsoft 365 for Android is now showing ads across the top, despite them paying monthly for the service. Microsoft 365's PDF Reader for Android Is Showing Ads to Subscribers As spotted by our sister site How-To Geek, users are reporting advertisements at the top of the Microsoft 365 PDF Reader for Android. They seem to only appear along the top as a banner ad, but they're still drawing the ire of users who pay extra to use Microsoft 365's features. How-To Geek tried the app for itself, and it, too, found ads along the top of the viewer. However, when it tried the same using the iOS version of Microsoft 365, it didn't see any ads. We're not sure if that means that iOS users aren't getting the ads or if Microsoft simply hasn't gotten around to updating the Apple App Store version of Microsoft 365, but only time will tell. This isn't the first time that people have caught Microsoft sliding advertisements into its services. For example, Windows 11 is getting ads in the Start menu, and while you can turn off these \"recommendations\" via the Settings panel, it's unknown how long Microsoft will allow you to do that.",
