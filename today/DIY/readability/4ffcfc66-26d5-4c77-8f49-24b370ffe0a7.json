  "text": "Apple Music Sign in to your MUO account Yash Wate/MakeUseOf If you have ever been tempted to try Apple Music but have been put off by the price, today may be your lucky day. Because Apple Music is available for six months for less money than it costs to buy a cup of coffee. Apple Is Almost Giving Apple Music Away for Free Apple has announced a new promotion designed to get more people to try Apple Music for the first time. And as the promo lets new users pay just $3 for six months of Apple Music, I can see a lot of people taking the company up on the offer. The promotional offer for users in the US was announced in a post on the Apple Newsroom mostly dedicated to the Halftime Show at Super Bowl LIX. The Super Bowl is taking place this Sunday (February 9), and Apple Music is the official sponsor of the musical spectacular that splits the game in two. In the post all about Kendrick Lamar (who is headlining the Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show), Apple states, \"Those who are not yet subscribed can check out Apple Musicâ€™s biggest offer ever. For a limited time, new and eligible subscribers can get six months of Apple Music for $2.99.\" There are more details available, as well as the option to redeem the offer, on Apple Music's Offers page. The offer is available from now until February 27, 2025, and only to new subscribers who aren't also eligible for the three-months-free offer. The plan will also auto-renew at $10.99/month after six months unless and until canceled. This Could Steal Some Users Away From Spotify The fact is, there are a handful of great music streaming services available, all offering pretty much the same service with the same songs and the same features for the same (basic) price. So, choosing one comes down mainly to personal preference. Therefore, offers such as this one, which is ridiculously good value, could tempt users of one service to switch to another. I myself have subscribed to Spotify for well over a decade, and yet I'm very tempted to try Apple Music at this price. It doesn't help that Spotify's push into other forms of audio entertainment beyond music has upset some users. And then there's the allegation that Spotify pays artists less (per stream) than the other big music streaming services. Which prompted Spotify to defend itself by reminding everyone that it \"got the world to value music.\"",
