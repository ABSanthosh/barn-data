All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.For many, the kitchen is the heart of the home — a place where meals are made and memories are created — and for some, it even serves as an entryway to the rest of the space. Decorating each room in your home is a fun and rewarding experience, as it allows you to get creative and make every room feel like a reflection of yourself. When I first saw Mary Darling’s mid-century modern house in Indianapolis, I was immediately struck by her home’s vibrant energy — bright, fun, playful, and colorful. The standout room is the kitchen, because I have never seen a kitchen so full of color before — even though the cabinets are white.The kitchen is an ideal space to decorate because it’s a room that many people will often see when visiting. Too often, kitchens are thought of as dull or basic, but I can’t help but ask — who made that rule? Why can’t kitchens be colorful? After seeing Mary’s kitchen, the bright colors and textures drew me in. While the cabinets remained white, they didn’t take away from the vibrant feel of the room. In fact, the white cabinets helped enhance the other colors. “Home flippers bought it and made literally everything gray,” Mary shared at the time of the tour. “Gray walls, gray carpet, gray fake wood floors. And that’s how it was when we bought the house.” So when I saw the final makeover, I was stunned! What I loved the most about the kitchen was the combination of bright colors, plants, and the way natural light poured in. I imagine she enjoys her kitchen’s energetic atmosphere while sipping her morning coffee. In addition to the purple walls, I love how the green plants and orange flowers complement each other perfectly and add a playful, retro vibe to the space. Although my home style leans more modern chic, I love incorporating pops of color into my home. I believe that at least one room in your home should have plants and at least a little color to reflect your personality. After seeing Mary’s kitchen, I’m excited to bring more color into my home — whether through a colorful kitchen appliance, like a blue tea kettle, or red hand towels. I realize I don’t have to play it safe and can have fun even with the smallest details. Mary’s kitchen reminded me that our homes are reflections of who we are — our stories and personalities, which can be reflected through vibrant color (even if some of the room remains white). It’s an honor to be able to write a love letter to this kitchen, and I can honestly say her home has inspired me to add more color to my kitchen this spring.
