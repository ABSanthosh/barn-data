  "text": "Top-of-the-line keyboards are often expensive, but does that mean the cheaper ones are no good? I massively overspent on my current mechanical keyboard, only to find out I didn't really have to. Are Cheaper Keyboards Inherently Worse? I used a Redgear MK881 mechanical keyboard pretty much every day between 2018 and 2023. During this time period, the keyboard went through a pretty hard bashing. By the time I replaced it with a Keychron K2 V2, it was still going strong. This was a roughly $34 keyboard, so if you ask me, the answer to the heading question is no. Cheaper mechanical keyboards are not bad at all. You can find hot-swappable options with customizable RGB and sometimes even software support for under $50 on Amazon rather easily. Unless you're nit-picking, these are perfectly serviceable keyboards. Yadullah Abidi\\MakeUseOf From what I've experienced jumping across keyboards, the primary difference comes down to the switches. Cheaper keyboards use cheap switches from Kailh, Gateron, and sometimes even Cherry MX. I've previously compared the three switch types to help you pick the best, but they're more or less going to feel the same regardless of whether you get a blue, red, or brown switch keyboard. If your board is hot-swappable, you can get a pack of switches, swap everything out, maybe add a layer of foam underneath the PCB, and you'll be good to go. You could also lube your switches for a smoother typing experience. Do They Miss Out on Features? Software features are one aspect where cheaper keyboards lose out to more expensive options. Most cheaper mechanical keyboards don't have accompanying software, meaning you won't be able to set up macros and program-specific profiles. Yadullah Abidi\\MakeUseOf This is true for backlighting as well. While a more expensive keyboard might give you per key RGB control and dozens of different presets, cheaper keyboards might only have a few preset options for you to cycle through. But that's all there is to it. Budget options have caught up a lot in recent years and you can get keyboards for as little as $80 that offer hot-swappable switches, volume control knobs, 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, and more. The Royal Kludge S98 even offers a smart screen with everything else mentioned above for less than $100 on Amazon at the time of writing. What Spending More on a Keyboard Gets You If you're spending more money on a keyboard, somewhere in the $150-200 range, the first thing you'll notice is significantly better build quality. These keyboards are significantly heavier and built with premium materials like aluminum frames. You get better quality keycaps, better RGB, and, of course, better switches. Yadullah Abidi\\MakeUseOf How much that affects your typing and user experience compared to a sub-$50 keyboard depends on your personal preference. That said, you can't go wrong with these keyboards, as the typing experience will almost certainly be better. The switches will be a lot smoother, the keys will be better stabilized, better materials will be used across the board, more software features will be available, and if you pick one up with magnetic switches, even more customization. Other small knacks like screens, dedicated macro buttons, and control knobs are also commonly found on more expensive keyboards. While some budget options also offer these features, keyboards on the higher end of the price spectrum do a much better job of the actual implementation. What About Design and Build Quality? This is another aspect that more expensive keyboards do a lot better. That's not to say that cheaper keyboards are worse-made or won't last you a long time. As long as you're properly cleaning your keyboard occasionally, it'll last you as long as you're willing to use it. The major difference comes in the stock experience. While you can spend money to buy better switches and keycaps for just about any mechanical keyboard, the more expensive ones come with nicer keycaps and switches out of the box. I use both my Keychron K2 V2 and Arion Frost K8 Pro in their stock forms, and the latter provides a much smoother typing and user experience courtesy of better materials used across the keyboard. How Much Should You Spend on Your Next Keyboard? I don't see the point of spending more than $100-$150 on a mechanical keyboard, given the insane number of options available. Options in this price range cover almost everything you need, including software support for customization and plenty of switch options. If you're on a budget, you can also pick up most budget keyboards in the $50 to $80 range. You might miss out on software support and extra controls, but the board itself won't disappoint. Besides, you'll likely get options that support hot-swapping, so you're free to experiment with different switches. We've got you covered if you need help choosing the perfect keyboard for your typing needs. So don't fall for the marketing hype or limited edition drops. Unless you have a specific or niche requirement, such as those provided by Alice keyboards, you don't have to spend much money on your new purchase.",

That said, you can\u0026#39;t go wrong with these keyboards, as the typing experience will almost certainly be better. The switches will be a lot smoother, the keys will be better stabilized, better materials will be used across the board, more software features will be available, and if you pick one up with magnetic switches, even more customization.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOther small knacks like screens, dedicated macro buttons, and control knobs are also commonly found on more expensive keyboards. While some budget options also offer these features, keyboards on the higher end of the price spectrum do a much better job of the actual implementation.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"what-about-design-and-build-quality\"\u003e\n                        What About Design and Build Quality?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is another aspect that more expensive keyboards do a lot better. That\u0026#39;s not to say that cheaper keyboards are worse-made or won\u0026#39;t last you a long time.

While you can spend money to buy better switches and keycaps for just about any mechanical keyboard, the more expensive ones come with nicer keycaps and switches out of the box. I use both my Keychron K2 V2 and Arion Frost K8 Pro in their stock forms, and the latter provides a much smoother typing and user experience courtesy of better materials used across the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"how-much-should-you-spend-on-your-next-keyboard\"\u003e\n                        How Much Should You Spend on Your Next Keyboard?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026#39;t see the point of spending more than $100-$150 on a mechanical keyboard, given the insane number of options available. Options in this price range cover almost everything you need, including software support for customization and plenty of switch options.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re on a budget, you can also pick up most budget keyboards in the $50 to $80 range. You might miss out on software support and extra controls, but the board itself won\u0026#39;t disappoint. Besides, you\u0026#39;ll likely get options that support hot-swapping, so you\u0026#39;re free to experiment with different switches.
