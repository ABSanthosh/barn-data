  "text": "With the Powerbeats Pro 2, I was excited to switch to Beats headphones instead of my usual AirPods Pro 2. But after a few weeks of using the Powerbeats Pro 2, I’m returning them and sticking with my AirPods. Heart Rate Detection on the Powerbeats Pro 2 Has Some Huge Limitations The headlining addition to the Powerbeats Pro 2 is built-in heart rate tracking. However, there are some serious drawbacks, especially when compared to an Apple Watch. Coming from an Apple Watch, the entire process was a huge step down. When I’m ready for a workout using the watch, I head to Apple Watch’s Workout app, and in a few seconds, I'm ready to go. However, the heart rate tracking on the Powerbeats Pro 2 is only accessible on a few apps—Nike Run Club, Peloton, Runna, Slopes, Ladder, Open, and Yao Yao. Not only is that a limited number of apps, but it's also missing some big and popular names like Strava. I run the same route daily, and my heart rate readings are usually predictable. However, after a few runs using the Powerbeats Pro 2, I noticed the data was significantly off in some sections compared to the data captured on my Apple Watch. Many others online have also noticed significant issues with heart rate readings, especially if the Beats aren’t in the perfect position in your ear. I also missed other significant features of the Apple Watch, like calorie tracking and activity information that uses heart rate data. I also heavily use Heart Rate Zones on my Apple Watch during a workout to help challenge myself. Sure, some people might not want to buy an Apple Watch, or you might use an Android phone and thus can’t use Apple's wearable device. No matter how you break it down, though, the heart-rate monitoring feature on the Powerbeats Pro 2 left me unimpressed. AirPods Pro 2 Are Substantially Lighter Brent Dirks / MakeUseOf On paper, the weight difference between the AirPods Pro 2 and the Powerbeats Pro 2 seems nominal. Each AirPods Pro 2 bud weighs 0.19 ounces compared to 0.30 ounces for the Beats option. But in practice, the weight difference is truly noticeable. One of the reasons I was interested in the Powerbeats Pro 2 was to use them while running or working out. Unlike some, I didn’t have any huge problems with my AirPods Pro 2 slipping out of my ear. But, I wanted that extra-secure fit around the ear the Powerbeats offer. The Powerbeats will always stay attached to your ear thanks to their design. However, that extra weight and design comes at the cost of comfort. The actual earbuds were somewhat comfortable, as they use the same type of silicone eartips as the AirPods Pro 2, but they really failed on the earhook. The plastic is hard without much give. Even after wearing the Powerbeats Pro 2 for just a short session, the back of my ears would hurt from where the hook pressed against them. And yes, it is possible to make a comfortable pair of workout-focused earbuds with an ear hook. I recently used the Shokz OpenFit 2, and the ear hook was barely noticeable, even during a long workout. Powerbeats Pro 2 Sound Worse Brent Dirks/MakeUseOf Another important part of any headphones is the sound quality. After purchasing the Powerbeats 2, I didn’t expect the sound to be as good as the AirPods Pro 2, but I thought it would be in the same ballpark, especially since both options sport the Apple H2 chip. The AirPods 2 have always been known for a realistic and natural sound. I’ve tried a number of earbuds, but nothing has come close, including the Powerbeats Pro 2. Yes, the Powerbeats Pro 2 features the same bass-heavy title as any Beats product. But everything else sounded somewhat distorted and hard to hear. Just like the AirPods Pro 2, you can run a fit test with your selected Powerbeats Pro 2 tip size to make sure you’re ready for the best sound. I made sure to do that before trying out the Beats but I still had difficulty understanding some lyrics over the thump of the bass. Turning up the volume only exacerbated the problem. Active noise cancelation on the Beats was acceptable but doesn’t come close to the AirPods Pro 2. Powerbeats Pro 2 Are Missing Additional Audio Features Two of my favorite features of the AirPods Pro 2 are Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness. Adaptive Audio adjusts the volume of the music depending on the surrounding environment. With Conversation Awareness, if you start talking to someone, the media volume will automatically be lowered, and the background noise will be reduced. It’s perfect for when you’re jamming out and going up to place an order at a quick-serve restaurant or when you’re trying to focus on music and someone asks you a question. That’s not even to mention how the AirPods Pro 2 can protect your hearing and act as an over-the-counter hearing aid thanks to new features Apple has introduced. Unfortunately, the Powerbeats Pro 2 is missing all of these features, which makes it hard to ditch the AirPods Pro 2. The Powerbeats Pro 2 Case is Huge and Doesn’t Offer Find My Brent Dirks / MakeUseOf Just like most wireless earbuds on the market, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are stored in a charging case when not in use. To describe the case of the Beats as bulky would be a bit of an understatement. It’s at least twice as large as the AirPods Pro 2 case, so don’t expect to easily slip it into your pocket with other items. Thankfully, you can use the Find My network to track down your lost Powerbeats Pro 2. But unlike the AirPods Pro 2, there is no way to track the charging case itself, like you can the AirPods Pro 2 case. Powerbeats Pro 2 Can’t Use MagSafe or Apple Watch Charging Brent Dirks / MakeUseOf The Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case can only be charged with a Qi charger or a USB-C cable. That provides much less flexibility than the AirPods Pro 2, which you can top up with a USB-C cable, Qi charger, MagSafe charger, or even an Apple Watch charging puck. While it’s not a huge problem, I’ve enjoyed cutting down on my cord mess while on the go, and charging my AirPods Pro 2 with an Apple Watch charger was always a nice touch. AirPods Pro 2 Can be Purchased For Substantially Less Brent Dirks / MakeUseOf The AirPods Pro 2 and PowerBeats Pro 2 both retail for $249. But you can often find the AirPods Pro 2 for a substantial discount. With a little searching, you can likely find the AirPods Pro 2 for $70-80 less. While I was excited to switch over to the Powerbeats Pro 2, my real-world experience was less than impressive. I’m sticking to my AirPods Pro 2 for the time being while I continue to look for the best set of earbuds.",

headphones is the sound quality. After purchasing the Powerbeats 2, I didn’t expect the sound to be as good as the AirPods Pro 2, but I thought it would be in the same ballpark, especially since both options sport the Apple H2 chip. The AirPods 2 have always been known for a realistic and natural sound. I’ve tried a number of earbuds, but nothing has come close, including the Powerbeats Pro 2.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYes, the Powerbeats Pro 2 features the same bass-heavy title as any Beats product. But everything else sounded somewhat distorted and hard to hear. Just like the AirPods Pro 2, you can run a fit test with your selected Powerbeats Pro 2 tip size to make sure you’re ready for the best sound.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI made sure to do that before trying out the Beats but I still had difficulty understanding some lyrics over the thump of the bass. Turning up the volume only exacerbated the problem.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eActive noise cancelation on the Beats was acceptable but doesn’t come close to the AirPods Pro 2.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"powerbeats-pro-2-are-missing-additional-audio-features\"\u003e\n                        Powerbeats Pro 2 Are Missing Additional Audio Features\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003e Two of my favorite features of the AirPods Pro 2 are Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness. Adaptive Audio adjusts the volume of the music depending on the surrounding environment. With Conversation Awareness, if you start talking to someone, the media volume will automatically be lowered, and the background noise will be reduced. It’s perfect for when you’re jamming out and going up to place an order at a quick-serve restaurant or when you’re trying to focus on music and someone asks you a question.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not even to mention how the \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/features-airpods-pro-can-replace-your-hearing-aids/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAirPods Pro 2 can protect your hearing and act as an over-the-counter hearing aid\u003c/a\u003e thanks to new features Apple has introduced.
