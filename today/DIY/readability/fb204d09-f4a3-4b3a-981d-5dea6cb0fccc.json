This innovation tackles head-on the long-standing challenges PAX customers have grappled with for years. IKEA makes two bold claims that have caught our attention: first, they promise to slash assembly time by half, and second—brace yourselves—they suggest you can now “fold-up the PAX and go” when it’s time to move. These upgrades could be a game-changer for both assembly and relocation. The PAX We Know and Love (and Sometimes Struggle With) The PAX wardrobe has long been praised for its versatility and affordability. At IKEAhackers, we love it. It’s been a fan favorite for decades, sparking thousands of PAX hacks from built-in closets to home offices and laundry rooms. While assembling the PAX wardrobe isn’t the most challenging task, it does require ample floor space to fit the pieces together and sufficient ceiling clearance to hoist it into position. Although there has always been the option to assemble it standing up, this method often felt like a game of Twister, as you had to grapple with multiple pieces in odd positions. Moreover, some issues have persisted over time. Our readers have reported the thin fiberboard backing occasionally bulging out, compromising stability. Longer shelves have been known to sag under heavy loads (though that’s more a cautionary tale about overloading than a design flaw). We’re hopeful this new design will address the dreaded “hunchback PAX” problem. The New PAX: Now Literally Foldable Photo Credit: IKEA.com At the heart of this redesign is the new foldable frame, featuring a pre-glued, one-piece back and side panel. This ingenious structure folds like a book, allowing for vertical assembly directly against the wall where the wardrobe will be placed. This breakthrough eliminates the need for extensive floor space during setup, making the PAX accessible to those with smaller living areas or lower ceilings.Mathias Persson, Engineering Manager at IKEA of Sweden AB, explains, “We always strive to do better, and one of our biggest motivators is our customers’ feedback. We wanted to bring our customers an innovative solution while maintaining the quality that PAX has been known and loved for.” Efficiency in Assembly (And Disassembly) The redesign goes beyond just the foldable frame. IKEA has also streamlined the assembly process, reducing the number of steps and incorporating fewer fittings. The new design utilizes IKEA’s proprietary wedge dowel system, which allows pieces to snap together easily. As a result, IKEA reports that assembly time has been cut in half, based on their in-house testing.As someone who recently relocated two PAX wardrobes, I know firsthand the pain of disassembling and reassembling these behemoths. While our backing boards survived the move, they didn’t escape unscathed, sporting some damage in (thankfully) inconspicuous places. If IKEA’s new design can alleviate these moving woes, it’ll be a welcome relief for PAX owners everywhere. A Solution for Better Sleep Photo Credit: IKEA.com IKEA’s focus on the new PAX 2.0 system goes beyond mere storage. The company’s research has shown a correlation between clutter and poor sleep quality. By providing a versatile and customizable storage solution, IKEA aims to help customers create more organized sleeping spaces, potentially contributing to better sleep hygiene. Looking to the Future The redesign of the PAX wardrobe is part of IKEA’s broader initiative to improve the assembly experience across all its storage systems. “Easy assembly is a part of IKEA’s ongoing innovation work for our storage systems. Our ambition is to make all our storage systems easy to assemble. The new PAX frame is just the beginning,” Persson states.The new PAX wardrobe with its innovative foldable frame is currently rolling out in several markets and is expected to be available worldwide in the coming months. As always, IKEA recommends checking with local stores for specific availability.Watch the video to see how the new foldable PAX 2024 is assembled. If you’ve had the chance to assemble the new PAX wardrobe, we’d love to hear your thoughts. How was your experience with the standing assembly option, and did you notice a reduction in assembly time?
