  "text": "ChatGPT Sign in to your MUO account The long-awaited moment is here: ChatGPT is receiving an enormous upgrade to GPT-4.5. However, despite OpenAI calling GPT-4.5 its \"largest and most knowledgeable model,\" it comes with a few caveats that might see you continuing to use its older models for a while longer. OpenAI Launches GPT-4.5 With a More \"Natural\" Feel Let's start with the positives of this GPT update. OpenAI claims GPT-4.5 has a \"broader knowledge base\" with stronger alignment with \"user intent.\" It also features boosts to emotional intelligence that OpenAI claims make GPT-4.5 \"well-suited for tasks like writing, programming, and solving practical problems.\" The GPT-4.5 research preview also hallucinates less than its predecessors—37 percent compared to GPT-4o's 60 percent. Interestingly, OpenAI's internal testing team found GPT-4.5 \" warm, intuitive, and natural.\" This suggests an AI model that emphasizes personality, empathy, and creativity more. GPT-4.5 Isn't All Sunshine and Roses OpenAI also acknowledges that despite the clear improvements to GPT-4.5, it isn't quite ready to replace its earlier models. GPT-4.5 is a much larger and more compute-heavy AI model, which makes it (currently) more expensive to run. Its responses may also feel slower than ChatGPT regulars are now accustomed to with models such as GPT-4o. GPT-4.5's API pricing reflects the intesive compute costs. But it's not only speed. An OpenAI document detailing GPT-4.5's capabilities explains that it \"is not a frontier model . . . its performance is below that of o1, o3-mini, and deep research on most preparedness evaluations.\" At the time of writing, GPT-4.5 doesn't support the multimodal features that make ChatGPT so useful. That means no Voice Mode, video tools, or screen sharing, at least for now. OpenAI has not provided a specific timeline for when this might change. When Can You Use ChatGPT GPT-4.5? Starting from 27 February 2025, GPT-4.5 is rolling out to ChatGPT's $200 Professional subscription tier. Those Professional subscribers will be able to pick up GPT-4.5 immediately from the model picker. From early March, ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers can choose GPT-4.5, followed by Enterprise and Edu subscribers. To me, this all points in one direction: GPT-4.5 is a stepping stone to GPT-5, expected to launch in 2025. The combination of GPT-4.5, GPT o3, o3-mini, and other models are the building blocks for GPT-5, which many suggest will be the first AI system we can truly deem artificial general intelligence.",

its earlier models.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eGPT-4.5 is a much larger and more compute-heavy AI model, which makes it (currently) more expensive to run. Its responses may also feel slower than ChatGPT regulars are now accustomed to with models such as GPT-4o.

OpenAI has not provided a specific timeline for when this might change.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"when-can-you-use-chatgpt-gpt-4-5\"\u003e\n                        When Can You Use ChatGPT GPT-4.5?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting from 27 February 2025, GPT-4.5 is rolling out to ChatGPT\u0026#39;s $200 Professional subscription tier.

From early March, ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers can choose GPT-4.5, followed by Enterprise and Edu subscribers.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eTo me, this all points in one direction: GPT-4.5 is a stepping stone to GPT-5, expected to launch in 2025. The combination of GPT-4.5, GPT o3, o3-mini, and other models are the building blocks for GPT-5, which many suggest will be the first AI system we can truly deem artificial general intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
