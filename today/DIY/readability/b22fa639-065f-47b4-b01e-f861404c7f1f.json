All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Whenever I tell someone what I do for a living, they immediately tell me my house must look incredible. As flattered as I am by that, it’s simply not true! Like everyone, I have areas of my home that I adore and am so proud to show off — and then I have the less-pretty spaces that exist behind closed doors and definitely are not part of any tours happening in my home.One such space is my laundry room. I’ve done a few projects since moving into my home to make it more functional for me and my husband, like adding shelves, hooks, and cabinets, and we’ve also replaced the literally-older-than-me machines with new high-efficiency ones. But my laundry room is still the same boring white it was at move-in, and that’s worked just fine for us — we can always just shut the door on it!But sometimes I see transformations that make me think, Okay, my laundry room should totally be my next project. They’re the ones that seamlessly blend practicality and beauty (yes, beauty!) and make these workhorse spaces look downright luxurious. This laundry room redo, which I first wrote about in 2021, definitely qualifies.The before looked a lot like my laundry room: white walls, no decor, and limited storage space. A single wire shelf just doesn’t cut it! A smart redo not only cured the no-style look of the before, but also doubled the usable storage space here — the most important part of any laundry room, in my opinion.Many of the upgrades shown here are DIY, including the beadboard wainscoting (so charming!) and the plywood countertop over the washer and dryer, which serves as an easy clothes-folding surface (so practical!). The once freestanding sink is now a vanity with storage beneath, and the old wire shelf was swapped out for a row of cabinets that hide tons of usable storage.Notably, the after is, as you can see, simply stunning. The beadboard looks so luxe — especially in a creamy putty-like color — and the bold black cabinets seem much more expensive than they were, too. In fact, the whole project (aside from the appliances and flooring, which were part of a previous update) cost just $700.Want to read more about this serene laundry room?
