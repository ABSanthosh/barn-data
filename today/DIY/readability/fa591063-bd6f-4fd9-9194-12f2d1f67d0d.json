It’s the best thing to make after apple picking, for a Halloween party, or just when you feel nostalgic and want to be a kid again. Candy apples may look like an impressive dessert (and hard to make), but it’s actually pretty easy (just like our Easy Caramel Apples!)! We’ll show you how … And just as a side note, since the sugar is extremely hot and you can get burned if not careful, we don’t recommend doing this project with kids. Just let them eat the final result rather than help with this one. 🙂 Looking for more fall treats?

Candy apples are a whole apple on a stick dipped in hot melted sugars which hardens to form a thin candy shell. While usually red, they can also be dyed other colors and they first appeared in 1908 in New Jersey when candy maker William Kolb created them. Red Hots candies were a popular choice to use for the outer coating, so some prefer to make theirs a cinnamon flavor coating to mimic that nostalgic flavor. Ingredients for candy apples: Apples: Using smaller apples will get you more finished apples out of one batch of candy coating. Try and pick ones with a nice round shape for the best looking candy apples. White sugar: This candy apple recipe uses plain granulated white sugar to give the candy coating its sweetness. Light corn syrup: Corn syrup helps you get that smooth candy finish. Water: The water mostly boils off while the candy rises up to the proper hard crack stage temperature. Red food coloring: Gel food coloring is preferred if you have it since it’s more concentrated so the color is brighter for the best candy apples. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat types of apples are best to use for candy apples? While Granny Smith apples are probably one of the biggest favorites for candy apples due to their tart flavor, you can really use any variety that you like! Just be sure to pick a more firm variety like a Gala, Fuji, or Honeycrisp rather than a softer option like a Macintosh. Supplies for candy apples: Apple skewers: You can also use popsicle sticks or even sticks from branches for your skewers, but we like these bamboo ones since they already have a point for easy insertion. Candy thermometer: Having a candy thermometer with a pot clip is super helpful. You can also use a multi purpose digital thermometer but you’ll have to stand there and hold it if you don’t have a clip. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is hard crack stage? Hard crack stage is one of the highest temperatures used in candy making at 300°-310°. There is almost no water remaining in the mixture, so it hardens rather than staying softer like a taffy. How to prepare your apples: Wash and dry apples: You want to try and remove any wax coating that’s on the apples so your coating will stick and you can avoid getting annoying bubbles that pop out of the coating. You can scrub them really well with a clean textured scrubber after rinsing them in hot water and rub them dry with a textured towel to try and remove as much wax as you can, or some people like to boil water and dip the apples in the water for about 5 seconds before rubbing dry (longer than 8-10 seconds can start to cook the apples, so don’t leave them in too long!). Make sure the apples are fully dry before dipping as any amount of water will create bubbles in your coating. Add skewers: Push or tap your wooden skewers or lollipop sticks halfway into the top of your dried apples and set aside. How to make candy apples: Prepare your pan: Prepare a sheet pan or parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray or butter so you’ll be able to remove the apples easily once cooled. Cook your coating: Combine sugar, water, corn syrup, and food coloring in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir together with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and bring the sugar mixture to a boil with a candy thermometer clipped to your pot (make sure it’s not touching the bottom of the pot or it won’t be an accurate read). Bring coating up to 300°: Let the mixture boil for about 15-20 minutes on medium-high heat until it reaches between 300°-310°. Remove the coating from the heat and allow the bubbles to settle down for a minute until smooth. Dip your apples: Working quickly, tilt your pan to the side and dip an apple in the candy mixture, swirling the apple to get each side coated. Pull the apple out and let the excess drip off before placing on a prepared baking sheet, wax paper, silicone mat or parchment paper (just coat whichever one you use with cooking spray). If the candy coating starts to harden before you are done dipping all your apples, put it back on medium heat until it thins out again. NOTE: Remember, this sugar is very hot, so be sure to keep your skin away from the sugar to avoid burns. You can also have a bowl of ice water nearby just in case you make contact with the sugar so you can quickly dip your hand in that, or even use heatproof gloves made for cooking. Let cool: Once all your apples are dipped, let the coating harden (it just takes a few minutes) and your apples are ready to eat! Remember, candy apples have a hard sticky coating, so eat with caution! Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat’s the best way to eat a candy apple? Biting right into a candy apple is almost impossible and just asking for dental bills. Kids can lick the hard outside coating like a giant lollipop, but it’s most practical to cut the candy apple into slices before eating. Tips for Making Candy Apples Use organic apples if you can since some companies don’t use wax on their apples so you don’t have to try to remove it. Or use apples from a local orchard that doesn’t wax their apples. Make sure your sugar reaches the 300° mark or the coating won’t harden and it will be more of a taffy texture. Try and keep the candy shell thin when you dip; it doesn’t need to be super thick and will be harder to eat. If you want to add a topping to your apples, just roll them in chopped coconut, nuts or sprinkles before the candy coating sets. You can make your candy apples a color other than red if you want! Just remember the color of the apple comes through a bit and may muddle your final color depending on what shade you pick, but purple or black for Halloween is fun! Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do I make Cinnamon Candy Apples? You can easily add a teaspoon of cinnamon flavor to your candy mixture to create a fall flavor with a touch of cinnamon! What the best way to clean your pot after making candy apples? Now that your candy apples are made, you may be staring at your pot thinking “Now, how am I ever going to clean that?!” It’s actually pretty easy! Fill your pot with water. Boil the water on the stove, stirring every so often. Once the candy leftover is dissolved, pour the water out and the hardened sugar is gone! If you have some sugar up on the sides of your pot above the boiling water line, just use a spatula to keep pulling up some of the hot water over that spot until it starts to dissolve. You can also dip your thermometer into the water as it boils to remove any hardened candy for the tip of that as well. Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do you avoid bubbles in your candy apples? While sometimes bubbles are a bit of a mystery in candy apples, making sure you’ve removed as much wax as possible, checking that the apples are totally dry before dipping, and allowing the bubbles in the coating to settle before dipping will give you the best chance of a totally smooth mirror-like finish on your candy apples. How do you store candy apples? Candy apples can be stored in an airtight container for up to three days in the refrigerator, although they are usually best eaten in the first 24 hours. The outer hard shell will last longer than three days, but the hole that is poked into the apple is what starts to oxidize the apple after a few days and makes it mushy inside.
