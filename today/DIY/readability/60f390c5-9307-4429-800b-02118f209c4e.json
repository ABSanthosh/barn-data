A mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting throughout a room is one of the trinities of great design. I’m always looking for clever ways to light things up, especially when it comes to incorporating accent lighting. Plus, as much as I love to tackle DIY projects, I admittedly hesitate when it comes to anything electrical. That’s why this MOSSLANDA picture ledge hack from Elisa @drellsky.home is perfect. This project is a ridiculously simple and affordable way to add under-shelf lighting to your workspace, bedroom, or anywhere else you want an indirect glow. The best part is, you can do the whole thing without having to touch your electrical panel. Maybe that’s why it has over 147,580 likes (and it looks great, too.) What You’ll Need MOSSLANDA Picture Ledge (hack uses 45 ¼”) Self-adhesive LED Light strip Screwgun Suitable screws and hanging hardware Flip the Simple MOSSLANDA Picture Ledge Into a Wall Accent Light 1. Turn Things Upside Down Take the IKEA MOSSLANDA picture ledge, as-is, and simply turn it 180 degrees. Yep, that’s right. All you’re doing is installing it upside-down. Genius, and so easy. 2. Hang the MOSSLANDA Shelf Hang the shelf using a screw gun and suitable hardware for your wall. Some commenters mentioned having issues with the weight of the shelf being too much for the topsy-turvy install. However, the original poster replied that her shelves and several she has installed for clients all hold up well. She suggests using the appropriate anchors for your wall type and long enough screws. Also, keep display items lightweight. To hide the screw heads, try some white screw caps. 3. Add Self-Adhesive Strip Lights After installing the shelf, measure and cut the LED strip lights to the desired length and stick to the bottom of the ledge. The lip that would normally keep pictures in place hides the LEDs perfectly. How Much Is This Hack? The whole project costs about $35 to $40 for one 45 ¼” shelf. The MOSSLANDA is $17.99 and 20-feet of strip lights cost roughly $13. Then, you’d need to pick up some hardware and the screw caps. But keep in mind that you don’t need all 20 feet of lights for one shelf, and one pack of hardware and screw caps can work for multiple shelves. So for $55, you could have two stunning underlit shelves or three for $75, you get the idea. Hide Unsightly Cords A few folks were worried about seeing ugly cords hanging from the shelf. The hacker hung hers next to a corner, so the cord runs down the corner and is practically invisible. You could also use cord covers if you plan to hang the shelf in the middle of a wall, then paint the cover to match. There are battery-operated LED strip lights available. They come with a detachable, rechargeable battery pack. Just make sure the shelf rim hides the pack sufficiently. You could attach the pack to the bottom of the shelf using heavy-duty velcro. Have Fun With Color Combinations The MOSSLANDA comes in a few different finishes (make sure you get screw caps to match), or the OP mentions painting them. She recommends using a high-quality spray paint, so don’t cheap out unless you want to deal with a flaking, splotchy paint job. You can also have fun with your lighting choices. LED strips come in so many colors, and a lot of them have features like, fading, flashing, dimming, and color-changing capabilities. My son has one like this under his loft bed and it’s pretty cool. It’s a great reading light when he sets it to bright white, but it’s also a cozy accent light when it’s set to a dim yellow or warmer white.",
