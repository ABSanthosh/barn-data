Sleep Positions Speak Volumes IKEA Sleep Report 2025 | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Here’s another fascinating revelation from the IKEA study: your sleeping position as a couple might be more important than you think. Couples who sleep facing each other achieve an impressive Sleep Score of 70 – significantly higher than those who sleep back-to-back, who score just 61. Could it be the physical security and emotional assurance of facing each other that makes couples drift off to Lalaland quicker and easier? Sleep position aside, for couples to get the best sleep quality, consider these tips: Create a bedtime routine together Invest in a mattress that minimizes movement transfer Use separate blankets if needed Address snoring issues proactively Keep bedroom temperature optimal for both partners Design your bedroom to create a tranquil, cozy space Establish technology-free zones Single and Sleepy IKEA Sleep Report 2025 | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Think couples have all the good nights? Think again. While the study shows partners get solid shut-eye, single sleepers can absolutely nail their nightly rest. The secret lies in creating the perfect sleep environment, and IKEA’s global research has uncovered exactly what works. Here are the top 10 sleep aids used globally: 1. Air conditioning/fan (24%) Perfect for both temperature regulation and white noise, making it the most popular sleep aid. 2. Blackout curtains/blinds (21%) Creating a cave-like darkness helps regulate your circadian rhythm, regardless of external light pollution. 3. Medication (19%) While not a long-term solution, many rely on sleep medication for temporary relief. 4. Music, podcasts, or audiobooks (17%) These gentle audio distractions can help quiet a racing mind – particularly helpful for those sleeping alone. 5. Books (14%) Old-school but effective: reading before bed remains a powerful sleep inducer. 6. Specialty mattress/pillow (13%) Investing in quality sleep equipment like weighted blankets pays dividends in better rest. 7. Dietary supplements or soothing drinks (11%) From chamomile tea to melatonin gummies, these natural aids help many find their way to dreamland. 8. Aromatherapy and white noise (10%) Essential oils like lavender, chamomile and vanilla can improve sleep quality by reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation through their natural calming properties. If you live in a noisy neighborhood, consider getting a white noise machine to drown out descriptive sounds and foster a tranquil environment. 9. Sleep mask (7%) A simple solution for light sensitivity that’s gaining popularity. 10. Bedding with cooling or heating features (7%) Temperature-regulating bedding helps replicate the body-heat benefits of having a sleep partner.",
