It hides away the garden tools and creates a storage nook where there is none. Hidden Patio Storage Photo Credit: Alexander Johnson @easyalex | Instagram Alex began by removing the flimsy back panel of the BILLY bookcase which will not withstand the rigors of too much movement. He then reinforced the structure with 1×2 wood boards across the bookshelf. This step keeps the bookcase sturdy and square. Moving to the base of the bookshelf, Alex screwed in an extra BILLY shelf, providing additional stability and also more “meat” for the caster wheels to bite into. That effectively turns the bookcase into a mobile unit. The enclosure He then stained lengths of 1×3 wood boards and meticulously screwed them around the sides and back of the bookcase. On the back, the boards are fixed onto the 1×2 he added. Once in place, he trimmed these boards to match the height of the ceiling, which is key in creating a seamless wall panel. To make the bookcase work as a hidden storage unit, Alex installed T-hinges on one side of the bookcase and the other on the wall. This step allows the bookcase to swing open, revealing the storage space inside.

To enhance the rustic appeal and utility of the unit, he hung brackets on the front of the bookcase and placed potted plants on them, adding a touch of greenery to the patio. Patio Storage Hidden In Plain Sight The final product is an attractive garden storage unit that blends beautifully with his overall patio makeover. “Finally, the chaos on the patio has ended!” Alex exclaimed. almost relieved at the much-needed storage.While Alex uses it for garden tools, this patio storage hack can also be used for storing outdoor pool toys (make sure to waterproof the BILLY first), barware, extra outdoor pillows, and more. Applying the BILLY Hack Elsewhere This clever hack can be adapted for various uses throughout the house. For instance: Laundry Room Storage: Transform a BILLY bookcase into a hidden storage unit for cleaning supplies in the laundry room. By flipping the bookcase to face inwards, you can use the back (now front) to hang artwork, turning a dull nook into an attractive and functional space. Craft Room: Modify a BILLY bookcase to create a compact, craft station. Add castor wheels and attach the bookcase to another BILLY bookcase to make a versatile craft pod that can be easily opened/closed up and moved. You can also apply the same “two-bookcases-in-one” hack for a home bar. Kitchen Pantry: Use the same principles to convert a BILLY bookcase into a pantry with added shelves and storage bins for dry goods and kitchen essentials.
