  "text": "Artificial Intelligence Sign in to your MUO account Are you ready for yet another way to use AI technology? According to a new report, xAI’s chatbot Grok might soon be available in a standalone app. Another Way to Access Grok The Wall Street Journal says that Elon Musk’s venture is planning release its own app. Currently, the only way to access Grok is through the social media app X, formerly Twitter. Grok access is a perk for subscribers to the social network in both the Premium and Premium+ tier. Premium costs $7 per month and also includes other X features like a larger reply boost. A standalone Grok app could arrive for consumers as early as next month. Interestingly, the report also says that Grok is currently being used to support another Musk venture, SpaceX’s Starlink, for customer service. Grok in the future might also be used to power a search engine for X in the future. Grok has been behind the curve. xAI's chatbot was released a little more than a year ago. Unlike competitors, the chatbot is known for answering questions with wit and sarcasm, showing Musk’s influence. Do We Really Need Another AI App? You don’t need to look very far to find a standalone AI chat app for your smartphone, tablet, or computer. There is a host of great AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Meta AI, Microsoft Copilot, and many more that don’t even need a subscription. If you’re willing to pay, you can unlock a host of great additional features. For example, you can have a full-blown voice conversation with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, which continues to roll out for more users. And along with standalone AI app options, Apple, Microsoft, and Google are quickly adding native AI features to computer and smartphone operating systems. Apple Intelligence has just started its roll-out to Apple devices and is continuing to add new features well into 2025. For Grok to be worth using in a standalone app, it needs to provide something unique compared to all of those other options. So it will be interesting to see what Musk has up his sleeve. While being an AI-powered X search engine sounds nice, it needs to have much more.",

Grok access is a perk for subscribers to the social network in both the Premium and Premium+ tier. Premium costs $7 per month and also includes other X features like a larger reply boost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA standalone Grok app could arrive for consumers as early as next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, the report also says that Grok is currently being used to support another Musk venture, SpaceX’s Starlink, for customer service. Grok in the future might also be used to power a search engine for X in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrok has been behind the curve. xAI\u0026#39;s chatbot was \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/elon-musk-announces-grok-ai/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereleased a little more than a year ago\u003c/a\u003e.

There is a host of \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egreat AI chatbots\u003c/a\u003e like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Meta AI, Microsoft Copilot, and many more that don’t even need a subscription.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re willing to pay, you can unlock a host of great additional features. For example, you can have a full-blown \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-advanced-voice-feature-rolling-out-to-users/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evoice conversation with ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode\u003c/a\u003e, which continues to roll out for more users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd along with standalone AI app options, Apple, Microsoft, and Google are quickly adding native AI features to computer and smartphone operating systems. Apple Intelligence has just started its roll-out to Apple devices and is continuing to add new features well into 2025.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor Grok to be worth using in a standalone app, it needs to provide something unique compared to all of those other options. So it will be interesting to see what Musk has up his sleeve. While being an AI-powered X search engine sounds nice, it needs to have much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
