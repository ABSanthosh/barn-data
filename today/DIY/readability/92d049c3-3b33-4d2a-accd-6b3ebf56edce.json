You may also have to customize the widget's settings again if you want the new widget to show the same content. It's a frustrating, long process, especially if you're trying to adjust multiple widgets on your Home Screen. How to Resize Home Screen Widgets and App IconsThanks to iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, released on Sept. 16, you no longer have to mess with the widget gallery to adjust widget sizes.Don't Miss: 10 New Home Screen Features for Your iPhone with iOS 18 Option 1: Use Quick Actions to ResizeSimply touch and hold the current widget, and you'll see new resizing options in the quick actions menu. You can also touch and hold an app's icon on your Home Screen to turn it into a widget — if the app has widgets available.The quick actions give up to four resizing options:App icon: The grid button converts the widget into an app icon. This app icon will not replace any icons for the app already on your Home Screen. Small widget: The small-sized widget button converts the current app icon or widget into a small two-by-two widget. Medium widget: The medium-sized widget button converts the current app icon or widget into a medium two-by-four widget. Large widget: The large-sized widget button converts the current app icon or widget into a large four-by-four widget. Option 2: Drag to ResizeYou can also drag the corner of a widget to upscale or downscale the widget, but you can't turn a widget into an app icon in this way. Things to KnowIf you have spaces between app icons, folders, and widgets, they may disappear when pushed out by a larger widget size. If the icons after the space get pushed as well, reverting to a smaller widget or app icon may not bring back the empty space. While widget customizations are retained when switching between widget sizes, they may not be remembered when switching to app icons and then widgets again. If you convert a widget to an app icon and already have an icon for the app on your Home Screen, you'll have duplicates now. App icons will not open their own instances, so you can't use one to sign into an app with one account and another for a separate account. However, it's still helpful to create multiple icons for an app if you organize folders or Home Screen pages by topic since some apps fit into various categories. Just updated your iPhone? You'll find new features for TV, Messages, News, and Shortcuts, as well as important bug fixes and security patches. Find out what's new and changed on your iPhone with the iOS 17.6 update.
