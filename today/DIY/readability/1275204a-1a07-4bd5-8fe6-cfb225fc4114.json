  "text": "I love it when a plan comes together. I wanted to reinvent our courtyard into a dining space for the fall months, and searched high and low for a dining table in the perfect size, style, and price. I finally found the perfect piece, I link to it below. But first, take a look at the faux burl wood tray I created with two colors of acrylic paint and a spray painted gloss finish. Last week I wrote about burl wood trending again and attempted a similar look with paint on a smaller scale, creating this faux burl wood painted tray, I love it! To create it I used this $5 dollar 5”x18” wood plaque, dark brown and camel colored acrylic paint, a few small paintbrushes, a chip paintbrush, and gloss clear finish, all purchased at Michael’s. The steps take a few layers, I made a video/reel and posted on Instagram so you can see the process. First, coat the plaque/tray in the camel colored paint, water down the paint a bit to allow a little of the wood grain to show through. Paint the striped edges of the tray with the camel paint to make it one consistent color. Next make swirls on top of the paint with a watered down version of the dark brown paint. To crate the burl wood look, dip the dry chip brush in the dark wood paint, pat it on a separate surface so just the tips of the bristle have paint and dab the paint in a random pattern.  Use the paintbrushes to add a few dots in more intense color, again in a random pattern. Once you’re satisfied with your pattern, coat the tray with three to four coats of clear gloss spray paint. See this video on Instagram to view the faux paint process from start to finish! It’s a lovely catchall to create a casual centerpiece with seasonal flowers and candles. I searched high and low for a wood and white table that was the perfect size for four to six with my white benches, and could fit up to eight if I squeeze three people on the bench and two people at the ends. This 69 x 33” outdoor table had great reviews and was so affordable, it has a solid wood top which I can always refinish it in the future. I spray painted the legs white so they complement the existing white benches. I think the stain on top is a hint too pecan with its reddish and yellow undertones, so I’m going to let it sit out in the sun and hopefully it will lighten up and fade a bit. Then I’ll add a few coats of polycrylic so it’s protected for the winter months. It will be so nice to enjoy fall evenings at this table with friends and family!",
