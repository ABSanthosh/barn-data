Alongside a redesigned Camera app and a smarter version of Siri, we might also see further refinements to Apple Intelligence, which currently powers app interactions and personal assistant upgrades. Apple Intelligence first appeared on iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1.Here's everything we know about iOS 19 so far:Release datesApple's yearly software cycle revolves around its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where the latest software versions are announced. The first developer betas are typically released on day one of WWDC or shortly after. Based on previous trends, WWDC 2025 is expected to kick off on Monday, June 9, making this the likely date for the iOS 19 developer beta release.Historically, the public beta follows the developer beta by 4–6 weeks, coinciding with the second or third developer beta release. So, we can expect the iOS 19 public beta to debut in mid-July 2025, as seen with iOS 18 and iOS 17.Apple has maintained a consistent schedule for its iOS releases over the past few years:iOS 18: The developer beta was released on June 10, 2024, followed by the public beta on July 15. The official release arrived on September 16, 2024.iOS 17: The developer beta debuted on June 5, 2023, and the public beta became available on July 12. The final release was on September 18, 2023.iOS 16: The developer beta launched on June 6, 2022, with the public beta arriving on July 11. Apple officially released iOS 16 on September 12, 2022.iOS 15: The developer beta was introduced on June 7, 2021, with the public beta following earlier than usual on June 30. The full release occurred on September 20, 2021.Following this pattern, the stable version of iOS 19 is expected to launch alongside the iPhone 17 in September 2025.For those eager to try iOS 19 early, signing up for the iOS Beta Program now ensures you'll be among the first to explore the new features as they become available. CompatibilityGood news for iPhone users: iOS 19 is rumored to support all the same models currently capable of running iOS 18. This means even older models like the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR — initially released in 2018 — should be able to run the upcoming software.If accurate, this marks the second consecutive year Apple has retained full compatibility across its lineup. The full list of supported devices would include:iPhone 16 Pro Max (Apple A18 Pro) [2024]iPhone 16 Pro (Apple A18 Pro) [2024]iPhone 16 Plus (Apple A18) [2024]iPhone 16 (Apple A18) [2024]iPhone 15 Pro Max (Apple A17 Pro) [2023]iPhone 15 Pro (Apple A17 Pro) [2023]iPhone 15 Plus (Apple A16) [2023]iPhone 15 (Apple A16) [2023]iPhone 14 Pro Max (Apple A16) [2022]iPhone 14 Pro (Apple A16) [2022]iPhone 14 Plus (Apple A15) [2022]iPhone 14 (Apple A15) [2022]iPhone SE (3rd generation, Apple A15) [2022]iPhone 13 Pro Max (Apple A15) [2021]iPhone 13 Pro (Apple A15) [2021]iPhone 13 mini (Apple A15) [2021]iPhone 13 (Apple A15) [2021]iPhone 12 Pro Max (Apple A14) [2020]iPhone 12 Pro (Apple A14) [2020]iPhone 12 mini (Apple A14) [2020]iPhone 12 (Apple A14) [2020]iPhone SE (2nd generation, Apple A13) [2020]iPhone 11 Pro Max (Apple A13) [2019]iPhone 11 Pro (Apple A13) [2019]iPhone 11 (Apple A13) [2019]iPhone XR (Apple A12) [2018]iPhone XS Max (Apple A12) [2018]iPhone XS (Apple A12) [2018] New and improved SiriAccording to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, Apple is developing a smarter version of Siri known as \"LLM Siri,\" designed to use advanced large language models (LLMs) for improved performance. This upgrade aims to make Siri more conversational and capable of handling complex tasks. The goal is to compete with AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini by enabling Siri to respond more naturally and continue ongoing conversations. ChatGPT is currently integrated with Apple Intelligence, which is helpful for more advanced queries Siri can't handle.The groundwork for LLM Siri has already been laid with Apple Intelligence. This feature uses an initial Apple LLM to decide whether Siri's current setup can handle a request or if a more advanced model is needed. With this technology, Apple hopes to transform Siri from a basic assistant into a versatile, AI-powered tool.The new Siri version is being tested in a separate app on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Eventually, it will replace the existing Siri entirely. Apple plans to preview LLM Siri as early as June 2025 during its Worldwide Developers Conference, alongside the announcement of iOS 19. Still, it won't be available for testing until 2026 in a later iOS version, such as iOS 19.3 or iOS 19.4. Big redesign for the Camera appOne of the biggest expected changes in iOS 19 is a redesigned Camera app, rumored to draw inspiration from visionOS, the interface for Apple's Vision Pro headset. According to Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, the new Camera app will feature translucent menus for controls, similar to the clean and futuristic design seen in visionOS. You can see it in action below in renders that mimic the actual design Prosser got a peek at.The shooting modes and adjustments menu will now be in one Photo/Video button. Tap Photo to access Portrait, Spatial, and Pano modes, as well as Style, Aspect, Exposure, and Timer adjustments.Tap Video to access Depth, Spatial, Slo-Mo, and Time-Lapse modes, as well as Action and Exposure adjustments. A new translucent panel will appear at the top, where you can set resolution and frame rate.The redesign will also make better use of the screen, offering a cleaner aesthetic and a larger, more visible viewfinder compared to the current iOS 18 version. A possibly improved Home ScreenAside from the new Camera app look, Prosser speculates that this visionOS-like design language could extend beyond the Camera app to other parts of iOS, like with app icons and widgets on the Home Screen. However, he says it's more likely that a few core Apple apps will see a similar design as Camera with a full-blown visionOS-looking update coming at a later date. More Apple Intelligence updatesThere are no concrete rumors or leaks explicitly stating that there will be new Apple Intelligence features coming in iOS 19, but it's likely the second-generation AI system will have some new features and improvements. For example, Apple had previously teased the ability to create custom playlist covers in the Music app using Apple Intelligence, but it's still not a feature as of iOS 18.3. A longer rollout of new featuresGurman also predicts that Apple will reserve many of the new iOS 19 features for later releases instead of making them available immediately with iOS 19.0. Thus, we could see significant updates for iOS 19.1, iOS 19.2, iOS 19.3, iOS 19.4, and so on, with the majority of these updates appearing in 2026.It won't be the first time, as we're still waiting for many of the most exciting iOS 18 features. For example, we can expect onscreen awareness, new app actions, and personal context knowledge for Siri with iOS 18.4, as well as improved Priority notifications and Sketch-style drawing in Image Playground.Don’t Miss: 160+ New Emoji Are Coming, Including Bigfoot, Distorted Face, and Apple Core",

developing a smarter version of Siri known as \u0026#34;LLM Siri,\u0026#34; designed to use advanced large language models (LLMs) for improved performance. This upgrade aims to make Siri more conversational and capable of handling complex tasks. The goal is to compete with AI chatbots like OpenAI\u0026#39;s ChatGPT and Google\u0026#39;s Gemini by enabling Siri to respond more naturally and continue ongoing conversations.

This feature uses an initial Apple LLM to decide whether Siri\u0026#39;s current setup can handle a request or if a more advanced model is needed. With this technology, Apple hopes to transform Siri from a basic assistant into a versatile, AI-powered tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new Siri version is being tested in a separate app on iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Eventually, it will replace the existing Siri entirely. Apple plans to preview LLM Siri as early as June 2025 during its Worldwide Developers Conference, alongside the announcement of iOS 19. Still, it won\u0026#39;t be available for testing until 2026 in a later iOS version, such as iOS 19.3 or iOS 19.4.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan id=\"jump-bigredesignforthecameraapp\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003eBig redesign for the Camera app\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest expected changes in iOS 19 is a redesigned Camera app, rumored to draw inspiration from visionOS, the interface for Apple\u0026#39;s Vision Pro headset.
