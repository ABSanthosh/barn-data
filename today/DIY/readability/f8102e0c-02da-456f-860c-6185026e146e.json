  "text": "Greetings friends, it’s been two weeks since I posted. I flew to Florida to get our house ready for tenants arriving unexpectedly early due to the damage from the hurricane. Usually we rent the house January through May, but Helene displaced a lot of people on the barrier islands due to storm surge. So I’ve been working here in Sarasota moving our personal things into the storage shed and prepping the home for tenants who will need the house for four months. Thankfully we experienced no damage to the interior since our house is a half mile inland, only a broken water line due to tree roots and also a dislodged gutter. My heart is saddened for those that had homes and businesses ruined from the huge storm. I fly home on Sunday and then it’s back to regular life in California. Favorite links from the week: This restored historic home in Tasmania. This chic Northern California houseboat. This 900 square foot cottage in the Cotswolds. Will artificial intelligence destroy lifestyle blogs? Six methods for removing sticky adhesive residue, ranked. Great find: these budget friendly arched bookcases. For the seventh year in a row, this country won “happiest” in the world. Could you pass a US citizenship test? The most haunted places in America. When and why people stopped wearing hats. Joy comes in a whisper. ___ If you’re still looking for chic Halloween decor you can reuse year after year, I’ve added my favorites to this list !",
