  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account HP HP laptops are becoming more repairable and upgradable, thanks to a partnership with iFixit. The two companies are working together to sell replacement parts, create repair guides, and other steps to make HP laptops more sustainable and repair-friendly. iFixit already provides repair parts, text and video guides, repair tools, and other support for fixing everything from game consoles to iPhones. This new partnership mainly covers some of HP’s premium business laptops, including the HP EliteBook 840 and 845 series G7, G8, and G9, and the 840 Aero G8. There are also guides and parts for the current HP 15 and 15s laptops, HP Pavillion x360 14 2-in-1 PC, and HP Pavillion 15. HP makes a lot more computers than the partnership currently covers, including all of HP’s desktop workstations, the Omen-brand gaming computers, and some mid-range and low-end laptops. You’re also still on your own for all of HP’s keyboards, printers, mice, webcams, and other hardware. Those repair guides and replacement parts are definitely better than nothing, but HP still has a long way to go. iFixit said in a blog post today, “Ever since earning our first-ever 10/10 repairability score in 2012 for the Z1 all-in-one workstation (complete with a repair diagram inside the device), HP has impressed us with their commitment to designing repairable products. Even when we called HP out for discontinuing the month-old TouchPad, we still had to give them credit for repairable design. […] We’re even more excited to expand our partnership today. As a subtle but steady champion for repairable hardware, this expansion is a natural next step for HP.” iFixit has partnered with several other big tech companies to create repair kits and guides for their products, including Microsoft, Google, and Valve. Not everyone needs iFixit’s help, though—it has praised Framework and other companies for creating their own repair documentation and retail channels for replacement parts. iFixit and Samsung also had a partnership for a few years until mid-2024, allegedly due to “obstacles that made us doubt Samsung’s commitment to making repair more accessible.” Related Samsung Doesn’t Want You to Repair Your Phone iFixit and Samsung are breaking up, and Samsung reportedly forces repair shops to share customer information. The blog psot also said, “One interesting feature to check out is the new battery replacement tool [HP is] calling the Revivekit. Inside the box, you’ll find two more boxes—one containing a new battery, and one designed to safely hold your old battery after replacement. The cardboard is contoured so it fits over the old battery while you’re extracting it, protecting it from wayward screwdriver pokes during your repair. It’s also got a couple strategically-placed adhesive pads to help secure it to the battery while you work—and it’s designed to stay stuck to the battery as it lifts out, whereupon you can fold it up for safekeeping and responsible disposal.” Even though the products with repair guides and replacement parts are still limited, any movement towards more sustainable hardware is great. Hopefully, the partnership extends to more of HP’s devices in the months and years ahead, especially with the ongoing trade war making new hardware purchases more difficult. Source: iFixit Windows",

laptops are becoming more repairable and upgradable, thanks to a partnership with iFixit.

This \u003ca href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/hp\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enew partnership\u003c/a\u003e mainly covers some of HP’s premium business laptops, including the HP EliteBook 840 and 845 series G7, G8, and G9, and the 840 Aero G8. There are also guides and parts for the current HP 15 and 15s laptops, HP Pavillion x360 14 2-in-1 PC, and HP Pavillion 15.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eHP makes a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e more computers than the partnership currently covers, including all of HP’s desktop workstations, the Omen-brand gaming computers, and some mid-range and low-end laptops. You’re also still on your own for all of HP’s keyboards, printers, mice, webcams, and other hardware. Those repair guides and replacement parts are definitely better than nothing, but HP still has a long way to go.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eiFixit said in a blog post today, “Ever since earning our first-ever 10/10 repairability score in 2012 for the Z1 all-in-one workstation (complete with a repair diagram inside the device), HP has impressed us with their commitment to designing repairable products. Even when we called HP out for discontinuing the month-old TouchPad, we still had to give them credit for repairable design. […] We’re even more excited to expand our partnership today. As a subtle but steady champion for repairable hardware, this expansion is a natural next step for HP.”\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eiFixit has partnered with several other big tech companies to create repair kits and guides for their products, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/ifixit-begins-selling-genuine-microsoft-surface-parts/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMicrosoft\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/135590/ifixit-now-sells-genuine-pixel-6a-parts/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogle\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216144458749237711\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eValve\u003c/a\u003e.

Revivekit. Inside the box, you’ll find two more boxes—one containing a new battery, and one designed to safely hold your old battery after replacement. The cardboard is contoured so it fits over the old battery while you’re extracting it, protecting it from wayward screwdriver pokes during your repair. It’s also got a couple strategically-placed adhesive pads to help secure it to the battery while you work—and it’s designed to stay stuck to the battery as it lifts out, whereupon you can fold it up for safekeeping and responsible disposal.”\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEven though the products with repair guides and replacement parts are still limited, any movement towards more sustainable hardware is great. Hopefully, the partnership extends to more of HP’s devices in the months and years ahead, especially with the ongoing trade war making new hardware purchases more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/109015/ifixit-and-hp-expand-partnership\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiFixit\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cul\u003e\n                                    \u003cli\u003e\n                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/category/windows/\" title=\"Windows\"\u003e\n                                                                    \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/windows-threads.jpg?q=50\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=32\u0026amp;h=32\u0026amp;dpr=1.5\" alt=\"Windows\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"/\u003e\n                        \u003c/p\u003e\n                                            \u003cp\u003eWindows\u003c/p\u003e\n                    \u003c/a\u003e\n                \u003c/li\u003e\n                        \u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n                            \n\n    \n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
