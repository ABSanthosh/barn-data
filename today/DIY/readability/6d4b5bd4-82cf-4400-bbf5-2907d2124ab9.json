I’m collecting book recommendations and summer activities. I’m hoping to make it our best summer yet full of picnics, reading and homemade ice cream (after we get our kitchen back, that is). 10 Things I Love 1. This week I’m excited to read The Wedding People. I’ve heard nothing but great things. The next I’m looking forward to reading The Sirens and Deep Cuts. Please send me your recent favorites from almost any genre- I love an enthusiastic recommendation so give me horrible fomo pls. 2. With the girls, I’m reading Peter and the Starcatchers. If you have any middle-grade book suggestions I’d love to hear them. 3. I forced myself to get my once-yearly Spring/Summer manicure and I got lavender. I like it, but truthfully, there’s a huge part of me that’s already ready for Halloween. I’m savoring Summer, but fantasizing about watching Practical Magic in my new kitchen…. ahhh. 4. If you’re looking for a fun summer cocktail to make I think you’ll love scrolling our cocktail page. There are so many fun ideas, all of them easy to mix up at home. My personal favorite is probably this hot pink margarita. 5. Round ice cubes are so fun. Speaking of ice, I’ve been considering getting a countertop pebble ice maker. If you have one (that you love!) let me know your review. 6. Rifle is having a 25% off sitewide sale. I love their home decor and rugs. 7. Love this saffron \u0026 cedar candle for summer. 8. If you need a Father’s day idea, this is what we do. Buy a cute album, print out all your photos of the kids with their dad and let them make a scrapbook using the photos, their own art and type out their memories and print them. We’ve done this project quite a few years and it’s always so worth the time and effort. They are treasures. Also, I love the idea of making a custom hat. 9. If you’re considering getting a Ninja Creami be sure to read our detailed Ninja Creami review. It’s my favorite novelty appliance. 10. I’m packing for a trip right now and it reminds me I love this travel makeup bag. It lays flat, which is so nice.
