Personally, I have nothing against making my home look fabulous, but I also need to pay the bills. Therefore, when a hack comes along that shows off how to get a custom look at a bargain price, I pay attention.It’s projects like this sweet media console from Michaela Shoebridge (@mishkashoe) that inspire me to think outside the box when it comes to home furniture and accessories. The final product is stunning, and with over 8,500 likes, many people agree.I think one of the most inspiring things about this hack is it reminds me that nothing has to stay as it seems. If you can’t find exactly what you’re looking for (or it’s too expensive), do it yourself. What You’ll Need 5 BESTÅ oak units (23 ⅝” ones) 1 BESTÅ door to use as a guide Timber for the base (2 x 4s) 2 sheets of Oak veneered MDF (4 x 8 sheets) The hinges and drawer runners that come with the BESTÅ units Screws to attach the units to the base Iron-on edge banding No More Nails or similar adhesive Drill Sander Jigsaw Clamps Pencil Something circular to use as a template for your scallops Turn BESTÅ Units Into a Beautiful Scalloped TV stand 1. Assemble Your BESTÅ Units Put together the BESTÅ units according to the IKEA instructions. Don’t worry about the doors and drawers right now since you’ll be using some of the MDF to make your own. 2. Build a Base Use the timber to build a base that raises your console off the floor. Include smaller 2x4s in the frame to provide supports where the BESTÅ units meet each other. Do not make the frame the same exact depth as the BESTÅ boxes. Leave a slight overhang to accommodate step 5. 3. Attach the BESTÅ Units Use screws to attach the BESTÅ units to your timber base. Place them on the base and make sure it’s a good fit before screwing anything together. Screw the units to each other as well to prevent gaps. 4. Add a Top Panel to Cover Joints Cut a piece of oak veneered MDF to size that will be a topper for the console and cover the seams. Use the No More Nails (or adhesive of choice) to secure the panel. Clamp the board in place until the glue sets. 5. Hide the Bottom of the Frame Add an extra piece of MDF across the bottom front of the base to hide it. (This is why you left the overhang in step one). Secure the strip with the adhesive to avoid making screw or nail holes. 6. Add Iron-On Edging Apply the iron-on banding to hide the exposed wood edges and sand all of the sides until they are smooth. Michaela had some good advice to share for this step. She says, “I always sand it down while the glue is hot. That way the glue gets mixed with the sawdust and creates a nice smooth edge.”  7. Prep the Doors and Drawer Fronts Michaela made her own doors and drawer fronts using the oak veneered MDF so everything on the exterior of the console matches seamlessly. She used the original BESTÅ pieces as a template to get the right size and mark holes for the hardware. 8. Add the Scallop Detail Use the original IKEA door to fashion a guide for the scalloped edges. Line the IKEA door up with your DIY doors to mark where you want the scallops to start. Use something circular to trace out your wave pattern (the hacker used an old candle jar). Cut the scalloped edge with a jigsaw.  Finally, add the banding to the doors. The original post mentions that putting the iron-on edging over the wavy edges is a little tricky, but a hairdryer helps.  9. Attach the Doors and Drawers Assemble the rest of the drawers. Put all of the drawers and doors together, and attach them to the BESTÅ units.  10. Finish the Sides Cut new sides for the console from the oak veneered MDF, and attach using the adhesive. Your custom console is done and ready to make all your houseguests ooh and aah! Is This Hack Expensive? The hacker says the whole project cost just under $625. It might sound pricey for a DIY project but don’t forget you’re getting a custom console that’s a little over 9 ½ feet long. That’s a bargain. My hubby and I have been searching for a unique piece for our entryway for a while now, and everything is so expensive. We’re talking $4,000 or more. This project has inspired me to look at things in a new way, reimagining basic pieces into beautiful additions to our home. A Few Extra Tips Drill holes in the back of your unit to create pass-throughs for wires and cords. The BESTÅ comes in a variety of colors, so choose one that works best with your space. If you opt for something different, you’ll need to change your MDF veneer accordingly. Or consider using unfinished wood and stain or paint it to give yourself endless aesthetic possibilities.Check out the tutorial, and be sure to follow Michaela on Instagram @mishkashoe for more inspiring home projects and beautiful designs.Looking for more media console ideas?
