If you miss the charm of early smartphones, you can relive those days with a three-dimensional, fully interactive, hyper-realistic Nokia 3250 right in your browser window. After visiting the website, you'll quickly find that this is about as realisitic of an expirience as you can get without having the physical phone in your hands. You have complete control of the phone. That includes panning and rotating to look around the device, as well as zooming in and out to hold it closer or farther away. That alone would be cool in itself, but there's so much more. This is a special phone. Every button on the device is functional. Want to turn the phone on? Simply press and hold the power button on the top. Now you can use the d-pad to navigate the interface and open the few apps that are available—sorry, no touchscreen here. Sadly, Snake is not present on this Nokia phone. You can, however, choose between the red/silver or black colorways that the Nokia 3250 was available in. There's something even cooler, too: the bottom of the phone swivels. The bottom quarter of the Nokia 3250 can be rotated for different purposes. In your exploration, you may have noticed the camera is on the side of the phone, which would be awkward to use. Well, you can simply twist the bottom section to point the 2MP camera forward or backward. If you twist it toward you, the website will even use your webcam to snap a photo. Twist it 180-degrees and you'll swap the number pad for media controls, which also automatically opens the music player. Now, I'll admit, I had never heard of this particular Nokia phone before I found this website. When the Nokia 3250 launched in 2005, I was probably using an LG flip phone and dreaming of owning a true \"smartphone.\" This is the exact type of phone I would have been drooling over, though. Imagine how satisfying it must be to fidget with the bottom section of the phone? The website makes a nice click sound, but I'm sure it was even better in real life. There's not much information available about the creator of this amazing toy. The Chaz.fun homepage simply says, \"Life is 3D, Why Settle for Flat.\" You know, I have to agree with that—life is indeed 3D. Now, I can't help but want more old phones to be ported into realistinc 3D space. Related A Love Letter to My First Smartphone, the HTC Droid Eris An easy way to find out if someone is of the tech persuasion is to ask them about their first smartphone or computer. If their eyes light up and they immediately spit out a full product name, you know you're in good company. Let me tell you about my favorite \"First\"—the HTC Droid Eris, my first smartphone.",

Back when we had physical buttons galore and moving parts. If you miss the charm of early smartphones, you can relive those days with a three-dimensional, fully interactive, hyper-realistic Nokia 3250 right in your browser window.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAfter \u003ca href=\"https://chaz.fun/phone/3250/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evisiting the website\u003c/a\u003e, you\u0026#39;ll quickly find that this is about as realisitic of an expirience as you can get without having the physical phone in your hands. You have complete control of the phone. That includes panning and rotating to look around the device, as well as zooming in and out to hold it closer or farther away. That alone would be cool in itself, but there\u0026#39;s so much more. This is a special phone.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eEvery button on the device is functional. Want to turn the phone on? Simply press and hold the power button on the top. Now you can use the d-pad to navigate the interface and open the few apps that are available—sorry, no touchscreen here. Sadly, Snake is not present on this Nokia phone. You can, however, choose between the red/silver or black colorways that the Nokia 3250 was available in. There\u0026#39;s something even cooler, too: the bottom of the phone swivels.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom quarter of the Nokia 3250 can be rotated for different purposes. In your exploration, you may have noticed the camera is on the side of the phone, which would be awkward to use. Well, you can simply twist the bottom section to point the 2MP camera forward or backward. If you twist it toward you, the website will even use your webcam to snap a photo. Twist it 180-degrees and you\u0026#39;ll swap the number pad for media controls, which also automatically opens the music player.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eNow, I\u0026#39;ll admit, I had never heard of this particular Nokia phone before I found this website. When the Nokia 3250 launched in 2005, I was probably using an LG flip phone and dreaming of owning a true \u0026#34;smartphone.\u0026#34; This is the exact type of phone I would have been drooling over, though. Imagine how satisfying it must be to fidget with the bottom section of the phone? The website makes a nice click sound, but I\u0026#39;m sure it was even better in real life.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s not much information available about the creator of this amazing toy. The \u003ca href=\"https://chaz.fun/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChaz.fun\u003c/a\u003e homepage simply says, \u0026#34;Life is 3D, Why Settle for Flat.\u0026#34; You know, I have to agree with that—life is indeed 3D.
