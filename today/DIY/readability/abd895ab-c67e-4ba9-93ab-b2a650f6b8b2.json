Maximizing every inch is an ongoing goal in our two-bedroom, so I’m always on the prowl for more space-saving solutions. Currently, I’m brainstorming ideas for my son’s bedroom, which is why this HEMNES bed hack from HANNA RÖDIN (@hannarodin) caught my eye. The IKEA HEMNES series cropped up in the early 2000s, starting with its chest of drawers in 2002 and adding additional bedroom pieces over the next few years. The HEMNES 8-drawer dresser offers plenty of storage in a sleek design, which is likely why Hanna picked it for her daughter’s bedroom in the first place (giving it a sweet facelift with subtle paint colors). My son has a loft bed with book bins underneath, but this hack takes things to a whole new level. After numerous requests from impressed commenters, Hanna offered a run-down on her loft bed project What you’ll need: IKEA HEMNES 8-drawer dresser Saw Drill Level Appropriate screws ¾” sheets of MDF Several 1 ¾” boards  Wooden dowels for slats Primer Paint Foam mattress (35” x 75” cut down to roughly 35” x 61.4”) The Popular HEMNES Dresser Gets a Do-Over to Cozy Loft Bed Photo Credit: HANNA RÖDIN @hannarodin | Instagram 1. Prep the HEMNES If you’re starting with a brand-new HEMNES, assemble it according to IKEA’s instructions. Hanna started by removing the top and sawing off the legs to make the bed lower. She mentions saving the cut legs to use for the floor plinth “So that the bed would feel more built-in.” 2. Frame and Secure Your Future Bed Use boards cut to the appropriate size to create a frame around the entire dresser, including inside the top. Bring the boards to the floor to provide ample support for future sleepers. Hanna cut a notch into the bottom of the supports by the wall to clear the baseboard. Attach another board to the wall and create rails between the wall support and bed frame. Use the level throughout to ensure everything stays even. 3. Add the Top and Sides Cut a piece of MDF to fit on the top of your newly framed dresser. Allow enough space on the front and side to accommodate the railing. Cut another piece of MDF to fit the side of the bed. (Hanna has her bed positioned in a corner. However, if you plan to have both sides exposed, consider if you want to do anything on the other side.) One extra point to think about during this step is airflow. One commenter, @hemmastilens, mentions, “Super nice, we built the bed similarly and got a million comments saying it’s not airy under the mattress and will mold.” However, it appears neither Hanna nor @hemmastilens have had any issues in this department. Still, if you’re concerned about mold and want to take some precautions, it could be as simple as drilling a few holes in the MDF on the side that’s not atop the dresser. Or create some decorative cut-outs along the front and sides. You decide what’s best for your situation. 4. Create the Stairs Use the MDF to build the box stairs. Again, if your bed’s not going in a corner, you could add steps on both sides. Leave the side of the steps open for extra storage. 5. Add the Safety Rail Use the boards to build the fence to your desired height. The wooden dowels provide the slats. Make sure to use proper spacing so little ones don’t get stuck. 6. Prime, Paint, and Finishing Touches Use a stain-blocking paint and primer in one to create the perfect finishing touch. Create any look you want by changing up colors and finishes. Swap out the hardware on the drawers depending on the room style you want to match. The final touch is a mattress for your brand-new DIY bed. Hanna used a foam mattress (35” x 75”) that she cut down to roughly 61.4” to fit the bed area. From One IKEA Hack to the Next There are lots of IKEA loft bed creations that inspire dedicated hackers to flex their DIY muscles. Hanna shares, “There is also a great description at @fotografhenriettabruto (Henrietta Bruto) that I found a long time ago when I was looking for inspo for the bed construction.” One major difference is that Henrietta uses three of the IKEA RAST three-drawer chests for their bed project. You can see a photo step-by-step on Henrietta’s blog for the RAST version.",
