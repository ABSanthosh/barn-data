Whether you’re trying to block your neighbor’s direct line of sight or simply carve out a little sanctuary for yourself, the IKEA NÄMMARÖ Privacy Screen might be exactly what you need. This wooden slatted beauty isn’t just a room divider—it’s a hackable piece that brings both function and form to small-space living. Why the NÄMMARÖ Privacy Screen Works for Small Spaces Designed with indoor and outdoor use in mind, the NÄMMARÖ is made of sustainably sourced acacia wood treated with a protective stain. It stands at 55 ⅛” tall and 31 1/2″ wide. If you need more coverage, you can place two or more next to each other to make a bigger wall. It would be even better if IKEA made it in different sizes—then we could mix and match to fit the space. At the bottom, it has feet that sit flat on the floor to keep it steady. Because it stands on its own and doesn’t come with folds like some room dividers, it doesn’t take up a lot of extra space. NÄMMARÖ Screen Hacks to Try 1. Mini Office Backdrop Set it up behind a compact desk in your home office and boom! Instant Zoom backdrop. Add some hanging planters or a clip-on light to make it even more functional. One clever hacker mounted caster wheels to the base for mobility to place the backdrop anywhere in the home. 2. Vertical Garden Wall Attach small planters, herb pots, or wire baskets to the slats to create a living wall. It’s a perfect solution if you’re short on ground space but still want a lush, green vibe. Screw one NÄMMARÖ on top of another to make a taller screen and hang up your greens. 3. Easy Walk-In Closet Photo Credit: IKEA.com No space for a dedicated walk-in closet? Then, turn your bedroom into a semi-private walk-in wardrobe. By placing the NÄMMARÖ screen between your bed and a clothing rack or closet, you can instantly create a defined dressing area without any renovations. It visually separates the sleeping zone from the storage space, making your bedroom feel more organized and intentional—especially in studio apartments or shared spaces. Add a mirror and a small bench, and you’ve got a walk-in closet feel in just a few square feet. 4. Indoor Room Divider NÄMMARÖ Privacy Screen | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Create zones for better use of space. Use the NÄMMARÖ room divider to section off a dining area, a reading nook, or make a makeshift mudroom. 5. Slatted Wood Door Transform the NÄMMARÖ panels into a lightweight door in the bathroom or an outdoor storage shed. (It’s pre-treated against water and stains!)  Reinforce the slats with a wooden frame and then add simple hinges to turn the screens into a rustic, stylish door to hide away clutter that could otherwise overwhelm a small space. What IKEA Shoppers Are Saying One reviewer shared, “Huge fan of slatted wood and these are sturdy and super stylish way to filter out the neighbors — I imagine they will sell quickly, so go ahead and get!” Another noted, “This privacy screen looks as advertised, good quality, and matches the other NÄMMARÖ outdoor furniture pieces. I wish it were a little taller/wider for the price, but I still like it.” Some users have mentioned that assembly can be a bit tricky. One of the main issues is with the feet. They are not screwed in, rather, they rely on tension and gravity to stay in place. This means if you lift or slide the screen, the feet can come off easily (and in some cases, both do). It can feel a little precarious, especially during setup. Aligning the panels and rods also requires some patience and finesse. It’s not the easiest assembly in the IKEA lineup. So give yourself some time, read through the instructions carefully, and get a second pair of hands to help you with it. And if you’re handy with a drill or a staple gun, you can even customize it further. Think fabric panels for more coverage, LED string lights for ambiance, or even painting it to match your décor. I’m also waiting to see someone turn the NÄMMARÖ sideways for horizontal slats. A Rustic Privacy Screen That Can Be Easily Modified For under $100, the NÄMMARÖ privacy screen has the potential to be so much more than just a divider. It’s a vertical canvas just waiting for your creative IKEA hack. Got your own NÄMMARÖ transformation? We’d love to see it — submit your hack here and share your room divider ideas.",
