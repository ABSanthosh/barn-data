The latest sensation comes from Ayse Balci of @interiorundco, whose stylish DIY project has been turning heads on Instagram, amassing an impressive 115,000 likes and counting. Have you seen it yet? It’s a fantastic DIY project that transforms the popular and affordable 13 3/4″ LACK side table into a stylish chrome cube side table. Many of us may already have this IKEA classic in our homes. If your LACK table is scratched up and in need of an update, this chic solution may be for you. Metal Cube Side Table Hack LACK side table 13 3/4″ | Photo Credit: IKEA.com To get started, Ayse installed the legs to the LACK tabletop as per instructions. Then, she removes the veneer banding along the edge of the LACK tabletop. This might take a bit of patience and brute force, but it’s an important step to create a level surface for the chrome sheets to adhere to. Next comes the fun part. Ayse spreads construction glue on the table legs before carefully applying the chrome sheets. Once you have the sheets in place, let the glue dry completely. You may need to place some heavy books on the table to help the sheets stick firmly. Then, simply peel off the protective film, and your chrome side table is done. How Much Does This Hack Cost? Ayse bought the aluminum sheets, cut to size, from Feld. The update cost a total of €50 ($55), with most of the expense going towards the metal sheets. She ordered raw aluminum sheets with a 1mm thickness, for a total of 5 sheets. 4 sheets at 351 mm (length) x 350 mm (width) – for the sides 1 sheet at 351 mm (length x 351 mm (width) – for the top At first glance, this might seem pricey compared to the original $9.99 LACK side table. However, after researching similar metal cube end tables, it’s clear that this hack is excellent value for money. For instance, AllModern offers a comparable 16″ brushed metal end table for a whopping $499. I’ll take the hack anytime.Ayse cleverly nests the side table under her coffee table, creating an appealing layer of texture against the stone tabletop. I love the elegance of this shiny new object in her living room. Safety First However, it’s important to consider safety if you’re thinking about replicating this hack. If you have younger children, you might want to exercise caution, as the edges of the metal cube could potentially be sharp. We certainly want to avoid any nicks and scratches on little ones. Always safety first when implementing DIY projects, especially in shared living spaces.
