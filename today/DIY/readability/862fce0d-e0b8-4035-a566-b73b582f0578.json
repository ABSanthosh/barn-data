However, you can make sure your February 14th goes off without a hitch by avoiding these scams. Online Romance Scams (Catfishing) Koto Images/Shutterstock Scammers create fake online dating profiles or social media personas using stolen photos and made-up backstories. Once they've gained a victim's trust, they fabricate emergencies—like sudden medical bills, flight expenses to visit, or other urgent financial needs—and ask for money. They claim to be from your country but are currently \"traveling abroad\" or working overseas. They avoid video chats or in-person meetings but grow emotionally intense very quickly. They repeatedly ask for money or gift cards, often for \"emergency\" reasons. Any time you receive undue pressure to suddenly send cash to someone is a huge red flag and a sign that a scam is underway. Gift and E-Card Scams violetkaipa/Shutterstock Around Valentine's Day, you may receive emails or texts offering you an electronic greeting card (\"e-card\") from an \"admirer.\" In some cases, these are phishing emails that contain malware or links to malicious sites. One way to spot these phishing scams is poor grammar and spelling, though AI chatbots have made this method less effective. Another clear sign of a scam is that there is no specific sender (not in the romantic Valentine's Day mystery way!) and that the gift or e-card contains a link to a random website. Unfortunately, AI phishing scams are everywhere, but you can spot them with some effort. Fake Online Florists or Gift Shops Scammers set up fraudulent websites offering amazing discounts on popular Valentine's Day items such as flowers, chocolates, or jewelry. They take payment but never deliver the products or items of far lower quality than promised. Be wary of extremely low prices that seem too good to be true. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is, and scammers know most folks can't resist the pull of an amazing deal. Another sign that you're dealing with a fake florist or gift shop is a lack of contact information or a physical address. “Secret Admirer” Messages You might receive a text, social media direct message, or email claiming you have a \"secret admirer.\" The scammer asks you to \"confirm your identity\" or \"click a link to see the message.\" Doing so could install malware or lead you to a spoofed site that steals personal data. Fake messages and emails are among the most common types of phishing. Similar to the fake e-cards, unsolicited requests for personal information such as your name, address, or financial details are a huge red flag. Similarly, anything with a suspicious link, unusual domain, or shortened URL could indicate that you're being pushed to a phishing site. Counterfeit Gift Cards or Coupons Scammers sell fake gift cards or coupon codes—often through online marketplaces or social media ads—at a discounted rate. You pick one up thinking you've grabbed a bargain, only to discover they're worthless when trying to redeem them. Or, you send one to a loved one as a lovely Valentine's gesture, only for them to realize it's unusable. Just like the fake florists and other gift sites, extremely high discounts are always a worry. Sure, there are some major discounters, and some big deals do exist. But they're few and far between, especially for big-ticket items. For example, why would someone sell a brand-new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for under half-price just weeks after its February 2025 launch date? They're not; it's a scam. Tips to Avoid Valentine's Day Scams While Valentine's Day comes with an uptick in romance-related scams, much of the advice on avoiding these is \"standard.\" That is to say, these tips are universal and will always help you avoid scams, not just on Valentine's Day. Verify Identities: If you meet someone new online, insist on video chats or voice calls before getting heavily invested. Look out for excuses about why they can't show their face or meet in person. Be Skeptical: If someone you've just started talking to online has sudden financial emergencies, that's a major red flag. Never send money or gift cards to someone you haven't met in person. Even then, make sure you really know the person before sending money. Double-Check URLs: When purchasing gifts or sending e-cards, ensure the website's address starts with \"HTTPS\" and the site name is spelled correctly. Look for trust seals and read reviews from other customers. Consider using a URL security checker to quickly scan for issues. Use Secure Payment Methods: Avoid paying for flowers, gifts, or anything else with direct wire transfers. Using a debit or credit card or reputable payment service is more secure. Ignore Unsolicited Links or Attachments: Don't click on unfamiliar Valentine's e-card links or open attachments from unknown senders. Scan any surprising attachments or links with antivirus software first. Research Before Donating: If you come across a romantic-themed charity appeal, research the organization. Check for official websites and confirm legitimacy on recognized charity watchdog sites (e.g., Charity Navigator). Take Your Time: Scammers love to rush you. Don't let anyone pressure you into making financial decisions quickly. Real offers and genuine friends or partners will respect your caution. Remember, trust your instincts when in doubt—if something feels \"off,\" it's better to err on the side of caution.",

If it seems too good to be true, it probably is, and scammers know most folks can\u0026#39;t resist the pull of an amazing deal. Another sign that you\u0026#39;re dealing with a fake florist or gift shop is a lack of contact information or a physical address.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"ldquo-secret-admirer-rdquo-messages\"\u003e\n                        “Secret Admirer” Messages\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might receive a text, social media direct message, or email claiming you have a \u0026#34;secret admirer.\u0026#34; The scammer asks you to \u0026#34;confirm your identity\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;click a link to see the message.\u0026#34; Doing so could install malware or lead you to a spoofed site that steals personal data.

Similarly, anything with a suspicious link, unusual domain, or shortened URL could indicate that you\u0026#39;re being pushed to a phishing site.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"counterfeit-gift-cards-or-coupons\"\u003e\n                        Counterfeit Gift Cards or Coupons\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eScammers sell fake gift cards or coupon codes—often through online marketplaces or social media ads—at a discounted rate. You pick one up thinking you\u0026#39;ve grabbed a bargain, only to discover they\u0026#39;re worthless when trying to redeem them. Or, you send one to a loved one as a lovely Valentine\u0026#39;s gesture, only for them to realize it\u0026#39;s unusable.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eJust like the fake florists and other gift sites, extremely high discounts are always a worry. Sure, there are some major discounters, and some big deals do exist. But they\u0026#39;re few and far between, especially for big-ticket items.
