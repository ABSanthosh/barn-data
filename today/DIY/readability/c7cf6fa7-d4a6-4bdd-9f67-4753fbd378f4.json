The practical side table with a removable tray table is among IKEA’s best-sellers, and right now, you can snag one for just $14.99 as part of the IKEA Family Price promotion—down from the regular price of $19.99, valid until November 26. If you’ve been on the hunt for the perfect side table but are hesitant about the GLADOM because so many people seem to have one, you’re in for a treat. Luisa Ehlgötz has three inspiring GLADOM hacks that will set your table apart from the rest. Luisa, who shares her creative projects on Instagram @schereleimpapier, has taken this ordinary side table to the next level with her gorgeous hacks. Here’s a look at her creative IKEA GLADOM hacks, which might just inspire you to bring home a GLADOM of your own. 1. IKEA GLADOM Hack with Epoxy Resin First, she sprays the side table with Rust-oleum’s chalk paint. Then, she creates a lovely mosaic pattern on her GLADOM tray tables using small wooden cubes. The process involved casting the cubes in epoxy resin to secure them to the table. However, Luisa encountered a common challenge: air bubbles formed as the oxygen was released from the wood. “In hindsight, I should have sealed them (the cubes) with clear lacquer first,” she admits.To combat this, after the first layer of resin had cured, she used her trusty Dremel to mill out the air bubbles, then poured a second layer of epoxy resin which solved the issue. The result is a beautiful tray table we think is perfect for a patio or balcony. 2. Macrame Curtains for a Mini Cabinet In another IKEA hack, Luisa’s partner, Adrian, showcased his knotting skills by crafting macrame curtains for the GLADOM table. With the patience of an angel—something Luisa humorously admits she lacks—Adrian created a stylish curtain that allows the tabletop to transform into a mini cabinet.The original tabletop was moved down, making room for a SKALA tray to take its place at the top. If the SKALA is no longer available at your local IKEA, you can substitute it with any other round 17″ tray like the OMBONAD. Simply place your revamped GLADOM next to your bed, and voilà—you’ve got a boho bedside table. 3. Indoor Jungle with Live Plants For plant lovers, Luisa’s third hack is a fun way to add more greens to your living space. She begins by cutting out a round acrylic tabletop, using the original GLADOM tray as a template. The GLADOM tray is then repurposed as a planter. She glues strips from the RÖDEBY armrest tray to the round base, creating height to hide regular plastic pots. Along the top rim of the GLADOM frame, she glues moss to the frame to complete the look. Has Luisa convinced you of the hackability of the GLADOM table? Which of these 3 GLADOM tray table hacks is your favorite?
