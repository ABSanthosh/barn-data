  "text": "Samsung Phones \u0026 Tablets Sign in to your How-To Geek account Justin Duino / How-To Geek CES 2025 is giving us a lot of cool hardware, but once that's over, we still have a lot to see over the next weeks and months. Samsung, for its part, is already gearing up to show us its next smartphones. When, exactly? At its Unpacked event on January 22nd. Samsung has just started sending out invites for its next Unpacked hardware event, which is happening on January 22nd in San Jose, California. As usual, you will be able to tune to Samsung's website when it happens—the event will start at 10 AM PT or 1 PM ET. Samsung will reveal its upcoming Galaxy S25 range of flagship smartphones, and possibly other devices. Samsung There have been conflicting rumors as to how different these phones will be from their predecessors, but we can expect a more powerful chip inside, with rumors pointing to the use of the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite. We might also get a slighly different design, better cameras, and more stuff. Samsung is also teasing improvements to its Galaxy AI suite of AI features, and we'll probably see during the event whether those are any good. As usual, Samsung has opened a \"reserve\" window where you can reserve your new Samsung phone before the actual pre-order period starts. That reserve window is now open and will be open all the way through January 22nd, which is when the phone will be announced. You also get a reward for reserving your phone—a $50 credit towards your new phone, and a chance to win a $5,000 gift card on Samsung's online store. You can also get up to an additional $300 credit when you reserve and pre-order (the specifics of that particular promotion should be shown right after pre-orders begin) and up to $900 off when you trade in your previous phone.
