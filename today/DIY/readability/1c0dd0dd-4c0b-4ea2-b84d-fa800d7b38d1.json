Traditionally, itâ€™s made by pouring batter through a funnel into hot oil to quickly deep fry the cake. I believe itâ€™s somewhat regional to areas of the US but Iâ€™m honestly not totally sure as itâ€™s very much a staple of many childhood memories for me so it seems universal. ðŸ™‚ Making homemade funnel cake is super easy . Itâ€™s very similar to pancake batterâ€”we are basically deep frying pancakes! Related: And if you love pancakes then you should also try our crepes and french toast recipes next. Ingredients Pancake mix Water Vanilla extract Oil â€“ canola or vegetable Powdered Sugar, also called Confectionerâ€™s Sugar How to make Funnel Cake Mix together the pancake mix and water. Add to a squeeze bottle or pour through a funnel. Heat the oil to right around 350Â°F or a little less. Then pour the batter in, making a spider web type shape. Wait 20-30 seconds, flip, then fry for another 15-20 seconds.Â Remove to a bed of paper towels to remove excess oil. Dust with powder sugar before serving. Notes \u0026 Tips I tried three different store bought pancake mixes. The one that worked best wasÂ Bisquick. In the process of testing a few mixes, I learned that itâ€™s all about batter texture. If your batter is super runny, like you could drink it through a straw, it wonâ€™t hold together well when you go to deep fry it. You want a thick paste consistency.Â  I like making smaller, two to three bite-sized funnel cakes as they are easier to maneuver in the hot oil. But you can use this same recipe to make large size funnel cakes, like the fair, if you prefer. It works best if you pour the batter through a squeeze bottleÂ (like the one pictured above) rather than a funnel into the oil. This gives me a little more control as I work.
