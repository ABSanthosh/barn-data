  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Govee Summary Govee's Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL reacts to music within 32ms and has 210 customizable LEDs. The lamp doubles as a speaker, offering a 5.8GHz stereo connection and 4.5hr battery life. Similar to JBL's Pulse 5, the lamp combines aesthetics with sound quality, priced at $179.99 from June 23. Finding a good table lamp is not something you think about a lot until you start getting older, but while there are many simpler options, why not allow yourself to get something a tad higher tech? Now, Govee has just launched a neat lil' table lamp, with a party trick that sounds really good (literally). Govee has announced the release of its new Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL. The Table Lamp 2 Pro incorporates Govee's latest algorithm and chipset, allowing it to react to music within 32 milliseconds. The lamp is equipped with 210 individually customizable RGBICWW LED beads, which are reported to deliver visuals that are 20% crisper than previous models. Each LED bead can be uniquely colored, opening the lamp up to a wide plethora of customization options. The device comes with over 100 preset lighting scenes, and you might find each of those to fit various moods from festive to relaxed settings, such as meditation and reading. It also features adjustable brightness and color temperatures, allowing you to tailor the lighting to different scenarios. This isn't just any lamp, though. It's both a lamp and a speaker. The Table Lamp 2 Pro features a 2.5-inch 500cc speaker, developed in collaboration with JBL. The lamp supports a high-speed 5.8GHz Wi-Fi stereo connection, enabling stereo sound when two Table Lamp 2 Pro units are paired. This dual-lamp configuration should have both synchronized sound and synchronized lighting. As far as battery life goes, it has a 5,200 mAh battery that provides up to 4.5 hours of portable use. Related Govee's New Outdoor Lights Are Perfect For Your Yard Many prioritize indoor smart lights, but outdoor lights are also important, and you can also make those smart, just like you would put a smart outdoor camera by your doorstep. Govee's latest outdoor smart lights might be a good choice if you've been considering getting some to keep the lights on at night. The lamp's 360-degree circular design and suspended light ring are intended to project visuals from multiple angles. It offers 600 lumens of brightness and a color temperature range of 2700K to 6500K, suitable for various room settings. This seems to be a pretty similar product to JBL's own Pulse 5, but there are some key differences. The Pulse 5 has a bigger battery, at 7,500 mAh, and seems to be better at actually performing as a speaker. This product, however, is a table lamp first and a speaker second. It's still pretty good, though, and it's nice if you want to enhance the look of your room and make it sound good. Two in one! The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL will be available starting June 23 for $179.99 on Govee.com and Amazon, so keep an eye out at your retailer of choice if you want to grab a couple of these.

getting older, but while there are many simpler options, why not allow yourself to get something a tad higher tech? Now, Govee has just launched a neat lil\u0026#39; table lamp, with a party trick that sounds really good (literally).\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eGovee has announced the release of its new Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL. The Table Lamp 2 Pro incorporates Govee\u0026#39;s latest algorithm and chipset, allowing it to react to music within 32 milliseconds. The lamp is equipped with 210 individually customizable RGBICWW LED beads, which are reported to deliver visuals that are 20% crisper than previous models. Each LED bead can be uniquely colored, opening the lamp up to a wide plethora of customization options. The device comes with over 100 preset lighting scenes, and you might find each of those to fit various moods from festive to relaxed settings, such as meditation and reading. It also features adjustable brightness and color temperatures, allowing you to tailor the lighting to different scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0026#39;t just any lamp, though. It\u0026#39;s both a lamp \u003cem\u003eand \u003c/em\u003ea speaker. The Table Lamp 2 Pro features a 2.5-inch 500cc speaker, developed in collaboration with JBL. The lamp supports a high-speed 5.8GHz Wi-Fi stereo connection, enabling stereo sound when two Table Lamp 2 Pro units are paired. This dual-lamp configuration should have both synchronized sound and synchronized lighting. As far as battery life goes, it has a 5,200 mAh battery that provides up to 4.5 hours of portable use.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n
