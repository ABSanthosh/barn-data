  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account There is now a new way to watch Netflix with captions, as long as you’re ready to dive into the final season of You. Dialog-Only Captions Strip Out Audio Cues, Speaker Names and More You’re probably aware of the captioning option for deaf and hard of hearing, also known as SDH/CC. When you read that, you’ll see audio cues like [phone buzzing] along with speaker names. That’s not useful if you’re just interested in better understanding what’s being said in your favorite TV show or movie. Netflix is adding a new way to use captions. Starting with the new season of You, it’s possible to also select a new subtitle option that only shows the dialog. To do that, open the language picker and select English as a subtitle option instead of English (CC). Netflix says that the new subtitle type will be available on all new Netflix originals in every language offered going forward, right along with the SDH/CC option. All of the current caption options from Netflix can also be customized by changing both the size and font of the information on the screen. To do that on a TV or streaming device, select the player controls at the bottom of the screen. Then choose Settings to adjust the subtitle size and font. If Settings isn’t shown on screen, your device doesn’t support customization options. Netflix Should Provide the New Caption Options Across Its Catalog Subtitles are popular with Netflix users as the streaming giant says almost half of viewing hours have subtitles turned on. Even without hearing problems, there are a number of reasons to use subtitles, like someone sleeping in the same room, wanting to keep better track of the dialog, or because of subpar home theater equipment. While it’s nice to see Netflix start adding the dialog-only caption option, it should also do the extra work to roll it out to all existing content. That would make the feature much more useful, especially if you’re looking for something else to watch besides a Netflix original. Many houses are split on whether to use captions when watching TV. Some people avoid subtitles for a more immersive experience while allowing better focus on the dialog. You’ll also benefit from less screen clutter and train your memory and comprehension. On the other side of the stage, many people enjoy subtitles so they won’t miss a bit of dialog and the state of modern sound mixing. If you’re a fan of subtitles, the new dialog-option on Netflix sounds great. Thankfully, I am a fan of You, so I will make sure to try it out instead of simply using my AirPods to listen privately without disturbing others in my household.",
