  "text": "Happy weekend everyone! This week I made progress on our kitchen update. I found a quartz pattern I really like, it’s just a matter of ordering the material and scheduling the fabrication and installation. The new upper cabinets and open shelves are ready to be swapped out so we’re waiting for our finish contractor to give us a date on that installation. My hope is to have it all done by January, fingers crossed. My stepdaughter got engaged over the weekend so we’re all excited for her future nuptials. We really love her fiancé and we’re so happy for both of them as they step into a new chapter together. Favorite links from the week: This elegant dining space layered in shades of green and white. This relaxing home in Southern California. This kitchen totally transformed with paint including the cabinets, floors, and the backsplash too. Interesting test: where do you stop seeing green and start seeing blue? A USA fall foliage map based on September to November dates. All the apples ranked from tartest to sweetest. 25 tasty recipes for your next tailgate or football party. Which Halloween candy is most popular in your state? Five signs you may be eating too much sugar. Why choosing to travel is a good defense against aging. Clever and funny test answers. :) ___ If you’re looking for chic Halloween decor you can reuse year after year, I’ve added my favorites to this list !",
