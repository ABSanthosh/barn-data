  "text": "TikTok Sign in to your MUO account Nobody likes to watch ads, but it’s one of the ways social media platforms can make money off the service they provide. And, to make it easier to create new ad content that the platform will serve up to its users, TikTok introduced the Symphony Creative Studio AI video generation tool for all its advertisers. So, how will this new tool affect the average user? We’re Going to See Way More AI Generated Ads Because AI will make it much easier for advertisers to produce video content, you can expect your TikTok feed to be filed with AI-generated video in the coming months. The social media platforms claims that its AI video tool will allow anyone of its advertisers to generation video in minutes with minimal input, compared to the several hours and technical expertise needed to plan, shoot, and edit video advertisements in the past. Hopefully, though, we don’t just see AI-made videos that don’t make sense. After all, Symphony Creative Studio gives creators a digital avatar that will the video script, and it could even translate and dub voice overs into over 30+ languages. This will make it much easier for professionals to create high-quality video content, especially those that know their way around AI technologies. However, it would also make it easier for just about anyone to create AI ad videos on TikTok, which would run the risk of flooding the platform made by businesses and advertisers just for the sake of putting as many “creative” video content ads out there. This is one of the reasons why we think that generative AI shouldn’t be in any creative app or software, as it instead of being a tool that will be used to enhance creativity, instead, it will be turned into a mass-production machine that outputs tons of mediocre videos just designed for getting clicks. Furthermore, there’s also the issue of people being fooled, thinking that the video showing the product that the business is selling has been shot in real life, when, in fact, it’s been generated by AI. How to Know if a Video Is AI Generated While there’s nothing wrong with an AI-generated video per se, especially if it doesn’t claim to be a real video, you’d still want to know if it’s made by a human or a computer. Just like how you would want to check if you’re chatting with a real person or AI, you can spot if the video that you’re watching is AI-generated if you spot some inconsistencies with it. Some of these things include pixelation or blurriness in some parts of the video, especially where there shouldn’t be any. Furthermore, strange patterns and video artifacts will sometimes appear in AI-generated content. Unfortunately, it’s getting harder and harder everyday to figure out if you’re watching a real video or an AI-generated one, especially as AI models are getting more and more advanced—this is probably why AI video call scams are also on the rise. At the very least, we hope that TikTok would add a warning on every AI-generated video, just to ensure that viewer could determine if what they’re seeing is real or not.",

ways social media platforms can make money off the service they provide. And, to make it easier to create new ad content that the platform will serve up to its users, TikTok introduced the Symphony Creative Studio AI video generation tool for all its advertisers. So, how will this new tool affect the average user?\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"we-rsquo-re-going-to-see-way-more-ai-generated-ads\"\u003e\n                        We’re Going to See Way More AI Generated Ads\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause AI will make it much easier for advertisers to produce video content, you can expect your TikTok feed to be filed with AI-generated video in the coming months. The social media platforms claims that its AI video tool will allow anyone of its advertisers to generation video in minutes with minimal input, compared to the several hours and technical expertise needed to plan, shoot, and edit video advertisements in the past.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully, though, we don’t just see AI-made videos that don’t make sense. After all, Symphony Creative Studio gives creators a digital avatar that will the video script, and it could even translate and dub voice overs into over 30+ languages. This will make it much easier for professionals to create high-quality video content, especially those that know their way around AI technologies. However, it would also make it easier for just about anyone to create AI ad videos on TikTok, which would run the risk of flooding the platform made by businesses and advertisers just for the sake of putting as many “creative” video content ads out there.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of the reasons why we think that \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/why-generative-ai-not-needed-in-creative-apps/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egenerative AI shouldn’t be in any creative app\u003c/a\u003e or software, as it instead of being a tool that will be used to enhance creativity, instead, it will be turned into a mass-production machine that outputs tons of mediocre videos just designed for getting clicks. Furthermore, there’s also the issue of people being fooled, thinking that the video showing the product that the business is selling has been shot in real life, when, in fact, it’s been generated by AI.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"how-to-know-if-a-video-is-ai-generated\"\u003e\n                        How to Know if a Video Is AI Generated\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there’s nothing wrong with an AI-generated video per se, especially if it doesn’t claim to be a real video, you’d still want to know if it’s made by a human or a computer.

Furthermore, strange patterns and video artifacts will sometimes appear in AI-generated content.\u003c/p\u003e    \n    \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it’s getting harder and harder everyday to figure out if you’re watching a real video or an AI-generated one, especially as AI models are getting more and more advanced—this is probably why \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/how-ai-video-call-scams-work/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAI video call scams are also on the rise\u003c/a\u003e.
