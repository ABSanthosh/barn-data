It may not be as essential as Messages, Photos, or Mail, but you can still get plenty of use out of it, especially if you're a hiker, camper, or someone who enjoys outdoor adventures.One of the best features of the Compass app is that it works offline, relying on your device's GPS and magnetometer rather than cellular service. This means it's just as effective in remote areas as it is in urban settings. While navigating, you can also turn on Airplane Mode or Low Power Mode to conserve battery power. For added security, download offline maps in Apple Maps before heading out.Here's a breakdown of all the features in the Compass app, a simple yet powerful tool with everything you need on a single screen. (We're showing it off on iOS 18, but it will work similarly on older iOS versions.)Determine your direction in degreesThe Compass app displays your current direction and a precise degree reading, which you can use as an azimuth when navigating. Understanding your heading in degrees allows for more accurate travel, particularly in open spaces with scarce landmarks. It's also valuable for activities such as hiking, boating, stargazing, and drone piloting, where precise directional control is essential.If a trail map instructs you to follow a heading of 215 degrees, rotate your body until the Compass app displays that exact degree at the top. The app provides real-time adjustments as you move, helping you stay on course. In addition to keeping you oriented in unfamiliar terrain, this feature can help you determine your approximate location on a map by comparing your heading with identifiable landmarks in the distance.Hold your iPhone level for the most accurate readings so that the center crosshairs are correctly aligned. Since the Compass app relies on your magnetometer, nearby metal objects, electronics, and magnetic surfaces may cause temporary interference. Even environmental factors, such as underground minerals or power lines, can affect accuracy. If you suspect a disrupted reading, move to a different area and take another measurement. Navigate using cardinal and ordinal directionsOn the Compass app's face, cardinal directions (N, S, E, and W) are clearly labeled around the crosshairs. Knowing your basic direction can help keep you on a general navigation path where precise bearings are less necessary, such as when traveling on highways.North = 0ºSouth = 180ºEast = 90ºWest = 270ºThe Compass app also shows ordinal directions (NE, SE, SW, and NW). However, unlike cardinal directions, ordinal directions are not labeled directly on the compass face; instead, they appear next to the degree reading below it. Ordinal directions are helpful for fine-tuning navigation, especially in cross-country travel, where precise adjustments are needed.Northeast = 45° ± 22.5° (22.5° to 67.5°)Southeast = 135° ± 22.5° (112.5° to 157.5°)Southwest = 225° ± 22.5° (202.5° to 247.5°)Northwest = 315° ± 22.5° (292.5° to 337.5°) Lock your heading for steady navigationYou can lock your current heading by tapping the compass face. This is incredibly useful for staying on a specific trail or path, especially in areas with confusing terrain or multiple intersecting routes. It's also helpful for cross-country skiing, kayaking, and desert trekking, where visual landmarks may be limited. Once locked, a red arc appears when you move off course, visually guiding you back to your original direction. Choose between true north and magnetic northThe Compass app allows you to switch between true north, which aligns with Earth's geographic north pole, and magnetic north, which shifts due to changes in Earth's magnetic field and varies based on location.When to use true north: When navigating with a topographic map or a GPS device, these tools align with the Earth's actual geography, not the shifting magnetic field. True north is ideal for hikers, backpackers, and surveyors who rely on precise mapping.When to use magnetic north: When using a traditional compass, since most physical compasses point to magnetic north by default. Older maps and some navigation techniques (such as orienteering) assume the use of magnetic north.To set your preference, go to Settings » Apps » Compass. Then, toggle the Use True North switch on or off. If you're using true north, also ensure Compass Calibration is enabled in Settings » Privacy \u0026 Security » Location Services » System Services. Access and share your precise coordinatesYour current latitude and longitude are displayed at the bottom of the app. These are geographic coordinates that define your exact position on Earth. Latitude measures how far north or south you are from the equator, ranging from zero degrees at the equator to 90 degrees at the poles. Longitude measures how far east or west you are from the prime meridian, which runs through Greenwich, England.For more accurate results, ensure Precise Location is enabled in Settings » Privacy \u0026 Security » Location Services » Compass.On the compass, tap the coordinates to open your exact location in Apple Maps. This is useful if you need navigation assistance. (Note that you can just open the Maps app by itself to see your current location, too.)Tap and hold the coordinates to find the Copy and Speak options. Copy adds the coordinates to your iPhone's clipboard, and you can paste them wherever you need to share them, while Speak reads them out loud. If you get lost, you can share your copied coordinates with emergency responders.The name of your current location is displayed underneath, which can be helpful when identifying waypoints or sharing your location with others. Track your elevation for smarter hikingThe Compass app also displays your altitude above sea level, which is particularly valuable for outdoor enthusiasts exploring mountainous terrain or high-altitude environments. The elevation reading comes from the iPhone's barometric altimeter, which detects atmospheric pressure changes to estimate altitude. However, accuracy can fluctuate due to weather conditions, so cross-check with a dedicated altimeter if necessary.Tracking elevation helps assess the difficulty of a trail, measure progress, and plan breaks to avoid altitude sickness. If you're on a challenging hike, knowing your cumulative elevation gain can help you manage energy levels and anticipate difficult sections of the trail. And higher elevations often bring colder temperatures, lower oxygen levels, and unpredictable weather conditions; keeping track of your altitude can help you prepare for these changes. Level furniture and other objectsYour iPhone has an app called Measure that comes with a built-in level feature for leveling furniture, picture frames, and other objects. This level used to be part of the Compass app before iOS 12 when it moved to Measure, but the crosshairs on the compass face can still help you level a tabletop or other flat surface in a pinch, especially if the Measure app is on the fritz. Get more out of Compass with Apple WatchIf you have an Apple Watch, the Compass app can enhance your navigation with additional tools, including waypoints, elevation alerts, and backtracking.Waypoints and elevation tracking: You can create waypoints for important locations, such as a parked car or a trailhead, and track their elevation relative to your current position.Backtrack feature: If you become disoriented, use Backtrack (which relies on GPS) to retrace your steps and return to where you started.Cellular waypoints: Your Apple Watch automatically marks the last place where you had a cellular signal or were able to make an emergency SOS call, which can be helpful if you get lost.Target elevation alerts: Set an elevation limit to receive alerts when you ascend past a designated altitude, which will help you acclimate properly.Multiple compass views: Use the Digital Crown to switch between different compass views, including a heading-focused arrow or a waypoint grid for better spatial awareness.You can customize Compass settings on Apple Watch by going to Settings » Compass. You can adjust options like Use True North, Backtrack in Workout, and Grid System (DMS, Decimal Degrees, MGRS/USNG, UTM) here. Note that the Use True North setting syncs between your iPhone and Apple Watch, so changing it on one device will change it on the other.Buy on Amazon: Apple Watch Series 10, Jet Black, Ink Sport Loop, $329 Final thoughtsWhile it may not seem as exciting as other iPhone apps, the Compass app is packed with valuable navigation, hiking, and emergency preparedness features. Whether deep in the backcountry or just trying to stay oriented in a new city, knowing how to utilize this tool fully can make a huge difference.With these tips, you can unlock the full potential of the Compass app — ensuring that you always know where you are and where you're headed.Don't Miss: 20 Hidden Calculator Tricks for Your iPhoneCover photo and screenshots by Gadget Hacks.",
