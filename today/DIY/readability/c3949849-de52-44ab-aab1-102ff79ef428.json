All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterSwapping out fixtures and hardware in your bathroom are simple upgrades that make a big difference, but when you want a more dramatic makeover, well, you do more. Sage Phillips (@sagephillipshome) did just that when she recently renovated her home’s bathroom to make it feel more modern. “The bathroom had outdated orange tile, which gave it a bold, retro look,” Sage says. Sage wanted to give the bathroom a bit of a glow-up before listing her home for sale. “The overall look felt mismatched with more modern design preferences, and it lacked [a] fresh, updated aesthetic.” she adds.A new toilet and shower begin the transformation.“Updating the tile and installing a new modern toilet made the biggest difference,” Sage says. But before bringing in the new, Sage ripped out the old tile, toilet, and fixtures to give herself a blank slate. It was her first time taking out a commode, but she says it was simple: “Removing the toilet was waaaay easier than I thought!”With that out of the way, it was on to the design aspects, and Sage didn’t have to overspend to get great results. “We found affordable white textured tiles that gave the bathroom a modern and clean look,” she says. She also updated the shower with gold fixtures to add some contrast to the white tile. While she took over the toilet project on her own, Sage called in the pros for other work. “For more technical tasks like plumbing or tiling, it’s best to leave it to the professionals to avoid costly mistakes,” she says.Modern details (and DIY skills) give the room new life.But Sage did a good amount of work without professional help to save money on the $4,500 project. “I DIYd the shiplap feature wall, which really added some character to this space!” she says. After installing the shiplap behind the toilet and painting it with Sherwin-Williams’ Jogging Path, Sage says she’s most proud of this project and, specifically, “the pop of greige” in the room. “It adds a unique, personal touch to the space and elevates the overall design,” she says. “It was a small detail that made a big impact.”Plus, the shiplap perfectly complements the white tile. “The white textured tile gives it a clean, timeless look, while the greige shiplap adds warmth and personality,” Sage says. “It’s the perfect balance between cozy and contemporary.”Sage also painted the walls with Benjamin Moore’s White Dove and installed a new, lighter wood vanity with black pulls and a gold faucet. “Installing hardware, like towel bars and drawer pulls, was a quick win that I realized I could easily handle myself,” Sage says.The final design creates a calming space.Although the bathroom’s layout didn’t change drastically, Sage says the updated toilet and fixtures help make the room feel “more open and organized” than it was before. “Everything has its place, and it’s much easier to keep clean,” she adds. To stay calm during the renovation, Sage planned ahead. “Keep track of your timeline, materials, and budget in one place,” she says. Sage also didn’t rush the process, saying she “[took] time to ensure the elements [she] pick[ed] are both practical and visually appealing.”This balance of “style with functionality” helped Sage get her final result. “The new space makes me feel relaxed and refreshed,” Sage says. “It has a spa-like vibe that’s both calming and inviting, which makes starting and ending the day in this bathroom a joy.” She also believes that refreshing this “key space” also added value to her family’s home ahead of listing it for sale.",
