  "text": "Amazon Prime Sign in to your MUO account If you currently subscribe to Prime Video, you’ll have access to Apple TV+ beginning later this month. Today, Amazon officially announced it’s bringing Apple TV+ to Prime Video. Amazon indicates the Apple TV+ service will be a $10 add-on, and will offer all your favorite Apple TV+ premium content. That means before October ends, you’ll be able to watch shows like Ted Lasso, CODA, Hijack, and Palm Royale, from within Amazon Prime. It’s unclear where that leaves current Apple TV+ subscribers, however. Still, the TV+ service is worth considering for a myriad of reasons. Apple and Amazon Team Up Diego Thomazini/Shutterstock “We want to make Apple TV+ and its award-winning library of series and films from the world’s greatest storytellers available to as many viewers as possible,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President, “We’re thrilled that Prime Video will now offer Apple TV+, giving viewers an incredible breadth of viewing options.” If you own a Fire TV or Fire tablet device, the ability to watch Apple TV+ is nothing new. If not, then your access to Apple’s video service has been limited. Its inclusion in Prime Video changes that. From an outsider’s perspective, however, it seems the addition is just another step in Amazon’s diabolical plan to monopolize the entertainment universe. According to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon’s Prime Video platform has an estimated monthly viewership of around 200 million. Apple TV+ Joins Over 100 Other Subscription Services Proxima Studio / Shutterstock Amazon already also offers a barrage of fee-based movies, television shows, and live sporting events. Earlier this year, it introduced an additional tier to Prime Video that included ads by default, unless you were willing to pay an extra $3 a month. Amazon’s announcement means Apple TV+ is now just another arrow in the quiver of over 100 add-on subscriptions that are available to buy on Prime Video. Overall, if you’re a die-hard Apple TV fan who is looking for more ways to enjoy your favorite shows, then this news is likely positive. It means you’ll be able to save yourself a few clicks to get to your preferred programming. Additionally, if you're looking for some great free Apple TV and Apple TV+ content, we've got you covered with a list of the best free content on Apple TV+. But, if you’re not a current Prime Video subscriber, then I wouldn’t sign up just to get to Apple TV+. It’s significantly cheaper to simply purchase an Apple TV device, and subscribe to the service on its own.",
