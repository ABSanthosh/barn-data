All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Ariana ErvinThere are some super-tiny bathrooms in this world that take some true fixture-Tetris to arrange — and so there are, of course, some super-tiny bathroom sinks in this world made to fit those bathrooms. Personally, the smallest sink I come in contact with regularly is in the restaurant Lobo in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. It’s about 8 inches wide, and every time I wash my hands there I think about how adorably tiny it is — but it gets the job done. Another perfectly tiny bathroom sink I think about a lot is the one in Ariana Ervin and her wife, Lucy’s, bathroom, previously shared on Apartment Therapy. Equally as practical, it manages to sneak a bit of storage into the bathroom, saves on square footage, and doesn’t sacrifice floor space because it’s wall-mounted.When Ariana and Lucy were renovating their bathroom, they needed to find a sink that would fit between the wall and the door frame. “I looked for months for a sink vanity combo that would fit in a 12-inch space, which is the space from the wall to the start of the door, and couldn’t find anything,” Ariana says. “We ended up repurposing an IKEA cabinet, sanding and staining a piece of reclaimed redwood, and buying the sink and faucet separately.” That’s right — an IKEA IVAR creates the base of this floating vanity, and it tucks snugly into the corner of the bathroom and takes up less floor space than the vanity from before, making the entire space feel larger, Ariana adds.",
