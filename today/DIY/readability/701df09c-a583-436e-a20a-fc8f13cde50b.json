  "text": "With AI image generation tools getting more powerful at a rapid pace, it's getting pretty tough to differentiate which images are real and which used artificial intelligence to enhance them. In response, some companies have added ways for people to identify when an AI model has either generated or edited an image. Now, Google has added a new feature to the Photos app that reads an image's metadata and lets you know if it has been enhanced by AI in the past. As announced on Google's blog The Keyword, the Photos app will now let you know if an image's metadata contains any information about AI usage: Photos edited with tools like Magic Editor, Magic Eraser and Zoom Enhance already include metadata based on technical standards from The International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) to indicate that they’ve been edited using generative AI. Now we’re taking it a step further, making this information visible alongside information like the file name, location and backup status in the Photos app. When looking at an image's details in Google Photos, the app will let you know at the bottom of the panel if someone edited it using AI. It'll also let you know which tools were used to edit the image, including those that don't use AI such as Best Take on Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 and Add Me on Pixel 9. This new feature seems limited to images edited through Google Photos which haven't had their metadata changed to remove all traces of AI editing. As such, it's not designed to help you spot AI generated images online; it's more to let you know which images in your album were digitally enhanced and which weren't.",
