Then tap or click the Edit button. You'll see a new tab for Clean Up. Tap or click that.If it's your first time using Clean Up, Photos must download the tool first. When it's ready, it will instruct you to tap (or click), brush, or circle what you want to remove and replace. If Clean Up recognizes people or objects it thinks you'll want to get rid of, it will highlight those elements in the image with fluorescent colors. If it's correct, tap each highlighted element to make them disappear.You can pinch the screen or trackpad with your fingers to pan and zoom around to see things better and be more precise with your edits.Clean Up works rather well when the elements are among a relatively open space without complex objects or scenery around them. But if it's close to any complicated lines and shading in the image, Clean Up may have difficulty filling things in where the person or object was.If Clean Up doesn't automatically highlight everything you want to erase, simply circle the remaining elements or use the brush to make them disappear using your finger, mouse, or Apple Pencil.In Photos on macOS, you change your brush size to make the width of your brushstroke smaller for more fine-tuned edits or larger for bigger areas.If you need to make changes or want a better result, use the undo button and try again. However, if you want to start from scratch, tap or click the Reset or Reset Clean Up button to wipe the slate clean. It only removes Clean Up edits, not any other edits you've made on the image.Tap or click Done to save the image. Obscuring people's faces in photosClean Up also comes equipped with a hidden face blur tool. To use it, just circle or brush lines over a person's face and let go. If Clean Up interprets you correctly, the facial features should pixelate using the safety filter (and an \"Identity protection applied\" or \"Safety filter applied\" alert will appear if successful), adding a quick layer of privacy to protect and safeguard the person's identity.Complete Guide: How to Quickly Pixelate Faces in Photos on Your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to Blur Out People's IdentitiesDon't Miss: How to Easily Record Phone Calls on Your iPhone and Get Auto-Generated Transcripts and SummariesCover photo and screenshots by Gadget Hacks.",
