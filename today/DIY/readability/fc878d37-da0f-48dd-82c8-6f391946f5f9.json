This space-saving tree is exactly the kind of clever solution we at IKEAhackers love. While nothing quite matches the magic of a traditional live tree, the VINTERFINT offers a chic alternative for those with tight spaces. As homes shrink and urban living spaces become more compact, the traditional Christmas tree is increasingly becoming a luxury many can’t afford – both in terms of space and cost.The VINTERFINT is an accordion-like alternative Christmas tree crafted from pine, complete with knobs for instant ornament hanging. It’s IKEA’s nod to those who love the holiday spirit but can’t spare the square footage. Space-Saving Spruce Solution VINTERFINT Wall decoration | Photo Credit: IKEA.com The brainchild of designer Mikael Axelsson, the VINTERFINT wall decoration mimics the silhouette of a traditional Christmas tree integrated with a flexible construction. This allows users to pull it horizontally to their desired width, making it adaptable to various wall spaces. As Axelsson explains, “It can be tricky to fit a traditional Christmas tree, especially if you live in a small space. That’s why I decided to create an alternative.”Early adopters are singing praises for the VINTERFINT. One user commented, “We can’t have a traditional tree (real or fake) due to an asthmatic in the house. This is the perfect way to have a tree without the asthma flare-up.”Another user highlighted its versatility: “One of the things I like about it: you can choose how wide to extend it. If you have a particularly narrow space, just don’t extend it all the way (note: this will make the tree taller, too).”The product’s construction and ease of use have also been noted. “It’s robust but not too heavy. No assembly needed!” exclaimed one satisfied customer. Pre-Holiday Prep VINTERFINT Wall decoration | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Users can easily hang it on their walls with minimal hardware, as it is lightweight and requires no assembly. The ornament hooks are both large and sturdy, allowing for various decorations, from traditional ornaments to strings of lights.The wall decoration is designed to hold up to 20 pounds (10 kg) of weight, which is ample for most ornaments and light decorations. True to our IKEA hacking style, we immediately thought of ways to hack it. Explore these ideas to personalize the VINTERFINT tree further: Painting the pine with a custom color scheme Using fabric or ribbon to create a garland effect Spraying on expanding foam to give the tree an organic shape Attaching faux Christmas branches to the frame if you want a wall-mounted artificial Christmas tree Kick Off With Advent VINTERFINT Wall decoration | Photo Credit: IKEA.com Another creative way to maximize the use of the VINTERFINT is to transform it into an advent calendar. Here’s how you can milk the most out of your wall decoration: Hang up 24 numbered gift boxes or bags filled with small treats. Arrange them across the VINTERFINT’s branches, interspersed with festive decor. Each day in December leading up to Christmas, family members can take turns removing a treat. As treats are removed, you can replace them with ornaments, creating a gradual transformation from an advent calendar to a fully decorated tree. Easy Post-Holiday Clean-Up What we like most about this alternative Christmas tree is the post-holiday clean-up. After the last ornament is packed away, the wall decoration can be collapsed into a slim profile, ready to be tucked away until next season. Unlike faux Christmas trees, you don’t need to deal with tree box storage issues. Or in the case of real trees, disposal and, vacuuming endless pine needles.Alternatively, the VINTERFINT wall decor can be repurposed as a display for jewelry, a unique photo holder, or even a quirky kids art organizer. Available Online and Instore Whether you’re tight on space, or simply looking for a unique holiday decoration, the VINTERFINT wall decoration offers a fresh take on the classic Christmas tree. It not only enhances your festive decor but can also be repurposed throughout the year for various displays. Now available at IKEA stores, it’s worth adding to your festive shopping cart as you prepare for the holidays and the new year ahead.",
