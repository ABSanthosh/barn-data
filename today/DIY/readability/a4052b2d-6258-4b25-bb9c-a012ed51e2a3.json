  "text": "Apple is reaching across the aisle and making some of the best parts of its ecosystem available to Android users. An Apple TV app, along with the Apple TV+ subscription streaming service, is now available to download. Unlocking Apple TV+ Content on Android You could previously download an Apple TV app for just Google TV, but the new app supports a wide variety of Android devices, including phones and tablets. The Android app will offer a number of popular features found on the Apple version. You will be able to download content for viewing offline, save watchlists, and use the continue watching option that will sync across devices. That will work even if you use the app on both Android and Apple devices. With the Android app, you will also be able to see when new TV episodes or seasons arrive. The Apple TV+ approach to offline downloads gives it a big advantage over competitors. An Apple TV+ subscription is available for $9.99 per month. Google fans can subscribe to Apple TV+ and add-ons like MLS Season Pass with Google Play billing instead of having to create an Apple account. Friday Night Baseball will be available to Apple TV+ subscribers on Android as well. Instead of quantity, Apple TV+ has focused on quality since its launch with popular shows like Silo, Ted Lasso, and Shrinking. The hugely popular Severance is also in the middle of its second season on the platform. Making Apple TV+ Available for More Potential Subscribers Apple doesn’t mind offering apps to Android users, especially when it draws in more subscribers. The company has previously released an Apple Music and Apple Music Classical app for Android subscribers. The Apple TV app and Apple TV+ service have been available on a wide variety of non-Apple devices, like smart TVs. But adding a full-featured Android app to access both will definitely help more people try out the streaming service. Apple isn’t trying to give a peace offering to Android fans; it just wants to increase its bottom line.",
