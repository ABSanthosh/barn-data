  "text": "Hello all and Happy February to you. I’m at home today watching the Superbowl and catching up on some little projects around the house. Now that the nest is empty, it’s quiet and clean but still has those cozy touches and that feeling of comfort. I’ve been lighting a favorite candle in the evening and keeping warm in our cozy study with the electric fireplace that gives me just the right amount of heat and ambiance. It’s my favorite room in winter. I hope you’re staying cozy too, spring will be here soon. Favorite links from the week: This home has a beautiful mix of white and warm tones (don’t miss the uniquely accessed wine cellar). This elegant and spacious home in Sonoma is layered in lovely patterns and hues. Great examples on display: using dark tones to create contrast in this well decorated home. Very chic: the pencil stacked tile in both of these bathrooms. (More tile examples here). How to wash pillows. Lots of tile inspiration here. Winter soups you can make with a rotisserie chicken. When you want to watch a certain genre, don’t forget about the Netflix codes. I was very invested in his first day ! Need a weekend getaway? 16 cute small towns in the USA. How not to be an “ugly tourist”.",
