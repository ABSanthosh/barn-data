  "text": "Spotify Sign in to your MUO account Quick Links I'm obsessed with music. While most of what I listen to comes from playlists I've created myself, the rest comes from Spotify-generated playlists. If you haven’t explored them yet, here are four I’d recommend checking out. 1 Discover Weekly Whether you're trying to diversify your music palette to avoid a disappointing Spotify Wrapped at the end of the year or simply tired of listening to the same tracks daily, the Discover Weekly playlist is a great way to shake things up. The playlist is updated every Monday with thirty fresh tracks and helps you discover new music that aligns with your taste. The tracks you'll find in Discover Weekly are based on your streaming habits and behavior, including how you interact with songs you like and dislike. For example, if you like a track or add it to one of your personalized playlists, similar tracks will show up in your Discover Weekly. On the other hand, if you often skip a song, you're less likely to encounter it. Spotify also considers the listening habits of users who share a similar taste in music when recommending songs to you. If you're disappointed with your Discover Weekly, interact with your playlist to guide the algorithm and Spotify’s recommendation system. You can skip a track or tap the horizontal three dots next to it, then select Hide song from the menu. Likewise, liking or saving tracks you enjoy will help Spotify recommend similar music in the future! 2 Release Radar Discover Weekly is a great way to find music that suits your taste, including both old and new releases. However, if you're looking to catch only new music before it goes viral, Release Radar is the playlist you're after. It features thirty new releases and is updated every Friday. Like Discover Weekly, this playlist is influenced by your listening habits, but you'll primarily get new music from artists you follow, listen to, and other artists Spotify’s algorithm thinks you'll enjoy. You won’t find any tracks you've already listened to in your Release Radar, and you’ll only find one song per artist per week. The tracks are ordered in a specific way, influenced by how much Spotify thinks you’ll enjoy them based on your listening history and factors like the release date of a particular track. Other than a few minor differences, the order of your Release Radar will stay pretty consistent each week. 3 Repeat Rewind We all have those few tracks we obsessively listen to for days on end, only to forget about them eventually. Most of the time, you'll rediscover them months later and be hit with overwhelming nostalgia. The Repeat Rewind playlist helps ensure you don’t forget the tracks you loved for too long. Updated every five days, it includes thirty tracks you obsessively listened to about a month ago. The order of tracks in the playlist doesn’t necessarily reflect how many times you’ve played each one. 4 On Repeat I’d be lying if I said I don’t find myself skipping tracks in my playlist to listen to those few songs I've been obsessed with. One option to avoid this is to create a playlist of your favorite tracks. Thankfully, Spotify saves the hassle of making one and has another personalized playlist called On Repeat. This playlist includes thirty songs you can't get enough of and have been listening to non-stop over the past thirty days, updating every five days. You can find all the playlists I’ve mentioned above by searching for them by name in your browser and clicking the first Spotify link that appears. Alternatively, you can find them on Spotify’s app by switching to the Search tab at the bottom and tapping Made For You under the Browse all header. Both Repeat Rewind and On Repeat are under the Uniquely yours heading. If you scroll all the way down, you'll find Discover Weekly and Release Radar under Discover New Music. Regardless of which playlist you check out, if you find tracks you enjoy, make sure to save them to your Liked Songs or add them to your playlists. Since these playlists auto-update, you won’t be able to get the exact same playlist back once it’s updated, so you'll lose those tracks otherwise!",

Other than a few minor differences, the order of your Release Radar will stay pretty consistent each week.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"repeat-rewind\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Repeat Rewind\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                            \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"2726\" height=\"1556\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Repeat Rewind Spotify playlist\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png\" src=\"https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/repeat-rewind-spotify-playlist.png\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e We all have those few tracks we obsessively listen to for days on end, only to forget about them eventually.
