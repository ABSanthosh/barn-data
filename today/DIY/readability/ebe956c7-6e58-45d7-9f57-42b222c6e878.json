  "text": "iPhone Sign in to your MUO account The Google app for the iPhone is getting a little less useful. Google has removed access to Gemini AI from that app. Google Is Asking Users to Download the Gemini App Google recently emailed users noting the change. Instead of the Google app, the company is asking users to download the standalone, free Gemini app on the iOS App Store. If you try to access Gemini through the main Google app, you’ll see a message saying “Gemini is no longer available in the Google app.” You’ll also see download links for the Gemini app. Using the standalone Gemini app on the iPhone, which officially landed in November 2024, you can tap a wide variety of features. Some of those include the ability to interact with Gemini using text, a voice conversation, or with the camera. You can also connect Gemini with other Google apps like Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Home. Compared to many other chatbots, Gemini continues to be underrated, and there are a number of reasons why you should try it out. One of my favorite ways to use the Gemini app on my iPhone is Gemini Live. My daughter recently used the app to prepare for a job interview. She asked Gemini to run through the top 10 most common interview questions. Gemini Live even gave feedback on her answers. While you can access Gemini for free, you can also subscribe to Gemini Advanced directly through the app for $19.99 monthly. Along with access to the most capable AI models, you will also receive priority access to new features. That Google One Plan offers Gemini in other Google apps like Gmail along with 2TB of storage. Will the Confusing Decision Pay Off? It’s an interesting and somewhat confusing choice for Google to remove access from its flagship iOS app. Many of the people who use Gemini from the Google app might not go through the trouble of downloading yet another app. But Google is likely wanting to quickly add features to Gemini with a dedicated app. It’s also easier to draw in subscribers with a standalone app. While I made the move to the Gemini app for my iPhone when it was released, some users could be left in the dust by Google. And in today’s competitive AI landscape, that’s a confounding choice.",
