  "text": "Adobe Photoshop Sign in to your MUO account While there are plenty of ways to create and edit images using AI, I'd argue that removing undesirable elements is its most useful application. It saves you a ton of time and allows people who struggle with image editing to perform advanced techniques with very little intervention. Now, Adobe has revealed a new AI tool that can remove pesky reflections from your photos. As announced on the Adobe Blog, the Camera Raw tool is getting a new AI-powered tool to remove reflections from your photos. If you've taken a photo of something through a window and you want to get rid of any reflections spoiling your image, you can use this tool to automatically scrub away unwanted parts, leaving the photo subject clear and pristine. Adobe breaks down how this technology works in its blog, and it's pretty fascinating. The AI tool is trained to recognize an image with a reflection as two separate images: the photo subject and the scene reflected off the glass. By separating these two images, the AI could generate what the original subject would look like without reflections and what the reflected scene looked like. It works so well that Adobe is thinking of making more removal tools like it: We'd also like to extend our tool to the removal of dust, scratches, rain, snow, or other things that land on windows (bugs on windshields?) To use this tool, open a raw photo in an Adobe image editing app like Photoshop, then activate the Camera Raw extension. If this is the first time you've heard of this tool, check out how to work with Camera Raw so you know how to work it. Go to the Technology Previews section in Preferences, enable the New AI Settings and Features panel, then restart the app. Import a photo, go to the Remove panel, access the Distraction Removal section, and check the box labeled \"Reflections.\" It should now scrub your image of reflections.",
