  "text": "Amazon Fire TV Sign in to your MUO account While most streaming devices and televisions have accessibility features to assist those with hearing or vision loss, it can be an isolating experience when these individualized settings require you to watch movies alone. To foster more inclusion, Amazon has added a dual output feature to its newest Fire TV models, so people with and without hearing aids can engage simultaneously. Amazon Fire TVs Now Have Dual Audio With most Fire TVs, you can connect hearing aids, thanks to what's known as the Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids (ASHA) protocol. Essentially, this technology allows you to stream sound from an Amazon smart TV directly to your implant. While this feature has certainly been transformative, it typically means watching content alone. Now, a new feature called Dual Audio is \"making the streaming experience on Fire TV more communal,\" according to an Amazon blog post. Starting its roll-out today, Dual Audio will let you listen in two different ways at once: while one person can experience the audio through a hearing aid, another can listen through the speakers. With its two simultaneous outputs, everyone can watch content together—regardless of hearing. If your television is part of the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series, then you should see a software update in the \"coming weeks\" that will support this feature. How to Set Up Dual Audio To enable Dual Audio, you should navigate to your Fire TV's Accessibility settings: Go to Settings \u003e Accessibility. If you have an updated Omni Mini-LED TV, then you should see an option to turn on Dual Audio. The setting will walk you through pairing a hearing aid. If your television is not part of the Omni Mini-LED series, it may still be ASHA-enabled—meaning you can connect a hearing aid, but you just won't have the Dual Audio function. You can find the option to Add Hearing Aids in the same Accessibility menu. According to Amazon, the following devices are ASHA-enabled: Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV 2-Series, and Fire TV Omni Series. It's All About Access Alongside Dual Audio, Amazon is expanding Fire TV's accessibility in other ways. According to the company's announcement, more hearing aids will be compatible with the ASHA protocol, including \"all Widex Moment behind-the-ear (BTE) and receiver-in-canal (RIC)\" devices. The company is also adding raised dots to its start guides to be more inclusive of those who are visually impaired. These tactile markings guide users to a QR code, which will contain the most updated set-up information, including how to enable accessibility features. Over the years, new audio technology has made it a lot easier for those with hearing loss to interact with the world, from OTC hearing aids to Apple's AirPods Pro 2 that double as hearing aids. Televisions introducing ASHA support is yet another example of technology fostering inclusion. That said, an ASHA-enabled television can't be completely inclusive if someone with a hearing aid still has to be alone to watch. It seems so simple, but this output setting could go a long way when it comes to shared watch parties, premieres, and binge sessions.",

those with hearing or vision loss, it can be an isolating experience when these individualized settings require you to watch movies alone. To foster more inclusion, Amazon has added a dual output feature to its newest Fire TV models, so people with and without hearing aids can engage simultaneously. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"amazon-fire-tvs-now-have-dual-audio\"\u003e Amazon Fire TVs Now Have Dual Audio \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith most Fire TVs, you can connect hearing aids, thanks to what\u0026#39;s known as the Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids (ASHA) protocol. Essentially, this technology allows you to stream sound from an Amazon smart TV directly to your implant. While this feature has certainly been transformative, it typically means watching content alone. Now, a new feature called Dual Audio is \u0026#34;making the streaming experience on Fire TV more communal,\u0026#34; according to an \u003ca href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-fire-tv-accessibility-asha-dual-audio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon blog post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStarting its roll-out today, Dual Audio will let you listen in two different ways at once: while one person can experience the audio through a hearing aid, another can listen through the speakers. With its two simultaneous outputs, everyone can watch content together—regardless of hearing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your television is part of the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series, then you should see a software update in the \u0026#34;coming weeks\u0026#34; that will support this feature. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-set-up-dual-audio\"\u003e How to Set Up Dual Audio \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo enable Dual Audio, you should navigate to your Fire TV\u0026#39;s Accessibility settings:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e Go to \u003cstrong\u003eSettings\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026gt; \u003cstrong\u003eAccessibility\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e If you have an updated Omni Mini-LED TV, then you should see an option to turn on \u003cstrong\u003eDual Audio\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e The setting will walk you through pairing a hearing aid. \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your television is not part of the Omni Mini-LED series, it may still be ASHA-enabled—meaning you can connect a hearing aid, but you just won\u0026#39;t have the Dual Audio function. You can find the option to \u003cstrong\u003eAdd Hearing Aids\u003c/strong\u003e in the same Accessibility menu. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"custom_block_11\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Amazon, the following devices are ASHA-enabled: Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series, Fire TV Omni QLED Series, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV 4-Series, Fire TV 2-Series, and Fire TV Omni Series. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"it-39-s-all-about-access\"\u003e It\u0026#39;s All About Access \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside Dual Audio, Amazon is expanding Fire TV\u0026#39;s accessibility in other ways. According to the company\u0026#39;s announcement, more hearing aids will be compatible with the ASHA protocol, including \u0026#34;all Widex Moment behind-the-ear (BTE) and receiver-in-canal (RIC)\u0026#34; devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe company is also adding raised dots to its start guides to be more inclusive of those who are visually impaired. These tactile markings guide users to a QR code, which will contain the most updated set-up information, including how to enable accessibility features. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years, new audio technology has made it a lot easier for those with hearing loss to interact with the world, from \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/otc-hearing-aids-everything-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOTC hearing aids\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/airpods-can-act-as-hearing-aids-but-theres-a-catch/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u0026#39;s AirPods Pro 2 that double as hearing aids\u003c/a\u003e.
