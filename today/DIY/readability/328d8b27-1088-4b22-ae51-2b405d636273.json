Whether you put down a refundable preorder “just in case” or you’re determined to hunt down a unit during the launch window, it’s make-your-mind-up time. While buying an original Switch at launch was a bit of a gamble given Nintendo’s missteps with the Wii U, the Switch 2 has a bit more momentum behind it. Even so, there are some pros and cons that prospective buyers should be aware of. 2 Reasons to Buy a Switch 2 Right Now Looking for a good reason to justify your purchase at launch? Here are a few. The Switch 2 Isn’t Getting Cheaper Any Time Soon Is it a matter of when and not if you’ll be buying a Switch 2? Consider for a moment that Nintendo’s follow-up won’t be getting any cheaper, any time soon. So if you’re going to buy a Switch 2 in the next few years, you’re probably going to pay the same $449 that you would at launch. In fact, it’s not out of the question that the Switch 2 could get more expensive. Both Microsoft and Sony have raised prices for their Xbox Series and PlayStation 5 consoles, years out from their initial launch. We live in economically uncertain times, so it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that Nintendo will consider doing the same. Nintendo has noted that the $500 Mario Kart World bundle is a “limited-time production” expected to last through “Fall 2025.” Purchased separately, the $80 flagship title would push the price up to $529. There’s a Strong Lineup of Launch Titles The original Nintendo Switch launched with 10 games. Nintendo’s disappointing Wii U era had caused many third-party publishers to step back, and many were hesitant to commit. While Breath of the Wild was the headline-grabber, Nintendo also scored a win with smaller titles like Snipperclips. In the weeks and months that followed, Nintendo strengthened the Switch lineup with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Splatoon 2, while indie darlings like Shovel Knight and The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth set the scene for what the Switch would eventually become. The Switch 2 is launching with 25 games (if you count the Switch 2 editions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom), with the tentpole release being Mario Kart World. Considering Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was the best-selling game last time around, this seems like a solid strategy. In addition, third parties are here in droves with games like Cyberpunk 2077, Civilization VII, and Split Fiction launching on day one. Perhaps one of the most exciting releases is Deltarune, Toby Fox’s follow-up to Undertale which includes chapters three and four (with future chapters coming as free updates as they are released). I’m also excited about the F-Zero-esque Fast Fusion (the follow-up to Fast RMX). Mario Kart World Systems Released June 5, 2025 ESRB Everyone // Mild Fantasy Violence, Users Interact Developer(s) Nintendo Publisher(s) Nintendo Multiplayer Local Multiplayer, Online Multiplayer GameCube fans will be delighted with the launch of a GameCube emulator as part of the Nintendo Classics program. As long as you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription with the Expansion Pass, you’ll be able to play The Wind Waker HD, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX on day one. More games including Super Mario Sunshine and Luigi’s Mansion have also been confirmed as post-launch additions. The launch window looks strong, with Donkey Kong Bananza arriving on July 17, Pokémon Legends: Z-A coming on October 16, and games like Kirby Air Riders, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and a Switch 2 release of Elden Ring penciled in for “2025.” Donkey Kong Bananza Systems Released July 17, 2025 ESRB Everyone 10+ // Fantasy Violence Developer(s) Nintendo Publisher(s) Nintendo Number of Players Single-player Enhanced Versions of Older Games Are Tempting If you skipped the Switch or were underwhelmed by the console’s lack of power, you’ll be delighted to hear that you can play some of the platform’s best games with Switch 2 enhancements. This includes higher-resolution graphics and higher or more consistent frame rates. The heavy hitters are Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, arguably two of the best games ever made. If I could erase my knowledge of these games and experience them anew on superior hardware, I’d do it in a heartbeat. If you already own these titles you can upgrade for $10, or buy the Switch 2 editions outright (the upgrade is free if you have the Expansion Pack tier of Nintendo Switch Online too). Some games are getting free updates aimed at adding visual enhancements and HDR support. This includes Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Super Mario Odyssey, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, and Link’s Awakening. Many of Your Switch Games and Accessories Will Work According to Nintendo’s own Switch compatibility tracker, the vast majority of Switch 1 games will work on the Switch 2. This includes almost all Nintendo games and more than 60% of third-party titles with roughly 30% of third-party games being marked as playable with small issues in some parts of the game. It also includes most (but not all) accessories. Related There is a small list of games that don’t work on the Switch 2, though software updates from developers will likely remedy many of these issues. The reason for this is Nintendo’s hybrid software emulator approach to Switch 2 compatibility, which Nintendo confirmed is “somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility.” The good news here is that if you’re thinking of trading in your original Switch to offset the cost of a Switch 2, you can do it safely in the knowledge that most of your library will work (just be sure to transfer your saves to the new console before you sell it). Alternatively, maybe you’ve got someone in your life who would really appreciate that original Switch. You’re a Massive Nintendo Fan Let’s be real: some people just really like Nintendo stuff. It’s hard to argue against this given the relatively high quality of Nintendo’s software, with the Switch routinely punching well above its weight in terms of game quality relative to the power of the hardware. If you absolutely love Nintendo’s attention to detail, colorful worlds, creative characters, and style of games then the Switch 2 seems like a no-brainer. Source: Nintendo 1 Reasons to Think Twice About Buying a Switch 2 While it can be easy to get swept up in the hype and excitement of a new console launch, there may be some good reasons to wait this one out. Eventually, Nintendo Will Revise the Switch 2 Hardware Many were disappointed to learn that the Switch 2 used older LCD technology for its display, rather than OLED. Since Nintendo already produced an OLED version of the original Switch, some took it for granted that the new console would feature a superior display. The Switch 2 ships with an HDR LCD display that will in all likelihood still be better than the OLED Switch, but if you want an OLED model then you’ll need to wait. It took more than four years for Nintendo to introduce an OLED model last time, so who knows when it will arrive. If you were hoping for a portable-focused Switch 2 Lite, then you might want to hold off for a few years too. Sydney Louw Butler / How-To Geek The other reason to wait is for an improvement to the hardware. Nintendo quietly revised the original Switch with a more efficient system-on-chip, which resulted in better battery life. Power consumption is arguably the Switch 2’s biggest downside, offering up to “6.5 hours” under ideal circumstances (which is worse than the original model). The Original Switch Will Still See Releases for a While While Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza are Switch 2 exclusive titles, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokémon Legends: Z-A are not. The Switch has a huge install base, with Nintendo having shipped more than 150 million units. If you’re not too bothered about the latest 4K HDR visuals and are happy to sit out a few Switch 2 exclusives (at least for now), there are plenty of big Switch releases on the horizon. This includes many indie games, which are often a better fit on underpowered hardware. It’s just too difficult for developers and publishers to ignore such a massive audience of Switch owners when releasing their games. A Handheld PC May Offer Better Performance or Value While the Switch 2 offers a big leap in power over the original Switch, the world has changed a lot since 2017. Nintendo’s hybrid console set the scene for years to come, offering home console-quality games in a portable form factor. In the years that followed, the dedicated handheld market exploded. None have been more successful than Valve’s Steam Deck (and its revised OLED model). If you’re looking for an alternative to the Switch 2, the Steam Deck has a lower asking price (for the base model, at least) with access to the world’s largest game marketplace in the form of Steam. Tim Brookes / How-To Geek If power is your main concern, the upcoming ROG Ally 2 with its Z2 Extreme APU will put the Switch 2 to shame. Though you’ll pay considerably more for a Windows handheld with this much power, you’ll get the best possible handheld gaming experience. You’ll also get the freedom to do what you want since these machines run Windows (with SteamOS becoming increasingly viable). A PC handheld is a solid choice if you’re mostly going to be playing third-party games and aren’t too interested in Mario and co. It’s also a great way to cash in on Steam’s legendary sales or make use of services like Game Pass on Windows. The Switch 2 Hardware Is Yet to Prove Itself Though the Switch 2 is technically a hardware revision unto itself, many questions can only be answered by the passage of time. We won’t know truly how performant the console will be until we see how it handles a good selection of games. We won’t know how good the display looks until we lay our eyes on it. We won’t know what the “real” average battery life is until we run the console flat a few times. And perhaps most importantly, we won’t know if the Switch 2 will fall foul of the same stick drift debacle that plagued the original Switch console. You’d hope that Nintendo has learned the lesson, but you never know… Last of all, there’s the price. At $450 (or $500 with a copy of Mario Kart World), the Switch 2 isn’t cheap. It’s also not anywhere near as pricey as a PS5 Pro, a gaming PC, or a high-end PC gaming handheld. Ultimately, this is going to be your real deciding factor (but you already knew that).",

If you were hoping for a portable-focused Switch 2 Lite, then you might want to hold off for a few years too.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;Sydney Louw Butler \\/ How-To Geek\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                    \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                \n                        \n            \n            \n                                        \n                                        \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                             \n                    \u003cimg width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Switch playing Street FIghter 2 on an OLED Nintendo Switch.\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg\" src=\"https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/01/4-2.jpg\"/\u003e\n                \n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                        \u003cfigcaption\u003eSydney Louw Butler / How-To Geek\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n                        \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other reason to wait is for an improvement to the hardware.

This includes many indie games, which are often a better fit on underpowered hardware.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIt’s just too difficult for developers and publishers to ignore such a massive audience of Switch owners when releasing their games.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"a-handheld-pc-may-offer-better-performance-or-value\"\u003e\n            A Handheld PC May Offer Better Performance or Value\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Switch 2 offers a big leap in power over the original Switch, the world has changed a lot since 2017.
