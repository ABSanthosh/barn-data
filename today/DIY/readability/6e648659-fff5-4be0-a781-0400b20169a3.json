However, a cute mushroom lamp gives me mid-century vibes that I can get behind. Magdalena Wöckinger (@menawox) gives the IKEA LAMPAN Table Lamp a quick facelift with a glass bowl, a kitchen knob, and a coat of paint. This popular little IKEA lamp inspires many different transformations, like this artistic DIY and even a cake platter. It also shows that there’s more than one way to do a mushroom makeover with this playful kid-inspired hack.  Magdalena’s vision is a bit more sophisticated if you’re looking for a stylish accent lamp. Plus, this DIY is so simple that it almost begs you to try it. It’s a project with a short supply list and an even shorter step-by-step. What You’ll Need 1 IKEA LAMPAN lamp 1 IKEA BLANDA serving bowl (or similar glass bowl) 1 IKEA BAGGANÄS furniture knob (or similar) Orange spray paint (or color of your choice) Mounting adhesive A DIY Mushroom Lamp Easy as 1-2-3 1. Prep and Paint the LAMPAN Remove the shade that comes with the LAMPAN. Clean and dust the base so it’s ready for painting, then spray paint it with whatever color you choose. Allow it to dry, and install a suitable LED bulb. 2. Make the Mushroom Wash and dry the BLANDA serving bowl or whichever glass bowl you’re using. (If using a different bowl, make sure it fits correctly over the bulb and base before painting.) Heed these tips from Magdalena when you paint the bowl, “I only sprayed the inside of the bowl – not the outside. I only needed one coat. Drying time is about 15 minutes.” I would think a spray paint like Rust-Oleum Universal would be a good choice since it’s a paint and primer in one designed for multiple surfaces. You can also get it in different finishes if you prefer a matte look or a glossy one, etc. Once dry, flip the bowl and rest it upside down on the LAMPAN base. 3. Finish With a Faux Finial The finishing touch of this cute lamp is the fake finial on top. Since you don’t actually need a finial to hold the shade in place, this one is strictly for show. Therefore, you could omit this step if you want, but it does give the lamp a little something extra. Use a strong mounting adhesive to attach the knob to the top of your lamp. How Much Does It Cost? If you go with all the parts from IKEA, you’ll spend about $20 on this DIY (not counting the paint and adhesive). Unless you already have the right spray paint, this is likely where you’ll spend the bulk of your money. You don’t want to cheap out on your paint. Otherwise, you’ll end up with flaking or weird coverage on the glass. But there are certainly ways to trim your budget. For example, maybe you have a glass bowl gathering dust that’s similar in size and shape (or you can pick one up at your local thrift shop for a buck).  Also, the BAGGANÄS knobs are $7 for a two-pack, but it’s a pretty common shape that you could likely find at a big-box store for less. Or maybe you’ve recently swapped out the knobs on a piece of furniture during another DIY project, and the old ones are perfect. Want to give this one a try?
