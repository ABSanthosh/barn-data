  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account While it's been almost a year since AI Overviews came to Search, they’re yet to win people over. Google's solution to that is simple: push them more, so people have no choice but to accept them. Now, they're making their way to YouTube. AI Overviews Are Coming to YouTube Next As first spotted by Search Engine Land, and as per a post on YouTube's Help forum, YouTube is currently experimenting with AI Overviews. Once you search for a query, the new feature will use AI to hunt for videos that address your query and display the most relevant clips under a new \"video results\" carousel. Since the post mentions that it'll only appear \"after entering certain search queries,\" it likely won’t show up for all searches. The post explicitly mentions that AI Overviews will most likely appear when you're searching for product information, like \"best noise-cancelling headphones,\" or when you're looking for travel-related information, such as details about specific locations or activities to do there. YouTube mentions that AI Overviews will provide \"another way to discover content\" and \"discover topics and information related to your search query.\" While this works differently than AI Overviews in Search, which display a text summary of the information you're looking for, it’s not surprising. Gavin Phillips/MakeUseOf Someone visiting YouTube likely wouldn't want to read a wall of text and would rather watch clips relevant to their query. This isn’t the first time YouTube has dabbled with AI features, though. A few months ago, the company introduced a conversational AI tool that let YouTube Premium members in the U.S. ask questions about the video they were watching or get recommendations for other videos. Though it’s been almost a year since AI Overviews in Search debuted, I’m still not a fan of them. A lot of the time, they’re inaccurate, fail to address what my query really is, and are frankly unfair to creators and websites that put in the work to answer that query. I imagine something similar will happen with YouTube's AI Overviews, but that’s a story only time can tell. Currently, YouTube's AI Overviews are rolling out to a small number of YouTube Premium members in the United States and are only being displayed for a limited number of English search queries. Unfortunately, it’s possible that, similar to AI Overviews in Search, users won’t have the option to disable them directly and might have to resort to workarounds. Related Here's How I Turned Off Google's AI Overviews and Reclaimed Regular Search Done with Google's AI overviews? You can turn them off in just a few steps. While there’s no telling if AI Overviews for YouTube will end up being widely rolled out, I expect we'll find out more about the feature at Google's annual event, scheduled for May 20 and 21, 2025, Google I/O.",

likely wouldn\u0026#39;t want to read a wall of text and would rather watch clips relevant to their query. This isn’t the first time YouTube has dabbled with AI features, though. A few months ago, the company introduced a conversational AI tool that let YouTube Premium members in the U.S. ask questions about the video they were watching or get recommendations for other videos.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThough it’s been almost a year since AI Overviews in Search debuted, I’m still not a fan of them. A lot of the time, they’re inaccurate, fail to address what my query really is, and are frankly unfair to creators and websites that put in the work to answer that query. I imagine something similar will happen with YouTube\u0026#39;s AI Overviews, but that’s a story only time can tell.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, YouTube\u0026#39;s AI Overviews are rolling out to a small number of YouTube Premium members in the United States and are only being displayed for a limited number of English search queries.
