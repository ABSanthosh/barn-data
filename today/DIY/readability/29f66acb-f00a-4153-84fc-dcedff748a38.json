Spending a little extra on an OLED screen to make sure you're getting the most out of it might seem unnecessary, but it's totally worth it. 5 Deeper Blacks for More Lifelike Images Zarif Ali / MakeUseOf One of the biggest advantages an OLED screen has is the fact that it's a self-emissive technology. This means individual pixels can be turned off, resulting in a \"true black\" color where the deeper blacks give you more lifelike images. On LCD or LED screens, blacks are shown in the same manner as any other color, meaning the screen's backlight remains on. This results in a phenomenon called \"backlight bleeding,\" where the resulting blacks aren't as dark as they should be. This affects the overall quality and saturation of the image. On OLED screens, however, when an area of the screen or even an individual pixel needs to go black, the display panel turns off those specific pixels. The result is little to no backlight bleeding; the rest of the colors on your screen aren't affected either. OLEDs aren't just great at blacks either. Almost every color on an OLED screen will be more saturated than its LED or LCD counterpart—resulting in better, more realistic-looking images. 4 Colors That Stay True From Any Angle Yadullah Abidi / MakeUseOf Another massive advantage of having an OLED screen is the viewing angles. Unlike traditional LCD or LED panels, OLED screens have much wider viewing angles, making sure you don't get any banding or color shift issues when you're not facing the screen at an optimal angle. OLED panels maintain color consistency far better than their LCD or LED counterparts. Of course, you'll never get 100 percent accurate colors from every possible angle, but you can get viewing angles as wide as 170 degrees on most good OLED screens. This is most noticeable on PC monitors when you're sitting up close. If you've got a 24-inch or bigger monitor, especially curved, any slight deviation in angle can cause the image quality to drop. If you're playing games with lots of dark areas, this can heavily affect how well you can see the game itself and your overall experience—regardless of what you're doing. 3 Better Battery Life in Dark Mode OLED panels' ability to completely turn off pixels also comes in handy for battery life, especially if you use your OS in dark mode. Since most of the on-screen UI elements in dark mode will either shut down pixels or lower their brightness, the overall power consumption of your screen will reduce massively.

Since OS elements are what you look at most of the time, you can expect increased battery life with dark mode, no matter what OS you're using. For best results, use dark mode in all your apps and browser, too. Additionally, OLED screens show better contrast at lower brightness levels, meaning you won't have to turn up the brightness as much during day-to-day usage. Over time, this also positively impacts your battery life. It also helps reduce OLED burn-in. 2 Smoother Motion in Fast Scenes Hamlin Rozario/MakeUseOf OLED screens tend to have the lowest response times and quickest refresh rates. This means you get much smoother motion in fast scenes or games, and is a must-have if you're into competitive gaming or just looking to upgrade your gaming experience. 60 FPS just isn't enough anymore. Additionally, OLED screens (mostly TVs) have motion smoothing features that can help make faster scenes or games look less jarring. If you're playing on a console and looking to pick up a TV or monitor, these features can come in handy for a more fluid gaming experience. That said, the benefits of smoother motion aren't limited to games. Other types of content like sports or movies also benefit from this. 1 Sleeker, More Flexible Designs Image Credit: Gavin Phillips/MakeUseOf Last but not least, OLED panels are thinner compared to LCD or LED panels you see on the market. So regardless of whether you're buying a TV or monitor, you'll likely get thinner bezels and sleeker designs. Depending on the type of OLED screen you're getting, this can massively impact your viewing and user experience. On laptops, smaller bezels mean you get bigger screens in a smaller device. This also applies to monitors and TVs, in addition to a slimmer design that looks better on your desk or wall. Buying the right OLED display can be tricky, but we've got some tips to help pick the right OLED screen. An OLED screen might cost you a little extra, but with all the advantages it brings—and just how much of a visual upgrade it is—the extra cash can be worth it.",

having an OLED screen is the viewing angles. Unlike traditional LCD or LED panels, OLED screens have much wider viewing angles, making sure you don\u0026#39;t get any banding or color shift issues when you\u0026#39;re not facing the screen at an optimal angle.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eOLED panels maintain color consistency far better than their LCD or LED counterparts. Of course, you\u0026#39;ll never get 100 percent accurate colors from every possible angle, but you can get viewing angles as wide as 170 degrees on most good OLED screens.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThis is most noticeable on PC monitors when you\u0026#39;re sitting up close. If you\u0026#39;ve got a 24-inch or bigger monitor, especially curved, any slight deviation in angle can cause the image quality to drop. If you\u0026#39;re playing games with lots of dark areas, this can heavily affect how well you can see the game itself and your overall experience—regardless of what you\u0026#39;re doing.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"better-battery-life-in-dark-mode\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e3 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Better Battery Life in Dark Mode\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOLED panels\u0026#39; ability to completely turn off pixels also comes in handy for battery life, especially if you use your OS in dark mode.
