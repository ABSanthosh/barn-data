However, its 2024 discontinuation forced me to move over to Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K—and it’s been a surprisingly great upgrade! 6 An Intuitive and Feature-Rich Interface Jack Mitchell/MakeUseOf Having not owned an Amazon streaming device since the first-generation Fire TV Stick, I was impressed by the significant improvements that the Fire TV OS has undergone in recent years. In 2025, it is one of the most user-friendly streaming interfaces I’ve used, and while Chromecast also stepped up to the challenge with Google TV, the Fire TV Stick’s UI still surpasses it in terms of personalization, discoverability, and overall responsiveness. Like with Google TV, the Fire TV home screen is neatly organized into personalized content rows, shortcuts, and trending shows, along with quick access to your favorite apps. However, unlike Google TV, which often prioritizes Google services and content, Fire TV provides a more neutral experience, whether you’re watching Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon’s native Prime Video. 5 A Superior Remote Control With Alexa Integration Jack Mitchell/MakeUseOf The Fire TV Stick 4K features a newly redesigned Alexa Voice Remote, which sets it apart from Chromecast with Google TV—the only generation of the device to include a remote. While the latter does support Google Assistant, it’s not as polished and lacks the deeper ecosystem capabilities that Amazon Alexa provides. The latest Alexa Voice Remote is highly intuitive, with dedicated app buttons and volume and power buttons that sync to your TV. The blue-highlighted microphone button takes pride of place at the top of the handset next to the mic itself. This allows you not only to open apps and search for shows and movies but also to control your smart home devices, check weather reports, and manage Alexa routines. In contrast, over the years, Chromecast has been heavily reliant on its app. While Chromecasts are still a good purchase in 2025 and can be controlled by my smartphone, for home use, I prefer the holistic and simplified solution that the Alexa Voice Remote provides. 4 Third-Party App Support and Native Streaming Services Jack Mitchell/MakeUseOf One of the primary benefits of the Fire TV Stick 4K is its support for a wide range of third-party apps and streaming services. Of course, there is the usual array of options available, including Netflix, YouTube, Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, and live TV streaming, among others. However, what really sets it apart from other plug-and-play devices is the ability to sideload apps for better customization and a more personalized viewing experience. While Chromecast with Google TV also offers a wide selection of mainstream apps, Fire TV’s compatibility with lesser-known services, like IPTV services and gaming platforms, as well as its ad-free integration of Prime Video and Freevee, makes it a much more versatile tool overall. 3 Straightforward Integration for Smart Homes Amazon has invested considerable effort in creating its native ecosystem, and the Fire TV Stick 4K integrates seamlessly, offering superior automation and control compared to its Google counterpart. Amazon’s smart products are affordable and readily available, and the Fire TV Stick 4K easily connects with a wide range of devices, including Echo speakers, Ring doorbells, Blink cameras, and smart plugs. For example, you can ask Alexa to show your front door camera while watching a movie or dim your smart lights using voice commands via the remote. Fire TV even supports Matter and Thread, making it a future-proof hub for smart home devices across different brands. For me, deeper control and better customization options make the Fire TV Stick 4K stand out in comparison to Google Assistant-supported devices. 2 Improved Performance Overall Jack MItchell/MakeUseOf The latest Fire TV Stick 4K is powered by an upgraded quad-core processor and GPU combination for smoother navigation, quicker app launches, and buffering-free playback. It also supports 4K Ultra HD, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos, providing a premium audiovisual experience that will hold its own when connected to a high-quality TV. This performance is similar to that of the new Google TV Streamer, which is also a premium device, although it has a much larger footprint and a price tag that is double that of Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K. 1 Excellent Value for Money Value for money was the most compelling reason for me to opt for the Fire TV Stick 4K. In recent years, Google has decided to drop the ultra-compact, smartphone-activated, and affordable Chromecast in favor of the more expensive, bulkier, and remote-controlled Chromecast with Google TV. This was ultimately succeeded by the even bulkier shelf-top console, the Google TV Streamer, which is significantly more powerful—and more expensive. When I considered that the Fire TV Stick 4K combines portability, convenience, app compatibility, performance, and affordability, along with the ability to stream live TV and free ad-supported content, it was a no-brainer for me. If you also want a secondary streaming device for sideloading apps, streaming foreign networks via VPN, and having a portable backup unit for all your streaming subscriptions, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is a perfect fit. And while Google’s streaming products have never let me down, and I will continue to pack my Chromecast in my tech pouch when traveling, the Fire TV Stick 4K offers the best balance of functionality, ecosystem compatibility, and affordability, making it my top choice for streaming in 2025.",

rel=\"noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFire TV Stick 4K\u003c/a\u003e is powered by an upgraded quad-core processor and GPU combination for smoother navigation, quicker app launches, and buffering-free playback. It also supports 4K Ultra HD, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos, providing a premium audiovisual experience that will hold its own when connected to a high-quality TV.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThis performance is similar to that of the new Google TV Streamer, which is also a premium device, although it has a much larger footprint and a price tag that is double that of Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"excellent-value-for-money\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e1 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Excellent Value for Money\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eValue for money was the most compelling reason for me to opt for the Fire TV Stick 4K. In recent years, Google has decided to drop the ultra-compact, smartphone-activated, and affordable Chromecast in favor of the more expensive, bulkier, and remote-controlled Chromecast with Google TV. This was ultimately succeeded by the even bulkier shelf-top console, the Google TV Streamer, which is significantly more powerful—and more expensive.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWhen I considered that the Fire TV Stick 4K combines portability, convenience, app compatibility, performance, and affordability, along with the ability to stream live TV and free ad-supported content, it was a no-brainer for me.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIf you also want a secondary streaming device for sideloading apps, streaming foreign networks via VPN, and having a portable backup unit for all your streaming subscriptions, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is a perfect fit. And while Google’s streaming products have never let me down, and I will continue to pack my Chromecast in my tech pouch when traveling, the Fire TV Stick 4K offers the best balance of functionality, ecosystem compatibility, and affordability, making it my top choice for streaming in 2025.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
