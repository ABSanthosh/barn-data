Some may think that appliances like dishwashers and washing machines are self-cleaning, but since they are constantly coming in contact with dirty substances and mineral buildup, they also need regular cleaning to continue to work properly and provide clean dishes consistently. Thankfully, cleaning a smelly dishwasher and bringing it back to its best only requires a few instructions and we’ll show you how! Related: How To Clean Copper, How to Clean a Cast Iron Skillet, How to Clean Makeup Brushes, How to Clean Brass, How To Clean and Care For Your Leather Boots, How to Clean a Washing Machine Why should I clean my dishwasher? Cleaning your dishwasher regularly not only helps remove odors and keep your dishwasher smelling clean, it also is important to keep up with the grease, minerals, grime and limescale that can occur as that can actually keep your dishwasher from working efficiently over time. Lack of proper cleaning can lead to dishes still being dirty or cloudy and you may think you need unnecessary repairs when all you need is a good cleaning! How often should I clean my dishwasher? Most dishwasher manufacturers recommend washing your dishwasher on a once a month basis. If you use your dishwasher consistently then it’s a good idea to follow this schedule, but you may want to clean it even more if you use yours several times a day. Hard water can also contribute to mineral buildup and may need more frequent cleanings. Try cleaning once a month with vinegar and baking soda and do a deep clean at least every three months (and if you’re experiencing odors or visible grime then you may want to clean more often). If you use your dishwasher infrequently, then you can clean it closer to every 3-6 months. Supplies needed to clean a dishwasher: White vinegar Baking soda Dish soap Small soft-bristle scrub brush or toothbrush Dishwasher-safe bowl or glass Pyrex measuring cup Note: When it comes to cleaning electronics, you’ll always want to consult your product owner’s manual to see if your particular model has any cleaning restrictions from the manufacturer so you don’t void your warranty. \u003c How to clean your dishwasher 1. Remove and Clean Filter: If your dishwasher has a removable filter (check your manual to see if it does or if it’s built in), remove the filter and clean it out to clear any debris or obstructions that may block the filter. It’s a good idea to do this about once a month to keep it running smoothly. If your machine has a filter that can’t be removed, then it should also be a self-cleaning filter so you can skip this step. Find and remove your upper and/or lower dishwasher filter. Check the empty filter compartment for any food particles and wipe out with a clean cloth. Use warm soapy water to wash your filter and use a soft brush to clean the filter. Rinse the filter and lock the filter back in place in the dishwasher. 2. Clean Removable Parts Remove the utensil holder and dishwasher racks. Clean off any stuck on food with a soft brush and warm soapy water and rinse. If your sink feels to cramped to wash the larger dishwasher racks, you can also move them to a bathtub to scrub and rinse. TIP: For stubborn-to-remove food on your racks or utensil holder, soak them in hot water with a cup of vinegar added. Let it sit for 15 minutes and then scrub again before rinsing.3. Run a Vinegar Cycle With consistent dishwasher use, grime and odor can accumulate over time and running a dishwasher cycle with white vinegar will help deodorize your dishwasher and keep it smelling clean. Empty your dishwasher. Add 2 cups of white vinegar to a dishwasher safe bowl or glass measuring cup and set the cup in the bottom rack of your dishwasher. Run a cycle on the hottest water setting without dishwasher detergent and with the heated dry option turned off. TIP: You can use apple cider vinegar in place of white vinegar, but there’s a chance the coloration of the apple cider vinegar may cause some staining.4. Run a Baking Soda Cycle Baking soda is another cheap and easy way to add another layer of clean to your dishwasher as it also helps to deodorize and remove grime. Once your vinegar cycle is complete … Sprinkle 1 cup of baking soda onto the bottom of the dishwasher. Run a cycle with your hottest water setting without dishwasher detergent. For a Dishwasher Deep Clean, You Can Also … Clean Your Interior Door and Gasket To clean your dishwasher interior door and gasket (the rubber seal around the inside opening of the dishwasher), add 1/2 cup of vinegar to 3 cups of warm water and scrub the gasket with a soft toothbrush to remove residue. Check your manual to see if the manufacturer only allows water on the gasket, and if that’s the case, simply scrub with warm water. If you notice signs of mold or mildew on the gasket, check your manual to see if an all-purpose cleaner can be used for a deeper clean. Use the same vinegar solution to wipe down the interior door with a soft cloth. Clean Your Drain Cleaning your dishwasher drain is another important step in dishwasher maintenance. To keep the drain clean and clean of debris … Warm 1 cup of vinegar on the stove or microwave until warm. Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the vinegar and pour down the dishwasher drain. Let sit for 15 minutes. Heat water in a kettle until it boils and then carefully and slowly pour down the drain to remove any clogs (be careful not to splash yourself with the hot water!) Check the Spray Arms: The spray arms on the top and bottom of you dishwasher are what distribute the water to your dishes and overtime they can become clogged with debris or mineral buildup. While your racks are removed, check the spray arms and inspect the holes to check for blocked holes and use a toothpick or a flexible wire to poke out any debris. Wipe Down Your Exterior Door For the final step in your clean dishwasher, wipe down the front door of your dishwasher with a damp microfiber cloth and water mixed with a little dish soap. If you have a stainless steel dishwasher, it’s best to use a stainless steel cleaner to fully remove smudges/fingerprints and avoid cleaning streaks. How do you clean a dishwasher with Affresh tablets? Using a dishwasher cleaner like Affresh tablets is also an easy way to clean your dishwasher. For best results, remove all the dishes first. Some dishwasher cleaners will say you can technically leave your dishes in while you clean it, but it’s best to run it on an empty dishwasher so all the areas of the dishwasher are exposed. Then remove and clean your filter (if the filter is removable) to clean out clogs and obstructions and pick out any remaining food near the drain or filter area. Add your dishwasher cleaner tablet to the detergent tray. If you have a lot of buildup in your machine, you can add a second tablet to the bottom floor of your dishwasher in addition to the tablet in the detergent tray. Run a full wash cycle and your dishwasher is now clean! TIP: Make sure to also keep your garbage disposal clean and clear as a dirty or clogged disposal can actually cause issues with your dishwasher draining properly.To keep your dishwasher clean … After each load, remove any visible food that has collected on the bottom of the dishwasher. Don’t overload your dishwasher so the water can reach all areas easily. Set a reminder on your phone calendar for scheduled cleanings so you don’t forget when it’s time to do a regular or full deep clean. Frequently Asked QuestionsCan you use bleach to clean your dishwasher?First of all, it’s important to know that you should never use bleach along with vinegar or baking soda as they create a dangerous gas when combined. Bleach can also damage any stainless steel parts in your dishwasher, so it’s best to just stick to vinegar and baking soda as they are enough to get the job done safely. Can you run a cycle with vinegar and baking soda together?While the two are used in combination a lot for cleaning, you don’t want the big bubbly foam that it will produce inside of your dishwasher as it can be quite a mess. It’s best to run separate cycles with each ingredient. How do you clean a smelly dishwasher?Running separate cycles with white vinegar first and then baking soda is the most effective way to combat odors. What’s that white powdery residue in my dishwasher?A powdery film can be caused by mineral buildup from hard water. Use a sponge soaked in vinegar to wipe down the surfaces.",
