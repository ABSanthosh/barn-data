  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Joe Fedewa / How-To Geek Get ready to say goodbye to the familiar Google Assistant on your wrist. Google’s continued push to replace Assistant with Gemini appears to be hitting Wear OS smartwatches. The changes are small–for now. The latest update to the \"Assistant\" app on Wear OS smartwatches hints at a significant upcoming shift. While the core functionalities remain for now, the Assistant branding is taking a backseat. You'll notice that the shortcut to launch voice input from your watch face is now simply labeled \"Google,\" powered by a generic \"Digital Assistant\" label instead of Google Assistant. Even the familiar Assistant logo has been replaced by a generic sparkle icon (not the Gemini sparkle logo). The same icon can be found on the Assistant tile as well. This rebranding isn't just skin deep. The \"At a Glance\" feature, previously tied to Google Assistant, now awkwardly reads “At a Glance” twice with Google's prominent \"G\" logo. These subtle changes suggest that Google is actively laying the groundwork for the future where Gemini takes center stage on your smartwatch. As you might remember, Google has bigger plans for Gemini. Last month, Google announced that later this year, Gemini will replace the classic Google Assistant on most Android phones. Millions of users have already been testing the waters with Gemini, but by the end of this year, it will be thrust on everyone whether they like it or not. Related RIP: Google Assistant Will Be Fully Replaced by Gemini Later This Year Google Assistant’s days are numbered. Later in 2025, Google officially plans to replace Assistant with Gemini on Android phones. This comes after the company has spent the last year releasing feature updates aimed at bringing Gemini up to par with the much older Google Assistant. Google, of course, claims that Gemini is a more intelligent assistant, potentially capable of understanding and responding in a more natural, conversational way. However, Google has also stated that it’s still working on getting Gemini up to speed with Assistant, which was released nearly a decade ago. It begs the question, which one is actually superior? Meanwhile, we’re continuing to focus on improving the quality of the day-to-day Gemini experience, especially for those who have come to rely on Google Assistant. We’ve updated the app to support more of the most requested features, such as playing music, setting timers, or taking action from your lock screen. There’s still a lot we don’t know about Gemini on Wear OS. How will Gemini's more demanding processing needs fare on the smaller batteries and less powerful chips found in smartwatches? Will all the features we expect from a voice assistant make the jump? And what exactly will the user interface look and feel like? Unlike with Android phones, Google is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding a specific timeline for the full Gemini takeover on Wear OS. However, these branding changes strongly indicate that the transition is indeed underway. It's a clear signal that the time of Google Assistant on your smartwatch is drawing to a close.

id=\"article-body\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet ready to say goodbye to the familiar Google Assistant on your wrist. Google’s continued push to replace Assistant with Gemini appears to be hitting Wear OS smartwatches. The changes are small–for now.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe latest update to the \u0026#34;\u003ca href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2012385/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.wearable.assistant\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAssistant\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#34; app on Wear OS smartwatches hints at a significant upcoming shift. While the core functionalities remain for now, the Assistant branding is taking a backseat. You\u0026#39;ll notice that the shortcut to launch voice input from your watch face is now simply labeled \u0026#34;Google,\u0026#34; powered by a generic \u0026#34;Digital Assistant\u0026#34; label instead of Google Assistant. Even the familiar Assistant logo has been replaced by a generic sparkle icon (not the Gemini sparkle logo). The same icon can be found on the Assistant tile as well.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThis rebranding isn\u0026#39;t just skin deep. The \u0026#34;At a Glance\u0026#34; feature, previously tied to Google Assistant, now awkwardly reads “At a Glance” twice with Google\u0026#39;s prominent \u0026#34;G\u0026#34; logo. These subtle changes suggest that Google is actively laying the groundwork for the future where Gemini takes center stage on your smartwatch.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAs you might remember, Google has bigger plans for Gemini. Last month, Google announced that later this year, \u003ca href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/gemini-replace-google-assistant-2025/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGemini will replace the classic Google Assistant on most Android phones\u003c/a\u003e.

Year\n\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003c/h5\u003e\n\n                                                    \n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eGoogle Assistant’s days are numbered. Later in 2025, Google officially plans to replace Assistant with Gemini on Android phones. This comes after the company has spent the last year releasing feature updates aimed at bringing Gemini up to par with the much older Google Assistant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\n\n                    \n\n\n                \n                \n                \n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n                \t\n\n\n                \n\n                \n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n                \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle, of course, claims that Gemini is a more intelligent assistant, potentially capable of understanding and responding in a more natural, conversational way. However, Google has also stated that it’s still working on getting Gemini up to speed with Assistant, which was released nearly a decade ago. It begs the question, which one is actually superior?\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cblockquote\u003e\n                        \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, we’re continuing to focus on improving the quality of the day-to-day Gemini experience, especially for those who have come to rely on Google Assistant. We’ve updated the app to support more of the most requested features, such as playing music, setting timers, or taking action from your lock screen.\u003c/p\u003e    \n            \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s still a lot we don’t know about Gemini on Wear OS. How will Gemini\u0026#39;s more demanding processing needs fare on the smaller batteries and less powerful chips found in smartwatches? Will all the features we expect from a voice assistant make the jump? And what exactly will the user interface look and feel like?\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUnlike with Android phones, Google is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding a specific timeline for the full Gemini takeover on Wear OS. However, these branding changes strongly indicate that the transition is indeed underway. It\u0026#39;s a clear signal that the time of Google Assistant on your smartwatch is drawing to a close.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca
