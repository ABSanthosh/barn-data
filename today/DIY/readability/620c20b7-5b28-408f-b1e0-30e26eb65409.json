These are my favorite websites for creating Valentine's Day cards at no cost. 1 JibJab Online greeting cards are great, but why not go the extra mile and create a custom video card with JibJab? A lot of interactive cards on the site allow you to cast yourself in the video to create an entertaining and personalized experience for your loved one. If you’re not one for uploading your own photos, JibJab also offers pre-designed animated e-cards featuring fun themes, like haikus, snippets from old movies, and more. Regardless of the type of card you choose, you can make it your own by adding a heartfelt message. While there is a selection of free e-cards on JibJab that you can animate, you can also sign up for a paid membership if you see yourself using the service often and need access to a wider range of premium cards. If you want to make Valentine’s Day all the more special for your loved one, be sure to purchase a unique gift from a reputable website to go along with your video card. 2 Canva There are many things you can create on Canva with zero effort, from book covers to event invitations and resumes. But did you know you can also use the platform to create Valentine’s Day cards? The platform lets you access numerous designs for free, and the best part is that every design element and text box can be customized to your liking. If you don’t like the pre-loaded templates, you can create a card from scratch. It might seem like a lot of effort, but these simple Canva tips will cut your design time in half. While there’s a lot you can do with the free version, you can also subscribe to a trial run of Canva Pro if you’d like to take advantage of the premium features. You can use the free trial for up to 30 days, which is plenty of time to design a Valentine’s Day card that checks all the boxes. 3 Greetings Island Greetings Island is another website worth checking out if you want to create and share greeting cards or invitations to parties. There are plenty of pre-loaded card designs that you can choose from and personalize. Once you’re happy with what you’ve designed, you can print it out, download it as a PDF file, or directly share it via platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook. Creating invitations for Valentine’s Day or Galentine’s Day parties is just as easy, but you’ll have to add your event details to get the invite ready. Something worth noting is that you can create an online RSVP to keep track of who’s coming to your party. I truly appreciate this feature since I don’t have to manually keep track of my guests’ responses. 4 Punch Bowl Like Greetings Island, Punch Bowl allows you to create greeting cards and invitations for Valentine’s Day parties. The highlight, though, is that you can choose to include a gift card with your greeting card. While you can stick to safe options like an Amazon or Starbucks card, gift cards from retailers like The Cheesecake Factory, AMC Theaters, or Sephora are also available. I also like that while the cards might appear simple at first glance, you can add a video message to make it special and engaging. These websites can help you create some truly thoughtful cards for your loved ones, whether you’re looking for something heartfelt and romantic or something that will have the recipient cracking up. If you’re shopping for a gift to accompany your greeting card, make sure you keep your Valentine's Day purchase a secret.",

There are plenty of pre-loaded card designs that you can choose from and personalize. Once you’re happy with what you’ve designed, you can print it out, download it as a PDF file, or directly share it via platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eCreating invitations for Valentine’s Day or Galentine’s Day parties is just as easy, but you’ll have to add your event details to get the invite ready. Something worth noting is that you can create an online RSVP to keep track of who’s coming to your party. I truly appreciate this feature since I don’t have to manually keep track of my guests’ responses.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"punch-bowl\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e4 \u003c/span\u003e\n
