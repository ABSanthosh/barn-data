Whether you have experience from your own home or just the endless DIY renovation shows you’ve watched, you know that there’s nothing that can make your home look dated quite like ancient cabinets in the kitchen.Turns out, DIY experts agree. No matter how great your floor tile looks or how shiny and industrial your new oven is, a kitchen can’t get out of its ’90s time capsule if the cabinets aren’t right. Yes, it’s a huge pain to knock down already-installed cabinets and start over, but you don’t necessarily need to do that much work to make your kitchen look brighter, fresher, and newer. I tapped interior designers who deal regularly with challenges like small spaces and a lack of client funds to find out the best bang-for-your-buck kitchen cabinet upgrade. Below, learn the most recommended project for making your kitchen look its best (without breaking the bank).Credit: Bits And Splits/ShutterstockThe Best Value Kitchen Cabinet Upgrade, According to Interior DesignersBy far the most consistent answer when speaking to interior designers about the best bang-for-your-buck upgrade to kitchen cabinets is to replace the hardware on your cabinets. “As an interior designer in the Bay Area, square footage and material are at a premium, so I have a few affordable kitchen cabinet upgrades that give the best bang for investment,” says Tina Montemayor, founder and principal designer at Tina Montemayor Design. “Hardware with more sleek and modern silhouettes helps create a contemporary or transitional feel, even when paired with older cabinets,” she adds. “Think linear and less fussy.”Isfira Jensen, CEO and principal designer at Jensen \u0026 Co. Interiors, agrees. “The most cost-effective option — and one that will yield a tremendous upgrade — is to swap out the existing cabinet hardware,” Jensen says. “Replacing dated knobs instantly elevates the look of the cabinetry without a significant investment.”Kylie Mawdsley of Kylie M Interiors also has a great general rule of thumb when it comes to planning out hardware. “The standard approach is knobs on doors and pulls on drawers,” she says. “Polished nickel is the most timeless metal finish for the average kitchen,” she adds. “Black is no longer trendy, though it’s okay in small doses, and while some are doing gold and antique brass, if it’s not natural to the home (e.g., it’s not a heritage home), it will eventually go out of style.” Other designers also agree that you shouldn’t replace cabinet knobs without also replacing pulls for a more cohesive look. So what should you do if you’re still hating that orangey wood look even after you’ve replaced your hardware? Montemayor has a helpful tip. “For orangey wood where refinishing isn’t in the cards, an overlooked element can be the lighting,” she explains. “In older homes, I notice overly warm hues when kitchens should have some cooler lighting, especially in the task lighting that illuminates the counters. That can help combat orangey tones in wood, too.”",
