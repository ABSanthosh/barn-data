After spending hours wandering the merchandise-laden levels, it’s easy to leave the Swedish design store feeling inspired by creative ideas for every room. Whether you need to outfit a full kitchen or pick up a few items to complete a dorm room, IKEA has you covered.But there’s one section that might be especially inspiring for DIYers: the as-is section, right before you reach the checkout. While this stash of scratch-and-dent merchandise isn’t as organized as the rest of the store, it’s a secret go-to section for some (you can even preview what’s available in your local IKEA online). Here are four things DIY experts say you should always keep an eye out for in the as-is section — they’re all worth grabbing for your next home project.CabinetsLike many products at IKEA, the pine IVAR Cabinet serves various purposes. The IVAR is a staple for many DIYers, whether they’re outfitting a pantry or adding extra bathroom storage. “It’s solid pine, so it’s sturdy and one of the most versatile pieces of furniture at IKEA,” says Kim Bui, the DIY blogger behind XO My Home. These cupboards are the perfect blank canvas and can add storage to just about any room in your home. Plus, they’re easy to personalize. “Simply painting it a rich, bold color and adding knobs will instantly make it look more high-end,” adds Bui, who scored big when she found two IVAR cabinets in the as-is section of her nearest IKEA. She used them as a base for her daughter’s art and craft table and added floral decals to create a whimsical look. Even if you don’t find the IVAR, IKEA has a wide range of cabinet options that may end up in the as-is area.Cabinet DoorsIKEA has its staple cabinetry lines, but sometimes their decision to discontinue a style can be a reason to celebrate. Home improvement expert Tony Hoang says doors to discontinued pieces are often sold at a deep discount to clear out remaining stock. Depending on your DIY and carpentry expertise level, a former cabinet door can become a floating shelf, art frame, or even a custom headboard. Interesting finishes, unique textures, and other add-ons often qualify these lingering pieces. “Look for sturdy hinges and hardware that is still attached,” advises Hoang. “These small extras can cost a fortune if bought separately.” When considering your next upcycling project, watch for cabinet doors in the as-is section of IKEA to spark a little creativity without breaking the bank.Unfinished SurfacesIf you enjoy repurposing and upcycling, scouring the as-is section for items with unfinished surfaces opens up a wealth of opportunities. Hoang consistently scans the scratch-and-dent section for tabletops, countertops, or large wood panels. As long as they only have slight marks, he picks them up. “A minor scratch or dent usually doesn’t affect structural integrity and can be easily patched, sanded, or covered with paint or laminate,” he says. Hoang also says these pieces are a blank slate and perfect for making sturdy furniture. “These pieces are perfect for creating custom desks, window seats, or DIY kitchen islands,” he adds. To match unfinished wood to your decor, use stain or paint, or go a step further and add a decorative veneer for a custom look. FurnitureOf course, the term “furniture” covers a wide range of items, but interior stylist Claire Douglas considers just about any furniture piece a win when it’s in the slightly damaged section of IKEA. “Look out for storage options like cabinets and bookcases as well as IKEA’s brilliant ranges of chairs in the as-is section, as these items are prime for hacking, and it’s a chance to make even more savings,” Douglas says. If you’re on a budget and have a creative eye, walk through the area to see what you can find, and look at items in a different light to see what you can change. Douglas says she likes to paint and add paneling to IKEA furniture and upgrade the hardware to add a more elevated look. Of course the condition does matter, so ensure your piece still has structural integrity — but overlook small amounts of damage. “Don’t worry if there are a few marks, as these can be easily covered,” Douglas adds.",
