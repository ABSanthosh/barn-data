  "text": "Sign in to your How-To Geek account Canon PIXMA TS6420a Inkjet Printer $59 $141 Save $82 The Alexa-compatible Canon Prixma printer is a versatile inkjet model with auto-duplex printing, a 4.4-inch OLED screen. It supports color printing at 6.8 ppm (13 ppm monochrome), with a flatbed scanner. The Canon PIXMA Inkjet Printer is currently on sale with a big 58% discount, knocking the price down to just $59.00 on Amazon. This is a huge discount considering it normally costs $141. The printer is also compatible with Alexa, making it a great choice for smart homes. The printer handles printing, copying, and scanning, as you'd expect from a printer from Canon. It uses inkjet technology to print sharp, colorful documents and photos with a high resolution of 4800 x 1200 dots per inch. For everyday printing, it can print black-and-white pages at 13 pages per minute (ppm) and color pages at 6.8 ppm, making it efficient for most tasks. When copying, it keeps up the same speed, offering a black-and-white copy speed of 13 ppm. One of the most useful features is Auto-Duplex printing, which automatically prints on both sides of the paper. This saves you from needing to put the same pages back, and possibly ruining a print job. The printer also has a bright 1.44-inch OLED screen, which makes it easy to navigate settings and options. Connectivity is another strong point for the printer. It works with both Wi-Fi and USB, so you can set it up in different ways depending on your needs. The built-in Wi-Fi lets you print wirelessly from anywhere, so you don’t need to be connected to a computer. I've used both a USB and Wi-Fi and can say that using Wi-Fi with the app makes it so much easier to fax, scan, and print. I have had fewer issues with the wireless setup than I did with a wired one. With the current 58% discount, the Canon PIXMA Inkjet Printer is an excellent value. At just $59.00 on Amazon, down from $141, it’s a budget-friendly choice for anyone who needs a reliable all-in-one printer with modern features.",

This is a huge discount considering it normally costs $141. The printer is also compatible with Alexa, making it a great choice for smart homes.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe printer handles printing, copying, and scanning, as you\u0026#39;d expect from a printer from Canon. It uses inkjet technology to print sharp, colorful documents and photos with a high resolution of 4800 x 1200 dots per inch. For everyday printing, it can print black-and-white pages at 13 pages per minute (ppm) and color pages at 6.8 ppm, making it efficient for most tasks. When copying, it keeps up the same speed, offering a black-and-white copy speed of 13 ppm.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOne of the most useful features is Auto-Duplex printing, which automatically prints on both sides of the paper. This saves you from needing to put the same pages back, and possibly ruining a print job. The printer also has a bright 1.44-inch OLED screen, which makes it easy to navigate settings and options.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eConnectivity is another strong point for the printer. It works with both Wi-Fi and USB, so you can set it up in different ways depending on your needs. The built-in Wi-Fi lets you print wirelessly from anywhere, so you don’t need to be connected to a computer. I\u0026#39;ve used both a USB and Wi-Fi and can say that using Wi-Fi with the app makes it so much easier to fax, scan, and print. I have had fewer issues with the wireless setup than I did with a wired one.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWith the current 58% discount, the Canon PIXMA Inkjet Printer is an excellent value.
