  "text": "Sign in to your MUO account After more than a decade helping users save and rediscover content they love, the Pocket app is officially shutting down. Everything We Know About Pocket's Retirement Mozilla, which acquired Pocket in 2017, has announced that the service will close on July 8, 2025, marking the end of an era for one of the web’s most beloved read-it-later tools. Considering Pocket's widespread use, its impending shut down is likely a surprise to many. Despite springing this on us without much notice—new account signups are no longer available starting today, May 22, and the app has been removed from all app stores—Mozilla does have a plan it intends to follow to help you get all of your saved content out its service. \"Pocket has helped millions save articles and discover stories worth reading,\" Mozilla wrote in an updated support document. \"But the way people use the web has evolved, so we’re channeling our resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs.\" Beyond that, Mozilla also shared how it plans to double down on making its browser and other tools fit the needs of everyday people, especially as the way we use the internet continues to evolve. This is more bad news for Mozilla fans, especially after Firefox's updated terms of use spurred some outrage earlier this year. You Can Export Your Data Now While Pocket shutting down is undoubtedly a major inconvenience for those who use the service, Mozilla has made it easy to export your data so you don't lose anything you've saved. To export your data, log into your Pocket account and navigate to the Pocket Export page. Once here, you can export your saves by clicking on Export HTML file, which will create a file with all the URLs and titles of your saves, archive, and favorites. Mozilla says it may take up to 24 hours for your data to be exported. Once successfully exported, the HTML file will be sent to the email connected to your Pocket account. All Data Will Be Deleted Later This Year On top of providing an update about where Pocket is headed, Mozilla also provided a breakdown of key dates you'll want to be aware of going forward. May 22, 2025: Pocket will be removed from app stores, new account sign-ups will stop, and monthly subscription renewals will be disabled. July 8, 2025: The app officially shuts down and moves into export-only mode. Annual subscribers to Pocket Premium will receive automatic prorated refunds. October 8, 2025: Final deadline to export your saved content. After this date, all user data will be permanently deleted. Though the Pocket app is shutting down, Mozilla says it plans to continue its mission of curating quality content through other tools. The company plans to continue its newsletter offerings with a new letter called Ten Tabs, which will replace its previous newsletter, Pocket Hits.",
