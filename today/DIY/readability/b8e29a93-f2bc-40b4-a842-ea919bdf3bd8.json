  "text": "Amazon Prime Sign in to your MUO account Prime Video is getting over 150 free channels with its partnership with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). PBS is known for its high-quality and educational programs, and you can now watch its shows and channels on Prime Video under its ‘Watch for Free’ section. This is also the first time that PBS has partnered with a major streaming service, extending its reach to more users and devices across the country. PBS Is Now Available on Prime Video for Free As long as you have an Amazon account, you can enjoy PBS’ over 150 local stations by streaming it to your device via the Prime Video app. Aside from those local PBS channels, the PBS KIDS Channel will also be available for free — no Prime Video subscription needed. All these channels will slowly become available in the coming months, so you can soon watch your favorite PBS shows like Sesame Street, Frontline, and Masterpiece anywhere as long as you have a smartphone or compatible device and an internet connection. Prime Video also gets two new PBS channels that will initially be only available on the platform — PBS Drama and PBS Documentaries. These will be available starting November 26, alongside a “pop-up” channel that runs classic PBS shows starting with Reading Rainbow. “PBS member stations will be able to tap into a leading streaming service to offer quality local programming viewers know and love for free,” say PBS Chief Digital and Marketing Officer Ira Rubenstein. “It’s part of the PBS commitment to make trusted content available to all households across as many platforms as possible. We thank Amazon for giving PBS Member Stations a new and exciting way to grow their digital footprint while engaging with audiences old and new.” Aside from getting access to your PBS favorite, it also adds several more channels to Amazon’s free offerings. This comes at a crucial time, especially as Amazon is closing down Freevee, it’s free streaming service. Meaning you’ll still get a lot of value out of Prime Video even if you don’t pay a dime to Amazon for the privilege. Other Ways to Watch PBS Aside from streaming PBS on Prime Video, there are several ways you can enjoy its content for free on your smartphone, tablet, smart TV, and other smart devices. You could visit its website, pbs.org and pbskids.org, to stream its shows to your device. This makes it one of the free internet TV channels you can watch online. Alternatively, you can download the PBS app and PBS Kids app on Android or iPhone to make it easier to catch your favorite shows. PBS also recently launched a free channel on Roku called PBS Retro, which features shows from the 80s and 90s for those looking for some nostalgia. So, if you’re looking for quality content to watch when you’re relaxing, PBS should be one of the free channels you should look for.
