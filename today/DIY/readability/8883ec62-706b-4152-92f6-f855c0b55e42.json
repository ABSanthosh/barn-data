All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.About this before \u0026 afterI’m immediately intrigued when I come across a bunk bed that really stands out. Talk about small space design savvy! Often, bunk beds get tucked into corners of rooms, but the one in Morgan and Faye Hurley’s (@themaryhouserevival) daughters’ room is smack in the center, and it looks great.But there is so much more amazingness in this room makeover by that the bunk bed is just one part. Wait ’til you see all the juicy design details. Whereas before, the bedroom was beige, brown, and muted, now, it’s a colorful, joyful space.The hand-crafted bunk bed is painted a striking teal, (Benjamin Moore’s Covington Blue) and it feels as though the rest of the furniture and decor orbits around the bunk bed. Maybe the bunk bed’s placement is front and center because Faye designed it and Morgan built it, or perhaps it’s because the girls, Frida and June, were so excited about their beds. “They also had a lot of influence on their custom beds, the little girls were obsessed with the idea of a bunk, and we enjoyed gathering ideas together for built-in custom beds for all of them,” Faye explains. The bunk bed is between two red-painted windows (Benjamin Moore’s Redstone), so the room is flooded with natural light. But the vibrancy doesn’t just come from the sun — this bedroom is a masterclass in gorgeously mixing patterns. Spoonflower gifted the Hurleys wallpaper and decor for their room, so all of the design inspiration started with selecting those patterns (June and Frida helped a lot). “I was going for a vintage eclectic feel with classic Swedish influences,” Faye shares.“They were both pretty plain rooms with not much going on,” Faye says of all of her daughters’ bedrooms. “They had outdated wallpaper, and we made do with the beds and furniture we had until it was time to redo them.”Since June, Frida and their sister Olive have a playroom; time spent in their bedrooms is mostly for “reading and quiet time,” Faye admits (that’s full of cuddling!). Faye’s favorite part of the space is the bookshelf wall while her daughters love their bunk bed the most. “I love how sweet and cozy the rooms are,” she explains. “The girls are happy to have unique rooms that feel special to them.”",
