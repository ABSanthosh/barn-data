  "text": "Microsoft 365 Sign in to your MUO account Despite charging you more for its new, AI-inclusive plan, Microsoft is actually taking some features away. In an effort to thrust its Copilot AI tool on you, Microsoft Office apps will no longer offer Smart Lookup, one of its former research features. If you've ever needed a quick definition or synonym while using Microsoft Word or Powerpoint, you've probably used Smart Lookup. The tool used to be accessible via a right-click, and would present you with references regarding your selected term in the right side panel. Now, according to Microsoft Support, the company has nixed the featureâ€”even if it still appears in your dropdown menu. At the time of writing, you can still right-click on a word and select Smart Lookup. However, the side panel will present you with the following message: \"We are sorry, but this feature is deprecated.\" The panel will then point you to Office.com, and suggest that you search for the word on Bing. Thanks, but no thanks. Microsoft Continues Its Campaign For Copilot Despite oddly guiding you towards Bing for your search needs, the real writing on the wall here is that Smart Lookup is no longer necessary when there's Copilot. Copilot can do what Smart Lookup did and more; you can easily use the AI-assistant to look up definitions and synonyms, among other related tasks. The problem is: not everyone is ready to jump on the Copilot train. Since Microsoft combined its Office apps with Copilot, Microsoft 365 plans all got more expensive, automatically. To avoid the unexpected price hike, many have opted out of the new bundle, essentially downgrading to a Microsoft 365 plan without Copilot. Microsoft now calls these \"Classic\" plans. Unfortunately, those on Classic plans will not only lose access to Smart Lookup, but they also won't have Copilot to replace it. Of course, if you never used Smart Lookup, then you won't notice any difference. Personally, I've always just used my browser for additional research, or when I've needed a thesaurus. Then again, I'm one of those people who's happy to work in a sea of windows and tabs, and that's certainly not everyone's style. It all seems quite convenient, doesn't it? I understand that as technology evolves, companies have to stop offering support for outdated models. We see this, for example, with Apple's \"obsolete\" list of Macs. Maybe retiring this feature was necessary for Microsoft to give its full attention to its new software. Or, maybe Smart Lookup is a hostage Microsoft is leveraging to force us into (Copilot) compliance.",

Since \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-365-office-apps-copilot-bundle/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMicrosoft combined its Office apps with Copilot\u003c/a\u003e, Microsoft 365 plans all got more expensive, automatically. To avoid the unexpected price hike, many have opted out of the new bundle, essentially \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-365-subscription-with-copilot-price-increase/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edowngrading to a Microsoft 365 plan without Copilot\u003c/a\u003e. Microsoft now calls these \u0026#34;Classic\u0026#34; plans. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, those on Classic plans will not only lose access to Smart Lookup, but they also won\u0026#39;t have Copilot to replace it. Of course, if you never used Smart Lookup, then you won\u0026#39;t notice any difference. Personally, I\u0026#39;ve always just used my browser for additional research, or when I\u0026#39;ve needed a thesaurus. Then again, I\u0026#39;m one of those people who\u0026#39;s happy to work in a sea of windows and tabs, and that\u0026#39;s certainly not everyone\u0026#39;s style. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt all seems quite convenient, doesn\u0026#39;t it? I understand that as technology evolves, companies have to stop offering support for outdated models. We see this, for example, with \u003ca href=\"https://www.makeuseof.com/old-mac-models-added-apple-obsolete-list/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eApple\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;obsolete\u0026#34; list of Macs\u003c/a\u003e. Maybe retiring this feature was necessary for Microsoft to give its full attention to its new software. Or, maybe Smart Lookup is a hostage Microsoft is leveraging to force us into (Copilot) compliance. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
