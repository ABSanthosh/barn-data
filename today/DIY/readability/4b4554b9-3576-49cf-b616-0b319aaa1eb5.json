A nice touch to have your name on a FRAKTA bag. 1 in 2 Owns A FRAKTA Bag Photo Credit: IKEA.com The FRAKTA bag, meaning ‘to freight’ in Swedish, has been a staple of IKEA for over three decades. Originally designed to help customers carry their purchases, it has since become a symbol of resourcefulness and adaptability. From laundry basket to beach bag, and even a trusty companion for city commuters, the FRAKTA has proven its versatility time and again. Nearly half of UK households (45%) own one, with many (31%) keeping theirs for over five years. Belén Frau Uriarte highlights the bag’s significance: “The Hus of FRAKTA is more than a celebration of a product; it’s a fusion of fashion and our principles of democratic design, paying tribute to this iconic shopping destination and welcoming our new neighbors.” FRAKTA Hacks: Creative Uses for the Iconic Blue Bag Today the humble blue bag has become a cultural icon – reimagined by iconic designers including Zandra Rhodes and Marimekko along the way. But it’s not just the designers who have embraced its versatility. The FRAKTA is also regularly reinvented by IKEA hackers. Here are a few of our favorite FRAKTA hacks. 1. Bridal Bathroom Helper The FRAKTA bag can be your best friend on your wedding day. Cut a hole at the base of the bag and turn it into a portable bathroom helper that can hold up your dress as you navigate the difficulties of taking a leak in a bridal gown. 2. Roll-Top Backpack Transform your FRAKTA into a stylish and functional roll-top backpack. You’ll need 4-5 large blue bags for enough material to create a durable, ultralight, waterproof backpack. 3. Bean Bag Chair Sew multiple FRAKTA bags together and fill them with foam beads to create a unique, waterproof bean bag chair. It’s a fun and affordable way to add extra seating to your home or garden. 4. Dog Raincoat Keep your furry friend dry with a DIY dog raincoat made from a FRAKTA bag. Cut the bag to fit your dog’s size, add some Velcro straps for easy fastening, and you’ve got a waterproof raincoat that’s both functional and fashionable 5. Tomato Planter Bag Use the FRAKTA bag as a planter for tomatoes and other plants. Its durable material and large size make it an excellent container for growing plants. Just poke holes, add soil, plant your seeds, and watch them thrive. These creative hacks showcase the versatility of the FRAKTA bag, proving that it’s more than just a shopping bag.
