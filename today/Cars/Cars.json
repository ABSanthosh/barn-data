    "description": "This 1942 Packard Super Eight Custom One-Eighty is the 13th of 15 examples produced with style-1529 Convertible Victoria coachwork designed by Howard “Dutch” Darrin and built by the Sayers and Scovill Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, during the final year of the Packard-Darrin partnership. It is said to have been purchased in the early 1950s by a California collector who commissioned a refurbishment with the assistance of San Francisco Packard dealer Earle C. Anthony before the car appeared in a September 1953 issue of Road \u0026 Track. It was subsequently sold to an owner in Houston, Texas, and later returned to California, where it served as one of two Packard-Darrins utilized in the filming of the television detective show Banacek. The car then spent time in two New Jersey collections before moving to Florida and then residing in the Michigan-based Adderley Collection for 16 years, during which it is said to have undergone another refurbishment. Finished in maroon over red leather, the car is powered by a 356ci L-head inline-eight that breathes through a single downdraft carburetor and is mated to a column-shifted three-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Additional features include hydraulic drum brakes, Safe-T-fleX independent front suspension, a red convertible top, and a push-button radio. This Series 2006 Convertible Victoria was purchased by the selling dealer approximately six months ago and is now offered with a clean Missouri title.",

    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "description": "The MG Windsor EV is currently India’s bestselling electric vehicle. Credit to MG, then, that it hasn’t waited for interest to wane before bringing out an upgrade. The Windsor EV Pro you see here gets a larger battery and joins the Windsor line-up as the new range-topper, in both price and actual range.  MG Windsor EV Pro design and engineering - 8/10 Mono-volume MPV-esque silhouette stands out among SUVs The MG Windsor has quickly become a familiar sight across many Indian cities and stands out for its MPV-esque mono-volume silhouette. A healthy 186mm of ground clearance, a relatively wide body and large 18-inch rims also establish it as a fairly substantial vehicle. New alloy wheels are the biggest giveaway of this being the Pro variant. This Pro version is only differentiable by its new diamond-cut alloy wheels and ADAS badging on the tailgate. MG has also used the Pro’s launch to add three new paint shades to the Windsor palette – Celadon Blue, Aurora Silver and Glaze Red, as featured here. MG Windsor EV Pro interior space and comfort - 9/10 Spacious and practical interior, thanks to born-electric architecture  If there’s an area where born-electric vehicles like the MG Windsor have a distinct advantage over combustion-engined models re-engineered as electrics, it is space utilisation. The Windsor EV measures just under 4.3 metres in length, but cabin space is significantly better than most like-sized petrol or diesel SUVs. The rear-seat space is a highlight, with ample legroom even for taller occupants and enough shoulder room for three adults to sit comfortably. A flat floor helps middle-passenger comfort, and then there’s the seat. Well-padded and with the option to recline the backrest to a generous degree, it is good enough to interest buyers looking for a chauffeur-driven vehicle. Rear-seat comfort remains a highlight, with ample space for three abreast.  Giving the Windsor EV Pro’s cabin a slightly different vibe is its dual-tone, ivory-on-black colour theme. For reference, the standard Windsor EV gets an all-black theme. While the lighter upholstery does lend a slightly more premium look to the cabin, it will need more attention and effort to keep clean. Another notable point common to all Windsors is that the front seats aren’t as comfy as the ones at the back and feel firmer in their cushioning. White upholstery looks premium but will need effort to keep clean. In every other way, the Windsor EV Pro is identical to the standard model. A massive 15.6-inch touchscreen dominates the dash, with only a few physical buttons for the climate control and hazard lights tucked away lower down. Supplementing the large screen is a smaller, free-standing digital instrument display. It’s a very modern and airy setting that uses colours and textures (there’s a dull wood finish as well as champagne gold details) to good effect, but user-friendliness is a mixed bag. There’s just too much packed onto the touchscreen, and the need to navigate multiple menus on the go is far from ideal. Practicality is well taken care of with plenty of storage, including a large bay under the floating centre console. Access to the luggage area is via a new powered tailgate, and usable space is impressive. The lack of a spare wheel is a big miss, though.   MG Windsor EV Pro features and safety - 9/10 Equipment list is quite extensive for the money  Large 15.6-inch touchscreen controls most functions, including headlights.  The Windsor EV Pro is only offered in the fully loaded Essence trim and packs in lots for the money. Aside from the touchscreen and digital dials, the list includes LED headlights, a powered driver’s seat, front seat ventilation, a panoramic glass roof, configurable ambient lighting, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a loud Infinity sound system and connected tech. Over the standard Windsor, the Windsor Pro also gets additions, such as a powered tailgate and capabilities including vehicle-to-load (V2L enables you to use your vehicle to power appliances) and vehicle-to-vehicle (with V2V, your vehicle can juice up another EV). New ADAS functions have an inconsistent response.  In terms of safety, the Windsor EV Pro builds on the standard Windsor EV’s six airbags, electronic stability control, electric parking brake and ISOFIX child seat mounts with camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The ADAS suite includes intelligent light assist, lane keep assist, emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Over our test route from Guwahati to Shillong, we found that the ADAS, at times, reacted unnaturally to the driving environment. For instance, on a smooth and clear road, the cruise control would drop speed as if it had detected a vehicle in the vicinity. Lane keep assist was also not consistent in its responses.   A 360-degree camera is included, and it helps in placing the Windsor EV. However, the screen takes quite some time to boot on start-up, so you’ll have to wait patiently if you want a bird’s eye view of your surroundings. Wish MG could have tacked on a rear wiper, which remains a glaring omission on an otherwise feature-loaded car. MG Windsor EV Pro performance and refinement - 8/10 Performance is linear and leisurely  The four drive modes bring about a noticeable difference in power delivery. The EV Pro packs the same 136hp and 200Nm front motor as the standard Windsor EV. Performance is not urgent, but the linear build of power is relaxing. There are four drive modes, and a physical toggle allows easy access. However, we’d recommend you keep to the default Normal setting. Eco and Eco+ feel strangled and should only be used when you are worried about range. Sport mode makes performance sprightlier but also saps charge and range the quickest. While the motor runs quietly, road, wind and suspension noises disturb the calm inside; more on that later. MG Windsor EV Pro ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Hint of firmness at low speeds, vertical movements at higher speeds  The Pro’s larger battery and ADAS addenda have upped the vehicle’s weight by 93kg. At 1.6 tonnes, the Windsor EV Pro is quite heavy for its size, but you won’t feel it as much thanks to the steering that’s light and easy to twirl at low speeds. At higher speeds, too, you get a reasonable sense of connect. However, ride comfort could be better. There’s a firmness that comes through at low speeds, and you can also hear the suspension at work. Up the pace, and there’s also road and wind noise in the cabin. Easy cruises are fine, but wavy surfaces manifest in notable vertical movements. It’s not as settled as, say, a Tata Nexon EV. Ride quality isn't as settled as some of its rivals. Press down on the brake pedal, and you’ll find the Windsor that’s equipped with disc brakes on all four wheels to drop speed with confidence. There’s regen braking, too, with three levels on offer, and you can feel the difference between the levels. However, it lacks the one-pedal drive feature, and there are no physical controls such as paddle shifters to toggle between the regen levels. You have to go into the touchscreen menus, which isn’t ideal. MG Windsor EV Pro range - 8/10 Has an ARAI-claimed range of 449km  The biggest update on the Windsor EV Pro is under the skin. The standard Windsor EV’s 38kWh battery makes way for a 52.9kWh one on the Pro. Consequently, the ARAI-tested range figure jumps to 449km on a single charge from 332km on the standard car. While we will do a full range test when we get the car for a longer duration in Mumbai, it must be mentioned that the standard Windsor’s 308km real-world range achieved over our test loop was very close to the claimed 332km figure. Should the EV Pro deliver the similar efficiency, it’s safe to assume real-world range in the region of 400km-plus. MG Windsor EV Pro price and verdict - 8/10 Remains a very likeable car with the bonus of added range If you were drawn to the MG Windsor EV Pro’s tempting Rs 17.49 lakh launch price, you should know you’ve missed the bus. It was valid only for the first 8,000 buyers. MG has bumped up Windsor EV Pro’s ex-showroom price to Rs 18.1 lakh, which is Rs 2.1 lakh higher than the Windsor with the smaller battery. The added outlay gets you a few more features, but the real hook is the enhanced range. For anyone intending to use their vehicle for intercity commutes, it’s the easy pick of the range. The new Pro variant is the pick of the range for intercity commutes. MG should have worked on the user interface, too, and the ADAS calibration seems rushed, but in other areas, the Windsor EV Pro is very likeable. The roomy cabin makes it a family-friendly choice, performance is pleasant, and you get lots of comfort features for the money. The Windsor EV was already easy to recommend as an electric car. And the Windsor EV Pro is even more so. Also See: MG Windsor Pro video review",

    "description": "JLR treats its oldest model to some new kit to mark 35 years of Discovery The Land Rover Discovery has been treated to a pair of special editions and some subtle updates in a bid to sustain its appeal as it enters its eighth year on sale.  The primary additions for the 2026 model year are a pair of new special-edition Discovery models that JLR says have been designed to \"honour Discovery's 35-year legacy with subtle nods to the model's history in their names\". The 'Tempest' special edition takes its name from the codename used for the second-generation Discovery in the run-up to its launch in 1998. Available in a choice of three colours, it comes with a matte protective film, a contrasting copper roof and trim details, bespoke badging and bespoke wheel designs.  The 'Gemini' edition, meanwhile, is named as a nod to the original Discovery's turbodiesel engine. Available in six colours and with similar bespoke trim elements, it also brings special Gemini badging, a cooler compartment in the back seat, device holders on the seatbacks and three-zone climate control as standard.  In addition to the new special editions, JLR has rolled out a trio of 'curated' accessory packs: Beach Days, Road Trip and Snow Days - each equipped with a suitable selection of optional extras. There have been no changes under the skin, so the Discovery continues to be offered exclusively with the mild-hybrid, 3.0-litre Ingenium D350 diesel straight six, which develops 345bhp and 516lb ft give a 0-62mph time of 6.3secs, up to 33.4mpg and a towing capacity of 3500kg.  Prices for the freshened-up Discovery start at £64,810, or £63,775 for the van-backed Commercial variant. The updates come nearly nine years since the current-generation car was revealed at the 2016 Paris motor show, making the seven-seater comfortably JLR's oldest model line. Despite its age, though the Discovery remains an important part of the company's global line-up, even as it enters its eighth year on the market; in the 12 months to the end of March, JLR recorded more than 14,000 Discovery sales - which is more than the Jaguar F-Pace sold in its final year in production. However, while the Discovery remains a relatively steady seller, it continues to slip further into the shadow of the closely related, yet vastly more popular Defender - which sold more than eight times as many units last year.  Work is under way on a next-generation Discovery model, with the priority being to more clearly distinguish it from the Defender and move it into its own \"unique territory\" - though JLR has not given any indication of when that new car might arrive.",

You also get the chance to take a look behind the door, access what others can't and, importantly, own something nobody else does.All Bentleys offer some of this - which is why there are 46 billion ‘curated by Mulliner’ option combinations for a Bentley Continental GT alone and why new Bentley buyers spend on average £30,000 on them.You can double that amount for those who opt into the next-level ‘Mulliner bespoke’ line-up. This is one of the reasons why Bentley posted its biggest-ever profits in 2023, up 82% on just a 4% increase in vehicle sales: do a bit more work, earn a lot more money. (I’ll try suggesting this at my next pay review and let you know how I get on. Bespoke by Prior.)But for some people, even these increasingly exclusive option combinations aren’t enough.

    "description": "Over the weekend of the Barber Vintage Festival, I had a few goals: to show off a few bikes, hang with friends, and race my 1960 Harley-Davidson pan/shovel (or “dirt shovel”) in the cross-country race. This race was usually reserved for the likes of Hondas, Yamahas, Husqvarnas, OSSAs, and Pentons. Needless to say, I was the odd man out and loving it. Most of my fellow riders would be on sub-300-lb bikes. But my dance partner of choice was a 600-lb, 1200cc Milwaukee gorilla. Oh, and did I mention it was the early stock rigid chassis? Even at registration, they asked me repeatedly, “Are you sure you wanna go through with this?” They obviously didn’t know my reputation for throwing this thing down fire roads, power line trails, ice lakes, and flat tracks every chance I get.…",

This is the limited edition 2025 Harley-Davidson Fat Boy Gray Ghost (spoiler alert: it’s really shiny). Harley didn’t expect to keep making the Fat Boy past its first iteration in 1990.

    "description": "The Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX has been unveiled overseas. It is a limited-production motorcycle, of which only 1,200 units will be produced worldwide. The bike features a striking yellow paint scheme and a more committed rider’s triangle. The Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX is limited to 1,200 units worldwide The bike features a neon-yellow paint job with ‘RX’ graphics It has a more aggressive riding position with new clip-ons Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX unveiled The RX continues to use the Brembo Stylema Calipers with Ohlins EC 3.0 suspension Like its name suggests, the RX is based on the 2025 Speed Triple 1200 RS. To earn the RX suffix, the Speed Triple 1200 has undergone several revisions to its rider’s triangle. It now features sportier ergonomics, with the clip-ons set lower and farther from the rider. Additionally, the foot pegs are more rear-set and positioned slightly higher. Braking duties are handled by twin, radially mounted Brembo Stylema calipers. The bike runs on 17-inch wheels wrapped in Pirelli Supercorsa V3 tyres. The RX retains the latest Ohlins EC 3.0 semi-active suspension, paired with an Ohlins SD EC steering damper. Powering the RX is the same 1,163cc inline-three liquid-cooled engine, producing 183hp at 10,750rpm and 128Nm at 8,750rpm, mated to a 6-speed gearbox. The RX also features a special Akrapovic end can. Although this exhaust is made from carbon fibre and titanium, it hasn’t resulted in any weight savings. At 199kg (kerb), the Speed Triple 1200 RX remains one of the lightest litre-class streetfighters. With only 1,200 units slated for production, the RX is priced at GBP 19,000 (Rs 21.62 lakh approximately), an increase of GBP 1,500 (Rs 1.70 lakh) over the standard Speed Triple 1200 RS. It remains to be seen whether Triumph allocates any units of this exclusive RX model for India. Also see: Ducati Diavel V4 RS leaked, launch expected in 2026",

    "description": "The Toyota Corolla Cross – essentially an SUV based on the popular Corolla (sold as a hatchback and sedan in select markets) – has received a facelift and a sportier GR Sport variant. This is the second facelift for the Corolla Cross in as many years, and the first time the SUV has been offered in a sportier GR variant. Corolla Cross facelift gets minor exterior and interior changes GR Sport gets mechanical and design changes 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross facelift: exterior and interior changes 2025 facelift gets new LED light signatures and a new front grille Compared to the model revealed in February last year, the 2025 Corolla Cross features minor design changes. The headlights and tail-lamps now have new DRL signatures, the front bumper gets a new mesh design, and the headlights are now connected by an illuminated bar, on which sits the Toyota logo. The side profile is also the same as the outgoing model, except for the new 18-inch dual-tone alloy wheels. Centre console sees biggest updates On the inside, the updates are subtle as well. The facelift features new AC controls, a new gear shift knob, and a larger centre console, which incorporates an additional smartphone storage area, a sliding storage box, and revised cup holders. As before, the 10.5-inch infotainment touchscreen and the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster remain, along with features like a Level 2 ADAS suite, a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, a heated steering wheel, and seat heating. No mechanical changes There are no mechanical changes compared to its predecessor, with the Toyota Corolla Cross being offered with two hybrid powertrains: a 140hp, 1.8-litre petrol-electric (Hybrid 140) and a 197hp, 2.0-litre petrol-electric (Hybrid 200). The 2.0-litre powertrain also comes with an AWD option, which now features a Snow mode, previously unavailable on the Corolla Cross. Toyota claims a 0 to 100kph time of 9.9 seconds for the Hybrid 140, 7.6 seconds for the FWD Hybrid 200, and 7.5 seconds for the AWD Corolla Cross. 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross GR Sport: exterior and interior changes GR Sport gets larger alloys, exclusive exterior colour and sportier interior theme On the outside, the sportier GR Sport variant gets all-black 19-inch alloy wheels, a sharper nose and more aggressive bumpers, along with an exclusive Storm Grey and black dual-tone exterior finish. Naturally, GR logos also feature on the front grille and on the tailgate. The interior of the GR Sport features Brin-Naub upholstery, which is a suede-like synthetic leather, long with contrasting red stitching and GR logos.   2025 Toyota Corolla Cross GR Sport: mechanical changes It gets a more aggressive Sport mode and lowered suspension Compared to the standard Corolla Cross, the GR Sport variant has been lowered by 10mm. The Sport mode for the e-CVT gearbox gets a more aggressive setting while accelerating and decelerating. Toyota Corolla Cross India launch plans shelved The previous Toyota Corolla Cross was under consideration for an India launch. Codenamed 340 D and also known as the Toyota C SUV at the time, the brand was evaluating a rollout from its Karnataka plant for June 2026. It should be noted that the Corolla Cross and the Innova Hycross, currently on sale in India, share the same modular TNGA-C platform. However, the potential annual volume of 75,000 units did not meet the technical commercial viability for Toyota, which is why the Corolla Cross hasn’t made it to our shores.
