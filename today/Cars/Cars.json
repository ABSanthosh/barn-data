    "description": "This Maserati GTi Sebring was manufactured in April 1967 as one of 247 Series II examples produced, 134 of which were powered by a 3,694cc DOHC inline-six. Chassis 571 was initially delivered in Milan, Italy, and remained in the country under the care of several owners through the mid-2010s, when it was relocated to Belgium. The current owner purchased the car as a project in 2016, and subsequent refurbishment work included stripping the body, placing it on a rotisserie, performing metal repairs, and refinishing it in silver. The replacement engine and the five-speed gearbox were also overhauled, as were the brake and suspension systems. A refresh of the interior in black leather was carried out, and upon conclusion of the project, the car was the recipient of an award at the 2018 Concours d'Elegance Paleis Het Loo held in the Netherlands and appeared at the Antwerp Concours d’Elegance later that year. It achieved Maserati Classiche certification before being displayed as part of the 110 Years of Maserati exhibition at Autoworld in Brussels, Belgium, between late 2024 and early 2025. This Series II Sebring is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in Brussels, Belgium, with a tool kit, refurbishment photos, copies of factory records, Maserati Classiche certification documents, and Belgian registration.",

    "description": "The Honda Activa is the single largest selling scooter in India and has unmatched brand recognition in our market. Yet, when the Activa e: debuted, because of some crucial misses, it didn't strike the right chord. The reason I bring this up is that we are about to discuss the Suzuki e-Access, which is another Japanese electric scooter bearing a badge that's well established in India. So, has Suzuki succeeded where its Japanese compatriot hasn't?  Suzuki e Access design and colours e Access has an unusual design and comes in three colours One glance at the e-Access will tell you that Suzuki has thrown the family scooter design rulebook out the window. Depending on who you are, that will be a good or bad thing. I think the e-Access looks a lot better in the flesh than in pictures, although that double ‘duck bill’ front end will be an acquired taste. Love it or hate it, this unconventional design will help it stand out on the road from the sea of family scooters. The e-Access can be had in three colours – black/red, green/silver and white/silver. The e-Access has a rather unconventional design. Suzuki e Access battery and range, charging time e Access uses an LFP battery with 95km claimed range Another area where Suzuki has gone down a different route than every other well-known electric scooter on sale is the e-Access’ battery chemistry. It uses an LFP (Lithium Ferrous Phosphate) battery in a market dominated by NCM (Nickel Cobalt Manganese) batteries. The two sides of that coin are that while LFP batteries are safer and longer lasting, they cannot match a similarly sized NCM battery in terms of energy density.  The fast charger can top up the e-Access' battery in just over 2 hours. Therefore, it's not surprising that Suzuki claims a 95km certified range from the e-Access' 3kWh battery, roughly 20 percent less than the equivalent e scooter using an NCM battery. Suzuki will supply a 600-watt portable charger, which takes 6 hours 20 minutes to top up said battery from flat to full. The company also says that it is going to set up fast charging stations at all its outlets this year itself. Using that charger will fully charge the battery in just 2 hours 12 minutes. Suzuki e Access features It is a decently feature-rich offering  Coming to the features front, while the e-Access has the usual gaffe of smart features (accessible via pairing your smartphone to the 4.2-inch TFT dash), three riding modes (Eco, Ride A and Ride B), a USB charging port and the like, I'd like to give a special mention to a very intuitive feature. The scooter’s seat stays open in the position you leave it unassisted (a la Bajaj Chetak), which is a very handy thing if you've got both your hands full. The seat stays open unassisted. The trouble is that the under-seat storage area on the e-Access can hold just 17 litres – about half the size of most other rivals. In fact, even the latest-gen petrol Access has a bigger boot than the e-Access. Missed opportunity, Suzuki. The 4.2-inch colour TFT display is bright and well-laid out, but the bezels are rather large. Suzuki e Access ride and handling It is a surefooted and predictable handler But where the company has played to its strengths are in the way the e-Access behaves once you start riding. We were given just 45 minutes on a go kart track, so our learnings aren't the most comprehensive. Even so, this thing showed real promise. It is a sure-footed and predictable handler but isn't energetic. While it isn't as energetic a handler as an Ather 450, our experience so far suggests that the e-Access is flickable enough that slicing your way through dense city traffic won't be an issue. Performance is also measured and calm, with a gentle and progressive build of power that will be welcoming for both newer riders and the average scooter user. Be warned though, if you're expecting a zippy EV experience, you may want to look elsewhere. 17-litre boot is much smaller than other EVs in this class. Suzuki e Access ride modes, regenrative braking Ride modes are well thought-out but switching between them isn't straightforward That being said, Suzuki has thought out the ride modes very well and you can easily bop around town even in Eco, which limits you to 55kph. However, Suzuki has needlessly complicated switching between the three modes. You can switch from Eco to either Ride A or Ride B on the move, but you can't switch between Ride A and Ride B while riding. Before you set off, you must program what Ride mode you'd like to switch to from Eco, and to change that, you'll need to stop again. Toggling between the riding modes should've been a more straightforward experience. Suzuki says this was done so that riders don’t get caught off-guard with the differing regenerative braking settings between Ride A and Ride B. To be honest, we think the difference isn’t that big and this seems like an unnecessary complication on an otherwise straightforward scooter.  Seating comfort seems to be bang on with a very neutral rider’s triangle complemented by a spacious, well-padded seat. We only went over a few plastic composite speed breakers placed on the track in our stint with it, so it's hard to pass a definitive verdict on suspension comfort. But the e-Access felt like it was ironing out a lot of the jolt. Suzuki e Access price expectation and verdict It's a well-engineered and thoughtful scooter, although pricing is a question mark So far, it's the typical Suzuki story. It's a practical, well thought-out and high-quality machine, which is what most potential customers are looking for. So that's half the battle won. The problem is, since Suzuki hasn't revealed the price (or so much as given a hint about it), summing this rather likable e-scooter up is something we'll reserve for another day. The e-Access is a sorted package, but its pricing will determine its success. However, if Suzuki does manage to price it sensibly (around the Rs 1.20 lakh ballpark, ex-showroom), then I think the e-Access will find takers as it is a no-nonsense and practical offering that comes from a steadfast Japanese brand that's known for its reliability the world over.

    "title": "Official: Toyota to build GR Corolla in UK",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-toyota-build-gr-corolla-uk",
    "description": "Massive demand from the US will boost the Burnaston plant's output Toyota will build the GR Corolla hot hatch in the UK from next year in a bid to cater to increasing demand. Confirming this week's report from Reuters, the Japanese manufacturer said it had chosen the Corolla plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire, to boost GR Corolla production and preparations had been under way since last year. The hot Corolla will be the first GR model to be built outside Japan. Toyota said Burnaston – Toyota Manufacturing UK – was a natural fit because of the capability of the factory and its staff. It also pointed to the \"deep motorsport culture\" in the UK aligning with its GR (Gazoo Racing) sub-brand. The business case was almost certainly swayed by the fact that Burnaston also has a large and ready supply of Corolla bodies and ancillaries. Toyota added that the decision comes as part of a wider production overhaul aimed at accelerating production and customer delivery times. Indeed, GR Corolla buyers in the US have typically faced long waiting lists and dealer-added cost mark-ups since the car's launch in 2022, owing to strong demand for the model. Production and investment levels will be announced by the firm at a later date, but Reuters previously said it would cost £41 million to add the new line at Burnaston and that would give a capacity of 10,000 cars annually. Reuters added that Toyota’s Motomachi plant in Japan – the so-called GR Factory, responsible for output of the GR Corolla, GR Yaris and GR86 – is currently at full capacity. It assembled 25,000 GR cars last year, of which around a third were Corollas. As well as boosting overall output of GR Corollas, the addition of UK production will surely give Toyota additional flexibility to build other models at Motomachi. It could ramp up GR Yaris production, for example, or add entirely new models at the factory. As previously reported by Autocar, Toyota-owned Lexus is priming a new flagship sports car that is expected to compete in GT3 racing series from next year. It is most likely that Motomachi would host assembly of this model, given it previously housed its predecessor, the LFA supercar. The GR division has also been working on an all-new Celica coupé and is thought to be considering replacements for the MR2 (discontinued in 2007) and Supra, plus a Mazda MX-5 rival. Although the plan to boost GR Corolla production through the UK has not been informed by US president Donald Trump’s tariffs, given it pre-dates Trump's presidency, the decision to export from the UK surely benefits the company on that front. The US currently charges a tariff of 25% on all cars imported to the country from abroad, including Japan. However, the UK recently agreed to negotiate a deal that will cut the fee for its exports to 10%, within a national quota of 100,000 cars. Final details have yet to be confirmed but at present Toyota would have to pay a smaller fee on UK-built GR Corollas than on those from Japan. The prospect of adding production in the UK also lends weight to the possibility that the GR Corolla – currently offered in only a handful of markets, including the US and Japan – could be set for a launch in Europe. Prototypes were last year spotted testing at Germany's Nürburgring, hinting at a launch. A spokesperson suggested it was standard procedure to test global products at the circuit but did not deny the prospect. Toyota currently sells the GR Yaris and the GR Supra in Europe, the GR86 having been killed off in that market (including the UK) by the European Union’s GSR2 safety regulations. The Supra is soon to follow. Regardless, the plan to produce GR Corollas in the UK will come as welcome news to staff at the Burnaston plant, which last year built its five millionth car since opening in 1992. In a statement, Yoshihiro Nakata, president and CEO of Toyota Motor Europe, said: “We are proud that TMUK, our first plant in Europe, has also been selected as the first overseas Toyota plant to produce GR vehicles, securing this expansion project for TGR worldwide. We very much appreciate the historical support and recognition of the United Kingdom and would like to continue to contribute to UK society as a ‘Best in Town’ company.”",

    "description": "There’s no denying the popularity of the classic BMW boxer—but it does have its idiosyncrasies. Perhaps the most infamous of these is the way its fuel tank leans one way, while its substantial engine block leans another. This visual disharmony didn’t sit well with Earth Motorcycles. Faced with a 1987 BMW R80RT and a client who wanted a slick café racer, the Slovakian custom shop resolved to massage the old boxer’s individual parts into alignment. “Typically, this imbalance forces builders to angle the rear of the seat upwards, giving the bike a more aggressive, dramatic posture,” says Earth’s founder, Vlado Dinga. “Like many others, Earth has gone that route before. But this time, we chose to challenge the geometry instead of accepting it.”…",

    "description": "Kia has introduced the third model year update for its all-electric EV9 SUV flagship in the US. In addition to improved range for select 2026 EV9 variants, a new Nightfall Edition featuring both exterior and interior, and performance upgrades is also on offer.  Kia EV9 Nightfall Edition features a Boost mode for extra torque output The electric SUV is sold in four variants in the US; India gets only the fully-loaded GT-Line trim 2026 Kia EV9 range details Up to 16.1km range added While the Kia EV9 in India is available only in the top-spec GT-Line, it's also sold in Land, Wind, Light LR and Light SR trims in America. Of these, the updated EV9 GT-Line sees the biggest improvement in range, up 16.1km to 451km (brand estimated; the official US EPA test cycle figure may vary). For reference, Kia claims a 561km range with the EV9 on the Indian ARAI test cycle. The Land and Wind variants note a 4.82km jump at 455km, while the Light LR settles with a tiny 1.6km jump at 491km. The Light SR variant comes with a 76.1kWh battery pack, whereas, the other three variants get a 99.8kWh unit. 2026 Kia EV9 Nightfall Edition Blacked-out exterior bits, Boost mode adds 100Nm torque Exclusive to the second-from-top EV9 Land variant, the all-new Nightfall Edition applies a black treatment to the 20-inch wheels and exterior badges. Despite the dark-themed bits, this isn't a usual 'Black Edition' we are used to seeing in India as it adds a Roadrider Brown colour instead of black. As for the interior, the black theme extends to the dashboard, and both the six and seven-seater EV9 models get Nightfall Edition-specific stitching patterns. The Nightfall Edition also has a Boost mode which increases the EV9 Land trim's torque by 100Nm to 700Nm, matching the GT-Line top model's torque output.

    "description": "Jeep has revealed the first official images of the next-gen Cherokee ahead of its full debut later this year. Marking the return of the Cherokee nameplate - discontinued in 2023 after a decade-long production run - the SUV will slot between the Compass and Grand Cherokee in Jeep’s global line-up. New-gen Jeep Cherokee breaks cover with new design language Hybrid powertrain confirmed for the new Cherokee; petrol and EV versions likely coming too Jeep will fully reveal the new Cherokee later in 2025, with global launch set for 2026 New Jeep Cherokee design details The new-gen Cherokee adheres to Jeep’s latest design language - also seen on the recently-revealed third-gen Compass. Up front, the new Cherokee gets the hallmark Jeep seven-slot grille, flanked by large rectangular headlights with extended sections for the indicators. The front bumper features an abundance of black plastic cladding, with an air dam at the bottom and silver inserts on either side. Moving to the side reveals new alloy wheels, more plastic cladding, ‘Cherokee’ lettering on the front doors, and a blacked-out roof and pillars. Jeep has not released any images of the new Cherokee’s rear end, but it’s expected to prominently feature a large rectangular light bar, much like that of the latest Compass. Interior and features yet to be fully revealed Jeep also looks to be saving interior shots of the new Cherokee for the SUV’s full reveal later in the year. Despite that, the Cherokee expected to include a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, three-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel, all-digital instrument cluster, and a recessed touchbar for the climate controls. New Jeep Cherokee powertrains Hybrid setup confirmed The new Cherokee leverages Stellantis’ new STLA Large platform, which allows for hybrid, petrol, and all-electric configurations. Jeep has only confirmed a hybrid powertrain for the Cherokee right now, with precise details under wraps. Pure-petrol and EV versions will likely join the Cherokee line-up as well. The latter powertrain could share its mechanicals with the Wagoneer S electric SUV - a 100kWh battery, dual-motor setup. However, the output will expectedly be lower than the Wagoneer S' 600hp. Coming to the petrol Cherokee, it could use a version of Jeep’s 3.0-litre ‘Hurricane’ twin-turbo inline-6 engine, which develops 548hp and 707Nm in its most potent state of tune. New Jeep Cherokee launch details Launching in 2026 for overseas markets As mentioned previously, the new Jeep Cherokee will be fully unveiled later in 2025, with global market launches expected to begin in 2026. An India launch for the new Cherokee is unlikely. Also see: Jeep Wrangler Willys ’41 Edition sold out in India Jeep Compass Sandstorm Edition launched at Rs 19.49 lakh",
