    "description": "This 1967 Ford Mustang is one of two fastbacks that were modified when new by Carrozzeria Zagato in Milan, Italy. Zagato's work involved fitting bespoke front bodywork with a hood scoop, a narrowed grille, and rectangular Carello headlights as well as repainting the car from white to Holly Green and retrimming the front seats in two-tone upholstery. The car was taken off the road by its original owner in 1984 and remained in storage until 1995, when it was sold to the family of the current owner, Fabio Di Pasquale. Di Pasquale repainted the car white, as it had left the Ford factory, and it was driven regularly for the next two decades until a refurbishment was carried out c.2019. Since then, it has participated in the 2021 Mille Miglia and graced the pages of Autoitaliana and Octane magazines. The car is powered by a 289ci V8 linked to a four-speed manual transmission, and it has wheel covers, air conditioning,  a push-button radio, and a center console. This Mustang GT Zagato Elaborazione is now offered in Italy by the seller on behalf of the owner with a FIVA identity card and Italian registration.",

    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "SUVs big and small are all the rage, but there's another story developing on the sidelines – the rise of MPVs. MPVs outsold sedans in India last year and there's record interest in the body style high up the price ladder too. Kia's Rs 64 lakh (ex-showroom) Carnival is sold out for the year while Toyota delivered over 1,000 units of the Rs 1.22 crore Vellfire over the past 12 months. It’s customers like these who are happy to spend big on an MPV that MG wants to win over with its own luxury MPV. Meet the M9. MG hasn’t announced prices as yet but has hinted that the M9 will slot in right between the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. Giving the M9 more distinction is the fact that it’s the first all-electric luxury MPV in India. There’s lots to talk about, but MG’s review embargo rules mean we can only share opinion on the rear-seat experience for the moment. So pardon us for this coming across as an on-the-surface review at places. You may check back in on July 10 when we’ll have all aspects covered. MG M9 exterior design and engineering - 7/10 At 5.27m, the M9 is longer than a Carnival and Vellfire.  Being 5.27m long, 2m wide and 1.8m tall, the MG M9 is massive. For perspective, it’s longer and wider than the Carnival and Vellfire. The 3.2m wheelbase is large in its own right and hints at the space inside. The MG M9 rides on 19-inch rims wrapped in Continental Contiseal tyres. What’s interesting about these tyres is their viscous sealant layer that self-seals punctures up to 5mm. The M9 uses a monocoque construction and positions its 90kWh NMC battery pack under the floor. The battery powers a front motor that drives the front wheels. MG M9 interior space and comfort - 9/10 M9's middle-row seats are more like armchairs. Access to the M9’s middle row is via powered sliding doors that can be opened via a button on the door, the key fob or controls near the driver. It’s a slight step up into the cabin but a large grab handle at the B-pillar does help the journey in. The doors open to a massive cabin and what gets you first are the middle row seats. XL-sized, beautifully cushioned and finished in perforated leather and suede, the seats – scratch that – armchairs immediately establish the M9’s core competency – delivering a VIP experience for the boss sat at the back. In standard position, the middle-row seats are already very comfortable. The standard seat position is comfy in its own right and there’s 16-way power adjust too to control for everything from backrest recline and headrest height to seat slide and legrest position. One-touch functions make the job of setting the seat easier. For the full effect, you need to experience the seats at max extension (made possible with the middle row seat all the way back and front passenger seat electrically slid forward). Backrest at full recline and legrest rolled out, the seat feels no less than a recliner. Oh, and there’s seat ventilation and heating too, as well as eight soothing massage functions to choose from. The experience is every bit business class on land. Stretching out the seats to their max gives a recliner-like experience. While middle seat comfort is central to the M9’s appeal, the experience at the very back is pretty good too. You’ll have to make your way to the third row via the passage between the middle row chairs. It’s not quite a walk in but is convenient enough, as third rows go. The seating position is comfortable and there’s room for three average-sized adults to sit in comfort. Unusually, there’s no middle seat headrest or fold down armrest for the third row. Also note, the third row is all but unusable with the middle row seats fully extended. Third row has space for three adults, but no middle seat headrest.   MG M9 features and safety - 9/10 The M9 is offered in a single fully loaded variant. And MG has really gone the distance to pamper those sat at the back. As mentioned, the seats are fully powered with ventilation, heating and massage functions. There’s 64-colour ambient lighting, a dedicated climate control zone for the middle row, an onboard air purifier, a panoramic sunroof for the rear section of the cabin, a sweet-sounding 13-speaker JBL sound system and you can also get rear entertainment screens as an accessory. Middle-row passengers get a dedicated climate zone and panoramic sunroof. Seat adjustment, cooling and lighting functions are controlled by a screen on the middle seat armrests. Trouble is, the fixed position of the screen makes it hard to read in some lighting conditions and hard to reach when the backrest is all the way back. MG should have also given the M9 powered sun shades for the middle row windows. The manual operation isn’t in keeping with the M9’s price. On the subject, there are no sun shades for the third row windows and that means middle-seat passengers will feel the heat on their face at full recline. Armrest-mounted screen controls seat, cooling and lighting functions. There's a whole lot else packed in too which we’ll cover when the entire embargo lifts. MG M9 performance and refinement - 8/10 Refinement is a highlight on the M9. You do hear a whirr from the electric motor at very slow speeds, but otherwise, the powertrain runs quiet. Road, wind and suspension noise are also well contained yielding a soothing atmosphere on the go. MG M9 range and efficiency - 7/10 The M9 has a 90kWh battery, and while an ARAI-certified range figure is awaited, MG claims a 548km range achieved over internal tests. Internationally, though, the MPV has a certified WLTP range of 430km. On our drive, the M9 indicated a range of around 300km, but that was with a lot of time spent idling with the AC on during the shoot. We’ll only know the actual range once we put the M9 through our instrumented tests in Mumbai. MG M9 ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Small road imperfections aren't entirely ironed out at low speeds.  Where MG could have done more to pamper the M9’s crorepati clientele is in ride comfort. There’s a stiffness to the setup which means body movements are well contained at higher speeds. However, the suspension and tyres can’t iron out smaller imperfections at lower speeds as successfully. The low-speed ride feels a bit busy for what is a luxury car.   MG M9 price and verdict - 8/10 The M9 will be the first product to be retailed from MG’s premium MG Select network. These new showrooms will come up at 14 locations in the first phase and will soon also be the sale point for the sexy Cyberster electric sports cars. We won’t give a full verdict without talking about other aspects like the drive experience, performance and real-world range, but there’s no denying that the M9 delivers a plush rear-seat experience that should interest India’s chauffeur-driven elite. Vellfire-like comfort for a whole lot less money (we estimate a price of Rs 90 lakh) sounds like a great deal. Question is, will prospective buyers see the M9 for what it is? Or could the MG badge hold them back from spending big. Also see: MG M9 interior, seating and comfort review 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed review: Luxury SUV embraces its sporty side",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-vantage-s-returns-202mph-v8-brawler",
    "description": "Most potent series-production V8 Vantage yet brings track focus Aston Martin has revealed the Vantage S, the third-generation sports car’s most track-focused incarnation to date. It is the first time the S suffix has adorned a Vantage since 2018, and the new model follows the recently revealed DBX S as Aston brings back the badge for its highest-performing models. While the 671bhp Vantage S is the most powerful series-production version of Aston’s entry-level sports car yet (disregarding the extremely limited V12 Vantage of 2022), attention has been focused specifically on making it as quick as possible on track. To that end, engineers have worked to increase cornering speed and stability. Key to this is the fitment of a new ducktail spoiler, which has been tuned to push the overall downforce balance towards the front of the car. This is combined with new front and underbody aero to produce 111kg of downforce at top speed. Alongside this, Aston has reworked the 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 to deliver 671bhp while making the unchanged 590lb ft accessible higher up the rev range, where it is now produced between 3000rpm and 6000rpm. The car’s power delivery software has also been modified, with the driveby-wire throttle tuned to be more responsive and allow for better feel. Combined, this delivers a launch control-enabled 0-60mph time of 3.3sec (0.1sec quicker than before) and a 0-124mph time of 10.1sec. Top speed is unchanged at 202mph. While the car is 15bhp more powerful than before, that 0-124mph time is more than a second slower than that of Ferrari’s 631bhp Amalfi, the Italian car maker’s new entrylevel, Vantage-rivalling replacement for the Roma. Vast aero additions aside, the Vantage S is marked out by S badging inside and out, special satin black 21in alloy wheels and new blade-shaped front air intakes. Pricing for the new Vantage S is estimated to start at £170,000. Deliveries will begin in October.",

    "description": "Lexus addresses the key fl aw – and more – of its luxurious electric SUV With so many cars spuriously purporting to be sporty or have racing genes, it’s refreshing when the presentation for a new one hardly even mentions athleticism. The Lexus RZ is the firm’s flagship electric car, and instead it ought to offer “confidence, control and comfort”.Mind you, it still has up to 309bhp and will out-accelerate quite a few hot hatches.The RZ was Lexus' first step into getting serious about EVs. It had the UX 300e for a while, but that was never quite a heavy hitter, whereas this car is and goes toe to toe with the likes of the Tesla Model Y, Nissan Ariya and Hyundai Ioniq 5.The RZ shares its e-TNGA platform – which is bespoke to EVs – with the Toyota bZ4X and Subaru Solterra.A cheaper, front-wheel-drive model (badged 300e) joined the range in 2024 to address issues concerning range and price.",

    "description": "Triumph’s current crop of modern classics shows real divergence from model to model. From differences in engine size and tuning, to model-specific geometry and variations in parts that go beyond basic trim, each bike is built for a purpose. But that wasn’t always the case. Back in the air-cooled era, the Bonneville, Thruxton, and Scrambler were separated more by styling cues and ergonomics than substance. This approach to platform sharing was the inspiration behind this Triumph Bonneville café racer. It’s the work of our good friends Marcelo Obarrio and Germán Karp, who operate as STG Tracker out of Buenos Aires, Argentina. STG Tracker’s mission was to turn the 2011-model Triumph Bonneville T100 into a café racer; a riff on the traditional Thruxton formula, dialed to eleven.…",

The basic concept is that you can survive three minutes without oxygen, three hours of hypothermia, three days without water, and three weeks without food. While many motorcyclists may say they need their motorcycle as much as the air they breathe, the reality is that we can often be caught in inclement weather. And riding in cold and wet conditions can quickly lead to hypothermic conditions. While you can sometimes duck under an overpass to avoid getting saturated, there are products on the market that ensure you can keep logging miles when the going gets damp. Whether waterproof by design or easily stashable items for a rainy day, here are several key pieces of gear to consider for the long haul.…",

    "description": "Mahindra has begun a teaser campaign dubbed the freedom_nu in the lead-up to its annual Independence Day event, when it will unveil a ‘new platform vision’. Four new concept SUVs have been teased, and the campaign also carries both Mahindra’s EV and ICE Twin Peaks logos, which could be a nod to the platform’s multi-fuel capabilities. Mahindra has previously spoken about developing a house of brands, and each of these upcoming concepts is expected to add to a family of models going forward. Four names have been revealed – Vision T, Vision S, Vision X and Vision SXT – and a recurring theme across all four teasers is a top-angle view of the bonnet. Each of these suffixes, along with its respective design details, hints at the family of SUVs it’ll belong to. Let’s explore them in a little more detail. Mahindra Vision T This was the first teaser in the campaign, and the ‘T’ in the name likely points to the fact that it belongs to the Thar family. In fact, a close look at the top shot reveals details like a square bonnet, pronounced wheel arches, visible bonnet latches and even all-terrain tyres, seemingly hinting at an evolution of the Thar.e concept that the brand had showcased in South Africa back in 2023. This could perhaps be a closer to production version of the Thar.e concept. Also See: Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX image gallery Mahindra Vision S Up next is the Vision S, with the S in the name likely hinting at the Scorpio family. Like the Vision T, this too has a muscular demeanour with an upright nose and flared-out wheel arches, but the bonnet is more flattish, and it also appears to have bonnet scoops toward the edges. The Scorpio family currently comprises the N and the Classic, and this could be a third model in the family. Mahindra Vision SXT It’s unclear what exactly the Vision SXT will preview, but the details seen in the teaser suggest that it is related to the Vision T, which means it could be yet another derivative of the Thar family. It has a very similar bonnet with latches at either edge, a protruding bumper and flared wheel arches. It could even be a new body style, perhaps a pickup truck based on the Thar. Mahindra is not a complete stranger to pickups, having showcased the Global Pik Up concept in 2023.   Mahindra Vision X Last to arrive was the Vision X teaser, which is expected to preview a concept from the XUV family. This one doesn’t look as rugged as the above three, but instead features very stylistic and athletic lines on the bonnet, likely hinting at a more premium and urban positioning. In fact, this could be the long-awaited XEV 7e, which will be a more traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV. The XEV 7e has even been spied on test on several occasions with the top hat of an XUV700 and EV-specific updates and interior bits from the XEV 9e. A lot is still up in the air, and we will only have more details on August 15, when Mahindra officially takes the wraps off the concepts. But one thing is certain: Mahindra’s upcoming Independence Day gala doesn’t seem any less extravagant than any of the previous iterations. Stay tuned for more.

    "description": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO has four new variants, courtesy the new RevX trim line. Priced from Rs 8.94 lakh-12.99 lakh, the XUV 3XO RevX variants are petrol-only, and come with a few cosmetic changes outside and more features than the variants they are based on. New XUV 3XO variants named RevX M, RevX M(O), RevX A and RevX A AT Available with 111hp turbo or 131hp direct-injection turbo RevX trims get tweaked grille design, blacked-out wheels, dual-tone colours Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX price and position RevX M variant priced Rs 60,000 less than MX2 Pro; RevX A priced Rs 60,000 more than AX5.

Both these variants are powered by the 111hp, 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine that is paired to a manual gearbox. Meanwhile, the RevX A is based on the mid-spec XUV 3XO AX5, but gets the more powerful 131hp, 1.2-litre direct-injection turbo-petrol engine, along with manual and automatic gearbox options. The XUV 3XO RevX A costs about Rs 60,000 more than the AX5 and also gets more features. It should be noted that with the RevX A, Mahindra's 131hp engine has become more approachable by about Rs 83,000; the engine was available from the Rs 12.62 lakh AX5L onwards. Mahindra XUV 3XO RevX exterior and interior changes RevX trims available in five exterior dual-tone colour options only. To help differentiate from the standard variants, the new trim line gets changes to its exterior. Along with RevX badges, black 16-inch wheels (alloys on the RevX A and steel wheels with covers on the RevX M), and a body-coloured grille, these variants also get dual-tone colours as standard. There are five colour options to choose from: Tango Red, Everest White and Galaxy Grey get a black roof, while the Nebula Blue and Stealth Black get a grey roof finish. All RevX variants get black leatherette seats as standard. Regardless of the variant, all RevX trims get black leatherette seat covers as standard, giving the cabin a dual-tone look. While the safety kit is identical to the variants they are based on, the features list for the RevX is slightly longer. XUV 3XO RevX M adds driver’s seat height adjust, adjustable headrests, and rear seat arm rest. Compared to the XUV 3XO MX2, which gets a 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, 4 speakers, steering-mounted audio controls, keyless entry and follow-me-home headlights, the RevX M adds driver’s seat height adjust, adjustable headrests for all rear passengers and a rear seat arm rest with cup holders. The RevX M(O) adds a single-pane sunroof. XUV 3XO RevX A adds a panoramic sunroof. The XUV 3XO RevX A has the same safety features and features list as the AX5, though the new mid-spec variant adds a panoramic sunroof. Other feature highlights on the RevX A (and AX5) are the 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, 6 speakers, dual-zone climate control, a tyre pressure monitor, auto headlights and wipers, a rear wiper and defogger and a rear camera. It should be noted that features like a Level 2 ADAS suite, a 360-degree camera, an auto-dimming inside rear view mirror, an electronic parking brake and a cooled glove box, which are available with the higher AX5L variant, are not on offer with the RevX A.
