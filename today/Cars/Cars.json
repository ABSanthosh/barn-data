    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "A weekend escape in our long-term Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 4MATIC SUV was long overdue. No long termer of ours truly earns its stripes until it’s taken for a run up into the hills. And the Mumbai-Mahabaleshwar drive is nothing short of a trial by fire when it comes to real-world range. I’m happy to report that the big Merc absolutely aced it. Standard operating procedure is to top up our EV long termers at the Autocar India HQ on the 22kW AC charger before heading out. With the battery showing 99 percent, I was good to go. Within seven minutes, I was already on the lower entry ramp to the Atal Setu. This marvel of a bridge has been operational for over a year now, but I still find myself marvelling at how it has transformed the drive out of Mumbai. It’s dramatically reduced the journey time to Mahabaleshwar too – the drive took just three and a half hours! Phenomenal range makes road trips easy. The real highlight, though, was how effortlessly the EQS 450 devoured the kilometres. There was no need for hypermiling, no range anxiety, and absolutely no drama. At the base of the Ambenali ghat, 197km in, the state of charge still read a reassuring 48 percent. That gave me the confidence to push harder on the climb, which, admittedly, did eat up 22 percent of charge over the 30km ascent. Still, I rolled into Mahabaleshwar with 26 percent remaining – more than enough buffer. The return leg was even more impressive. I took the longer route back via Pune, with a detour through Wai that added nearly 50km. But thanks to a healthy dose of regeneration on the descent from 4,500 feet, I arrived back at base with a staggering 55 percent charge remaining after 320km of normal driving – and by that I mean no pussyfooting. That puts the real-world range at around 730km; downhill advantage, yes, but that’s exceptional for a car this size. Refinement levels are outstanding. Of course, efficiency like this doesn’t happen by chance. The EQS SUV’s design may not win over fans of traditional SUV styling – it’s more blob than brawn – but there’s serious aerodynamic intent behind its teardrop silhouette. Every curve and contour is tuned to cheat the wind, and it pays off handsomely in terms of range. It might lack visual ruggedness, but its slipperiness delivers where it counts. Inside, the EQS 450 continues to impress. The cabin is whisper-quiet, with barely any wind or tyre noise making its way in. On long road trips, that level of hush makes a huge difference. It’s genuinely relaxing – almost like travelling in a soundproof lounge. Brakes need better bite and stopping power. That said, it’s not without flaws. The brakes need work. The pedal lacks bite, and stopping power just doesn’t feel strong enough. You often find yourself relying heavily on regen to slow this 2,840kg SUV down, especially on steep descents. And while the air suspension does a decent job most of the time, it doesn’t always feel settled over broken surfaces, particularly on patchy sections of the NH66. Even in Sport mode, there’s noticeable vertical movement that takes away from the sense of composure. Lots of body movement can be felt on uneven roads. Charging in Mahabaleshwar wasn’t a problem, though it wasn’t quick either. I used a 3.3kW portable charger I keep at the house (bought online), which turned out to be twice as fast as the official 3.3kW 15A unit that, for some reason, wouldn’t go beyond 1.9kW. Even so, a full charge took 36 hours, but given that Mahabaleshwar is my hibernation zone, it suited the pace perfectly. So, what’s the takeaway? The EQS 450 4MATIC SUV may not fit the mould of a traditional luxury SUV, but it delivers where it matters most for an EV – range and refinement. It’s not without its quirks, but as a long-distance electric cruiser, it’s deeply impressive. This is the kind of machine that redefines the EV road trip, and does it with remarkable ease.

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "After recently debuting its new E-Clutch technology on its 650cc platform, Honda will soon add the same technology to the CL250 and Rebel 250.  Honda E Clutch allows for seamless gearshifts without using the clutch It adds nearly 3kgs to the Rebel 250 and CL250  Honda 250s to soon get E-Clutch E-Clutch a beneficial system to have on a beginner-friendly bike The E-Clutch technology is a semi-automatic transmission system that allows the rider to fore-go the use of the clutch allowing for a smoother ride, while retaining the ability to shift manually using the gear shifter. This means that the rider can pull away from a stop, shift up and down gears, and come back to a halt all without pulling in the clutch lever. This system is not a fully automatic one, like BMW’s ASA, Yamaha’s Y-AMT and Honda’s very own DCT seen on the Africa Twin, X-ADV and Gold Wing. While this tech had only previously been applied to Honda’s larger, more sporty motorcycles, the CBR650R and CB650R, its application on small bikes like the Rebel 250 and CL250 makes a lot of sense, as it eliminates the trials and tribulations of a traditional manual gearbox. Engaging and disengaging the clutch is always tricky for beginner riders and Honda's E-Clutch system acts like a safety net while still allowing the rider to retain manual control as they progressively get better at clutch control.  Aside from the addition of the E-Clutch, the rest of the motorcycles’ specifications will remain same, except the weight, where both motorcycles gain about 2.8kg due to the addition of the E-Clutch unit.  Also See: Honda CB650R, CBR650R now only available with E Clutch in India",

Both versions support fast charging and feature connectivity-enabled 4.3-inch displays. Government policy and safety regulation updates Delhi reverses fuel ban on 'end of life' vehicles After announcing a ban on fuel sales to end-of-life vehicles (petrol vehicles over 15 years old and diesel vehicles over 10 years old) on July 1, the Delhi government has now put the decision on hold due to public backlash and operational challenges regarding the automated number plate reader (ANPR) cameras installed at fuel stations. The ban may return in a few months' time once ANPR systems are fully implemented at fuel stations across Delhi-NCR to better detect end-of-life vehicles. Toyota Innova Hycross scores 5-star BNCAP rating The Toyota Innova Hycross has become the first Toyota, first MPV, and first hybrid vehicle to secure a 5-star safety rating in Bharat NCAP crash tests.

    "description": "Piers Thynne, operating chief for Autocar Award winner McLaren F1, spills all on its return to glory The McLaren Technology Centre still looks futuristic enough to double for a spaceport on Coruscant, so it’s staggering to reflect on the fact that it’s now 21 years old. Even more staggering given its age is that a constructors’ championship-winning McLaren had never been built there – until last year. When Lando Norris crossed the line to win the 2024 season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, McLaren ended a 26-year constructors’ championship drought – the longest in the history of the sport. The team came close a few times and clinched the 2008 drivers’ title with Lewis Hamilton, but there had also been some humiliating lows: in 2017 the Woking squadfinished ninth out of 10 teams. McLaren’s dogged climb back up the ranks and return to title-winning glory is why we have named the team the winner of our Motorsport Award. It would be easy to distil success in Formula 1 down to building a fast car, sticking a powerful engine in it (a Mercedes, in this case) and having two quick drivers – and in Norris and Oscar Piastri, McLaren might have F1’s strongest line-up. But there’s more to it than that. McLaren’s rise has been built on the efforts of the 1000 or so staff working incredibly hard in the McLaren Technology Centre. That effort has been led by Piers Thynne, the 17-year McLaren veteran whose role as chief operating officer means he essentially runs the factory. He describes last year’s Abu Dhabi race as “the culmination of an incredibly focused period of work for the whole team”. McLaren started 2024 trailing Red Bull on pace, but an upgrade package in Miami changed the pecking order, he says: “As a team we worked across all functions – aero, technical and operations – and dug deep to deliver a large upgrade for Miami. “That was a pivotal moment in the season.” Thynne describes his role as being “an enabler”, supporting all areas of the team to be the best that they can be. The role has also included a lot of work helping McLaren Racing boss Zak Brown and F1 team principal Andrea Stella to change the culture. “The culture of the team has gone from good to extremely positive in the past 18 to 24 months,” reveals Thynne, “and that has come from Zak and Andrea’s approach. “They empower me to drive that each and every day. We don’t need a hierarchy; we just need good people working together and having good conversations to ensure we are all pushing to deliver performance.” In sport, winning often cures everything, and the mood in the team has lifted as McLaren has started to win regularly. Thynne says success helps “drive the team forward”, but he adds that it’s important everyone understands they can’t rest on their laurels. “F1 is an extremely complex sport and things can go wrong,” he says. “When you’re celebrating success you still have to push reliability, push performance and push every opportunity to score points. “You have to be humble, but ultimately working in F1 is a privilege because you’re at the pinnacle of motorsport. You can never expect an outcome: an outcome is the result of the work you’ve put in. We ask everybody to avoid positive or negative hype and focus on what we need to do as a factory, which is to give Lando and Oscar the best equipment each and every race.” McLaren’s last constructors’ title in 1998 came in a different era of F1, with near-unlimited spending. Teams now have a cost cap (this year it’s £104 million), so much of Thynne’s effort is expended working out how McLaren can “extract every amount of performance per pound”. He adds: “It’s a really exciting challenge. It means the brainpower you put in is a competitive differentiator against others; you have to look at all angles of how you spend your money and where your focus should be.” As an example, he has to decide between spending money building a stock of spare parts in case of accidents against developing upgrades, and how much effort to put towards development of the car for 2026, when F1 will undergo a significant regulatory change with new chassis and powertrain rules. “We relish the challenge of regulation changes, because it gives the opportunity for the sport to reset,” he says. A reset isn’t always good news for F1’s top team: after Hamilton’s 2008 drivers’ title, a major regulation change for 2009 left McLaren struggling to compete at the sharp end. But trying to maintain its position at the head of the pack is a good problem for McLaren to face – one it hasn’t had to deal with for 26 years.",

    "title": "Safety fast: driving Aston's other F1 car",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/safety-fast-driving-astons-other-f1-car",
    "description": "Vantage and DBX 707 are the world's fastest emergency response vehicles Since 2021, Aston Martin has been on safety and medical car duty in F1 - we take them for a spin Only a few months in and already the 2025 Formula 1 season is proving to be a nail-biter, with the established driver order and team hierarchy under threat. So it’s fortunate that two cars present at every race are standing ready to intervene when things get messy. They are the official FIA safety and medical cars, since 1996 provided by Mercedes, but also now by Aston Martin. Coincidentally, and in the wake of the Spanish GP and Max Verstappen’s three penalty points for a late collision, the British manufacturer showed off both its safety and medical cars at its test and development centre beside Stowe Circuit, the short and sinewy track located inside the main track complex at Silverstone. Finished in the manufacturer’s trademark Racing Green with neon yellow accents on the side skirts and on the extended front splitter and rear wing, both unique to the car, and bristling with antennae and additional lighting, the Vantage has the presence necessary to bring 20 F1 drivers to heel. Its 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 produces 656bhp, and it does 0-62mph in 3.4sec. The cabin is fitted with a bespoke centre console incorporating multiple light and comms buttons, screens relaying live images of the track, a rear-view camera and a pair of six-point race harnesses. It means business, as does Bernd Mayländer, since 2000 the official FIA safety car driver and my chauffeur at the wheel of the vehicle today. “In this job you have to have been a race driver so that you can drive quickly but safely,” he explains. With a racing record that includes winning Le Mans in 2000 and driving for Mercedes in the DTM championship from 2001-04, Mayländer easily ticks that box. I’ve already taken the Vantage for a few cautious, solo laps of Stowe circuit but now it’s time for Mayländer to show me how it’s done. The track is only a little over one mile long and has eight corners plus a couple of straights. Mayländer’s three laps are a breathtaking display of on-limit control, interspersed with savage acceleration and ferocious braking. Commitment like this is essential when there are 20 F1 cars looming in his rear-view mirror, he says: “Especially when there’s debris on the track, the drivers don’t always know and maybe get frustrated because I’m holding them back. I try not to, but safety comes first.” Back at the garage, he describes how, on race day, he and long-serving co-driver, Richard Darker, will have been strapped into their Vantage at the pit exit with the engine running for at least 10 minutes before the start. “You feel the tension,” he says. Among recent races, the Australian Grand Prix stands out. “The rain was extreme and we had a few deployments and did 13 laps in total. In such conditions, you need a communicative car like the Vantage that lets you know where the track is drying out, which we report to the race director.” Meanwhile, poised at the back of the grid ready to deploy during the race’s critical opening lap, is the F1 medical car. It’s here at Stowe today – an Aston Martin DBX 707, one of two that have been in service since 2023. It replaced the original DBX safety car and, being a 707, has a 696bhp, 4.0-litre twin-turbo engine capable of catapulting the 2300kg SUV from zero to 62mph in 3.1sec. Fire extinguishers, medical bags and a defibrillator have their own dedicated storage compartments in the back, while the comms kit is packed in the spare-wheel well. Throughout the race, the on-board medic has access to communications from Race Control and can see not only the FIA marshalling system but also biometric data from the race drivers and live television images enabling early assessment of an incident. Official medical car driver Karl Reindler is a former professional racer who is covering 14 F1 races this season. “The job is more than just about driving a car fast,” he says. “You must also keep a cool head and have good situational awareness.” Especially so, he adds, when F1 cars can almost do two laps of a circuit in the time it takes the DBX – and the Vantage – to do one. Fortunately, the car is fast enough to complete the opening lap and park up ready to deploy before the race pack bears down. “On a deployment, we have to think fast and weigh up our priorities,” says Reindler. “For example, at the start of the F2 support race of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix last year, there was a three-car pile-up that required me and my medic co-driver to decide who to prioritise. \"One car was in the wall on fire, another was upside down and the driver was climbing out of the third. The fire team was on its way and could take care of the burning car so we went to the one that was upside down. Fortunately, the driver was okay.” For my final laps of Stowe circuit, the DBX 707 medical car looks a safe choice. Reindler gives the big SUV the full beans. It clings on securely, at one corner betraying only a hint of understeer that he has already anticipated. If I come a cropper on my way home, I know who to call.",

Suzuki Katana by AC Sanctuary The restomods produced by Japanese powerhouse AC Sanctuary have so much presence that they render hyperbole obsolete. This time, they’ve pulled out all the stops to deliver a hard-hitting Suzuki GSX1100S Katana for their most discerning customer: AC Sanctuary founder Hiroyuki Nakamura. Nakamura-san’s Katana takes the usual AC Sanctuary recipe and pushes it into overdrive.
