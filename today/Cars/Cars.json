    "description": "Suzuki’s stalwart supermini promises tech, style and an engaging drive. Does it deliver? In the current automotive landscape, the business case for bigger cars is easier to justify than that for smaller ones, which makes vehicles like the Suzuki Swift all the more unusual. The small car sector might seem alive and well in other countries, but in the UK, many of the little Suzuki's conventional rivals have been consigned to the history books. There's no longer a Ford Fiesta or a proper Mazda 2, and who remembers the Nissan Micra?It's not all bad news, though, because there are a few survivors, like the Hyundai i10, Volkswagen Polo, Renault Clio and Skoda Fabia, alongside a few EV alternatives like the Hyundai Inster and Renault 5. It helps, then, that the Swift is a car that we would recommend to buyers in such a market. Read on to find out why...The Suzuki Swift range at a glanceAll Swifts come generously equipped as standard. Entry-level Motion models get heated front seats, keyless entry, a rear-view camera, 16in alloy wheels and a 9.0in infotainment touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Step up to Ultra trim and you get automatic air conditioning, 16in alloys with a polished finish, rear-seat air vents and electrically folding mirrors.Prices start from just over £19,000 and rise to just over £20,000 for top-spec models.There's only one engine available: a 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol triple with mild-hybrid assistance. It's only as powerful as the non-electrified unit in its predecessor, but it's faster to 62mph and Suzuki claims it’s around 7% more fuel efficient. Cars fitted with the standard five-speed manual gearbox get from 0-62mph in 12.5sec and have a top speed of 103mph, while those fitted with the CVT automatic are a little faster, at 11.9sec to 62mph and 106mph at the top end.Suzuki’s Allgrip four-wheel drive system, like the one you used to find on the Ignis, is available with the manual only. It adds 25mm to the ground clearance and overall height.Suspension is by MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam at the rear. The brakes are ventilated discs at the front and drums at the rear.",

    "description": "Ed Jones returns to Japanese brand's British arm after seven years with Audi UK Welcome to Movers and Shakers, a new Autocar Business feature covering the latest job moves from across the automotive industry. This page will be updated regularly with all the biggest transfers, promotions and departures in the sector, covering everything you need to know. Names: Ed Jones Company: Nissan GB Role: Sales director Nissan GB has named Ed Jones its new sales director from 16 June. Among his key responsibilities will be preparing the company for the launch of the next-generation Leaf EV, as well as ensuring the continued success of the Qashqai and Juke crossovers.  Jones returns to Nissan after seven years with Audi, where he was most recently sales operations manager.  “I’m delighted to be returning at such an exciting time,” he said. “Nissan was the only brand with two models in the top five best-sellers in 2024 and, with increased market share and double-digit sales growth, it’s a brand with real momentum in 2025.” He replaces Michael Auilar, who held the position for the past two years. Names: Steve Hicks, Sanka De Silva Company: Kia UK Roles: Marketing director, sales director Kia UK has appointed Steve Hicks (left) as its new marketing director and Sanka De Silva as sales director - both effectively swapping roles. Hicks, previously sales director for Kia UK, joined the business in 2017, leading all sales channels across retail and fleet, for new and used cars. De Silva also joined in 2017, progressing to the lead the wider UK marketing team. Both men maintain equal position on the executive board of directors for Kia UK and continue to report to commercial director Simon Hetherington. Hicks said: “Kia is at a pivotal moment right now as we enhance our position as a leader in electrification and build on our range of customer-centric electrified vehicles. I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead Kia’s product positioning and marketing communications to enhance how UK consumers approach and engage with the brand.” De Silva said: “I am thrilled to be taking on this new position at such an exciting and evolving time for Kia. With such a strong product line-up in view, an engaged and committed dealer network and sales momentum at a promising rate, we’re in a positive position and I am eager to get started and lead our sales function to new heights.” Name: Peter Rawlinson Company: Lucid Motors Role: CEO Lucid chief Peter Rawlinson has stepped down after six years in charge of the electric car manufacturer. He will now take on a new role as strategic technical advisor to chairman Turqi Alnowaiser.  Meanwhile, chief operating officer Marc Winterhoff will take on the role of interim CEO. Rawlinson first joined Lucid as its chief technical officer in 2013, having previously led the development of the Tesla Model S – the saloon widely credited with having popularised electric cars in the mainstream. Lucid launched its first model, the Air saloon, in 2021. Its headline-grabbing 549-mile range – according to European WLTP testing – soon found the firm favour as a technological leader. It has, however, yet to make a profit. Indeed, Lucid made a net loss of $2.7 billion (£2.1bn) last year against revenues of $807.8 million (£638m).  The firm has pinned its hopes of success on the new Gravity, a luxury SUV based on the same underpinnings as the Air. It expects the new model to increase the firm's production from just over 10,000 cars last year to around 20,000 by the end of 2025. The Gravity will be followed by a new ‘mid-size’ SUV, due next year and pitched as a rival for the Tesla Model Y. This will spawn a saloon (to battle the Tesla Model 3) and a third model. \"Now that we have successfully launched the Lucid Gravity, I have decided it is finally the right time for me to step aside from my roles at Lucid,\" Rawlinson said in a statement. Winterhoff added: \"Lucid's technology leadership is now well established and our roadmap well defined. \"I am honoured to step into this role as we enter the next stage in our transformational journey, and I look forward to capitalising on the tremendous opportunity this presents.  \"Our team remains focused on further ramping production of the Lucid Gravity, preparing for the launch of our three mid-size platform vehicles, and continuing development of our low-cost Atlas drive unit while we aggressively reduce our costs.\" Name: James Taylor Company: Vauxhall Role: Managing director James Taylor has left the role of Vauxhall managing director, ending his 25-year run working for the British brand. He first joined Vauxhall on a student placement scheme in 1997 and returned to the firm as a commercial vehicle forecast specialist in 2000.  By 2005, he was a national business manager for Vauxhall's then-owner, General Motors, and in 2011 he took over the brand's crucial fleet sales channel. He was named Vauxhall's managing director at the end of 2022 and has been faced with one of the trickiest periods in its history since, negotiating a shift upmarket under new owner Stellantis and the introduction of several electric models while facing government mandates forcing their sale. His departure comes as Stellantis prepares to shut the historic Vauxhall plant in Luton and after the brand recorded a 21.43% decline in annual sales compared with 2023 – a significant drop but also slightly less than that felt by arch-rival Ford in the UK. In the interim, Taylor will be replaced by Stellantis UK boss Eurig Druce. His long-term successor will be announced \"in due course\", according to a company statement. “I’d like to sincerely thank James for more than a quarter of a century of loyalty and dedication to Vauxhall,” said Druce. “James leaves Vauxhall ready for the UK’s transition to an electric future, and on behalf of his many colleagues and friends, I wish him personally all the best for the future.” Taylor said: “I’d like to thank all my colleagues, past and present, for both their amazing contributions to what has been achieved – especially in recent years, transforming Vauxhall through design, technology and marketing into an electric-first brand – and I wish them every success in the future.” Name: Michelle Mortiboys Company: Aston Martin Role: Chief product engineer Michelle Mortiboys, a nominee in the 2024 Autocar Great Women awards, has announced that she is the new chief product engineer for Aston Martin. Mortiboys joins Aston Martin from supplier Aptiv, where she was responsible for managing its European programmes and its UK site. Prior to that, she was the head of automotive for Dyson and took charge of manufacturing at the Land Rover Defender factory in Nitra, Slovakia.  During her time at JLR, she also headed the firm's Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) division. Name: Alex Smith Company: Lookers Role: Chairman Alex Smith, the former managing director of Volkswagen Group UK, has been named the new chairman of dealer group Lookers.  The company has more than 150 showrooms across the UK, with 38 brands and more than 7000 cars across its new and used arms at any one time.  Smith has also been appointed to the executive committee of Lookers owner Global Auto Holdings Limited (GAHL), taking responsibility for the firm's European operations. \"We are extremely pleased to add someone of Alex’s calibre to the Lookers leadership team,\" GAHL said in a statement. \"We believe his deep automotive expertise, track record of industry leading results and overall strategic capabilities will greatly benefit both Lookers as well as GAHL’s European operations as we continue to pursue operational excellence and growth.\" Name: Frank Marotte Company: Dacia Role: Vice-president for marketing, sales and operations Dacia has named Frank Marotte its new vice-president for marketing, sales and operations. Marotte was previously the president and managing director of Toyota France, overseeing both the Toyota and Lexus brands. He started his career in automotive with Peugeot in 1993. He replaces Xavier Martinet, who left Dacia last year to lead Hyundai's European operations. Marotte will begin his new job on 1 February. Names: Giuseppe Cava, Damien Dally, Nicola Dobson, Tom Ray, Nick Richards Company: Stellantis UK Roles: Managing director for Fiat, Fiat Professional and Abarth (Cava), brand director for Leapmotor (Dally), managing director for Peugeot (Dobson), B2B director (Ray) and pre-owned vehicles director (Richards) Stellantis has revised its UK management team, appointing new managing directors for the Abarth, Fiat and Peugeot brands. Giuseppe Cava, who was most recently the UK marketing director for Fiat and Abarth, replaces Damien Dally as the sibling brands' managing director. Dally moves into the role of brand director for Chinese debutant Leapmotor. Nicola Dobson, previously the director of pre-owned vehicles, replaces Eurig Druce as Peugeot managing director following his promotion to managing director of Stellantis UK. Nick Richards takes on Dobson's former role. Tom Ray, who joined Stellantis in 2004, has been appointed B2B operations director for the UK. All will report to Druce. Name: David Beattie Company: Mini UK and Ireland Role: Director David Beattie has been named the new director for Mini UK and Ireland, replacing Federico Izzo, who has been promoted to lead the brand's European operations. Beattie has worked for the BMW Group UK since 2005 and most recently led its used car sales operation. Names: Sjoerd Knipping, Pablo Martinez Masip Company: Kia Europe Roles: Chief operating officer (Knipping), vice-president of product and marketing (Martinez Masip) Kia Europe has appointed a new chief operating officer and vice-president of product and marketing. Sjoerd Knipping (above, left), the new COO, has been promoted from his previous role as vice-president of product and marketing. He has spent more than 25 years working in the European automotive industry, having held several senior roles at Kia and Ford. Replacing Knipping as the vice-president of product and marketing is Pablo Martinez Masip (above, right), who has been Kia's global VP for customer experience since 2021. \"Going forward, our strong team supported by these executives will continue to move our bold transformation process to be a sustainable mobility solutions provider with a focus on our people and our customers,\" said Marc Hedrich, president and CEO of Kia Europe. Name: Christian Meunier Company: Nissan Role: Chairperson of the management committee for the Americas Former CEO of Jeep Christian Meunier has been named the new chairman of Nissan's management committee in the Americas. He will report directly to Nissan's new chief performance officer, Guillaume Cartier, who was appointed to right the ship after the firm's operating profits dropped by 90% during the first half of its 2024 financial year. Challenges facing Meunier include the threat of a 25% tariff on its cars exported into the US from Mexico, as well as a profitability slide that was in part caused by liberal discounting in the region. He spent 17 years with Nissan (between 2002 and 2019) before taking the top job at Jeep. He left the American manufacturer in October 2023 to \"take a long break to focus on personal interests\", according to an official Stellantis statement. Name: Damien O'Sullivan Company: VW Group UK Role: Managing director Volkswagen Group UK has named Damien O'Sullivan as its new managing director, with Alex Smith leaving after six years at the helm.  O'Sullivan will take the top job in Milton Keynes on 1 December, having run Audi in Ireland for the past three years. Prior to that, he spent time in various positions within the VW Group in China and Taiwan, having joined the company's sales division in 2009. Smith, who has been with the VW Group UK for nearly 15 years, is leaving the company \"at his own request\", according to an official statement.  His tenure as VW Group UK MD has coincided with one of the most turbulent and disruptive periods in automotive history, but he leaves the company in a strong position ahead of a transformative few years in which each of its brands are planning to launch crucial new models to the UK market. \"I’m very proud of everything the team and the networks have achieved in a period which has included Brexit, a pandemic, a supply crisis and the introduction of mass-market electromobility,\" said Smith.  \"With Volkswagen the UK’s number one passenger car brand, Audi at number two and both Skoda and Seat/Cupra achieving record market shares so far this year, as well as Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in number two position in the van market, it feels like the right time to hand over to Damien to continue building on Volkswagen Group’s market leading performance in the UK.\" Name: Xavier Martinet Company: Hyundai Europe Role: President and CEO Dacia marketing chief Xavier Martinet will become the next president and CEO of Hyundai Europe. Martinet replaces Michael Cole, who is retiring at the end of this year after four years in the top job. Cole, who has been with the Hyundai Motor Group since 2009, said: “After more than 40 years in the automotive industry, it is now time to return to the UK to be with my family and to enjoy life beyond work. “I have been incredibly fortunate to enjoy a career in such a dynamic industry and over the last 15 years to work at Hyundai Motor Group, the best and most progressive automotive organisation in the world. “I am proud to have worked with a great team in Europe, who l know will ensure that Hyundai continues its exciting growth trajectory.” Name: Christophe Georges  Company: Bentley  Role: Board member for sales and marketing Bentley has promoted sales and marketing director Christophe Georges to a seat on its executive board.  Georges joined Bentley in 1998 and has held several key positions since, including two stints as its president and CEO for the Americas region.  “I am relishing the prospect of continuing to work closely with my colleagues to provide fresh momentum and direction as we grow our brand, our audience base and our entire sales and marketing operations,” said Georges. Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser added that Georges is “perfectly placed to realise our brand and sales ambitions”.  Name: James Crichton Company: Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Role: Regional director for the Middle East and Africa James Crichton has been named Rolls-Royce’s next regional director for the “hugely important” Middle East and Africa region.  Crichton has held a number of senior positions at the luxury car maker since 2010 and has worked as the general manager of its global sales operations for the past six years. Julian Jenkins, Rolls-Royce’s director of sales and brand, said: “I am delighted to welcome James Crichton to his new role as regional director Middle East and Africa. “James has more than 14 years of experience with Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and has held several leading positions in the company during this time. “This latest move to Dubai reunites him with the regional office he was asked to establish in 2011. “Middle East and Africa is a hugely important region for our business, and I wish James continued success in his role leading the excellent team which serves the region.” Name: Maria Grazia Davino Company: BYD Role: Regional managing director for Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic Maria Grazia Davino has been announced as the new regional managing director for BYD in Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic. The news comes days after she stepped down as managing director of Stellantis UK – a position she held since July 2023. Stella Li, executive vice-president of BYD, said: “We are thrilled to welcome Maria Grazia to our team. Her extensive experience and visionary leadership will be pivotal as we continue to grow and innovate in the European automotive landscape.” Name: Eurig Druce Company: Stellantis UK Role: Managing director Eurig Druce has been named the next managing director of Stellantis UK, replacing Maria Grazia Davino. Druce has worked in what is now Stellantis since 2001, having started as an apprentice with Peugeot UK in 2001. He spent three years heading Citroën’s British arm between 2020 and 2023 before serving as sales chief for Stellantis UK. He was named Peugeot UK boss in July 2024 and will continue in that role until his replacement is found. Jean-Philippe Imparato, who was recently named Stellantis’s new chief operating officer for the Enlarged Europe region, said: “I am delighted to be able to appoint Eurig Druce to this position. His proven track record in the country will provide continuity of our strategy in this important market.”",

    "description": "Following on from the Karizma XMR 210 and Mavrick 440, the new Xtreme 250R marks Hero’s latest venture into the premium space, and it’s an important one because this is the debut of a new quarter-litre engine – one that’s Hero’s most powerful to date. Hero Xtreme 250R engine refinement, performance New 250cc engine derived from Hero's existing 210cc mill Well, I say new engine, but in essence, this is a stroked-out version of the 210cc motor we’ve already seen in the Karizma. So capacity is up to 249cc, and you get 30hp and 25Nm. All these numbers, combined with other aspects of this motorcycle, make it pretty easy to see that it’s been benchmarked against the KTM 250 Duke – in other words, it’s aiming to be the sportiest 250cc bike out there. The engine has strong performance but is a little vibey. To that end, the engine pulls quite cleanly and strongly all across the rev range; it’s fairly tractable at the bottom end and there’s a good spread of torque all the way across the rev range, with performance to be found in revving the motor out almost all the way to the redline. So, the Xtreme feels quick and performance isn’t an issue, but that’s not to say that this engine is perfect. The Xtreme 250R has the most powerful Hero engine to date. This is the most powerful road engine Hero has ever built, so it’s venturing into new territory. That's noticeable in the refinement department, where the company hasn’t quite got it nailed yet. Across all the bikes present at the media ride, some were quite smooth, others were a little buzzy, and some were fairly gruff and vibe-y. The Xtreme we rode for most of the day was vibe-free at the handlebars, but there were quite a few vibrations felt through the seat, tank and footpegs; some of the bodywork near the front of the bike was also buzzy when revved. Hero Xtreme 250R ride and handling Xtreme 250R's ride has a hard edge to it, unlike its smaller siblings The smaller members of the Xtreme family – the Xtreme 125 and Xtreme 160 – feel more like sporty commuters. The Xtreme 250R comes across more as an out-and-out sport naked, and this is most evident in the suspension setup. The smaller Xtremes manage to offer a degree of plushness in the way they ride. On the 250R, at low speeds especially, the ride feels quite jarring and there’s definitely a hard edge to the setup – it feels firmly damped. The suspension has a firm edge to it. This does get better as speeds rise or with a heavier rider on board, but by and large this is not going to be the most comfortable bike to live with everyday – the ergonomics are quite neutral and comfortable, but the ride quality certainly doesn’t feel plush. Moreover, there are others in this segment that feel equally sporty but manage to offer superior ride comfort. The Xtreme 250R is an energetic handler. The flip-side of that firm setup is that it beautifully complements the trellis frame to create a fun handling package. The Xtreme 250R feels nimble and agile through the twisties, quite happily and predictably responding to rider inputs. It’s also got grippy MRF Nylogrip tyres to back it up (though the front isn’t a radial), and this sweet chassis package – combined with the fairly quick motor – make the Xtreme a reasonably fun bike to ride on the open road. Hero Xtreme 250R quality, fit and finish The design is striking but doesn't come together very well, quality could improve too Hero says it’s aiming the Xtreme at people who value grabbing attention just as much as the riding experience, so they’ve made an effort to make it look striking. There are definitely certain elements and details across the bike that grab your attention, but I’m not sure the overall design here comes together cohesively – it’s certainly got some muscle to it, which is nice, but some areas feel a little busy and overdone. It has a catchy design but quality could be better. The step up from the rider’s seat to the fuel tank looks disproportionately large, and the fuel tank region itself has a lot of layering going on, with many different colours, finishes and graphics all jostling for space. The radiator shrouds also seem a little overstyled, and when you dive in for a closer look, you can see certain areas where the Xtreme feels built to a cost.   Some unsightly welds are in your direct field of vision. Near the headstock you’ll find some quite unsightly welds, which is unfortunate because they’re right in your line of sight when looking at the instruments. Certain sections of the frame on our bike also had rough surface finish and untidy welds, but vital touchpoints like switchgear feel reasonably good. Hero Xtreme 250R price and verdict Xtreme 250R is a good value proposition in the 250cc space Priced at Rs 1.80 lakh, the Xtreme 250R undercuts the likes of the Suzuki Gixxer 250 (Rs 1.98 lakh-2.17 lakh), and is a great deal cheaper than a KTM 250 Duke (Rs 2.28 lakh). That said, it isn’t quite as well equipped either – it’s fairly simple with no TFT screen or quickshifter, you get a simple LCD dash, all-LED lighting and ABS with two modes. Speaking of instrumentation, it’s the same fairly basic monochrome LCD display that you see on the Karizma, and it would have been nice to see a TFT or at least a colour LCD unit on the top variant. LCD feels a little basic in this age of TFT displays. So, how does one sum up this bike? Well, if you are shopping in and around the Rs 2 lakh mark for a performance bike, you could go a few different ways. On the one hand, you’ve got something like the Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z, which takes a brute force approach to performance, giving you maximum displacement and horsepower for the price. At almost exactly the same price, you could also get something like a Yamaha R15, which is the polar opposite – it’s only a 155cc, but with a very sharp focus on handling and a sporty riding experience. Somewhere between those two is where the new Xtreme 250R sits – it’s definitely got more grunt than the R15, without being as heavy-feeling as the NS400Z. It strikes a nice middle ground as a sporty 250cc bike, and as always with Hero, the value proposition is quite strong. Also See: Hero Xtreme 250R video review",

    "description": "The Hyundai Creta CVT has perhaps been the most in-demand car of the Autocar long-term fleet. Refined, comfortable and user-friendly, we’ve run this SUV for over 6,000km for shoots, commutes and road trips. Unfortunately, though, it’s now gone back to its maker, so I’m going to tell you what living with it was like. Most of my running with the Creta was done in the city, although Saumil and Hormazd did do some highway work on their road trips to Goa and Mahabaleshwar, respectively. Regardless of the usage, we agreed that this refined 1.5 petrol paired with the CVT auto makes for a seamless driving experience. And given that it especially excels in the city, it comes as no surprise that this atmospheric petrol engine outsells the other options. However, its lack of performance can be felt on the highways when you want to drive in a spirited manner. So, if performance is what you’re looking for, best opt for the 160hp turbo-petrol. Refined and seamless, the Creta IVT felt at home in city traffic. What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in fuel efficiency, by petrol SUV standards at least. In our instrumented real-world test, the Creta CVT returned a maximum of 15.05kpl on the highway, which went as low as 7.5kpl in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Also worth noting is that the efficiency will drop drastically into single digits if you drive at a brisk pace on the highway. Overall, though, with my daily usage, the efficiency hovered between 10kpl and 11kpl for the most part. What also helps conserve that little bit extra is the auto start/stop function, which works decently. Although it livens up the cabin, the ivory upholstery soils easily and is tough to keep clean. Other than the refined and fairly efficient powertrain, I also appreciated the feature-rich and well-appointed cabin. The light grey and ivory upholstery and the copper inserts and stitching work well together, though it was nearly impossible to keep the ivory bits clean given the intensive running our Creta did. And in typical Hyundai fashion, our top-spec SX(O) Creta had all the bells and whistles like a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone auto AC, cooled front seats, two screens, ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The high-res 360-degree camera and blind-spot monitor, in particular, proved their worth in the rainy season when visibility was poor. Even the Level 2 ADAS features worked well, and I liked using the adaptive cruise control on the highway. What’s also nice is that if you turn them off, they’ll remain off till you manually turn them back on. I even appreciated the Bose audio system, but passengers in the rear did feel like the volume was quite soft. Reclining backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows mean the rear seat is a comfy place. Speaking of the rear, it’s a great place to be. There’s enough room for three, and the pano roof and light upholstery make the cabin feel airy. And the reclinable backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows seal the deal. However, not all is well, as the Creta does miss out on wireless smartphone integration, which is particularly annoying given that the smaller 8-inch screen in lower variants gets it. I also would’ve liked to have a sliding front armrest. The twin screens, while great to look at and easy to navigate, are set a little too low and don’t fall in your line of sight. And it doesn’t pack a heads-up display like the Kia Seltos, which would’ve alleviated this. It’s also not one for enthusiastic drivers, as handling can best be described as safe. Although there’s a noticeable body roll, the grip is ample, and overall, it feels predictable around bends. The ride quality is cushy at low speeds, but it feels jarring over sharp potholes, and large bumps tend to catch it out. There’s also some noticeable vertical movement at highway speeds, but this doesn’t feel uncomfortable like the Cretas of old. Full-LED headlamps offer great illumination and throw; the auto high beam function works well. Other things I liked in my time with the Creta were the LED headlights, which offer great illumination. The auto high beam function also worked well, meaning I didn’t have to constantly shift between high beam and low beam. It’s also nice that the Creta gets physical controls for the AC and some of the infotainment controls. I also managed to solve two things that were annoying me. The first one was that Android Auto was appearing only in a split screen, which was resolved by unchecking a box deep in the sub-menus of the system. The second was the lock/unlock beeps, which were done away with by long-pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the key simultaneously for a couple of seconds. I know we say this a lot, but this car will actually be missed a lot by all of us in the office. Given its strengths and how easy living with it has been, it’s not hard to see why the Creta continues to rule the midsize SUV segment.

    "description": "The Renault Triber facelift has been spotted for the first time. Renault India MD and CEO Venkatram Mamillapalle confirmed a few months ago that the Kiger and Triber would receive facelifts later this year, and a Kiger facelift prototype was seen testing for the first time last month. The Triber facelift spy shot suggests mild design tweaks Its interior is expected to receive new materials and features Engine options will most likely remain unchanged  2025 Renault Triber facelift exterior and interior design Rear and side styling changes appear minor A new spy shot of a heavily camouflaged Triber test mule primarily shows off the rear of the facelifted sub-4-metre MPV and a bit of its side profile. The overall silhouette and design, including the tail-lamps, boot lid and rear bumper, don’t seem to be a major departure from the current Triber. Towards the side, the Triber’s distinctive upward crease and window line kink seem to have been retained. While the front is not visible in the spy shot, we expect the Triber facelift to sport sharper styling that better aligns it with global Renault models. Interior changes for Triber facelift Inside, the Triber facelift’s dashboard is expected to receive mild design tweaks, lighter shades, more soft-touch materials and an expanded features list, much like the refreshed Nissan Magnite launched last year. 2025 Renault Triber facelift engine and gearbox No major mechanical changes anticipated On the powertrain front, we expect the Triber facelift to carry on with the current model’s 1.0-litre naturally aspirated three-cylinder petrol unit that generates 72hp and 96Nm. Gearbox options will most likely be the same as well, comprising a 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT.

But it’s when the brief calls for something more unique that shop boss Tom Gilroy truly comes alive, relishing the opportunity to push himself, and his crew, to new heights. “We have held fast to the idea that if we stop moving forward, we will cease to exist,” he states. And if you need any proof that this philosophy is core to what the Australian shop does, this staggeringly elegant Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 has it in spades. The commission for the build came directly from Royal Enfield, leaving Tom with something of a conundrum. “Our build ideas come from our relationship with the client,” he explains, “their personal tastes, the riding style they like, and the energy they put out in our meetings and consult on their bike.…",

    "link": "",
    "description": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=7SaiVW3QfZc Photography: Rosario Liberti  In the early 1950s, a group of thrill-seekers in Zell am See, Austria, transformed their frozen lake into a playground of horsepower and daring. The inaugural Professor Ferdinand Porsche Memorial Race in 1952 saw skiers clinging to motorcycles, skijoring at breakneck speeds over the ice. This audacious blend of motorsport and winter sport marked the birth of a tradition that would see Porsche 356s and 550 Spyders sliding gracefully across the glistening surface, captivating thousands of spectators annually. The races continued until 1974, when a tragic accident halted the event, casting a shadow over the icy spectacle. Fast forward to 2019, and the frozen silence was broken by the roar of engines once more. Ferdi Porsche, great-grandson of the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, alongside his college friend Vinzenz Greger, resurrected the ice race, rebranding it under the F.A.T. International banner. This revival not only honored the legacy of the original races but also injected a modern flair, attracting a new generation of motorsport enthusiasts to the icy tracks of Zell am See. ​ To explore the history, evolution, and future of the F.A.T. Ice Race, as well as its impact on the automotive world, we sat down with Ferdi Porsche. In this conversation, he shares insights on reviving the event, Porsche’s enduring family spirit, the role of design in his vision, and his thoughts on the next generation of motorsport talent. Ferdi on F.A.T. and its Future Petrolicious:  Tell us a little bit about the FAT Ice race, and why its back? Ferdi Porsche: The ice race started in Selamsee in the 50s, and I honestly think it was an enthusiast event or race, basically. I think they saw that they had a frozen lake and decided to drive some cars around.  I found out about it because my dad bought a car that used to race on the frozen lake and it came with the spike tires and it still had the super long studs in there and I asked him what what it was because it was kind of forgotten already, the ice racing. I had the idea of bringing it back when I was in my architecture studies.  I was looking for something fun to do by the side and so this came at a perfect time. In 2019, we had the first ice race in Zell again. Then we did it twice before COVID. And when COVID hit, I was thinking, Okay, how do I, how do I take this to the next level? And how do I expand it from just one event? And that's when I found F.A.T. International and decided to revive the brand. Petrolicious: What does F.A.T. Stand for? F.A.T. used to stand for Francais Allemand Transit. It was a French German logistics company. And now it just stands for FAT It just literally describes the energy and the vibe of everything that we do basically. Funnily enough the first ice race kind of introduced that without the brand FAT being there. Petrolicious: What are the stars of this years F.A.T. Race? Ferdi: The stars of the show of the 25 Ice Race are probably the F.A.T. cars. Since F.A.T. was a sponsor in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s for all the great cars, Ferraris, Porsches, Mercedes, everything, they naturally take center stage. We brought this tradition back and are now sponsoring cars again. We have the 963 that raced at Le Mans last year here. Sadly, it is not driving because it is not high up enough, but we also have the Dakar cars, the ones that work better on the ice. We have a bunch of WRC cars, so we really have an amazing array of cars this year. That was always the idea of Ice Race, being open to any brand and any manufacturer. I think this year we have 22 different car brands in the race. Petrolicious: What is your favorite Porsche model on the ice this year? Ferdi: That's a difficult question. There's so many different, there's so many cool Porsches that I can't really decide for one. It changes over time. Sometimes I'm more towards the super old stuff, 550s obviously, also because of the history and the connection to ice racing. But obviously I love the Dakar, a sick car, and just the vibe also matches that somehow. It's hard to decide. Petrolicious: What are your long term plans for F.A.T. Ferdi: With F.A.T., we do a bunch of things. We're a young team, and the idea is to do stuff that we like, stuff that we enjoy, because we believe that when we like it, other people will like it too. Obviously, we have the event side of things. Last year, we brought it to Aspen, and I’m looking at where I can bring it next apart from Zell. But we're also looking into the summer. We have our \"Hot on Top\" at Großglockner with Mankei, where we do car meets every month during the summer. The idea is to do stuff that we think is fun. So you can expect F.A.T. to be all around the world many times. Petrolicious: So not just ice? Ferdi: I think F.A.T. works on every terrain. Basically, it got famous through Le Mans. Proper racing on tarmac is where it was kind of born, and it's still happening today with the 963 that we have in Le Mans, but also with the karting league for the kids. So F.A.T. works on every terrain, but its spirit is kind of born from ice racing because it's somewhat more about fun than speed. Petrolicious: As an Architect, how does your design sensibilities influence what you do? Ferdi: I think studying architecture kind of gives you a great opportunity to look at a blank piece of paper and then come up with stuff. So I think that obviously plays into F.A.T. I know what I can and what I can't do. I'm not a graphic designer, but I like paying attention to all of that stuff. And I think the devil and the beauty is in the detail. So that's why everything that we do with F.A.T. is always very detail focused. Obviously, it's sometimes festival and wild, and you can never fully plan an event that happens on a frozen airfield. Everything just is a bit wabi-sabi sometimes, but I think that's also kind of the beauty of it. Petrolicious: Where do you place yourself in within Porsche today? Are you involved with the brand at all in decision making? Ferdi: I think Porsche still has this kind of family business vibe, even though it's obviously a big company now. We build a lot of cars these days, and so many people work for Porsche, but it still has this energy of being a family brand. Obviously, I have a lot of love for the brand and want to see it thrive. Whenever I can give my two cents on something, I do, but I'm not involved in the day-to-day business. Petrolicious: What advice would you give to a young person with limited resources who wants to get into ice racing or racing in general? Ferdi: It depends on how young you are, but I think you should start in the F.A.T. Karting League. It’s the most meritocratic and a cheaper way to get into racing without losing any of the skill-building opportunities. I would advise any young person to start there and see if they have talent. From there, you can work your way through our completely meritocratic system and fight your way into F4 with us. And if you're looking to buy a car, I think what's cool about the car world is that it's very open. It doesn’t really matter if you buy a $20,000 car, a $10,000 car, if you have no car at all, or a $10 million car. In the end, everybody sits together, has a burger, and is the same because they all share the same passion for cars. Petrolicious: Please tell us more about the karting school. Ferdi: Coming from what we do with F.A.T. and the energy we wanted to bring, it was inspired by all the car events I went to as a kid, many of which felt somewhat stuck up and catered to an older crowd. I wanted to do something a bit more rebellious in that space. When I met [Renowned Formula 1 engineer] Rob Smedley and heard about the karting league and what he has done, building these karts that try to change the whole system by making it more approachable for everybody, it felt like the perfect match. That is why we teamed up and are now bringing it to the whole world. This year, we are bringing it to the U.S. for the first time. In the coming years, we are expanding to Asia and the Middle East. The goal is really to create a platform for everybody to start racing. Obviously, it still comes at a certain price, so it is not yet for everybody, but that is how democratization works. You start at some point and then you try to push it down and down. Petrolicious: So you're on the hunt for a Formula 1 driver then? Ferdi: Yes, we're looking for the first female F1 driver. Petrolicious: Mind if I give you a few rapid fire this or that questions? Ferdi: Lets do it. Petrolicious: Lewis at Ferrari or Mercedes?Ferdi: Lewis at Mercedes. Petrolicious: Stuttgart or Maranello?Ferdi: Stuttgart. Petrolicious: Racing in the desert or racing on the ice?Ferdi: Racing on the ice. Petrolicious: 962 or 917?Ferdi: 962. Petrolicious: Turbo or naturally aspirated?Ferdi: Naturally aspirated. Petrolicious: ST or GT3 Touring?Ferdi: ST. Petrolicious: Gravel or tarmac?Ferdi: Gravel. Many thanks to Ferdi Porsche for sitting down with us for a chat. We'll follow up soon on the noble efforts at F.A.T. Karting with a full story. Continue...",

    "description": "https://youtu.be/gF_VI4Ooafw Jean-Philippe Duval never finished school. In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",
