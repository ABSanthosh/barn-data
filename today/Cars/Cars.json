    "title": "Confirmed: New Honda Prelude to feature simulated gearbox",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/confirmed-new-honda-prelude-feature-simulated-gearbox",
    "description": "New Prelude will be based on the Civic, serving as a halo car for Honda's electrified tech Revived sports coupé will be launched in 2026 with new S+ Shift system and hybrid powertrain The new Honda Prelude hybrid coupé will feature a unique simulated gearbox when it is launched in 2026 as part of an effort to ensure it offers driving thrills. The Japanese firm will revive the long-running model after a gap of more than 20 years – and the new version is set to serve as a halo product for its electrified technologies. The new Prelude will be based on the Civic and have a 2.0-litre powertrain that uses Honda's e:HEV hybrid system. The complex set-up of that system effectively prohibits a manual transmission being fitted – so Honda will instead introduce a new S+ Shift system. Honda says the new system will \"simulate the sound and feel of quick automatic gearchanges\". Hans De Jaeger, the firm's Europe senior-vice president, said this will  \"not only deliver exceptional efficiency, but also the fun-to-drive performance for which this model is known\". The firm has not given any technical details about the new S+ Shift system, with a series of new official images featuring a single close-up of the drive mode selector. As a result, it is unknown if the system will simulate only an automatic gearbox – or if it could allow for simulated manual changes using steering wheel paddles or similar. The system is likely to serve in a similar fashion to the one on the electric Hyundai Ionic 5 N. Reports that the new Prelude would sport a simulated transmission emerged earlier this year and project leader Tomoyuki Yamagami added fuel to the rumours when he refused to rule out the idea in an interview with Autocar in October. Speaking then, Yamagami said: \"When you're in charge of developing the Prelude, you understand everyone has a lot of expectations of a coupé.\" Asked at that time about the reports of a manual gearbox, he said: “It’s very hard to answer that. Let me say that I own three cars and two of them have a manual transmission: one is an Accord Type R, the other a 997 [Porsche 911], because I'm a big fan of manuals. “I really love manual vehicles, and I can only say that it would be something I’d like [for the Prelude]. With a manual transmission, it would be a very fun vehicle to be with.” Honda's e:HEV system primarily uses an electric motor to propel the wheels, and while the petrol engine can drive the wheels directly at higher speeds, it serves largely as a generator to charge the battery. This removes the need for traditional gearing. Honda has previously offered a traditional manual gearbox on the Civic and Insight hybrids, although it was connected to an earlier, more conventional hybrid powertrain. Already revealed as a show car, the Prelude was recently spied testing in the German countryside. Although it's covered in a camouflage wrap, it's clear that the styling of the show car will be carried through to production.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/gwm-launch-haval-suv-uk-priced-%C2%A323995",
    "description": "Haval Jolion Pro offers a 188bhp hybrid powertrain for £23,995 China's Great Wall Motor to bolster UK presence with new range of hybrid SUVs, starting with Kia Sorento rival The Chinese company behind the Ora Funky Cat will expand its portfolio by bringing SUV brand Haval to the UK next year – and it will undercut many of its well-established competitors on price. Great Wall Motor launched the Ora brand here in 2022 with the electric hatchback (renamed the GWM Ora 03 last year), and it's now moving to “provide a wider choice for customers as it enhances its overall product offering”.  Previously officially named GWM Ora, the company will now rebrand as simply GWM in the UK. All its dealers will adopt a new look in February, coinciding with the start of deliveries of the first Haval model, the Jolion Pro. It's a hybrid SUV that’s roughly the same size as the Nissan X-Trail and Kia Sorento but substantially cheaper, with prices starting at £23,995. It's powered by a 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and an electric motor within a seven-speed automatic gearbox for a combined 188bhp and 277lb ft of torque. GWM quotes a 0-62mph time of 8.5sec and claims the Jolion Pro hybrid can achieve an average of 55mpg. The cabin is characteristically minimalist, with the dashboard topped by a 12.3in central touchscreen and a digital gauge cluster. There is a panel of physical buttons below the screen, though, and several more on the steering wheel and centre console.  GWM said the Jolion Pro had already “proven hugely successful in markets like Australia”.  The company will be hoping that the addition of a new line of hybrid SUVs will boost its footprint in the UK, having sold just 3000 examples of the Funk Cat/Ora 03 since launch.  GWM is the latest of many global car makers to turn to hybrids as a means of bolstering sales amid a downturn in demand for EVs in Europe.  BYD, for example, has confirmed plans to launch three new plug-hybrid models in Europe in 2025, having initially launched with a five-strong EV line-up. GWM UK’s managing director, Toby Marshall, hailed the arrival of Haval as “a new era for GWM in the UK”. “With the introduction of Haval under the GWM umbrella, we are able to offer customers a very competitively priced and well-specified petrol hybrid car for those that want to make their first step toward electrification,” he said. In addition to Ora and Haval, GWM sells cars under the Poer, Tank and Wey brands in China. It hasn’t yet confirmed plans to bring any of those here but said the move to being known as just GWM leaves space for “any future GWM product” to be sold alongside the Ora 03 and Jolion Pro in dealerships.",

    "description": "Few motorcycles can claim the notoriety of the ill-fated Buell Blast. Propelled by half a Sportster engine and aimed at beginner riders, the Blast was such a disappointment that its creator, Erik Buell, signaled the end of its production by publicly tossing one into a crusher. Then, to drive the point home, he offered a limited run of crushed and autographed Buell Blast ‘cubes’ for sale. The Buell Blast’s infamy—and rarity—are precisely what tempted Toshiyuki ‘Cheetah’ Osawa to customize it. Based in Tokyo, Japan, Osawa-san is the brains behind the ‘Have Fun’ flat track racing event. He also builds some of the most imaginative flat trackers around. The Blast is hard to find in Japan, so Cheetah imported one from the USA earlier this year.…",

    "description": "I love using my Suzuki Access to bop around the city. It’s comfortable, practical, frugal and zippy. So much so that I haven’t ever found myself wanting another commuter. That was until the Ather Rizta entered our long-term fleet. Ever since it arrived, my Access hasn’t seen much action, and in the month that I’ve spent with the Rizta, I’ve covered more than 500km. Two things that have made a positive impression on me in these early days are its enormous boot and intuitive regenerative braking. Its 34-litre boot is deep enough to fit in a lot of stuff, along with the big charger. The 34-litre boot here isn’t the biggest in the e-scooter game, but it’s almost double the size of the one on my Access (and most other ICE scooters). I’ve managed to fit in my fully packed Kriega sling bag and the bulky charger supplied with the Rizta, with room to spare. This is also the only e-scooter (besides the River Indie) that can accommodate an ECE-certified full-face helmet, which I think deserves praise. Unlocking the boot always needs two hands, which is frustrating on a daily basis. The trouble is that when I need to open the boot, it doesn’t unlock with just the twist of the key. I need to press down on the seat exactly where the locking mechanism is located with the key in the unlock position to get it to release every single time. This isn’t a big negative, but it is one of those things that gets mildly irritating with time. Another positive here is Ather’s Magic Twist feature, wherein the regen progressively slows you down when you twist the throttle backwards. This has proved to be quite a treat in Mumbai’s typically staccato traffic. At speeds below 40kph, with a bit of planning, I didn’t have to use the brakes and relied solely on the regen to stop.   Ather’s Magic Twist is intuitive and works beautifully well in city traffic. But there is a problem here. Locking the rear wheel up is all too easy when you’re coming to a halt hurriedly. Part of that blame must be attributed to Mumbai’s atrociously slippery concrete roads, but Magic Twist and the rear brake working in tandem seem to enhance this tendency. This has forced me to actively pay attention to how much pressure I apply on the brake lever. Either that, or I avoid using the regenerative braking when coming to a halt quickly, using only the brakes. Barring these irritants, it has been smooth sailing with the Rizta, and I’m looking forward to adding more digits to the odo reading. Strong regen, along with rear brake usage, can cause the rear wheel to lock up easily. Nevertheless, the biggest advantage of any EV has to be the beautifully low running cost. Per my usage, I spend around Rs 1,000 on fuel every month with my Access, but using the Rizta, that number drops to roughly just Rs 120! Also See: TVS iQube S long-term review, 2,200km report",

    "description": "Honda has infused fresh life into the Amaze, its compact sedan, with a significant update. As Honda’s current bestseller in India, the Amaze carries high expectations, especially following the lackluster performance of the Elevate and the decline in sales of the City. This third-generation Amaze arrives just in time to face off against the all-new Maruti Dzire, which not only boasts an updated powertrain and features but also wears a coveted five-star Global NCAP safety rating. While the Amaze now looks sharper inside and out, it retains its predecessor's powertrain. To bolster its safety credentials, Honda has equipped the Amaze with a camera-based ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) suite, instead of relying on external crash test certifications. Front styling resembles the Elevate with its upright grille and chrome treatment. With prices ranging from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10.90 lakh (ex-showroom), the new Amaze is priced above the Dzire (Rs 6.79-10.14 lakh). Interestingly, Honda will continue selling the second-generation Amaze in lower-spec petrol-manual variants to cater to budget-conscious buyers. Also, while there’s no factory-fitted CNG version, customers can opt for a dealer-installed CNG kit for an additional Rs 1 lakh, covered under Honda’s warranty. It looks like a barely shrunken City from the rear. Styling updates align the new Amaze with Honda’s latest design language. The upright grille and chrome detailing give the front a resemblance to the Elevate, while the rear looks like a barely shrunken City. The side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, but new elements like door-mounted mirrors and wider 185/60 R15 tyres with diamond-cut alloys add freshness. The overall dimensions are similar to the second-gen model, but the width has grown by 38mm, improving road presence. New Honda Amaze interiors The Amaze adopts a minimalist dashboard layout, echoing the Elevate's design, but without premium touches like soft materials or faux wood accents. The 8-inch touchscreen, though functional, feels small by modern standards. However, the beige-black cabin colour scheme does elevate its appeal to some extent.  The dashboard is identical to the Elevate, but it lacks the faux wood panel and soft touch bits. The beige-black interior theme adds brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster, as well as the neat, buttoned climate control console. Thigh support is inadequate at the front; the centre armrest is sorely missed. The front seats lack sufficient thigh support, and the absence of an armrest is likely to hamper driver comfort on long drives. The rear seat offers good support and a comfy backrest angle, but the narrow cabin width makes accommodating three adults a challenge. Taller passengers will also find headroom limited. On the upside, the Amaze now features rear air-conditioning vents, three rear headrests, three-point seatbelts, and class-leading 416 litres of boot space. New Honda Amaze ADAS, features The talking point of this new-gen Amaze is its camera-based ADAS suite, which includes lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and blind-spot monitor, among others. The lane-keep assist function activates only once the vehicle speed crosses 72kph, and it works seamlessly when both lanes are clearly marked. The rear seat is supportive and comfy; headroom is in short supply for taller passengers. Adaptive cruise control works well in stop-go conditions, too; however, in the manual version, gear shifts will deactivate cruise control. The blind-spot monitor displays a video feed of the left side of the vehicle on the screen upon using the indicator or activating this feature manually. While it is very useful, it takes up the whole touchscreen display, and while using maps, particularly, this can be a bit inconvenient. Lane-keeping assist works seamlessly on a clearly marked road. Additional equipment includes six airbags, wireless charging, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, rain-sensing wipers, and auto LED headlamps. However, missing features like a sunroof and a 360-degree camera are likely to give the Maruti Dzire an edge. Also, while there are a couple of USB Type-A ports in the front as well as 12V power sockets in the front and rear, there isn't a single USB Type-C port to speak of. New Honda Amaze performance A familiar 1.2-litre petrol engine continues to power the Amaze. This is a very rev-happy engine, with its power flowing only higher up the rev range. It builds pace only beyond 2000rpm, and from thereon, you can feel prominent tugs in power along the rev band, with a particularly strong pull beyond 4500rpm, almost all the way until 6700rpm. But there’s simply no getting away from its weak responses below 2000rpm.  The CVT (auto) masks this engine's weak bottom end very well; gets Sport mode, and paddle shifters too. To counter this and improve drivability, Honda has shortened the first and second gear ratios of the 5-speed manual gearbox. Despite this, it warrants constant downshifts in slow-moving traffic, on steep slopes, and also while trying to drive off from speed breakers. The third gear is quite tall too, which, coupled with the naturally aspirated petrol's weak midrange, does warrant a downshift to second for quick highway overtakes. Thankfully, this gearbox is smooth and has short throws, and even its clutch pedal feels light and effortless.  Soft suspension results in a fair bit of body roll around corners. Its CVT (continuously variable transmission) automatic complements this engine well and masks its weakness by keeping it in its optimum power band at all times. But with a heavy foot, this belt-and-pulley transmission will portray the typical ‘rubber band effect’, wherein the engine revs rise without a corresponding effect on the vehicle’s speed. It also gets a Sport mode, which keeps the transmission in a lower ratio, thereby extracting the most performance out of this engine. Its paddle shifters are nice and reactive and particularly useful when there’s a need for engine braking.  Cabin sound insulation could have been a bit better though, and engine, road, and ambient noises filters through a fair bit. New Honda Amaze ride and handling The soft suspension compresses a fair bit under full load, so you'll need to cross speed breakers with caution, despite its 172mm ground clearance. The Amaze’s suspension setup leans towards comfort, soaking up smaller bumps with ease but struggling over sharper potholes. Ground clearance has improved slightly to 172mm, but a fully loaded car can cause the rear suspension to compress significantly, requiring caution over large speed breakers. Wider tyres enhance grip, but body roll remains pronounced due to the soft setup. Steering is well-weighted and consistent, and a tight turning radius (4.9m on top variants; 4.7m for the base variant with 175/65 R14 tyres) makes city driving effortless. New Honda Amaze verdict The third-generation Amaze builds on its predecessor’s strengths with updated styling, better safety tech (ADAS), and improved practicality. Its CVT variant stands out as the smoothest automatic in its class, effectively masking the engine’s weaknesses. However, the absence of certain features like a sunroof and the higher pricing could deter some buyers. While it doesn’t feel as compelling as the mighty Dzire, the Amaze remains a solid choice for those seeking a well-rounded compact sedan and is likely to remain Honda’s bestseller in India.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki has hit a new milestone by manufacturing two million vehicles in India in the calendar year 2025. The India arm of Japanese multinational Suzuki Motor Corporation claims to be the country’s only passenger vehicle manufacturer to have achieved this feat. It also boasts to be the first among Suzuki Motor’s global automobile manufacturing facilities to reach this landmark. Two Haryana plants manufacture 60 percent of Maruti vehicles Maruti has a third production facility at Hansalpur, Gujarat  The fourth one, coming up in Kharkhoda, Haryana, will be ready next year Ertiga becomes the two millionth Maruti built this year Maruti says the two millionth vehicle built this year was an Ertiga MPV, which rolled off its Manesar facility in Haryana. While Maruti Suzuki has a long list of models on sale in India, the top five vehicles manufactured by it during this year were the Baleno, Fronx, Ertiga, WagonR and Brezza. Three Maruti plants active, fourth one to open next year The company says 60 percent of the two million units were manufactured at its Gurugram and Manesar facilities in Haryana, with the Hansalpur plant in Gujarat accounting for the rest. These three plants have a combined annual production capacity of 2.35 million units, and an all-new production facility being readied at Kharkhoda in Haryana will take that number to 4 million units. Moreover, Maruti is scouting for another location for one more production facility with a yearly capacity of one million units. Seventeen Maruti models exported overseas These production facilities not only cater to the domestic demand but also build vehicles for export to both left-hand-drive and right-hand-drive markets. Currently, Maruti exports 17 made-in-India models to around 100 countries. The company’s top export models include the Fronx, Jimny, Baleno, Dzire and Swift. eVitara, 7-seater SUV launching next year As for new products, Maruti launched the new Dzire in India last month. The company will showcase its first-ever electric vehicle for India, the e Vitara SUV, at the upcoming Bharat Mobility Auto Expo in New Delhi, which starts on January 17. Later in the year, Maruti plans to launch the three-row SUV based on the Grand Vitara that was spied testing recently.",

    "description": "Porsche and Audi India have issued a recall for the Taycan and the e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT, respectively, over a potential defect in the battery module that could cause a fire hazard. As per SIAM, a total of 207 cars were affected, which included 176 Taycans and 31 units of either the e-tron GT or RS e-tron GT. 39 units of both models had been previously recalled for the same issue A total of 207 units have been affected this time SIAM noted that the affected units of the Porsche Taycan were manufactured between October 21, 2019 and March 4, 2024. For the Audi e-tron GT pair, affected units were manufactured between January 1, 2020 and February 16, 2024. The recall, officially issued in November, stated that under certain circumstances, there is a possibility that the battery cell modules may have certain technical irregularities from the time of production. This could lead to a rise in temperature and, ultimately, fire in the high-performance EVs as a result of a short circuit within the battery module. Incidentally, both cars are sibling models and share a 93kWh battery pack. Earlier, recalls for select ICE models like the Porsche 911 (992) and Audi Q7 were announced due to mechanical issues. Ex-showroom prices of the Porsche Taycan start at Rs 1.89 crore, while the Audi e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT cost Rs 1.71 and Rs 1.95 crore, respectively. Both brands are run under the Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Private Limited division here. There has been no official communication from either Porsche or Audi yet, but both brands are expected to reach out to the owners of the affected units to schedule an appointment and fix the issue free of cost.
