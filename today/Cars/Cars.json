    "description": "Budget car specialist Dacia introduces its first electric car to the UK, and it's a bargain Ignoring the Dacia Spring is impossible if you’re hunting for a small electric car. Its headline-grabbing starting price of £14,995 makes it comfortably the cheapest electric car on sale in the UK today, undercutting the Citroën ë-C3 by £6995 and the Fiat 500e by £10,000.The arrival of the Spring expands Dacia's value offering to six models, ahead of the launch of the much larger Bigster next year. With its supermini proportions, the Spring is by far the smallest of the lot. Given that it’s punily powered (44bhp) at that headline price and that moving up the model hierarchy is unlikely to prove prohibitive for most cash customers, it’s surprising to learn that many are ordering this new city car in its most basic form: at less than 15 grand, please, with 44bhp, and no matter that it takes 19.1sec to reach 62mph.Of more interest to most customers, though is the more powerful Dacia Spring 65, which has a whopping 64bhp motor, pulling its acceleration from a 1965 Hillman Minx-equalling level to that of a 1992 Renault Clio 1.2 (13.7sec) in one fell swoop. Dacia Spring range at a glanceThe Dacia Spring is nice and simple. There are just two models to choose from - 45 and 65 - and two specification levels: Expression and Extreme. The 26.8kWh battery is officially good for 140 miles between charges. Before you scoff, it’s a really usable range for city drivers. Dacia says most drivers average 23 miles a day at an average speed of 23mph, and it claims drivers could expect up to 180 miles per charge in those circumstances.VersionPowerSpring 4544bhpSpring 6564bhpBut how does the Dacia Spring actually drive, and are too many compromises made to reach that low entry price?

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/electric-bmw-3-series-spotted-first-look-reborn-i3-2026",
    "description": "The BMW i3 of 2026 will look nothing like the quirky electric hatchback that went before BMW's radical Neue Klasse concept will evolve into the next 3 Series, which is now testing with electric power The radical new electric BMW 3 Series has hit the road for the first time, as the company gears up to take on the Tesla Model 3 and next Mercedes-Benz CLA in 2026. Expected to revive the dormant i3 moniker, the electric 3 Series will be the second model to use BMW's new Neue Klasse modular EV platform, following the launch of the closely related iX3 SUV in 2025. It was previewed last year by the boldly styled Neue Klasse concept, which introduced a striking new design language that departs dramatically from the look of BMW's current line-up while subtly nodding to some of its most important past models. While the prototype in these images has clearly been toned down slightly for production, it does retain the distinctive new kidney grilles, which wrap around the front of the car and house all the radars and cameras needed to facilitate next-generation advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The ultra-slim slashes have been replaced, though, by more conventional LED headlights, and the front of the car has been softened slightly with the introduction of a full-width lower bumper.  The rear looks to have been more substantially evolved from the concept, with the chunky lower splitter replaced by a more traditional bumper and circular brake light clusters swapped in for the substantial wrap-around LED bar that adorned the concept - although these could be temporary units put in place for testing only. Camouflage prevents us from gleaning too many more details, but BMW's trademark Hofmeister kink is just visible ahead of the C-pillar and the concept's full-length panoramic roof looks to have been retained. Our spies didn't manage to photograph the cabin, but BMW's two Neue Klasse concepts were both minimalist and tech-heavy affairs inside, with large, irregularly shaped central touchscreens, haptic steering-wheel controls and a full-width head-up display in place of any physical switches and buttons. BMW has yet to confirm full specifications of its crucial new electric saloon, but the Neue Klasse platform will be equipped with 800V electrical hardware to allow it to keep pace with the quickest-charging EVs on sale, while the batteries in the floorpan will be 20% more energy-dense than today's packs. Meanwhile, a more stringent focus on aerodynamics, in combination with more efficient motors and a new software stack, will boost range by up to 30%, BMW has said.  Like today's BMW 4 Series and BMW 5 Series, the next-generation 3 Series will be sold both with pure-electric and internal-combustion power, with BMW committed to maintaining a flexible powertrain offering across its line-up in the run-up to going all-electric. The firm is one of few mainstream car makers to have not set a date for the end of ICE car sales, but on current planning it will have to sell only EVs in the UK and Europe from 2035. The firm is working to make its current engines compliant with upcoming emissions regulations, though has not yet confirmed what the offering will be for the next 3 Series.  The current, G20-generation model is available with a choice of 2.0-litre four-cylinder and 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engines or as a plug-in hybrid with an electric range of 63 miles, having dropped all diesel engines in an update earlier this year.  While the Neue Klasse concept and this prototype have previewed the saloon variant, it's expected that the strong-selling 3 Series Touring estate will return, providing a rival for the upcoming electric Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake and Audi A4 E-tron Avant. The 3 Series will also once again spawn a hot M3, which will match the standard car in offering both petrol and electric power - the latter said to offer 'crazy' dynamic behaviour, courtesy of an advanced torque-vectoring programme that can vary the power to each of its four motors in milliseconds.  BMW has not yet indicated when it will unveil the next 3 Series, but the new iX3 is expected to break cover early in 2025, so the wraps could come off the saloon within a year.",

Indian’s beginner-friendly cruiser has been out of circulation for four years, but it’s finally back. And, like the Scout, it returns with a new engine and a new tubular steel frame. If you’re not familiar with the Sixty’s backstory, it was introduced in 2015 as a more accessible version of the Scout, with a lower price tag and a smaller engine. The new Indian Scout Sixty continues that fine tradition, powered by a new 999 cc version of the 1,133 cc mill in the Indian Scout. The new Indian Scout Sixty comes in three different variants; the Scout Sixty Bobber, Scout Sixty Classic, and US-only Sport Scout Sixty.…",

Mostly, they were quirky oil-dripping British bikes or nefarious “love ’em or hate ’em” Harley-Davidsons. The truth is, 1960s America was car crazy. Even 16-year-old kids could afford cars and gas was practically free. The tide began to turn, however, in the late ’60s when the avalanche of Japanese manufacturing technology hit America’s shores. Baby boomers had suddenly become a major purchasing force and motor vehicles evolved from practical and utilitarian to fun and exciting. In motorcycle terms, we all know what happened: four-cylinder overhead cam bikes from Honda suddenly became the new world standard for performance and reliability.…",

    "link": "",
    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "At a time when most passenger vehicle brands are shifting focus towards SUVs, Maruti believes it's crucial to have a strong product line-up across all mass-market segments, including sedans, for a high market share. “Although the SUV segment is growing, all other segments are equally important for us; Because, to retain our high market share, we have to have a presence in each segment. Especially in the sedan segment, which is traditionally very important,” MD and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said on the sidelines of the new Dzire launch. Maruti has spent Rs 1,000 crore on developing the fourth-gen Dzire Sedans currently account for around 8 percent of the total PV volume Maruti aims to increase sedan market to 10 percent with the new Dzire New Dzire to rejuvinate compact sedan segment  Hatchbacks or small cars and sedans have seen a significant decline in sales over the past decade, leading automakers to put their major focus on SUVs, with several even vacating the small car space altogether. The sedan segment has also been missing major product action for some time now. For Maruti, however, things are slightly different, as the brand continues to focus on popular models like the Dzire, with timely updates and model changes. “The compact sedan is a very reliable and stable segment. We can count on stable numbers all the time,” Takeuchi said. The automaker spent Rs 1,000 crore on the design, development, and production of the new 4th-generation Dzire, which comes with the Swift’s 1.2-litre three-cylinder Z12E engine and a slew of new features, including added safety tech. With the new Dzire, the automaker expects to re-energise the segment. “Taking a long perspective, by 2030, we feel the passenger vehicle market will be around 60 lakh units and sedans will still have a reasonable pie of close to 10 percent,” said senior executive officer for Marketing and Sales Partho Banerjee. Sedans currently account for around 8 percent of the total passenger vehicle volume and compact sub-4 meter models contribute to approximately 70 percent of that segment. Maruti Suzuki is the market leader in the compact sedan space with a share of around 60 percent. Last year, it sold around 1.6 lakh units of the Dzire. The Dzire generates a significant part of its sales from the fleet segment, where it is exclusively sold as the low-frills 'Tour S' variant for fleet operators. Around 65-70 percent of the Dzire sales come from the personal segment, while the rest account for the fleet segment. “With the previous-generation Dzire, there was a challenge to meet the different requirements of personal and fleet customer segments. So, we used to keep a balance to serve both segments,” Banerjee said. However, in a bid to prioritise the requirement of private buyers, Maruti is offering the fourth-generation Dzire only for personal mobility. For fleet users, the automaker will continue with the previous-generation Dzire, branded as Maruti Tour S. Apart from the Dzire, the Tata Tigor, Honda Amaze, and Hyundai Aura are other models in the compact sedan space.  With inputs from Yukta Mudgal Also see: 2024 Maruti Suzuki Dzire review: India's favourite sedan massively updated 2024 Maruti Dzire image gallery New Maruti Dzire video review",

TVS, Bajaj, Hero EV sales crosses 65,000 mark in October Top 10 e2W makers had a combined 44 percent market share Legacy brands registered their best-ever monthly retail sales in October.

The remaining 9 percent was being fought for by the rest of the field – 196 players. In October, Vahan retail sales data reflected all 209 e-wheeler manufacturers in India. Ola Electric, which had a torrid August and September, remains the No. 1 e2W OEM. It bounced back with 41,664 units in October, its third-highest monthly score after the 53,640 units in March and 41,794 units in July. With a 30 percent market share, the company accounts for the bulk of the top 10 startups’ sales. Bengaluru-based Ather Energy, which clocked its best-ever monthly retail sales of 16,000 units in October, has an 11.50 percent market share. The remaining eight startups – Bounce, Revolt Motors, River Mobility, Pur Energy, Simple Energy, Okinawa Autotech and Oben Electric – account for 3,397 units and a 5.56 percent market share. Revolt Motors (949 e-motorcycles) and Simple Energy (324 e-scooters) both registered their best-ever monthly sales. Not very long ago, it was felt that EV startups, with their perceived absence of legacy issues, IT technology prowess, venture capital investments and the ability to burn cash to get a foothold in the market, would stamp their dominance in this segment of zero-emission mobility. However, TVS, Bajaj and Hero MotoCorp, the three legacy ICE OEMs that have diversified and plugged into e-mobility, are proving to be a resilient lot and giving the two-wheeler startup world a run for its money and more. These three, with their strong R\u0026D setup and component supplier base, are clearly benefiting from their growing localisation levels, the introduction of new variants, brand power and the marketing strength that comes from a large dealer network across the country.

    "description": "SUVs are all the rage today, but no one told the Dzire that. It continues to be a strong seller. Last year, the compact sedan found 1.57 lakh buyers – that’s more than all its competitors combined. Even more impressive is that this figure puts it ahead of compact SUVs like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and Maruti Fronx. So, unlike the Ciaz, Maruti has lavished plenty of attention on this sedan, with regular updates since the original was launched in 2008. As with all predecessors, the Dzire is based on the Swift, and this new model shares its underpinnings with the latest Swift, which was introduced earlier this year. While it’s based on the previous car and shares its ‘Heartect’ platform, there are massive changes to technical bits, such as the suspension and the structural elements of the body. There are aesthetic changes too, and thus, Maruti classifies this as the 4th generation. LED headlights with integrated DRLs now horizontally oriented. Except for the height, where the new Dzire is 10mm taller at 1,525mm, the new car is identical to the outgoing model in length (3,995mm), width (1,735mm), and wheelbase (2,450mm). The width and wheelbase are also identical to those of the new Swift. Maruti Suzuki Dzire exterior style With each generation, Maruti has further distanced the Dzire from the Swift, and this one sees the maximum separation. One look, or even a good long stare at the two cars outside, will not clue you into their shared genes. The Dzire looks very different, and the styling is very sedan-like with a horizontal orientation, unlike the previous car, which carried vertically styled elements. That’s clearly seen with the LED headlights, which are narrow, horizontally shaped units housing thin DRLs and crystal-like cube elements laid out horizontally. The grille has an Audi-esque familiarity to it, thanks to the large trapezoidal shape. That said, though, the Dzire’s front end has its own style and looks very smart and elegant, topped by a flatter bonnet compared to the previous car. Alloys are 15-inch units with 185/65 section tyres. On the side, the curves on the doors look similar to the model before, but with the reshaped front and rear fenders, the new car does stand apart. Alloys are newly designed units, 15 inches in diameter, and carry 185/65 sized tyres. Atop, there’s a shark fin antenna instead of a regular one. The tail-lights are squarish but carry a tri-arrow-shaped LED light signature laid horizontally, and that lends more visual width to the car. The boot has an added lip spoiler, and the lower edge of the bumper has a sporty-looking chamfered strip moulded into it. It helps widen the car visually and will make for a sporty touch with some contrasting shade. Dzire RS coming up, Suzuki? Lower edge of the bumper features a sporty-looking chamfered strip.   Maruti Suzuki Dzire interior style, space and comfort While the exterior bears no resemblance to the Swift, the interior is nearly identical. The dashboard, centre console, steering wheel, and instrument panel are all carried over but have a different colour scheme that uses beige on the dash, door pads and seats, and wood trim across the dash. It looks smart and neat, and all controls are well laid out and easy to use. While some might have preferred a fully digital instrument panel with a graphics-heavy design, the twin dials look neat, sporty, and very easy to read at a glance. Faux wood trim on the dashboard adds a premium touch. Front seats are comfy with soft cushioning, and overall space is just fine; at the rear, however, headroom is tight. Despite the 5mm increase in height over the Swift, headroom feels compromised, largely due to the sunroof, which has resulted in a lower headliner. The liner is scooped out towards the rear, but I had just about a three-finger space to the top, and the roof does feel close to your head. Comfort-wise, the seat is fine, softly cushioned like the front, and there’s a rear armrest, twin AC vents, and two USB ports for rear passengers. Boot space is just about adequate, at 382 litres – the lowest in the class – and the rear seat back is fixed (cannot be folded down).   Lower headliner thanks to sunroof limits headroom.    Maruti Suzuki Dzire features and safety Big new features on the Dzire are a sunroof and a 360-degree camera; while the sunroof is small and has a more feel-good factor, the 360-degree camera offers a clear view with a 3D display and dynamic rear parking lines. Other features are a 9-inch touchscreen unit with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, wireless phone charging, connected car tech, and cruise control. Given what’s on offer today in this price segment, Maruti Suzuki should have had a few more features, such as premium audio hardware, cooled seats, and ambient lighting.  360-degree camera offers a clear view with a 3D display. While these features go amiss, it’s nice to see that the safety kit is elaborate and standard across variants. Six airbags, 3-point seatbelts for all occupants, ISO-FIX child seat mounts, ABS, ESP, and Hill Hold Assist will feature in every Dzire sold. What’s even nicer to see, and will be a big surprise for many, is the 5-star adult occupant and 4-star child occupant protection rating the Dzire has scored under the GNCAP safety protocol. The performance in these new enhanced safety protocols is commendable, and while it may not be a 360-degree assessment of everything that can go wrong, it covers a significant portion of road accidents and is a good barometer for the safety potential of a car. Maruti Suzuki Dzire engine and performance The new Dzire is powered by the recently introduced Z12E engine that debuted with the new Swift. Like in the Swift, the 3-cylinder unit puts out an identical 82hp at 5700rpm and 112Nm of torque at 4300rpm. It feels identical in nature too. There are some vibrations at low rpms, but these fade away as you drive on. The engine is quite audible, but at low and mid speeds, it has a likeable audio note with it, only sounding strained at the top end. 82hp engine lacks pep but has good low-end response. 82hp may not sound like much, and indeed, it is 8hp lower than the outgoing K12M engine. However, at low engine speeds, the response is good and the car moves off the line cleanly and crisply. Power then builds up in a gentle and linear fashion, and keeps coming in even above 5,000rpm, so there is some merit in revving it further. Those who like a spirited drive will end up doing so, as the engine isn’t peppy and lively. It even red lines at 6,000rpm, which is about 400rpm lower than the previous unit. In a quick test, it took over 13 seconds to 100kph from zero, which is slower than the previous car. However, we’ll soon put it through our standard instrument tests to measure all the figures. Don’t hold your breath, though, as the Dzire will be slower than the Swift, which itself wasn’t very impressive. Wheelbase is identical to the previous-gen Dzire. Going through the gears isn't a chore; the 5-speed gearbox has been tweaked and features a new hydraulic clutch. It's very smooth and light in effort, and the gear throws are also light and easy. Shifts on the AMT are smooth and at a moderate pace, and there's a minimal gap between shifts; it also downshifts a gear or two readily, but put your foot down and the pause gets very pronounced, and this does slow down the car during hard acceleration. There is a tip function to the gear lever that enables you to manually control shifts.  Both manual and AMT are smooth shifting gearboxes.  The main calling card for the new powerplant is efficiency, with the Dzire now claiming a figure of 24.79kpl for the 5-speed manual, which is up from the earlier cars' 23.26kpl claim. The AMT version claims a figure of 25.71kpl. There's also a CNG version, which we are yet to drive, and that promises 33.73kms/kg from its 70ps and 102Nm power unit. Maruti Suzuki Dzire ride and handling Like the powertrain, the Dzire’s suspension hardware is also carried over from the Swift, with McPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam setup at the rear. Small tweaks have been made to the spring and dampers; however, these are only to compensate for the increase in kerb weight, which, at 960 kg, is 40 kilos more than the Swift. The character thus remains the same, and that’s a very good thing. Like the hatch, the sedan also rides very well; bump absorption is good, and regular potholes and ruts are smoothed out well. Ride is comfy and compliant with agile handling. On the handling front, too, it impresses like the Swift. The electric power steering is smooth and fluid, and it returns to the centre in a very natural manner. Push it hard, and there is some body roll, but for everyday and even some spirited driving, it corners well with a progressive and controlled lean, offering good road grip.   Maruti Suzuki Dzire price and verdict Maruti Suzuki has clearly put in significant effort with the new Dzire. The car looks and feels very different from before; it’s elegant and more sedan-like, and that’s commendable given the tight confines of its sub-4-meter footprint. It rides very well, the handling is good and sporty, and the engine is more than adequate for everyday driving. It’s well equipped, too, and features like the sunroof and 360-degree camera will be appreciated, as will the fact that this is Maruti Suzuki’s first 5-star GNCAP car. It’s priced between Rs 6.79 lakh and Rs 10.14 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). So is it perfect, then? No, rear headroom is tight, and it should have offered a few more of today’s must-have features, but this won’t be enough to deter buyers, especially not when you weigh it against its impressive breadth of abilities. So, like its predecessor, the new Dzire will continue to ring the cash register for Maruti and is all set to carry on being the flagbearer for sedans in an increasingly dominant SUV world.
