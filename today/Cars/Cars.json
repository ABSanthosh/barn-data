    "description": "This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro coupe is one of what is believed to be approximately 1,000 examples ordered with the COPO 427ci L72 V8 for the model year. Ordered new through the Performance Division of Belmont Chevrolet–Oldsmobile in Weston, Ontario, the car was raced by the original owner and stored through the late 1970s. It has since changed hands several times, undergoing two refurbishments during which the body was refinished in Olympic Gold over a reupholstered Midnight Green interior and the engine was removed and stored for over two decades. Equipment includes a Muncie M21 four-speed manual transmission, a Hurst shifter, and a 12-bolt rear end with a Positraction differential as well as power front disc brakes, 14″ XT steel wheels, a chambered dual exhaust system, a Holley carburetor, a Winters high-rise intake manifold, and a cowl-induction hood.

    "description": "SUV and Saloon are the first of seven 0 Series Hondas due by 2030 SUV is one of two prototypes shown at CES previewing range of radical electric cars Honda has ramped up preparations for its new family of next-generation 0 Series EVs by revealing full prototype versions of its radically styled Saloon and SUV. The 0 Saloon and 0 SUV are the first of seven planned EVs that will sit on an all-new platform. Both are due to be launched in North America next year before arriving in other markets, including Europe. Honda previewed the 0 Saloon with a concept model at the CES tech event last year. The firm has now returned to the Las Vegas show to reveal a prototype version of the saloon, which notably remains true to the concept in both exterior and interior styling, alongside the prototype SUV. The new 0 SUV is described as being based on the Space Hub concept that Honda showed at CES last year, although it features substantially different proportions from that boxy vehicle. Honda describes it as a “mid-size” SUV. It appears to be slightly shorter than the saloon and has a more upright, defined windscreen at the front but it is designed to maximise interior space, with a more MPV-esque rear section that features a squared-off tail. Honda has yet to reveal any firm technical details about either car, although it has previously disclosed to Autocar key information about the platform they will sit on and the firm’s upcoming EV technology. The key design philosophy of the 0 Series EV platform is “thin, light and wise”. That includes a focus on making lighter battery packs that are around 8mm thinner than those used by rival firms and can be mounted lower in the platform. Honda claims this will enable sporty handling as well as improve the interior packaging of the vehicles. That in turn means the Saloon can sit lower than some rivals and have more sculpted bodywork, helping to improve its efficiency. All 0 Series models will be offered with single- and dual-motor powertrains, which will use new compact e-axle motors that are also designed to be mounted lower in the car. Entry-level models will feature a 241bhp motor on the rear axle, while dual-motor versions will provide four-wheel drive. Initially, top-end versions will offer a system output of around 482bhp. The 0 Series Saloon will use a nickel-manganese-cobalt battery with a capacity of 80-90kWh, for an estimated range of more than 300 miles. Larger models will be offered with packs of around 100kWh. Another key technology will be megacasting, with Honda using special presses to create large sections of the platform in single cast parts, which will reduce both complexity and weight. In total, Honda claims its 0 Series models will weigh around 100kg less than current-generation EVs of a similar size. The company has also outlined some of the cutting-edge technology that will make the 0 Series EVs ‘wise’, including a new software operating system that has been developed in-house and will run all the key vehicle systems. Notably, Honda has named it Asimo OS, a nod to the series of humanoid robots it has produced since 1986. The Asimo OS will be used to integrate the various electronic control units for vehicle systems, such as automated driving and advanced driver aids, with the in-vehicle infotainment systems. It will be continuously added to via over-the-air updates. The sporting focus of Honda models will be built on through software-controlled 3D gyro sensors, which will be used to apply stabilisation control via systems Honda says it has developed on its robots. Honda claims 0 Series models will be capable of level-three automated driving, which allows the driver to take their hands off the wheel in certain situations. The firm previously offered level-three autonomy on the Legend with its Sensing Elite technology and claims the new system builds on that and can be utilised in a wider range of situations (where local laws allow). The SUV will be the first of the 0 Series models to arrive in 2026, and is expected to land in the UK before the end of that year. A larger seven-seater is earmarked for 2027 and two further SUVs, described as compact and small, will follow. A compact saloon is due by 2030 too. At CES, Honda also confirmed a new deal with Japanese semiconductor firm Renesas to develop a new high-performance system-on-chip that will be used for its subsequent next-generation models, which will arrive in the late 2020s. Honda claims it will allow for substantially faster and more advanced processing performance than in current cars, but with only a minimal increase in power consumption.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-reveals-radical-panoramic-idrive-system-neue-klasse-cars",
    "description": "New steering wheel uses haptic buttons that illuminate when certain functions become available New dashboard with angled touchscreen will feature in all future cars; physical buttons will not BMW has revealed the production version of the next-generation Panoramic iDrive interface that will feature in all of its future models. The bold new system, revealed at Las Vegas’s CES tech event, will first be used in the production version of the Neue Class X electric SUV, due later this year, then subsequently be adopted by both electric and combustion models. The Panoramic iDrive interior concept comprises four separate elements, with the most eye-catching a chunky display that is projected across a black strip stretching across the width of the windscreen. It includes key driving information – such as speed – in front of the driver, alongside which are six customisable ‘particle’ slots. There is then a centrally positioned touchscreen, which is notably angled towards the driver, running BMW’s new Operating System X software. Based on Android code, OS X has been developed in-house, with the X (rather than 10) designation subtly noting that it marks a step change from the old OS 9. For right-hand-drive models, BMW will produce a touchscreen that slopes in the opposite direction. It is capable of receiving over-the-air software updates and has been fully developed as a touch- and voice-control system. It has also been designed to be more intuitive. For example, the sat-nav map is now the standard background. It features no physical controls, with BMW reasoning that these have limited its ability to offer more complex and varied options. The system works in conjunction with a new steering wheel featuring a number of physical buttons that offer haptic feedback. Finally there’s an optional 3D head-up display (HUD) that projects info into the driver’s line of sight above the Panoramic Vision strip. As the various elements have been developed together, BMW claims they are fully integrated. So, for instance, the HUD will show directions while the Panoramic Display gives further info on roads. BMW said the system was developed based on real-world anonymised usage data gleaned from its existing fleet of more than 22 million vehicles and then refined in usability lab tests.  Key elements of the new BMW interior 3D head-up display This optional unit projects navigation and driving information, complementing that in the Panoramic Display, onto the bottom of the windscreen. Panoramic Vision This dashboard spanning projection features six slots. Driving information is fixed, the rest can be customised. Steering wheel The primary physical controller features ‘shy-tech’ haptic buttons, which will illuminate when certain functions are available, such as answering a phone call Central display Sloped towards the driver for ease of reach, this touchscreen features BMW’s latest operating system, OS X. Voice control also features. Q\u0026A: Christian Bauer, vice-president of user interface design, BMW Why is the screen closer to the driver than before?  “In the past, our screens have started behind the steering wheel and extended to the middle, so they have to be a little far away from you. With the Panoramic Vision, we can put the content that is really necessary up there where you have to look anyway and can move the touchscreen closer to you.” Why is it angled like that? “We put a 16deg kink on it, which nods to BMW heritage [such as the Hofmeister kink]. But it’s shaped in that direction because it means you have a perfect ergonomic position. It means you have a very short distance from the steering wheel to the display.” Did you consider a vertically oriented screen? “We want to enhance driver interaction, and our slogan is ‘eyes on the road and hands on the wheel’, which means everything has to be in a perfect situation. This is the perfect situation for the technology that we have right now.”",

But this plucky Yamaha SR150 bobber comes from an outfit that’s new to these pages; Balls Custom. Based in New Taipei City, the cheekily-named Balls Custom shop is part workshop, part café.

    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "We in the car-reviewing industry are no strangers to a bit of marketing fluff. Our eyes are now desensitised to it, trained to gloss over the flowery writing in every press release, honing in instead on the facts and figures. But there’s something about the way Rolls-Royce does it that’s so enchanting; you want to savour it instead, like letting a sip of wine swirl around your tongue before drinking it. The vocabulary is sophisticated but not overpowering, inviting rather than technical, drawing you discreetly into a life of luxury with every advancing word. I don’t know the exact cubic capacity of the engine, but for a change, I don’t care. Owners are ‘clients’, the best-seller is the ‘most-requested model’, an SUV is a ‘high-sided vehicle’, and acceleration is ‘progress’. Their used-car business is called ‘Provenance’ – it’s just incredible! The reason I bring up Rolls’ bewitching turn of phrase is because it reinforces the fact that it won’t let its standard drop, it won’t make a compromise, and it certainly won’t do entry-level. And as the veil comes off the Series II (Rolls speak for facelift) Ghost, the brand’s ‘more approachable’ saloon, it’s clear they haven’t done any of that. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost design Did you know the core tenet of Rolls-Royce’s design philosophy is to begin with square, upright, straight lines at the front, and finish with smooth curves at the tail? I didn’t, but now I can’t look at any model from the marque’s 120-year history and not see it. In the Ghost, that begins with the unmistakable Pantheon grille up front, the Spirit of Ecstasy tipped forward proudly atop it. Sharp lines frame the rectangular headlamps and a bonnet that is purposefully long, falling vertically down the sides in flanks that enhance its 2.1-metre width and monolithic form. But then, as the window line approaches, the lines soften and dip, flowing into an almost triangular D-pillar and elegant tail. Unlike most facelifts that add styling elements, the Series II Ghost subtracts and simplifies. The front is a lot cleaner now, with slimmer, softer-edged headlamps and a single line of LED light signature. The complex, almost sporty air dam in the front bumper has been supplanted by a slim, single piece low down, though it must be said the Black Badge version you see here does have some passive aggression – beg your pardon, ‘assertion’ – in its air intakes. There are striking new 22-inch wheel designs across the range; a separate selection for the Black Badge that are more ‘open’ to better view the brake calipers. And at the rear, the LED tail-lamps feature the distinctive vertical strakes first introduced in the Spectre EV. Black Badge wheels designed to show off brakes.   2025 Rolls Royce Ghost interior, features The bigger news if you’re an actual Ghost client (See? It’s working) is that the customisation catalogue, called Bespoke, has expanded considerably to include options introduced in the Phantom Series II, Cullinan Series II and Spectre. These range from the subtle to the ostentatious to the downright bizarre. “We don’t like saying no,” explains Phil Fabre de la Grange, head of the Bespoke division, and he’s right. Why shouldn’t a Ghost client have access to the full catalogue? And this only furthers the idea that there’s no such thing as entry-level with Rolls-Royce. Unlike the parent company BMW, Rolls-Royce’s steering rims are as thin as possible. A big new addition is ‘Duality Twill’ – a complex and colourful stitching pattern meant to intertwine the R-R letters with nautical rope knots, which pairs nicely with the new sustainable bamboo-based rayon upholstery. It uses 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to create. There’s a new backlit Spirit of Ecstasy timepiece in the dashboard, and if you look closely at the famous ‘starlight headliner’, a shooting star will streak across at random every now and then. Sunroofs are so gauche. Another detail I love is the move from chrome-ringed fixed digital dials to a modern-looking full-digital instrument screen, which is customisable – once when you order the car. It’s crisp, clean and colour-coded to the interior or exterior of your car, and you can’t change it on the fly. Speaking of the interior, as with every Rolls, it doesn’t shout about its tech in the same way, say, a Maybach does. Buried deep under thick layers of hide, veneer, chrome and shagpile is the best the BMW Group has to offer; in fact, better, as it’s not as complicated as BMW’s i-Drive. Press a chrome button and a wooden table folds out of the front seatbacks, revealing a touchscreen that was until now hidden behind it. Each of the four doors is servo-assisted, and the motors shut softly at the push of a button. Even the beautifully analogue metal organ-stop toggles are connected to a fully digital auto climate control system inside the dash. Even SWB models have huge space and recline more than what’s pictured. No sun blinds, though. I could write a page about the Bespoke audio system alone, with its 18 speakers, 1,400 watts and zero branding. Its clarity and depth coming through those exquisite metal grilles knock the socks off any other high-end car audio you’ve heard, and again, it’s thanks to hidden solutions. It uses cavities in the car’s chassis as resonance chambers, incorporates exciters into the roof liner for greater sound depth, and has microphones that constantly read ambient noise and adjust the amplifier to suit. As for the throne itself, as the coach door swings open to reveal it, it doesn’t look like much at first. It’s fairly upright and doesn’t appear to have the typical luxury-car puffy bolstering or quilting. Slip inside, though – actually not so easy to do thanks to the rear-hinged door – and you’re immediately lulled half to sleep. They’re the type of cushions you just sink into and extend over to the sides, with an added pillow on the headrest. The seatback recline, at first, seems minimal, but that’s until you realise you have to push the seat base forward to unlock the full angle. As you do this, your head descends behind the C pillar, giving you the sort of privacy reserved for royalty. Unbranded ‘bespoke’ audio sounds incredible. Legroom? Even with the standard 3,295mm wheelbase, it’s immense, but there’s also an Extended version with a 3,465mm wheelbase. Seat heating, cooling and massage are options, but interestingly, rear window blinds aren’t. Rolls says most clients are content with tinted rear windows, but of course, these are illegal in India. However, in the spirit of never saying no, they’re working on it. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost performance, engine Alarmingly, to these ears at least, Rolls says that since the Cullinan SUV came along in 2018, the number of chauffeur-driven clients across the model range has dropped from a staggering 70 percent to just 11 percent. Should you, then, as a Ghost owner, want to commandeer your own motorcar, might I recommend the Black Badge, as it introduces a hint of spice to the experience, with no compromise whatsoever to comfort. Power from the six-and-three-quarter-litre twin-turbo V12 gets a bump from 571 to 600hp and torque from 850 to 900Nm, but Rolls is quick to point out that this isn’t some sort of Ghost RS; it’s merely a bit more expressive. This expression is best felt when you press the ‘Low’ button (Sport mode? That’s for plebeians) on the steering-mounted shifter stalk, which tells the 8-speed ZF gearbox to downshift more readily and upshift as late as is fashionable. I can’t, of course, tell you at what RPM any of this happens because there’s no tachometer in a Rolls, just a power reserve meter. Without Low mode, it feels identical to the standard Ghost in every respect. But there is a different kind of pleasure to be found in extending this large V12 (in this large car) as far as it will allow you. It isn’t high-revving, but it doesn’t feel overtly turbocharged either. Power is a swell, like a tidal wave gathering mass and momentum as it makes its way to shore, and I imagine there have been some learnings from the company’s aircraft engines here. At an undisclosed number of revs, it sounds good, too – heavy and mechanical. And interestingly, Rolls says customers want this, especially in the Black Badge. Digital dials customisable. At the time of purchase. Where the previous Ghost was based on the 7 Series, this new one shares no mechanicals with any BMW. It, like every other Rolls, is built on the brand’s aluminium spaceframe Architecture of Luxury, and with that comes clever suspension that has dampers…for its dampers. This, in congruence with self-levelling air springs and a ‘Flagbearer’ system that scans the road and primes the adaptive dampers, has allowed Rolls to fit these 22-inch wheels and sliver-thin tyres with little compromise to ride quality. At worst, you can hear the wide rubber as it hits a sharp bump, but you’ll seldom feel it. Apart from some minor geometry changes to the suspension, the Black Badge’s ‘disruptive nature’ is simply the work of software. It’s what allows the engine to be more ‘voluble’, the gearbox to shift earlier, the steering to be more reactive and the suspension to respond quicker. Agile, however, is a relative term, and by the physics-breaking standards of large grand tourers like a Continental GT or an AMG S63, it feels a little soft. The rear-wheel steering feels essential here, and the steering has some slack, but that being said, once you get it into a rhythm, twirling the thin-rimmed wheel and making all that mass move is, again, joyous in its own special way. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost price, verdict Pre-configured ‘Inspired Specifications’ can be easily ordered, get special names like Idealist. With the Ghost having gotten so accomplished, what is the point of the flagship Phantom, you might ask? De la Grange likens it to what’s in your wardrobe: “The Phantom is a black-tie tuxedo with dress shoes; it’s for special occasions,” he says. “The Ghost is a business jacket and loafers; it’s something you might use every day.” It makes so much sense for something so far removed from my everyday life. Because in absolute terms, the Ghost is no less of a car. In fact, it’s a greater car than most others available. The lengths Rolls has gone to surpass just about any other luxury carmaker, and the results are plain to see in the level of quality, sophistication and craftsmanship, which few others can match. At Rs 8.95 crore, before options, you should certainly get your money’s worth. So even if you aren’t the type to self-drive your Ghost, or pick an outrageous specification like this, or opt for the Black Badge treatment, or even be swayed by the mesmerising poetry of the Rolls-Royce lexicon, know that you will be in possession of one of the finest luxury motorcars to have ever put rubber to tarmac.
