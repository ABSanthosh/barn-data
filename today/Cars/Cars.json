    "description": "This 1977 Ferrari 308 GTB is said to have remained with its original owner until 2013 and won its class at the 2014 Cavallino Classic in Palm Beach, Florida. It was then placed in a private museum from 2015 until it was acquired in 2021 by its previous owner, who subsequently performed an engine-out service that included the installation of replacement bearings, belts, gaskets, and seals along with rebuilding the starter and cylinder heads. The car is powered by a 2.9-liter quad-cam V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, and it is finished in red over tan leather upholstery. Equipment includes quad Weber DCNF carburetors, 14\" Cromodora wheels, an ANSA muffler, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt Frankfurt cassette radio. This 308 GTB was acquired by its current owner on BaT in March 2022 and is now offered by the seller with manufacturer's literature, service records, a trophy, a tool roll, and a clean Texas title in the name of the current owner's LLC.",

    "description": "This 1934 Packard Super Eight was delivered new with five-passenger Club Sedan coachwork and is said to have been re-bodied in the 1940s in a pickup-style configuration. After a period of long-term storage, the car was purchased in 2003 by its current owner, who commissioned a multi-year refurbishment that included the fabrication of bodywork incorporating styling cues from Packard boattail speedster designs of 1932 and 1934. Finished in two-tone green, the car is powered by a 385ci L-head inline-eight that was overhauled during the project and is paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Additional features include mechanically actuated four-wheel drum brakes with adjustable vacuum assistance, adjustable ride-control suspension, green-painted 17” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a tan convertible top, and tan leather upholstery over two-place seating. This boattail-bodied 11th-series Super Eight is now offered on dealer consignment in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with photos from its refurbishment, a pair of spare tire covers, and a clean Maryland title.",

And for British buyers, it perhaps isn’t as appealing as when it had the cachet of being built in Swindon.In the past few years, it has quietly sunk down to the bottom of Honda’s sales statistics, with the Jazz supermini and HR-V small SUV dwarfing its figures. And that’s a real shame, because we reckon the sensible hybrid hatchback is easily the best car that Honda makes right now.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/company-cars/ionity-targets-company-car-fleets-network-doubles-size",
    "description": "New EV charge card unlocks discounted rates for fleets Network's new charge card promises cheaper, simpler fuelling of electric vehicles for business users Ionity has launched an EV charge card with discounted rates for fleets as part of an effort to attract time-sensitive business drivers to its fast-growing network of rapid-charging hubs. The manufacturer-backed network is installing 500 additional chargers in the UK this year, more than doubling the 379 already operating across the country. Each of its hubs has at least six 350kW ultra-high-speed chargers, to reduce the risk of queueing, and they’re powered by 100% renewable energy, supporting businesses’ ever-tougher sustainability targets. Following requests from customers, Ionity Fleet offers similar benefits to the Ionity Passport subscription schemes, which discount the standard rate of 74p/kWh to as little as 43p/kWh for the top-tier £10.50 monthly membership option. For a single-motor Tesla Model Y Long Range (the UK’s best-selling EV last year), that’s enough to slash per-mile energy costs from 17p to 9p and recoup the subscription fee within 150 miles, based on its published efficiency data. However, that’s still higher than the HMRC-approved 7p-per-mile Advisory Electric Rate (AER) that drivers can expense for business mileage. Fleets can set their own milage rates but risk additional scrutiny to avoid any excess being classed as taxable income. Ionity Fleet offers even cheaper rates for fleets while cutting the “unnecessary bureaucracy” involved with expensing charging costs, according to Andreas Atkins, the company’s country manager for the UK and Ireland. It issues each driver with unique RFID card, providing discounted tap-and-go access to the chargers, then aggregates everyone’s costs into a single monthly invoice and itemises sessions so that (if necessary) they can be allocated to different departments and teams. Fleets can restrict access to a single country or allow drivers to plug in at any of Ionity’s 4800 chargers across Europe. Businesses with more than 250 vehicles can add their own branding to the cards,  Ionity doesn’t collect personal information to avoid issues with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. “Many fleet customers proactively reached out to us, expressing the need for direct access to our charging stations at competitive rates,\" said Atkins.  \"This was particularly important for SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] with routine repetitive routes, who recognise that Ionity charging locations align well with their operations. “Generally, businesses want to take advantage of Ionity Passport packages, but these were designed for private use only, leading to administrative complications. With Ionity Fleet, we have solved this.”",

    "description": "Chinese motorcycle giant CFMoto has been making waves in overseas markets with a series of well-equipped, good-to-ride motorcycles that are sold with enticingly low price tags. As the company gears up to re-enter the Indian market after a short-lived first attempt in 2019, it invited us to its global launch event to experience some of its latest products. CFMoto 675SR-R design, engine The first of these was the new 675SR-R, which, on the surface, looks like a rival to the sub-100hp street-oriented sportbikes like the new Triumph Daytona 660, the Suzuki GSX-8R and the Honda CBR650R. This is why CFMoto’s decision to let us ride the bike on the mighty Portimao racetrack seemed puzzling at first, but it started to make sense once we met the bike. Unlike the above-mentioned rivals, this bike takes on more of a sporty identity with much more committed ergonomics that are closer to a proper supersport. The 675cc three-cylinder engine also sounds very supersport, and the immediate assumption is that it has been ‘benchmarked’ from the erstwhile Triumph 675 motor. However, the spec sheet reveals that the bore and stroke figures are quite different here, and this motor actually finds its roots in CFMoto’s 450cc twin-cylinder engine that receives one more cylinder here: 450 + 225 = 675. What you get is an engine that produces 88.6hp at 11,000rpm and 68Nm at 8,250rpm. The sound from the compact exhaust is similar to the Moto2 howl that you get from the Triumph and Yamaha triples, and it’s quite a loud note as well. CFMoto 675SR-R handling, performance Portimao is a wild circuit with huge crests and drops and plenty of blind sections, with no reference points to whether the next corner goes left or right. It took me a couple of sessions to learn the track well enough to be able to commit to proper speeds, and the 675 never felt out of its depth as the pace went up. The power on offer was perfect for my lack of track knowledge, and it resulted in a fast motorcycle but not one that was overwhelmingly so. What needs improvement is the throttle connection, which feels a bit too sharp on the initial opening and, occasionally, a little inconsistent. Midrange torque should be impressive on the street, but with the rollercoaster-like undulations on this track, it was vital to keep the revs up. However, the rev limiter hits quite hard, and running into that with the bike leaned over between corners was a little unsettling. Aside from these issues, the performance was strong and enjoyable, and I saw just over 220kph before braking for the first corner. The front suspension is fully adjustable. With twin 300mm front rotors and J Juan calipers, the stopping performance was actually quite impressive. There was good power and feel, although this circuit has more of a flowing nature without too many brutal hard-braking zones. The main issue with the brakes was that the ABS could be quite intrusive, and many riders elected to deactivate it for the final run by pulling the fuse. CFMoto 675SR-R ergonomics, underpinnings The SR-R weighs 189 kilos, and the seat height is 810mm – both pretty good numbers for a motorcycle like this. Suspension is handled by KYB components: a fully adjustable 41mm USD fork and a preload and rebound adjustable monoshock. The tubular steel chassis and aluminium swingarm, along with the KYB suspension, resulted in a sharp yet predictable riding experience, with the bike turning well and holding a line across this fast-flowing circuit. It didn’t feel out of its depth when thrown into some really fast corners, including the final turn – which is a long downhill right-hander that leads into the main straight – at nearly 180kph.  Aero makes up a big part of the 675’s design. Even the CST tyres were surprisingly good, and while the past experience with these Chinese tyres hasn’t been positive, the new semi-slick tyres on the SR-R were never a cause for concern. Chassis-wise, the only limiting factor was the footpeg feelers that ground down once the pace went up. CFMoto says that removing them will not be a problem, but it wanted to keep them on the bikes for this event as they help protect parts like the exhaust in case the bike goes down and slides along the tarmac.  CFMoto 675 SR-R features It’s no surprise that this is a well-equipped motorcycle, and it has a sharp, functional TFT display, along with dual-channel ABS, two-level traction control and a tyre pressure monitoring system. The traction control was smooth enough that I left it in its lower setting on the track without any issues. A cable-operated throttle means the SR-R only has a quickshifter, but CFMoto says it is working on a ride-by-wire system that will enable a blipper as well. There’s also an optional “T-Box” module with a 4G SIM that unlocks a myriad of connected features.  TFT display is smooth, informative and easy to read. CFMoto 675SR-R price, India launch On its own, the CFMoto 675SR-R is a good motorcycle that will probably be quicker than any of its sub-100hp rivals around a racetrack. There are a few blemishes in it that need to be polished out, but they’re all fixable, and at the rate that CFMoto is churning out new and impressive bikes, I don’t think it will be long before the company does so. But as you would expect with CFMoto, the real kicker here is the price, which, at 7,590 euros, is just 200 euros more than a Honda CBR500R. CFMoto is planning its India launch by the middle of this year, and while the 675 is not immediately on the cards, it is being considered for our market. If the company can manage to undercut its Japanese and British rivals by around Rs 2 lakh, as it does overseas, that will make this a very tempting option indeed. CFMoto 675NK quick review We also had the opportunity to ride the 675SR-R’s naked sibling, the 675NK. This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. The 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R. We got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.

    "description": "The Hyundai Creta CVT has perhaps been the most in-demand car of the Autocar long-term fleet. Refined, comfortable and user-friendly, we’ve run this SUV for over 6,000km for shoots, commutes and road trips. Unfortunately, though, it’s now gone back to its maker, so I’m going to tell you what living with it was like. Most of my running with the Creta was done in the city, although Saumil and Hormazd did do some highway work on their road trips to Goa and Mahabaleshwar, respectively. Regardless of the usage, we agreed that this refined 1.5 petrol paired with the CVT auto makes for a seamless driving experience. And given that it especially excels in the city, it comes as no surprise that this atmospheric petrol engine outsells the other options. However, its lack of performance can be felt on the highways when you want to drive in a spirited manner. So, if performance is what you’re looking for, best opt for the 160hp turbo-petrol. Refined and seamless, the Creta IVT felt at home in city traffic. What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in fuel efficiency, by petrol SUV standards at least. In our instrumented real-world test, the Creta CVT returned a maximum of 15.05kpl on the highway, which went as low as 7.5kpl in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Also worth noting is that the efficiency will drop drastically into single digits if you drive at a brisk pace on the highway. Overall, though, with my daily usage, the efficiency hovered between 10kpl and 11kpl for the most part. What also helps conserve that little bit extra is the auto start/stop function, which works decently. Although it livens up the cabin, the ivory upholstery soils easily and is tough to keep clean. Other than the refined and fairly efficient powertrain, I also appreciated the feature-rich and well-appointed cabin. The light grey and ivory upholstery and the copper inserts and stitching work well together, though it was nearly impossible to keep the ivory bits clean given the intensive running our Creta did. And in typical Hyundai fashion, our top-spec SX(O) Creta had all the bells and whistles like a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone auto AC, cooled front seats, two screens, ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The high-res 360-degree camera and blind-spot monitor, in particular, proved their worth in the rainy season when visibility was poor. Even the Level 2 ADAS features worked well, and I liked using the adaptive cruise control on the highway. What’s also nice is that if you turn them off, they’ll remain off till you manually turn them back on. I even appreciated the Bose audio system, but passengers in the rear did feel like the volume was quite soft. Reclining backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows mean the rear seat is a comfy place. Speaking of the rear, it’s a great place to be. There’s enough room for three, and the pano roof and light upholstery make the cabin feel airy. And the reclinable backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows seal the deal. However, not all is well, as the Creta does miss out on wireless smartphone integration, which is particularly annoying given that the smaller 8-inch screen in lower variants gets it. I also would’ve liked to have a sliding front armrest. The twin screens, while great to look at and easy to navigate, are set a little too low and don’t fall in your line of sight. And it doesn’t pack a heads-up display like the Kia Seltos, which would’ve alleviated this. It’s also not one for enthusiastic drivers, as handling can best be described as safe. Although there’s a noticeable body roll, the grip is ample, and overall, it feels predictable around bends. The ride quality is cushy at low speeds, but it feels jarring over sharp potholes, and large bumps tend to catch it out. There’s also some noticeable vertical movement at highway speeds, but this doesn’t feel uncomfortable like the Cretas of old. Full-LED headlamps offer great illumination and throw; the auto high beam function works well. Other things I liked in my time with the Creta were the LED headlights, which offer great illumination. The auto high beam function also worked well, meaning I didn’t have to constantly shift between high beam and low beam. It’s also nice that the Creta gets physical controls for the AC and some of the infotainment controls. I also managed to solve two things that were annoying me. The first one was that Android Auto was appearing only in a split screen, which was resolved by unchecking a box deep in the sub-menus of the system. The second was the lock/unlock beeps, which were done away with by long-pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the key simultaneously for a couple of seconds. I know we say this a lot, but this car will actually be missed a lot by all of us in the office. Given its strengths and how easy living with it has been, it’s not hard to see why the Creta continues to rule the midsize SUV segment.

    "description": "Then Porsche first introduced the Taycan, the enthusiasts said it was sacrilege. How could Porsche, renowned for some of the best ICE sports cars in history, slap its crest on a four-door, two-tonne electric sedan? But as usual, Porsche has proven naysayers wrong, as the Taycan is now known as the enthusiasts’ EV of choice. We can attest to that after setting the fastest lap time by an EV at the Buddh International Circuit in it, racing it against a sailing boat, and even drag-racing it against its petrol-powered stablemates. But Porsche is not one to rest on its laurels. There’s an updated version with even more performance now, and we sampled its Turbo and Turbo S variants in and around Dubai to see what to expect. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift exterior design The rear bumper and light signature have been mildly altered. You’ll have to be a real Porsche nerd to spot the design differences on this facelift; they are so subtle. It has more aero-efficient bumpers on the front and back, tweaked headlamps that now get LED Matrix tech as standard, a revised rear light bar and new colour and wheel options. Porsche lettering on tailgate lights up There’s even an option to illuminate the Porsche lettering at the back, which looks quite cool, and the Turbo and Turbo S also get the new ‘Turbonite’ satin-matte accents, which feature on the logo, too. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift interior and features Active air suspension aids cabin entry There’s good room behind, but you’re seated in a low and knees-up position. Before I even got inside, the Taycan showed off one of its party tricks. Air suspension is standard fit, but Taycans can now be equipped with the optional Porsche Active Ride system, which instantly lifts it off the ground by 55mm to ease entry into the cabin. While 55mm may not sound much, it makes a big difference, given how low-slung the Taycan is. The updated UI is more user-friendly; there are ‘Turbonite’ Porsche badges inside and on the exterior. The interior is more or less the same, but there are changes to the interface for the infotainment screens to make it more user-friendly. The Turbo and Turbo S also get the Porsche emblem finished in ‘Turbonite’, much like on the exterior, and buyers can opt for a fully leather interior or one with sustainable materials, in line with the EV’s green cred. The car retains its four-screen layout, including one for the passenger, which gets a special coating so that it can’t distract the driver. The rear seat has good room, but the seating position is low and knees-up. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift ride and handling 'Leans' while cornering to minimise body movement The Taycan's handling belies its near-2.3-ton kerb weight. Circling back to the new Porsche Active Ride, this system is a technological marvel. Sure, Dubai’s pristine roads aren’t the best place to judge a car’s ride, but the Taycan walks the tightrope between handling and comfort with precision like few others. Around bends, it ‘leans’ like a motorcycle to maximise corner speed, and it also compensates for body movements like squatting and diving while accelerating or braking. The entire system is so clever that it does without anti-roll bars. And despite sitting on huge 21-inch wheels (Turbo S), the ride feels quite supple. Carbon ceramic brakes are standard fitments Handling is typical Porsche, which means the Taycan corners flat, and there’s tremendous grip, too. With the way it changes direction, you won’t be able to tell it weighs nearly 2.3 tonnes. That, coupled with the sharp and responsive steering, makes it the best-handling four-door EV on the market. The brakes are immense as well, and you get a good feel from the pedal. It’s worth noting that the Turbo S gets carbon ceramic brakes as standard. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift performance 0-100kph takes 2.7 seconds Immediate power delivery helps the Taycan Turbo S match the 911 Turbo's performance. On the move, the Taycan Turbo feels absolutely manic. With a max output of 884hp and 890Nm from its dual-motor setup, there’s always so much power in reserve that you can barely floor the throttle for a couple of seconds before doing illegal speeds. Mind you, the limit is 120kph in certain parts of the UAE. From a standstill, 100kph is dismissed in just 2.7 seconds – that’s as quick as the 992-gen 911 Turbo! And as it’s an EV, there’s no delay or lag in performance. Moreover, the clever Porsche Torque Vectoring system keeps all wheels in check without losing traction. That makes acceleration almost a non-event, aside from the ferocity with which it launches forward – that simply scrambles your brain. But there’s no getting away from the distinctive lack of sound, which, in a Porsche of all the cars, is essential to the driving experience. Taycan Turbo S develops 952hp and up to 1,110Nm Next up is the Turbo S, which dials things up even further. Power is now up to an eye-watering 952hp (from 761hp) while torque is up to 1,110Nm (from 1,050Nm) with the ‘Overboost’ or push-to-pass function, which gives you full power for up to 10 seconds. The difference in performance between the Turbo and Turbo S is like splitting hairs. Porsche will tell you that the S does 0-100kph in just 2.4 seconds, 0.3 seconds quicker than the Turbo, but the truth is that both feel equally relentless. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift battery, range, and charging It now gets a larger yet lighter battery, more efficient regen braking and can accept charge up to 320kW. Besides the added performance, Taycans now get a larger 105kWh ‘performance’ battery that weighs less than the older 93kWh unit, revised electronics and more efficient regenerative braking. The results are more range and quicker charging times. Charging speeds bumped up by 50kW Both the Turbo and Turbo S have a combined claimed range of up to 630km (WLTP), but in urban conditions, the former is claimed to give up to 683km and the latter up to 691km. Both can accept charge at speeds of up to 320kW, up 50kW from before, and the max regen capacity is also said to have improved by 30 percent. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift price and verdict Taycan Turbo S not coming to India While the Taycan Turbo S isn't on the cards for India, the base 2WD, 4S, and Turbo are on sale here. In India, Porsche sells the Taycan 4S for Rs 1.89 crore and the Taycan Turbo for Rs 2.52 crore; the base two-wheel-drive variant is due for a launch soon. However, Porsche won’t offer the Turbo S or the Nürburgring record-holding Taycan Turbo GT here. Nevertheless, the performance from the more ‘regular’ Turbo is mind-numbingly fast, and the Taycan remains the most electrifying EV out there. The updates have only made it more compelling. Not only is it quicker, but it also has more range, can charge faster and has more tech. It remains the enthusiasts’ EV of choice – for a price, of course.

    "description": "Mercedes has launched the Maybach SL 680 Monogram Series in India at an ex-showroom price of Rs 4.2 crore. First revealed in 2024, the luxury roadster is touted as the sportiest Maybach ever made. Bookings have started and only three cars are allocated for this year. SL 680's bonnet, finished in Obsidian Black, has Maybach logos The two-seater gets white Nappa leather upholstery It is based on the AMG SL 63 and can go from 0-100kph in 4.1s Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 exterior Front grille gets illuminated vertical slats A chrome radiator grille with illuminated vertical slats and MAYBACH lettering makes the SL 680 stand out from the AMG SL 63, on which the former is based. The bumper and the long bonnet (which is finished in Obsidian Black) have an abundance of Maybach logos to differentiate the car further. Buyers can also have these logos embossed into the soft-top fabric roof as part of the customisation programme.  Maybach 5-hole forged wheels (optional). As for the profile, bespoke 21-inch forged wheels feature 36 spokes connected to the three-pointed star emblem in the centre. A sleek chrome strip runs across the length between the wheels; door handles and front fenders also have chrome elements. Like the front, a smoother and chrome-decorated rear bumper looks toned down compared to the SL roadster. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 interior Maybach patterns on seats Unlike its four-seat AMG sibling, the SL 680 has space for only two occupants. The cabin’s white Nappa leather upholstery comes courtesy of Manufaktur, Mercedes’ personalisation range. Its new three-spoke steering wheel has ‘MAYBACH’ lettering, while the roll hoops behind seat headrests get Maybach signets. The portrait-styled touchscreen can be adjusted for the best viewing angle. The 12.3-inch driver’s display and adjustable 11.9-inch central touchscreen are similar to the SL 63. Mercedes has equipped the central touchscreen with its AI-based MBUX multimedia system. It has tweaked the car’s exhaust system to keep the cabin noise low and tuned the suspension for comfort.  Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 powertrain 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol Twin-scroll turbos are placed between the cylinder heads for quick response. Under the hood is the familiar 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine that makes 585hp and 800Nm. A 9-speed automatic transmission sends power to all four wheels, and from a standstill, the SL 680 can hit the 100kph mark in 4.1 seconds (0.5 seconds slower than the AMG SL 63). The top speed is 260kph. Also, see: Mercedes Maybach SL 680 India debut on March 17 Mercedes Maybach GLS to get second facelift 2025 Mercedes CLA debuts with both electric and hybrid powertrains",

    "description": "https://youtu.be/gF_VI4Ooafw Jean-Philippe Duval never finished school. In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation.
