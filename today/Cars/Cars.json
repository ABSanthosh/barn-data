His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

The changes are subtle and numerous, but the Borgo Panigale marque is making serious headway into dream-touring-bike territory. First up is the light massaging of the front end to improve aerodynamics—but the improvements are for rider comfort rather than speed.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/peugeot-e-408-arrives-polestar-2-rival-priced-%C2%A342k",
    "description": "New e-408 matches the look of the combustion-engined 408 New electric version of saloon-esque hatchback offers a range of 281 miles between charges Order books have opened for the Peugeot e-408, the new electric version of the brand's saloon-esque hatchback that rivals the Polestar 2 and Tesla Model 3. It's available in two trim levels, with the entry-level Allure car priced from £42,175, while the GT range-topper is £44,945. Its addition means every car in Peugeot’s UK line-up now offers a choice of petrol, hybrid and electric powertrains. Although closely related to the Peugeot e-308 hatchback, the larger e-408 adopts a slightly different powertrain, notably drawing power from a larger 58.2kWh (usable) NMC battery – unique within the Stellantis group. The bigger battery could be accommodated as engineers “had more room to play with” within the fastback’s longer wheelbase, explained Peugeot product director Jérôme Micheron. The rakish 408's slippery design, which achieves a drag coefficient of 0.28 (on par with the 2 and only just beaten by the class-leading Model 3), helps the EV to achieve a range of 281 miles, with 4.6mpkWh efficiency. The battery can be charged at rates of up to 120kW. Despite being able to accomodate it, Peugeot isn’t offering the e-408 with the 98kWh battery that has just been launched in the Peugeot e-3008 and Peugeot e-5008 (which offer up to 422 miles of range). Asked why, Micheron said: \"When we looked at the competition of the e-408, we saw we were the right position when it came to range and efficiency. The average daily C-segment customer drives 45km [28 miles] a day.” The new Peugeot’s Polestar and Tesla rivals are both offered in 'Long Range' forms, with ranges of 408 and 390 miles respectively.  The e-408 is fitted with the same synchronous electric motor as the e-3008, which deploys 207bhp and 245lb ft of torque. Official acceleration figures have yet to be released, but it's expected to outpace the 154bhp e-308’s 9.8sec 0-62mph sprint time. The e-408 is nearly indistinguishable from its ICE siblings, with only the additional 'e' badge at the rear marking it out. This is because “we wanted to protect the design and its attractiveness\", said Micheron. The same is true inside, the e-408 having the same i-Cockpit (small steering wheel and raised 10in instrument panel) as the ICE 408, along with a 10in infotainment screen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a separate i-Toggle shortcut touchscreen. Deliveries are due to begin early next year.",

The new Skoda Elroq is the Czech marque’s second bespoke EV and marks its assault on the electric compact crossover class – a move that it hopes will help bolster its position as Europe's fourth best-selling car brand.This is effectively the electric equivalent of the Karoq, but it's not a reworked version of the ICE car: it uses the same electrical underpinnings as the larger Skoda Enyaq. Skoda has already found success in the electric car market, with the Enyaq climbing to the very top of EV sales charts. But the Elroq’s task is undoubtedly harder, as it's entering a segment that has mushroomed in popularity. There’s a plethora of rivals already baying for the attention of British buyers, such as the Ford Explorer, Volvo EX30 and Kia EV3. So, is the Elroq up to the task?",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Picking up the M4 Competition from BMW’s press centre storage facility on the outskirts of Munich initially feels a bit like going through passport control – licence and ID check before we are finally handed the keys. Once inside, walking through the massive parking tower feels surreal; every single BMW you can imagine is here. And probably every Mini and every Rolls, too. Even better, as we walk through, there are M cars in all shapes and sizes. What a place! Finally, we get to our car. Yeah, that nose. The flared nostrils are clearly OTT and shouty, but it doesn’t look quite as odd as it did when it was first revealed. And I like those vents on the bonnet. But can this M4 Competition deliver as characterful a driving experience? Chop-chop, we’re headed to the Austrian border and then into the Alps. Good driving roads beckon. 2024 BMW M4 Competition ride and practicality I open the surprisingly light doors, squeeze in past the big seats, and settle down. BMW has brought the curved display to the M4, and this Competition version gets plenty of other driver-oriented stuff; more on that later. My first priority is getting out of this building, and while most of the drive down resembles a normal parking lot, the last bit is unique. We drive down a steel chute and then straight out into the sunshine. Voilà! Big grille is still a big talking point of the M4. The first few kilometres of city trudge are pretty uneventful. The engine doesn’t feel overeager or spiky, the 8-speed ZF torque converter gearbox is creamy-smooth, and only when I manually intervene do I get a rude burst of power. So the M4 Competition can do the office, school and outstation runs. It has a proper boot, usable back seats and isn’t too difficult to get in and out of either. In fact, driving it in the city feels so undramatic and one-dimensional that it feels bland. No sensations come through to my palms at low speed, no nice elasticity of repose from the accelerator, and certainly no beautifully balanced and confident agility in low-speed corners. It just feels rooted and relaxed. The ride over Munich roads also feels firm; it can be brittle over bad patches, and there is a fair amount of road noise over open-pore surfaces. However, with the adaptive dampers set to Comfort, there’s enough pliancy to make the M4 Competition a very competent long-distance cruiser. Seats are large and very supportive in corners; inner thigh support is not as much of an issue as it is made out to be.   2024 BMW M4 Competition powertrain So, at normal driving speeds, the M4 Competition feels very laid back. I guess I’ll have to stir the pot a bit to get to the good stuff. This should be pretty easy once we turn off to the Autobahn, where on this route, there are plenty of derestricted stretches. But first, it’s time to do a bit of a spec check. Under the hood, the twin-turbo S58 straight-six has been wound up to 530hp – check. Then there’s 650Nm from 2,750rpm to a high 5,730rpm; plenty of torque – check. Forged crank, iron coating sprayed on the internals and two mono-scroll turbos for more boost – check. Near 50:50 front-rear weight distribution – check. And although this is a four-wheel-drive car, there is a rear-wheel-drive mode for those wet, empty parking lots and drift pads. You also get a 10-stage adjustable traction control and an ‘M drift analyser’ that awards points and stars for good drifts. I have to say I like BMW’s on-screen games better than Tesla’s. The M4 Competition, however, is heavy at 1,850kg – the four-wheel-drive hardware contributing to a lot. And yes, you get staggered wheels for greater stability, 19s and 20s at the front and rear, respectively. Stonking twin-turbo engine makes a strong 530hp. Getting to the 120kph speed limit on the restricted parts of the Autobahn brings the M4 Competition somewhat out of its shell. Past 3,000rpm, it begins shedding its Clark Kent suit and flexing its muscles. Often, 120kph comes up so quickly that I get taken by surprise. And hey, BMW, can we at least have fake analogue dials? When it comes to character, BMW’s twin-turbo straight six responds more like a naturally aspirated unit than a turbocharged one. Progression up the rev band is as linear as some atmo sixes, responses are quick, and then, because it has all the extra torque, it just hauls, even from low in the powerband. A delicious combo. 2024 BMW M4 Competition performance When we finally see the grey and white cricket ball-like de-restriction sign, my right foot goes down automatically. The M4 Competition lunges at the horizon – no delay in power delivery, no slack, no lag. And that’s even though the gearbox is in a high gear in manual mode. Even more impressive, the engine keeps pulling harder and harder as the revs climb, and at around 6,000rpm, I realise we are really shifting – the scenery flying past in a blur. Wow, this thing has some real muscle, some real grunt! And like any good BMW unit, it’s thrilled to rev and spin hard. It isn’t explosive or peaky in the mid-range, and sometimes you miss that, but it is smooth, crisp and seriously potent. 200kph is almost a casual stroll up the ’box. And when I really plant my foot, the linear lunge delivers a sledgehammer blow. The claimed 0-100kph is super quick at just 3.5 seconds, which, incidentally, is faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera. Quad exhaust and low-slung roof make it look purposeful. Niggles? It doesn’t sound great, but I like that this is the honest voice of the engine with no synth added. And when you are in a hurry, you do expect a bit more urgency from the gearbox.  2024 BMW M4 Competition handling The real test of an M car, however, comes in the twisties, and here, initially, there’s a bit of disappointment. The steering, tasked with ironing out the push-pull of the four-wheel-drive system, is light and inert, and going to a sportier setting only adds weight. Lean on the M4 Competition, however, and it seems to wake up from its slumber and come alive, the relative four-wheel-drive stodginess and not-inconsiderable weight seemingly melting away. Now, the stiff chassis and aluminium suspension seem to finally limber up, stretch and attack corners with an incredible amount of verve, grip and gymnast-like balance. The harder I turn into corners, the more agile the M4 Competition feels, with the precision from the steering sharpening up superbly. It may not be the most feelsome unit, but it is super sharp, even when all four wheels are loaded up and complaining loudly. Even small movements on the wheel change your line, and that’s exactly what you want. The steering is light and not very M car-like at all. But our drive is too brief, and to really enjoy this car to the fullest, I need more time, better roads, faster corners and more opportunities. That, or a track. Sure, it is heavy; 200kg less would have made it incredible. But the weight is placed down low, and that helps. Also, I must say, the driving position is excellent, especially if you like to sit low. 2024 BMW M4 Competition price and verdict Rs 1.53 crore will buy you an M4 Competition in India. Look at this as just a much more powerful 3 Series Coupé with some go-faster hardware, and it will seem even more expensive, especially if you consider the excellent M340i xDrive at Rs 74.9 lakh. But that’s not quite right. The M4 Competition is a whole category or two up. A serious performance car that delivers a combination of supercar pace and sedan-like practicality, the M4 is the one to go for if you want many disparate cars in one. Let’s not forget it gets a back seat and boot, comes with a stonking 530hp engine, more performance than some supercars, and on the right road, delivers a driving experience that’s agile, accurate and as adjustable as some of the best sports cars around. And that makes it stand out. Also see: BMW car prices to increase from January 2025 2024 BMW M2 launched at Rs 1.03 crore, gets more power Next-gen BMW M3 to get both ICE and EV powertrains",

    "description": "Maharashtra has announced that all vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, will be required to have HSRP (high-security number plates) before March 31, 2025. This directive could affect more than twenty million vehicles in the state. Vehicle owners to bear the cost of installing HSRPs  Installation process will be carried out via appointments Vehicles failing to get HSRPs will be penalised High security registration plate (HSRP) installation process The State Transport Department said vehicle owners will have to bear the cost of replacing their old number plates with the new tamper-proof HSRP units. Owners who fail to do so within the deadline will face penalties under the Motor Vehicles Act. The Motor Vehicle Department will also deny services such as vehicle transfer and address change if it does not have an HSRP plate. Vehicle owners can get the new HSRP at their respective RTO offices at official rates that are set at Rs 745 for passenger vehicles, Rs 500 for three-wheelers and Rs 450 for two-wheelers and tractors. The state department has assigned three agencies to provide HSRP based on RTO location. In order to get their plates changed, vehicle owners will have to book their installation appointments online through portals managed by government-appointed agencies. Walk-ins are not allowed. The installation appointments can be rescheduled within 90 days after the first date of the appointment. The agency will verify vehicle details on the official VAHAN portal before installing these plates. Benefits of HSRP  According to the government, usage of HSRPs will help improve the security of the vehicles, especially when it comes to tracking stolen vehicles.  A chromium-based hologram is hot-stamped on the top-left corner of both front and rear HSRPs to discourage counterfeiting. This stamp contains the Ashoka Chakra in blue. The 10-digit permanent identification number (PIN) is laser-branded into the bottom-left corner of the HSRPs, and the hot-stamping film to be applied on the letters and numerals of the registration number has ‘India’ inscribed on it. These HSRPs are fastened with “at least two” non-removable/non-reusable snap locks. Also See: New car, SUV prices to go up from January 2025 Mahindra BE 6e to be renamed to BE 6 temporarily",

    "description": "Renault’s sister brand, Dacia, has taken the wraps off the Duster Soul of Dakar edition to celebrate the brand’s entry in the upcoming Dakar Rally. This is officially a one-off show car to celebrate, but the company’s CEO has suggested that a line of similar cars could also make it to showrooms. Duster Soul of Dakar to be one of many special editions Gets Dakar rally car-inspired exterior paint shade Renault Duster headed to India next year Duster Soul of Dakar first of many special edition models The uniquely kitted Duster gets a unique black, grey and orange livery that has been inspired by the Dacia Sandrider, which will compete in the next Dakar rally. To round off its outdoorsy looks, it also gets a specially designed roof rack that carries “a waterproof bag, a cargo box and a shovel, allowing occupants to tackle more difficult terrains”. On the inside, it has unique hooks for additional smartphones, tablets and other accessories.  Apart from the cosmetic tweaks, there are no other mechanical changes on the special edition Duster. It comes with a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine good for 128hp, mated to a six-speed manual gearbox and electric AWD setup. Although Dacia officially calls the Soul of Dakar a one-off, CEO Denis Le Vot previously told our sister publication, Autocar UK, that he was open to using the Dakar Rally for a more direct link to its road-going models, too. “Maybe we can use a taste and feel of the Dakar car on some limited series or whatever, but we will see,” he said. Renault Duster India launch details Renault India has announced that the Duster will come to India sometime in 2025. It will also have a Nissan derivative that will join the line-up a little later.
