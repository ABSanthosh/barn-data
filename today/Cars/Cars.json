    "description": "This 1931 Ford Model A roadster was purchased by its late owner, collector John B. McMullen, in 2001 after it had been refurbished in blue with black fenders and a tan soft top over tan vinyl upholstery. The car is powered by a 201ci L-head inline-four paired with a three-speed manual transmission that has been fitted with a Mitchell Gear-Splitter overdrive unit. The car is equipped with yellow 19\" wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a six-volt alternator, a tilt-out windshield, a fold-down luggage rack, a rumble seat, and an Auto-Lite flow-through heater.

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "title": "Renault's turnaround is underpinned by cars you actually want",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/business/renaults-turnaround-underpinned-cars-you-actually-want",
    "description": "The French brand is pushing to build electric cars that you truly desire to own “The fastest turnaround in the recent history of automotive” read one of the captions on a recent Renault Group video reflecting on the first 1000 days of its ‘Renaulution’ turnaround plan. It’s not hyperbole either: Renault has gone from loss making in 2020 from just under 3 million sales to having an enviable 7.9% operating margin from 2.2m sales in 2023, while also increasing revenues by around a quarter at the same time.  Renault’s foundations solidified, a key part of the next phase of the Renaulution plan is democratising electric cars, while making them cars you truly desire to own.  Fabrice Cambolive, the Renault brand CEO, is currently overseeing the launch of the flagbearer of the Renaulution project: the reborn 5.  Making such desirable EVs are crucial in helping “break the glass roof” on EV sales, which need another “breakthrough” after “plateauing”, according to Cambolive. The 5 and upcoming 4 “combine emotion and new technology, and we are convinced that those cars will help us to get ahead”. There’ll be no need to push sales, he insists. Cambolive is preparing a renewed global push for Renault, too, not just through exporting models but by setting up local operations, harking back to the days of the 4 where it was not just sold but made in all corners of the world.  “If you really want to be important in a market, you have to be on two legs: on one, a good capacity to sell on the local market, but on the other, a good capacity to export. For that, you have to be localised.” China though is off limits for now, a market that’s increasingly unsustainable and difficult to operate in for western car makers, although Renault is partnering with an unspecified Chinese partner to develop the new Twingo electric city car. Reflecting on recent progress, I put it to Cambolive that all of a sudden Renault seems to have a lot of similarly-sized cars in similar segments - the 5 and the 4 sit alongside the Clio and the Captur in the B-segment, and in the C-segment there are six crossover offerings. He “doesn’t see the line-up as complicated” and this was more a case of “launching almost all the cars in the last months. It means we have to establish them, and frankly speaking we have two-three years to really extract the best potential of these cars”. And in a reference to the likes of Stellantis and Volkswagen, “if you look at it coldly, Renault is three brands [with Dacia and Alpine], four with Mobilize, and we don’t share many cars between brands”, which will naturally mean Renault has to do more heavy lifting itself. Still, there’s a sense of pride in the Renault badge again and it feels like a brand in the ascendancy. “In the past our names were even sometimes stronger than the brand. Espace, Scenic, Clio… Now, we are capable of mixing cars that are really well known but under the Renault umbrella. This is very important.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/defender",
    "description": "It promises unrivalled off-road performance with on-road niceties. But does it deliver? The talismanic strategic status of the reimagined Land Rover Defender has been obvious since we first saw one back in 2019. The funny thing is, this car’s commercial significance has rapidly become even greater. JLR sold more Defenders in 2023 than all of its Velars, Evoques and Discovery Sports combined. In the UK, it has sold more and more units every full calendar year since its introduction. So it’s a vital profit generator (given it can easily be dressed up to cost close to £100,000 in just-so specification), and suddenly an asset that the company simply can’t afford to let go off the boil.Hence this 2025-model-year update. It’s not quite a facelift, because very few if any exterior design changes are entailed. It’s more about lifting the Defender’s luxury cabin ambience to meet slightly more bourgeois appetites (still no hose-out interior, then. Gah, etc).But, cabin revisions aside, there's a new engine in the range; with the new range-topping Defender Octa about to launch to the market.The new Defender is available in 90, 110 and extra-long 130 forms, the 90 only emerging into showrooms early in 2021 and the 130 in 2022. The engine range, which was only four options strong at launch, has expanded to encompass six motors in all, although some are only on offer in models with starting prices above £80,000.The meat of that engine range is now comprised of two six-cylinder, 3.0-litre diesel options (D250 \u0026 D350) which offer between 247- and 345bhp, as well as a four-cylinder petrol-electric P300e plug-in hybrid (which adds in an electric drive motors to help out that same four-pot petrol turbo engine, and to boost real-world running efficiency and fleet running credentials).If you're shopping at the pricier end of the showroom spectrum, P425 and P500 V8 options are available, both sitting underneath that new 626bhp V8 Octa.The Land Rover Defender line-up at a glanceThe Defender's model grade structure is now simpler than it was. The cheapest S models start at under £60,000, and the line-up extends up from there through X-Dynamic SE and -HSE, X and V8 specifications. Commercial-grade Defender Hard Top models, which come without rear seats and with boosted load-carrying space, are still available also. Lower-grade cars come on fixed-height steel coil suspension as standard, with height-adjustable air suspension optional, and typically packaging with Land Rover's latest Terrain Response offroad traction and stability control aids and adaptive damping.On interior layout, there's lots of flexibility on offer. A pair of manually deployable third-row seats are available as an option on 110 models; a middle-set front-row 'jump seat' is offered on some derivatives (though not, critically, where it would effectively turn the Defender into a nine-seater minibus); and extra cabin configurability has been added to the extra-long 130 version, to which we'll come shortly.",

    "description": "Since they first hit the scene, Auto Fabrica has flirted with the concept of motorcycles as art pieces. The machines they build often feel like elegant concept bikes, but stop short of being so abstract that they become useless ornaments. This Ducati Scrambler 1100 embodies that philosophy. Labeled ‘T23,’ this is, remarkably, the first Ducati that the English workshop has customized. “We wanted to design and build something with a unique style,” says Bujar Muharremi, who runs Auto Fabrica with his brother, Gaz. “It was during the time when we were finishing our first bike with an integrated seat cover—Type 17—and wanted to really explore this idea on a slick concept-style build.” To give themselves a head start, Bujar and Gaz started with a 2024-model Ducati Scrambler 1100 Pro.…",

    "description": "BMW has launched the updated M2 coupe in India, and its prices start at Rs 1.03 crore (ex-showroom). The M2 now gets more power, minor design tweaks, new colours and more tech. The updated M2 coupe is more powerful by 20hp It now does 0-100kph in 4 seconds; MT version takes 4.2 seconds  New colour options and new steering on offer  Updated BMW M2 now rated at 480hp BMW’s M division has ramped up the power and performance of the M2 as part of a series of changes for the model. It now comes with a more powerful version of BMW’s turbocharged 3.0-litre straight six, which makes 480hp, an increase of 20hp. Torque has also increased by 50Nm to 600Nm at 2,650-6,130rpm. With the updated engine, BMW claims a 0.1-second improvement in the 0-100kph time. The standard M2 Coupe with the 8-speed torque converter automatic gearbox now covers 0-100kph in 4 seconds, and the optional 6-speed manual model in 4.2 seconds. The effect of the extra power and torque is reflected more in the 0-200kph times, where both M2 models eclipse their predecessors by 0.6 seconds, with 12.9 seconds for the auto M2 and 13.7 seconds for the manual one. The top speed remains limited to 250kph, though this can be raised to 285kph with the optional M Driver’s package. The design remains largely unchanged, but the car now comes with an extended range of colours, including Sao Paulo Yellow, Fire Red, Portimao Blue and Skyscraper Grey. The standard M wheels feature a double-spoke design with a black finish and measure 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear. The same wheels are available with a silver finish as an option.  Inside, the M2 Coupe receives a new flat-bottomed steering wheel with an optional Alcantara finish. The updated model also gets an new digital operating system with the latest-generation iDrive system. The M2 has no direct rivals in India. However, the Mercedes-AMG A 45 S hatchback comes close in terms of size and dynamics but is low on power at 421hp.

    "description": "Skoda India will announce the pricing of all variants of the Kylaq compact SUV on December 2, 2024. The Czech brand had announced the starting price of the Kylaq – Rs 7.89 lakh (ex-showroom) – a few days ago. Skoda India will also start accepting bookings for the Kylaq on the same day. Kylaq prices start at Rs 7.89 lakh Gets four trims, two gearbox options The Kylaq is Skoda India’s smallest SUV and is its most important product as it marks the carmaker's entry into the hotly contested compact SUV segment. Skoda surprised the market with a shocking Rs 7.89 lakh starting price, and sources tell us that prices for the other variants are expected to be competitive as well. The Kylaq will be offered in four trims – Classic, Signature, Signature+ and Prestige. The heavily localised Kylaq has a lot in common with the Kushaq, which has helped Skoda price it competitively. What’s more, dealer sources tell us that the Kylaq will get an automatic gearbox option on all trims. As for equipment, all trims are decently loaded with a good mix of creature comforts and safety features. You can read more about it here.  The Kylaq will come with a sole 115hp, 178Nm 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine mated to either a 6-speed torque converter automatic or a 6-speed manual, with a claimed 0-100kph time of around 10.5 seconds. Key rivals to the Kylaq include the Mahindra XUV 3XO, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and the Tata Nexon.

His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
