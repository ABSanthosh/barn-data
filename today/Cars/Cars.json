    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/80bhp-volkswagen-baja-bug-resto-mod-done-right",
    "description": "The Twisted TBug is yet another rear-engined, air-cooled resto-mod - but it's different in all the right ways Have you seen the Twisted TBug? Twisted, the friendly, Yorkshire-based modifier of classic Land Rover Defenders (and now owner of a marine division as well), has started offering a Volkswagen Beetle Baja Bug restomod too. (If it starts doing Hillman Imps, our respective garages will look even more alike.) Unsurprisingly, the TBug looks somewhat nicer than my Baja Bug, because Twisted are people who are used to doing things properly. The interior looks trimmed beautifully, the stance is just so (I’m tempted to have a word with the front end of mine and a grinder) and there’s a reinforced chassis, a new engine, new electrics and LED lights that don’t look daft. The power output has been about doubled over the original, but it’s still making less than 80bhp, so it isn’t a fast car – but that doesn’t matter a bit. “What makes the TBug special is that it makes you smile every time you slide behind the wheel,” says Twisted founder Charles Fawcett. “In a world of increasingly serious and complex vehicles, there’s something wonderfully refreshing about that.” As they might have said in the 1970s, I can dig that. Unlike Twisted Defenders and Suzuki Jimnys, this car exists in the ‘special projects’ bit of the company’s offerings. Lots of personalisation and customisation is on offer and it’s the sort of thing you could get lost for days in with the designers – although Twisted has made three for sale already to its thinking, in grey, green and yellow. You can spend around £95,000. Rather refreshingly, the TBug is a restomod that isn’t about adding silly power, keying a chassis down to the road or fitting an electric drivetrain to it. And better still, it’s one that’s based on a rear-engined, air-cooled, two-door German car but not a you-know-what.",

    "description": "From Rovers to Porsche, BMWs to Vauxhalls, there's a '90s star out there for everyone The 1990s were a time of great speed. As marathon-ready trainers became everyday footwear and hard-and-fast house music pulsed through city streets, it seemed a given that even the most snooze-worthy family hauler would be reheated into a have-a-go hero. Sierra Sapphire Cosworths and Lotus Carltons hit the headlines as the joyriders’ favourites - eminently nickable and so fast the fuzz couldn’t keep up. Japanese manufacturers finally stamped their mark on the performance car scene, undoubtedly helped along by the immense popularity of Sony’s game-changing Playstation and the Gran Turismo series. And, as if we didn’t already have it good enough, we witnessed a speed war between Jaguar, McLaren and many more besides. So revered were those cars that a great many of the ‘90s’ motoring highlights are now well out of reach. What was once a £20,000 Honda NSX is now an £80,000 garage queen. Lancia Delta Integrales can push six figures, and even the common man’s Ford Escort RS Turbo is £20,000. That isn’t to say there aren’t bargain superstars out there, however. Here are some of the best… Porsche Boxster (986) A howling flat six, super-sharp steering and stunning wide-hipped looks – they can all be yours from just £3000. Of course, the cheapest Boxsters are best avoided, but the truth is that these are surprisingly hardy little roadsters – provided you buy carefully. Its best-known Achilles is the intermediate-shaft (IMS) bearing, which in some cases fractures or even shatters after a long and hard life. This then throws off the engine’s timing and shunts pistons into valves, requiring a really rather expensive rebuild. Thankfully, many examples’ bearings have already been replaced, and typically with a sturdier aftermarket item that isn’t prone to exploding. If it hasn’t been done, add another £800 or so to the car’s price, if you get it done alongside a new clutch – which you probably should. It’s also worth checking the immobiliser, locks and alarms work as intended: blocked door seals or a leaky roof can mean the ECU (located under the driver’s seat) gets wet and dies. Replacements are £500-plus. Still, it’s easy to snag a good ’un – and you absolutely should, before prices soar. Volkswagen Corrado VR6 Volkswagen’s junior coupé was always a tidy steer, but its full potential wasn’t unleashed until 1992. The fitment of a potent 2.9-litre narrow-angle V6 made it the fastest front-driver of the day, and it somehow improved the handling compared with the smaller (but turbocharged) four-pot. Every Corrado was made from galvanised steel, so they hold up better against rust than many rivals – and it’s a good indicator of a dodgy repair, which should be easy to spot. High-milers go for around £6000, but you shouldn’t be scared off by that: these are generally reliable bona fide modern classics. Vauxhall Calibra 4x4 Turbo Early Calibras were tarnished with a reputation for being a bit too much like the Cavalier on which they were based. The 4x4 Turbo flipped that notion on its head, turning what was a slightly humdrum coupé into Britain’s cheapest 150mph car.  Today, though, they’re an expensive window onto the past, with prices venturing well into five figures. Honda Integra Type R This was the car that really put the Type R name on the map when it landed here in 1998, thanks to an all-time-great engine and tremendous handling. Clean cars go for about £15k, but it’s also worth considering importing one from Japan while the yen’s value is low.  Rover 220 Turbo “Nasty steering, a vague gearchange, dubious handling and dead-feeling brakes,” we said back then, pulling no punches. The 220 may not be a good car to drive, but it has an intangible appeal as the plucky underdog. These are now incredibly rare and prices vary wildly, but around £5000 should be enough to secure one in mint condition. BMW 328i (E36) “The hardest-hitting, least compromised all-rounder on sale for less than £30,000,” is what we reckoned of the 328i back in 1995. Much of the same remains true today, except you can snag one for one-tenth of the as-new asking price. Many have led hard lives, though – these were sub-£1000 cars for a long time – so buy carefully. Fiat Coupé A Chris Bangle masterpiece, and not half bad to drive either. The five-cylinder 20-valve engine, offered in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms, has the most exotic feel, but the four-cylinder option, a descendant of the Delta Integrale powerplant, still has the means to entertain. Rust is by far the biggest issue: inspect the sills, subframes, wheel arches, footwells, boot floor, exhaust… Basically, just give the whole thing a thorough going-over. Interior plastics are prone to developing a horrid sticky finish, too. Running project cars can be found for £500, but the best examples are north of £10,000. Toyota MR2 (SW20) Forget the second-generation MR2’s reputation for having a wayward tail – we never thought that held very much water. Still, Toyota revised the model no fewer than five times, with updates two (in 1991) and three (1993) gradually softening the handling to tune out the risk of snap oversteer. Any MR2 is a great drive and a fairly reliable proposition, barring rust or any extensive modifications. It’s worth seeking out a Japanese-import Turbo model or one with the atmospheric ‘Beams’ engine that came with Yamaha-developed cylinder heads; either example brings with it the soundtrack and performance the car’s chassis and looks deserve. Such cars will set you back around £10,000. Renault Twingo The Twingo has aged like Mr Blobby: once a tad unsightly, but now remembered for flouting convention and embracing the absurd. In the Twingo’s favour, it didn’t single-handedly traumatise a generation of children, so it’s looked back on a bit more fondly. You can occasionally find them from £5k, but it’s perhaps easier to source and import a clean car yourself. BMW Z3 If it’s a pure driver’s car you want, look elsewhere. But the Z3 has otherwise aged tremendously, with long-nosed, low-slung proportions and – as long as you go for the 2.0-litre engine or bigger – some of BMW’s greatest straight-six lumps. Prices – from £1000 – are on the up, so now is the time to buy. Peugeot 306 GTi “The GTi is back,” declared our road testers after sampling the performance-enhanced 306. For years, hot hatchbacks had been iced over, hamstrung by horrendous insurance premiums and the looming threat of theft. But the French machine’s combination of a 167bhp four-pot (then one of the most powerful engines to have featured in a hatch), a six-speed gearbox (when most rivals made do with five ratios) and a simply stunning chassis raised the bar. Suddenly, the race was back on. Avoid track-converted cars; clean examples should start at £5000 or so. Mercedes-Benz SL (R129) Technically speaking, the R129’s life started in the late 1980s, but the fourth-generation SL didn’t really hit the limelight until a few years later. Its sheer desirability – thanks in no small part to those futuristic lines and stonking £50k-plus price tag – made it the darling of the burgeoning hip-hop subculture. And if you can picture yourself rollin’ in a 500 Benz, just like Tupac, the good news is that SLs are today shockingly affordable. Just £3000 gets you behind the wheel of a ropey car, but we’d budget £10,000 or so for something more dependable. Engines ranged from a 2.8-litre V6 all the way up to a 7.3-litre V12 fettled by AMG (good luck finding one of those), but our pick was the grunty 5.0-litre V8, badged 500 SL. Look out for an original car with a good service history, and you shouldn’t encounter too many issues. A hard-top roof is a desirable extra for the colder months, but the standard soft-top should prove adequate, providing it’s been properly looked after (or replaced in the relatively recent past with an official Mercedes-Benz part). Ford Escort RS2000 Hot hatches are nothing new, but it’s rare that the treatment proves to be the redemption story for what was otherwise a generational stinker. So it proved, however, for the maligned Mk5 Escort, transformed by a fizzy 148bhp twin-cam four, quicker steering and a chassis overhaul. The addition of four-wheel drive in 1994 only raised its limits, making it a genuine Cossie-lite. As remixes go, it’s tantamount to The Prodigy turning a kids’ safety ad about not talking to strangers into a rave classic. Not cheap today, though: expect to pay about £8000 for a good runner. Peugeot 106 GTi All the joy of the 306 GTi, but in a smaller, lighter and slipperier package. The 106 GTi was as close as Peugeot ever came to properly replacing the 205 GTi, and today a good example can fetch a five-figure sum. At that price, though, you should also consider the 106 Rallye, which went without power steering and much of the cabin kit in pursuit of pure driving thrills. Ford Focus The Focus was the car that righted all the later wrongs of its Escort predecessor and democratised the attributes of all the best driver’s cars. Ignore the ST and the eye-wateringly expensive RS, and instead look for a tidy Zetec petrol that has managed to elude the tin worm. Just a few thousand pounds should snag one you can enjoy for years to come. BMW 8 Series Munich’s Icarus was too heavy and too blunt in its responses to be a proper grand tourer, and it cost around the same money as Mercedes’ SL. But in 1993 the tide began to turn with the introduction of the 850CSi. It was an M car in all but name, with its V12 engine upsized and boosted to a hearty 375bhp so the 8 could finally provide a driving experience that lived up to its gorgeous looks. It’s also worth considering the later 4.4-litre 840Ci, which finally felt like the 8 Series had become a proper GT car. Prices for the 8 Series start at around £10,000, but CSis are now hitting £50,000-plus.",

    "description": "I have always had a bit of a tortured love affair with the Ducati Panigale V4. It is, in my mind, the most exotic and violently exciting motorcycle of its kind. However, every ride on one over the years has left me feeling simultaneously blown away but also disappointed in myself. Unlike some rivals that instantly make you feel like a riding hero – particularly the one from Germany – the Panigale always left a lingering feeling that I just wasn’t good enough for it. The best way I can explain it is that it felt like the bike’s chassis and suspension were designed to excel when loaded with tremendous speed and brake force going into a corner – the kind of commitment a rider with my skill level simply could not provide. Ducati has obviously been aware of this because every update since the V4 debuted in 2018 has been centred around the phrase “easier to ride”. While it certainly did evolve in that general direction, the Panigale has never quite nailed that description – until now. Ducati Panigale V4 S performance - 10/10 One of the hardest accelerating motorcycles on the market The changes this time around are so vast that Ducati is calling this a new-generation bike – its 7th-gen superbike, to be precise. The engine is the same 1,103cc V4, but it’s massaged to produce even more power (up slightly to 216hp) while somehow also adhering to even stricter Euro 5+ emissions norms, which is just incredible. Torque has dropped slightly, but the only real loss is that the engine is now a little quieter than before  – again, thanks to stricter norms. EngineDucati Panigale V4 SEngineV4, 1103cc, liquid-cooledPower216hp at 13,500rpmTorque121Nm at 11,250rpm The bigger changes are at a chassis level, with the aluminium frame modified to offer a huge 40 percent reduction in lateral stiffness while also shedding 700gm. The controversial new double-sided swingarm also brings in weight savings as well as a 37 percent reduction in lateral stiffness. There are new forged wheels and the latest Brembo Hypure front calipers, which are slightly lighter than the previous Stylemas and claim even better heat dissipation for more consistent performance. And the final major chassis update is the move to Öhlins’ latest ECE 3.0 semi-active suspension (on the S model) that promises a wider operating range of damping capabilities at both the firm and soft ends of the spectrum. Large TFT is easy to read and packed with valuable information. Another significant improvement for me is that the riding position is now designed to be more roomy with a reprofiled fuel tank that is now easier to grip. Ducati also continues to lead the charge in the MotoGP-derived electronics game, with a new horizontally laid-out TFT being the poster child for a deep rabbit hole of electronic customisation options. The one feature that stands out this time around is the new eCBS, which essentially introduces some rear brake inputs while entering a corner (to tighten the line) and even on exit (to help with anti-wheelie). This is something the pro riders manually do, but most amateurs struggle to find the spare brain capacity to manage rear brake inputs at racetrack speeds. Ducati Panigale V4 S handling - 10/10 Easier and more encouraging, but also more capable So, how does all this translate to the race track? Ducati invited us to one of its DRE (Ducati Riding Experience) events at the Chang International Circuit in Thailand to find out, and the result was three of the most memorable, euphoric track riding sessions I’ve had in a long, long time. The first session was all about recalibrating my brain to the outlandish speed. Previous experience at this track reminds me that it has two fairly long straights, but on the V4, it’s almost like they don’t exist at all. It takes just seconds before the little speedometer on the bottom left of the Race layout on the TFT display flicks past 290kph, and it keeps climbing at a remarkable rate before I bail out and haul on the brakes. The new BremboHypure brakes have incredible feel and power Panigales have always been the forerunners of the latest Brembo brakes, and these new Hypurecalipers build on the already exceptional Stylema’s feel and performance. No matter how brave I was about my braking markers, it felt like the brakes could take much more abuse. As we gently rolled back into the pits at the end of the session, the plumes of hot air gently cooking my left thigh were an amusing reminder that with great Ducati power comes great Ducati heat. Then again, the company says it has further improved the V4’s cooling system, which was always quite effective at handling race track speeds – even in our weather. That’s me attempting to follow Ducati’s official MotoGP test rider, Michele Pirro, who is riding at a very sedate pace by his standards. It’s also a nice comparison of how the new Panigale looks next to the previous-gen bike. With a little familiarity in the bag, session two was less of a brutal assault on the senses, which allowed me to observe other things. First, the revised riding ergonomics had me feeling less awkward (and, thereby, less exhausted), and I could tell that the bike felt lighter and more agile than before. Then, there was the way the Panigale dipped into corners with less effort than I recalled and also laid down the power on exits without any of the bucking and weaving that the previous-gen models tended to do. However, by this point, it felt like the suspension was a little too soft for the speeds we were now carrying, and I was keen to switch from Sport mode to Race mode in the next session. Key specsDucati Panigale V4 SKerb weight198kgWheelbase1485mmFuel tank17-litreSeat height 850mmSuspension (F/R)USD fork/monoshockBrakes (F/R)Twin 330mm discs/245mm discTyres (F/R)120/70-ZR17 / 200/60-ZR17 There are two Race modes, each of which can be individually tuned to your liking via a dizzying array of engine, suspension, and electronic settings. The only setting I changed within Race Mode B was lowering the ABS to Level 1, which supposedly provides the full e-CBS effect and deactivates the ABS at the rear. Engine response is noticeably ramped up in the Race modes, but amazingly, it’s still not the full, unrestricted violence in the first few gears, and you’ll need to individually set that in the settings menu. That was something I had absolutely no desire to do, given how easily the bike was already lifting its front wheel on slow corner exits. The V4 S gets the latest Öhlins electronic suspension The most delectable change, however, was how taut and accurate the firmer suspension damping in Race mode made the bike feel. The Panigale now turned in and held a tight line in a way I have never experienced on a fast Ducati, and it somehow still found superb traction on a rather worn set of Pirelli Supercorsa SP tyres. I wonder how much of that tight turn-in was due to the firmer suspension and how much was from the clever rear brake system. Whatever that ratio was, it was, it worked beautifully, and those few laps trying to keep pace with Ducati’s official MotoGP test rider, Michele Pirro, directly ahead of me were some of the most exhilarating I’ve ever had – even though it was plainly obvious that he was riding at what was an embarrassingly casual pace by his standards.  Ducati Panigale V4 S verdict - 9/10 More desirable and rewarding than ever, but at a massive price Sadly, three sessions are all we got, and it would take more like three days to truly unravel how much this bike has to offer. However, the one clear takeaway I have is that it is now vastly more enjoyable for a much wider audience of non-superhero riders- and that has me filled with newfound and unconditional love for the Panigale V4. That being said, there is the caveat that, while it may be easier than before, this is still an overwhelmingly rapid motorcycle that demands respect and a decent amount of skill and experience. There’s also the fact that a bike this explosive needs a big and flowing GP-level track to be truly enjoyed – I suspect it will continue to feel like a caged (and enraged) wild animal if you take it to some of our smaller southern circuits. And, of course, there’s the exorbitant Rs 36.50 lakh ex-showroom price, which means you’ll need a lot more than a heart filled with sunshine and rainbows to be able to afford one. But my god, if you can, you should! Also see: Suzuki GSX8R review: the subtle sportsbike",

    "description": "The Aprilia SR line of scooters, especially the larger 150s and 160s, has been synonymous with sporty Italian design, fun demeanour and strong performance. What they have also been known for is their rather single-minded approach to performance and being priced on the higher side, more so in the BS6 era than ever. Enter the SR 175, Aprilia’s latest sporty scooter that aims to rectify some of these issues.  But before we begin to talk about the scooter itself, I must stress how unusual it is that Aprilia India hasn't officially launched the SR 175 yet but strangely, customer deliveries have begun! One of these new customers has very kindly loaned us his scooter for a review, which is how this story has been possible.   Aprilia SR 175 design and features - 8/10 Striking bodywork unchanged from before; gets two new colours The Aprilia SR 175’s sharp and angular bodywork is almost identical to the SR 160, and this design is now the better part of a decade old, but it still manages to turn heads and stand out in the sea of humdrum commuters on our roads. The SR 175 gets two new colours – white/red and purple/red – both of which are inspired by the RS 457 sportbike.  The SR's colour palette is the same as the RS 457's. While the design remains unchanged, what has seen a step up from before is the feature set. And all of that is primarily down to the crisp new 5-inch TFT display – also borrowed from the RS 457 – and brand-new switchgear to control all the functions. This colour TFT replaces the rather basic and dull-looking monotone LCD on the SR 160 and brings in things such as turn-by-turn navigation, call/message alerts, as well as music playback control once you connect your smartphone to the display via Aprilia’s proprietary app. The inclusion of this colour TFT dash now makes the Aprilia one of a handful of ICE scooters – besides TVS’ Jupiter 125 and Ntorq and Honda’s Activa and Dio models – to have this feature.   The 5-in colour TFT is borrowed from the RS 457 but has a new layout. The new dash is bright and can automatically switch between day and night modes, depending on ambient light. There are also two display modes, with all the above functions only available to use in the ‘Digital’ mode. I personally prefer the clean and uncluttered look of the ‘Analogic’ mode, which has a faux round speedometer and a needle. The overall UI/UX is fairly straightforward for nearly all functions, and no secret handshakes are needed here.  However, convenience-enhancing features, such as a multi-function ignition key slot, a cubby on the front apron, a brake-lock clasp, an external fuel filler and start/stop tech or even a quiet start, are missing. Boot space has never been an Aprilia SR’s forte, and the 175 is no different – you’ll struggle to get even an Indian half-face helmet in there.  Underseat storage not as spacious as that of a conventional scooter. Then, there was one other issue specific to our test scooter. The side stand cut-off doesn’t seem to work, and the display doesn't show the side stand symbol at all like it does in the brochure provided to us by the dealer. Aprilia SR 175 performance and efficiency - 8/10 Packs in strong and eager performance; reasonably fuel-efficient, too But once you swing a leg over and start riding, the SR 175 will have you grinning ear to ear. It’s eager from the word go and is great fun accelerating away from stop lights and leaving traffic behind! Aprilia has enlarged the SR 160’s engine to create this new 174.7cc mill, which makes 12.9hp at 7,200rpm and 14.14Nm of torque at 6,000rpm – a discernible step up from the previous 11.27hp at 7,100rpm and 13.44Nm at 5,300rpm.  EngineEngine174.70cc, single-cyl, air-cooledPower12.9hp at 7,200rpmTorque14.14Nm of torque at 6,000rpm The power delivery, while strong, is smooth as well as predictable, and younger riders will benefit from that. There’s no sudden surge of power, and it has a measured yet strong pull all the way to a speedo-indicated 90kph. The SR 175's riding experience in a nutshell: fun! In our tests, the SR 175 was quite close to the Yamaha Aerox 155 in the sprint to 60kph, after which the more powerful Japanese scooter starts increasing the gap. This is commendable performance from the Aprilia’s simpler 3-valve, air-cooled engine, and what also pleasantly surprised us was its fuel efficiency. It returned an impressive 41.7kpl out on the highway and a decent 35.2kpl inside the city. For the sort of engine this is and the performance on tap, these numbers are commendable.  PerformanceAcceleration0-40kph2.76s0-60kph5.69sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph2.88s30-70kph6.37s50-80kph7.37s The Aprilia SR’s engine has always been a gruff thing, and while that character continues onto the 175, its refinement isn’t a dealbreaker. There is some juddering below 20kph, especially so with small or constant throttle inputs, but once you open the taps, this engine becomes reasonably smooth with just a mild tingle in the floorboard. Our scooter had less than 500km on the odo, so perhaps this could improve after performing the first service.  Aprilia SR 175 ergonomics and comfort - 7/10 It can feel tight for bigger riders; suspension is firm, not harsh Focused and sporty scooters like this can’t match the outright comfort and spacious nature of mainstream practical offerings. The Aprilia SR 175 follows that theme to some extent, but it isn’t as single-minded as its predecessors. Its sloped rider’s seat, which forces you to adjust your seating position every so often, continues into 2025, and it isn’t the most spacious or well-padded unit around. But its suspension comfort has proven to be an area of surprise.  Fuel economyCity35.21kplHighway41.78kplOverall38.50kpl The first day of riding the SR 175 entailed going from Andheri in Mumbai’s western suburbs to Panvel East. Traversing the breadth of the monsoon-ravaged city, I’m happy to say that the SR’s suspension kept me reasonably comfortable as I encountered an unceasing barrage of road imperfections. Of course, it’s still a sporty scooter with taut suspension, but it’s not as downright uncomfortable as the Aerox. The sloping seat forces you to reposition yourself every so often. The SR 175 is quite a tall thing by scooter standards, and while I, at 5’11”, didn’t have any issues with flat-footing it, I foresee that to be a challenge for anyone under 5’7”. Riders with bigger feet will also wish for a little more room on the floorboard, as I felt my feet had little wiggle room and felt quite locked in place. I wear size 12 shoes, so I’m on the larger end of the spectrum, and this is a subjective thing.  Aprilia SR 175 ride and handling - 7/10 14-inch wheels lend stability and confidence when leaned over Sporty handling and surefooted manners at high speeds have always been the Aprilia SR line-up’s forte, and the 175 happily continues that trend. The large 14-inch wheels shod with chunky 120-section rubber inspire loads of confidence when chucking the SR 175 into a bend, and the scooter stays planted no matter the size of the bump on the road. 14-inch wheels keep it planted in almost all situations.  Our scooter came equipped with Vee Rubber tyres, however, Aprilia also offers MRF and CEAT as tyre suppliers, although what your scooter comes equipped with is entirely a game of luck.  BrakingBraking (60-0kph)19.18m Stopping performance, too, is superb, and it feels like this scooter wants you to brake like you’re on a motorcycle. The front brake has a strong yet progressive bite and shoulders the majority of the load, with the rear drum brake mainly there to keep you steady. Just like the SR 160, the SR 175 comes with a single-channel ABS as standard, and while this safety feature works well for the most part, it feels like it intervenes a little too early when you clamp down hard on the binders and robs you of power. The 14-inch wheels lend the SR a motorcycle-like planted feel. Aprilia SR 175 price and verdict - 8/10 A lot more scooter for not a lot more money  By now, we’ve established that the SR 175 is a perceivable step up over its predecessor. Happily, you get this improved experience without having to pay extra, and in Mumbai, the SR 175’s ex-showroom price is Rs 1.26 lakh, which is more or less on par with the top SR 160’s asking price. Considering that there’s really no petrol scooter in this space (the Yamaha Aerox now costs over Rs 1.50 lakh), the Aprilia SR 175 makes a rather compelling case for itself.  Aprilia SR 175 left rear static in field Its performance and sporting ability are attributes few other scooters can match. Its striking good looks and fancy TFT display add to its allure, and it isn’t entirely impractical. Areas of improvement are more to do with the company rather than the product itself – a small Aprilia dealer network limits availability, and service will generally be more expensive and quite likely not as frictionless as for scooters from other brands.   PricePrice (ex-showroom, Mumbai)Rs 1.26 lakh However, if you’re willing to look past that, the Aprilia SR 175 is a thoroughly enjoyable scooter at a fair price that will stand out in the crowd.",

    "description": "Daily commuter, highway cruiser, support car on shoots, track-day toy, drag-race machine – our long-term Maruti Swift has played all these roles over the past 10 months and 10,000km. And it isn’t surprising that it’s been commendably good at all of it. Despite being so multi-faceted, the majority of the running was done within city confines, as that’s one of the Swift’s fortes. The compact dimensions, the light steering and clutch, the peppy engine, the slick gearbox and, of course, the impressive fuel efficiency are what drew everyone from our team to the Swift, and as such, it had become a vital cog. Be it city traffic or open roads, the Swift always felt effortless to drive. Admirably, despite being a sensible and practical hatchback, the Swift remains fun to drive, and it tends to egg you on to drive harder, darting in and out of gaps in traffic, which makes even the most mundane of commutes entertaining. New three-cylinder Z-Series engine is smooth, tractable and impresses with its efficiency. A part of it is down to its dynamics, but the engine does deserve credit, too. While it was initially slagged off, given it is down a cylinder and down on power compared to the outgoing K-Series engine, we quickly realised that this is one of the best small, naturally aspirated petrol engines around. It’s smooth at idle, feels tractable at low speeds, and has a strong midrange, all of which contribute to the experience. It may not be as silky or have the punch at the top end like the K-Series, but this Z-Series engine provides a good balance between efficiency and performance, and I also like the way it sounds. Aside from commuting and support car duties, it also saw action on the racetrack. Inside the cabin, there’s nothing flashy, but it’s got everything you need, and then some. I really like how practical it is, with large door bins, two cup holders and multiple charging provisions. The touchscreen, too, performed near flawlessly in our time, with only some minor glitches. Even the space at the rear proved ample for adults on a family outing, though some did feel that the backrest was a tad too upright. It had even become a regular support car for shoots, comfortably accommodating our camera crew and their gear.    Plenty of cubbies and charging provisions, along with large door bins, make it a practical cabin. During our tenure, we even pitted it against the Tata Altroz Racer in a drag race during our track day, and to everyone’s surprise, the Swift beat out the Tata. Despite having a significant output disadvantage, the fact that the Swift is light weight and easy to launch hard meant that it took an early lead and held its place until the finish. Not only that, the Swift even managed to post a quicker lap time around the CoASTT circuit in Coimbatore – at the hands of Narain Karthikeyan – than the Altroz Racer. Narain was particularly impressed by the Swift’s chassis and the good grip levels. You’ve got to handit to Maruti, as this new Swift, despite being a commuter on the spec sheet, is still capable of some proper old-school fun. 6-speaker audio system’s quality leaves much to be desired, especially compared to rivals. Apart from the shortcomings my colleagues mentioned in previous reports, like the evident cost-cutting in places, poor reverse camera quality and the lack of a centre armrest, I also have some things to complain about. First, the audio system isn’t up to the mark, especially when compared to rivals. In a car where you’re largely spending time in traffic, a good sound system is a must for me. Playing with the equaliser settings did improve things, but it still didn’t make a massive difference. What also could have been better are the LED headlights. They look nice and have a good throw, but the spread isn’t very wide, so on a winding road or when weather conditions are adverse, the illumination can feel lacking. LED headlights have decent throw, but the spread isn’t wide, which becomes evident around bends. Other than some small niggles, this has been one bulletproof Maruti. The Swift’s absence will be felt, given just how useful it was, but it stings a little less knowing that it’s being replaced by its own sedan sibling, the Dzire. Think more space, more features and more practicality than the Swift, and perhaps, more adventures, too.  Long term test dataOdometer9771kmPriceRs 9 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi)Economy14kpl (overall)Maintenance costNoneFaultsNonePrevious reportsSeptember 2024, January 2025, May 2025 Also see: Maruti Swift long term review, 9,000km report Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG comparison Maruti Wagon R, Swift get up to Rs 89,000 off this month",

    "description": "Tesla recently announced its Q2 sales numbers and during the call, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla’s future entry-level model is not an all-new car but just an “affordable Model Y”. Earlier this year, Tesla had promised that it has high hopes for the future with its new launches out of which one is a new ‘affordable model.  Affordable Tesla to be based on Model Y Likely to be aimed at US, European market initially Tesla Model Y price in India starts at Rs 59.89 lakh Affordable Tesla Model Y details Production of the more affordable Model Y to begin in August While the “Affordable Tesla” was expected to be an all-new model, touted to be called Model 2 upon debut, it seems to have turned out a stripped-out iteration of the American EV brand's best-seller.  Series production for the Tesla Model Y’s affordable variant could begin around August or September this year.  There is no clarity from Elon Musk on whether such “affordable Tesla models” will be planned in future on other cars like the Model 3 or will be just confined to the Model Y.  The brand is also yet to reveal details of the markets which will see sales of the affordable Model Y. The ongoing electric car grants in the United States, that amount to USD 7,500 per vehicle are soon going to end thanks to President Trump’s rollback of emission mandates. The upcoming entry-level Tesla Model Y would be aimed at pushing sales, thanks to its lower pricing than the current Model Y’s USD 51,990 sticker price before incentives. Additionally, introducing the affordable Model Y in the European market will also help Tesla give its buyers a lower entry price point to the brand. Tesla sales in Europe are in a downward trend since a long time with the brand losing market share for the last six months in the continent thanks to an overall decline in electric car sales and also the growing competition from Chinese brands. Tesla Model Y in India Tesla Model Y price range is Rs 59.89 lakh to Rs 67.89 lakh  Tesla entered the Indian market with the Model Y earlier this month. Being a CBU import has subjected the Model Y to the full extent of EV taxation and duties, costing almost Rs 60 lakh for the RWD and Rs 68 lakh for the Long Range RWD (ex-showroom, India). The bran initially opened bookings for the Model Y for a limited number of cities but now bookings are open pan-India.  At this price, the Model Y will niche offering in the country as it sits at the upper end of its segment which has similar-sized better equipped rivals at a lower price. While the “affordable model Y” may not make sense for India, the recently shown six-seater long wheelbase Model Y for China could be a good option for India should Tesla decides to build Right hand drive version of the Model Y LWB in future.

Further, the company is also developing smaller series hybrid vehicles that could be exported to the UK. Other manufacturers that could potentially benefit from this agreement in the years to come include Toyota, Mahindra and Tata Motors. While neither Mahindra nor Tata Motors currently exports EVs to the UK, this pact could certainly help these homegrown companies gain a foothold in the UK, a market where Tata Motors once sold its products.    Also see: Commuter bike sales fall as premium bikes gain traction in Q1 FY2026 Tesla DC Supercharger network to come to India Hero MotoCorp to enter UK and Europe with Vida VX2",
