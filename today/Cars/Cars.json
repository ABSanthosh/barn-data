    "description": "Traversing Mumbai’s congested streets is already harrowing enough, especially during rush hour. And in the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé, this experience is amplified manifold. Picture being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, with other vehicles precariously close to your oversized luxury SUV that costs more than some apartments.On several occasions, my heart raced as the SUV’s 360-degree camera system lit up, triggered by reckless bikers attempting to squeeze through non-existent gaps. I was on my way to meet my brother-in-law, but I had an ulterior motive. When he moved to Dubai in 2022, I suggested he purchase a GLE Coupé – not the AMG variant but the standard turbo-petrol version. It fit his budget and would have complemented Dubai’s opulent lifestyle. He didn’t heed my advice. Now, driving the 2025 AMG GLE through Mumbai’s Western suburbs, I was determined to prove a point. Feels huge when navigating through congested streets. The GLE’s substantial size, especially its 2.1-metre width, is particularly noticeable in city driving. Despite setting the GLE in Comfort mode (as it lacks an ‘Eco’ setting), the onboard computer never showed fuel efficiency exceeding 5kpl in traffic – unsurprising for an AMG-fettled 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine in a full-size SUV. The ride quality is also less than ideal. Even in Comfort mode, the suspension crashes through potholes, followed by a floaty, vertical movement that tosses passengers around. The front seats are comfortable, but their ventilation is ineffective, and at this price point, the absence of a massage function is disappointing. Moreover, the touch-sensitive steering controls are overly sensitive, often registering unintended inputs. Also, like in most Mercedes models, one must switch off the overly sensitive autonomous braking feature at the start of every journey. Besides sounding sweet, this 6-cyl unit is a strong performer. On the upside, the GLE’s touchscreen interface is one of the best in the business, and the sound quality from the Burmester audio system is equally impressive. Additionally, Mercedes’ integrated starter-generator delivers a seamless and non-intrusive auto stop/start function, making it easier to leave this feature enabled for fuel-saving while idling. After two hours and 20 kilometres, I finally arrived at my destination, relieved to have avoided any scratches on the vehicle. However, it’s worth noting a significant flaw – many modern Mercedes models, including this one, have a noticeable orange peel effect on their paint, giving the body panels an unfinished look that’s unacceptable at this price. When my brother-in-law saw the GLE, he was visibly impressed. The bold LEDs, imposing Panamericana grille and sleek, sloping roofline left him awestruck. The luxurious beige cabin, complemented by wood inlays, silver trims and dramatic ambient lighting, further elevated the experience. While I admired the impeccable fit and finish, I would have preferred a sportier interior with red seatbelts to enhance its AMG character. Also, though the rear seats are spacious, their cushioning is firm, and the upright backrest detracts from comfort. However, the AMG GLE’s highlight is its six-cylinder engine and exhaust note. With the exhaust flaps open, a few solid revs produced a thunderous roar and crackles that disrupted the serene neighbourhood. “I should have listened to you,” my brother-in-law admitted, promptly whipping out his phone to browse websites scouting for used examples in Dubai. Mission accomplished. Firm cushioning, upright backrest angle far from comfy. The following day, we drove the GLE to a popular eatery in Karjat. Traffic on the Western Express Highway was predictably slow, so I opted for the longer but less congested route via the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Coastal Road and AtalSetu before joining the old Mumbai-Pune highway. I’m really glad Mercedes didn’t downsize this six-cylinder turbo-petrol unit. The engine’s performance reserves make highway cruising effortless. It gets to three-digit speeds almost too quickly, and before you know it, you’re well past the speed limit. With the drive mode set to Sport, even the gearbox feels sharper and a touch quicker. The nine-speed automatic performed brilliantly, too, and I never found the need to use the paddle shifters to take manual control. Switching the suspension to Sport mode revealed a firmer yet more composed ride, with the car feeling flat and stable at higher speeds. The steering is sharp, and when driven with verve, the GLE feels surprisingly agile and manoeuvrable for its size. However, its bulk becomes evident during hard braking, with a noticeable nose-dive and a significant weight transfer. Ground clearance in its standard setting is plenty, but the GLE takes it a step ahead with a suspension-lift function to increase ride height further. Honestly, I don’t think this feature is needed for the typical on-road application the GLE AMG will be subjected to. Its bright interiors with wood and aluminium inserts feel luxurious. In conclusion, the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé commands attention with its road presence, offers strong performance paired with an exhilarating exhaust note and is a pleasure to drive on open roads. However, its ride quality and rear-seat comfort could have been better, and certain features should have been added to justify its Rs 1.88 crore price tag.

    "description": "The RV BlazeX is Revolt’s latest electric commuter, positioned as an alternative to 125cc motorcycles. Sitting between the RV 400 BRZ and RV 400 models, the RV BlazeX emphasizes practicality and daily usability. However, our test was confined to a go-kart track, limiting our overall riding experience. Revolt RV BlazeX design and features Sporting a minimalist aesthetic, the RV BlazeX adopts design elements from the RV1 and RV1+. Unlike the RV 400 and RV 400 BRZ, this model follows a traditional commuter style, featuring a round LED headlamp, LED indicators, and a long single-piece seat. While fit and finish are adequate for the segment, the wiring around the handlebar and the charging socket cover could benefit from better quality materials. The charging cover, in particular, feels flimsy and might not withstand much force. The switchgear quality also seems budget-oriented, with buttons feeling soft and less tactile. A new kill switch is now present, but the absence of a traditional start button may require new riders to be extra cautious when getting on the bike because it is ready to go when you turn the key on. While the overall design mirrors Revolt's lower-tier models, the most noticeable addition is the 6-inch LCD display. This unit allows riders to switch between three modes (Eco, City, and Sport), offers Bluetooth connectivity, and supports app-based features like geo-fencing and over-the-air updates. Two buttons beside the screen enable toggling through trip meters, but they require a firm press, making operation less seamless. Our test unit came with an accessory windscreen, wheel stickering, and a crash guard. While the pricing for these extras was not disclosed, Revolt states that more accessories are available in addition to these three. Revolt RV BlazeX charging and practicality Reinforcing its commuter focus, the RV BlazeX offers a well-cushioned seat and an accessible 790mm seat height. Revolt has also upgraded the suspension to support a higher payload of 250kg. Additional storage is available under the tank, which also acts as a cover for the removable battery. Riders have the flexibility to remove and charge the battery at home. However, the 3.24kWh battery weighs 20kg, which could be cumbersome for those living in buildings without an elevator. The standard charger replenishes the battery from 0-80% in 3 hours and 30 minutes, while an optional fast charger reduces this time to 1 hour and 20 minutes. If purchased separately, the fast charger costs Rs 14,500, but buying it with the bike allows for a trade-in against the standard charger, reducing the price to Rs 4,500. Revolt RV BlazeX performance and handling The RV BlazeX is powered by a new electric motor, delivering a peak output of 4.1kW and 45Nm (at the motor) and 180Nm (at the wheel). Revolt claims a top speed of 85kph, matching its flagship model. While these figures may seem modest, the BlazeX provides a surprising level of punch, especially in Sport mode, making it engaging on the tight go-kart track. However, the throttle response is inconsistent, sometimes feeling imprecise or sluggish. This raises concerns about real-world traffic performance, where smooth throttle control is essential. The suspension setup includes a telescopic front fork and twin rear shock absorbers. Though the track had minimal bumps, the few encountered were absorbed well, ensuring a comfortable ride. The softer suspension setup makes it better suited for city roads rather than track use. Braking performance is strong, with 240mm disc brakes at both ends working effectively, assisted by the CBS (Combined Braking System) for added stability. Revolt RV BlazeX verdict The Revolt RV BlazeX blends  performance, range, and modern features at a competitive price. Its commuter-friendly design and smart connectivity features make it an attractive choice for those transitioning to electric mobility.  However, certain aspects, such as the finish quality and throttle calibration, leave room for refinement in an otherwise practical package.

    "description": "Can an electric powertrain resolve some of our frustrations with this new SUV? BMW’s strategy for most of its electric cars is for them to be closely related to those with an engine, hence the BMW iX1 is essentially just an electric BMW X1. While it might only look like an X1 with a green numberplate, the iX1 is an important model for BMW to grab hold of the small electric SUV segment with both hands. Back when it launched in 2022, BMW estimated 31% of all X1 sales would be electric, with rivals including the best-selling Tesla Model Y and the Volvo EX40 in the firm’s sights. BMW's small SUVs have always been pretty good at the sensible stuff – boot space, legroom, interior versatility and economy – but the X1 isn’t perfect. It uses an anodyne engine partnered with a clunky gearbox, infuriating infotainment and uninvolving handling that makes it notably bad in many areas that are traditional strengths for the brand.Removing that engine and gearbox should in theory improve things, adding a refined smoothness offered by electric powertrains. But does it make the iX1 the best option in the range? Read on for our full review… BMW iX1 range at a glanceThe iX1 line-up consists of two powertrains - the entry-level eDrive20 with 201bhp and front-wheel drive, plus the all-wheel drive xDrive30 with 301bhp. Prices start at just over £43,000, which is similar to rivals from Tesla, Audi and Volvo. Three specification levels are available: Sport, xLine and M Sport. VersionPowereDrive20201bhpxDrive30308bhp",

    "description": "Bold new iX3 will take its lead from the BMW Neue Klasse Vision X concept BMW to begin era of Neue Klasse EVs with launch of crucial new Audi Q6 E-tron rival for 2026 The next era of BMW is edging closer as the firm enters late-stage testing of its first Neue Klasse electric car: the 2026 iX3 SUV. Previewed last year by the bold Neue Klasse Vision X concept (below), the second-generation iX3 will be the first of BMW's new family of EVs, riding on the Gen6 platform, which promises significant improvements in range, functionality and cost. The iX3 will be revealed later this year and launched in 2026 as a rival to the Audi Q6 E-tron, Polestar 3 and forthcoming electric Mercedes-Benz GLC. It will be followed soon after by an electric BMW 3 Series saloon, itself modelled on the striking Neue Klasse concept. The iX3 is now coming towards the end of its development cycle with a hot weather testing programme in South Africa, suggesting its unveiling is on the horizon. BMW has yet to give a date, but the firm has hosted a number of important reveals at its home motor show in Munich in recent years, so the September event seems a likely venue. Specific details on the Gen6 platform remain under wraps, but BMW has confirmed it will be equipped with 800V electrical hardware for rapid charging and accommodate batteries that are 20% more energy-dense than today's packs - boosting range by as much as 30% and efficiency by 20%.  The platform also houses a new generation of lighter and more efficient electric motors, accommodating up to four in the most potent of BMW's new EVs, although the iX3 is likely to offer just the choice of single- or dual-motor powertrains, initially at least. The combustion-engined BMW X3, the firm’s current best seller, will continue to be sold alongside the new iX3. The fourth generation of the SUV was launched in June last year with petrol, diesel and plug-in hybrid powertrains.",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUkhfi8pxw At sixteen, freedom came wrapped in a small rectangular bit of plastic. Alex Yust got a fresh driver’s license from the Hollywood DMV. It wasn’t just about transportation, it was about going places on his own terms. Still, cycling was his first real escape. He could ride to the beach, to Hollywood, anywhere his legs would take him. It was his first connection to the road, and that feeling never left. The M5 isn’t so different. It’s pure, mechanical, and direct. Feet move rods that open butterflies and push incompressible hydraulic fluid. Hands steer and levers move gear selectors. Like a bike, there are consequences when you push and pull on things. Unlike new cars, with the m5, there's no interference in-between doing, and happening. If his bike is Alex's simplest way to connect with the road, the M5 is the best way to amplify it. Then there’s the question: why does this car exist? Why did BMW take a race-bred engine and stuff it into a 5 Series? When it launched, it was the fastest sedan in the world, a car for those who wanted a family-hauler that could also outrun most sports cars. It was hand-built, absurdly over-engineered, and, in the U.S., available in exactly one color combination: black over beige. Why? Maybe it's that what the Germans thought we deserved, or maybe it was just German pragmatism. While European buyers got a wider range of options, BMW locked American customers into a single spec. No other colors. No manual seat adjustments. Just a black suit over a beige interior, no frills, no distractions. Before the M5, sedans were practical. After the M5, they had to be something more. The super-saloon market was born, and every automaker spent the next decade trying to keep up. Alex’s car isn’t stock anymore. It’s been tweaked, refined, made better. It sits lower, grips harder. It’s carried 212,000 miles of history, across the country, through years of memories, through the hands of his cousin before him. And it’s still here, still moving. Plenty of people have tried to buy it, but he’s not selling. Some things, once they become a part of you, aren’t meant to be let go. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photos: Rosario Liberti Tuberculosis is a heck of a way to start an article about some ice racing history, and an even wilder way for a town to find its purpose, but here we are. Back in 1866, an Englishman named Arthur Edward Vansittart Strettell, while coughing his bloody lungs out, decided St. Moritz might just save his life. The pure alpine air (or luck) worked its magic, and he stuck around long enough for people to notice. Soon, more of Europe’s well-heeled started showing up,not just to breathe better, but to winter in style.   That might have been part of the beginning, but Johannes Badrutt, a Swiss hotelier, turned it into a destination. In 1864, he made a bold wager with his English summer guests: return in winter, and if you don’t love it, I’ll pay for your entire trip. They took the bet, expecting bitter cold and suffering. Instead, they found sunshine bouncing off snow-capped peaks, a winter unlike anything they had known. St. Moritz was no longer just a retreat, it is possibly the birthplace of luxury winter tourism. By the time it hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, St. Moritz was more than just ski chalets and cocktails. It was home to the Cresta Run, a skeleton track where men in tweed willingly hurled themselves face-first down a mile of ice. Horse racing? On ice. Polo? On ice. It was only a matter of time before we ended up with cars, on ice. If it could be done with risk and elegance, it happened at St. Moritz.  Fast forward to 2019, and The ICE St. Moritz started carrying that same spirit forward. But this time, instead of jockeys or sledders, it’s Ferrari 250 SWBs, Bugatti Type 35s, and Maserati 450Ss sliding across the frozen lake, their reflections blurry and fractal on the ice.  Part concours, part fever dream, spiked tires chew through ice while vintage race cars dance across a surface that was never meant for them. And then there’s the light, snow refracting golden-hour sunlight, exhaust vapor swirling in the cold. It’s a photographer’s paradise, a filmmaker’s storyboard, a dreamscape of speed and style. With a little history behind us, and that light in mind, we’re sharing a gallery of the finest photos from St. Moritz 2025. Enjoy the view.  Continue...",

    "description": "The Mercedes-Benz CLA is set for its world premiere in production-spec on March 13, the brand has confirmed. The new CLA was first showcased in concept guise in September 2023 at the Munich Motor Show. Earlier this year, the CLA concept even made an appearance at the Auto Expo 2025 in India. Based on the Mercedes-Benz Modular Architecture (MMA), the new CLA will be the first of an all-new model line-up of entry-level luxury cars from Mercedes-Benz. New CLA will debut as an EV, petrol variants to follow It will be the first car with the brand’s new MB.OS operating system Is the first of a new line-up of entry-level Mercedes EVs Mercedes Benz CLA exterior design Production model to closely resemble the concept Mercedes had previously said the production version of the CLA will only be ‘lightly altered’ over the concept, and as such, it previews a completely new exterior and interior design philosophy. Camouflaged test mules of the CLA have hinted at new wraparound LED headlamps with a three-pointed star-like LED daytime running lamp signature, a full-width light bar atop the grille, and a new interpretation of the Mercedes-Benz grille. A camouflaged test mule of the new CLA spied abroad. Meanwhile, the rear end of the compact sedan mimics the front end with an LED light bar connecting the tail-lamps with the star-like LED signature. Overall, the new CLA will have a low-slung stance with flared haunches and a coupe-like roofline, much like the original CLA. Mercedes Benz CLA interior and features Will get an all-new MB.OS operating system We haven’t got a glimpse of the production-spec CLA interior, but the concept had previewed a Supercreen setup with three connected screens. The brand had said the same would be retained for the production version as well. What’s interesting is that the CLA will debut the new MB.OS operating system. The new chip-to-cloud architecture also comes with an AI-enabled virtual assistant. The CLA concept was previewed with a Superscreen setup. The new CLA will come equipped with Level-2 semi-autonomous driving using LiDAR sensors, over-the-air updates compatibility, as well as an expansive glass roof. Mercedes Benz CLA powertrain, range and specs Is claimed to deliver around 750km range from a single charge The new CLA has been engineered as an EV-first vehicle, and entry-level variants of the compact sedan will come with a rear electric motor with a two-speed transmission. Higher-spec 4Matic models will have an additional single-speed electric motor on the front axle. Mercedes calls the new CLA “the one-litre car of the electric age”, with the powertrain having been derived from the Vision EQXX concept. Following the EV, the new CLA will also get an all-new 1.5-litre petrol engine. The battery and electrical architecture will run at 800V, and it can be charged at up to 320kW. This was claimed to enable the CLA to gain 300km of range in just 10 minutes. Mercedes claims an efficiency of 12kWh/100km for the CLA and an overall range of around 750km on a single charger. Later on, the CLA will also benefit from a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder mild-hybrid petrol engine that will be offered in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations. Stay tuned for more details when Mercedes officially takes the wraps off the all-new CLA sedan.
