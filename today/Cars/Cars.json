    "description": "This Success Story comes to us from 500K36, who won this 1995 Talbo Series I coupe from FantasyJunction in a September 2023 BaT auction: It has been a few months since I won this 1995 Talbo Series I coupe on BaT, and I love the car! I have not seen any other examples of this ultra-low-production tribute car inspired by the 1938 Talbot-Lago “Teardrop” coupe up for sale since, so that helped justify the purchase price. Thanks to BaT for bringing me one of the cars I had been looking for for several years. In the end I was competing with one other bidder for it, and this just shows why BaT is a great place for sellers and a great place to find rare cars.",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "First things first. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback you see here is not an all-electric replacement for the ICE A6 we’re all familiar with. In fact, the two models have little in common. You see, under Audi’s new naming system electric vehicles will have odd numbers in the name with ‘e-tron’ as a suffix (eg. Q4 e-tron, Q6 e-tron, Q8 e-tron) while ICE models will run odd numbers. The next-gen A6 will become ‘A7’, ‘A5’ is the name for what is the latest-gen A4 and so on.    This A6 e-tron is the second Audi model after the Q6 e-tron to be built on PPE or premium platform electric co-developed with Porsche. Advancements on the motors, battery and architecture promise enhanced efficiency, faster charging and superior performance. The A6 e-tron has been unveiled in Avant or estate form that's sadly not headed to India and this Sportback bodystyle which is headed to India in 2025. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback design The A6 e-tron looks substantial because it is. It's about the same size as the A6 petrol we are familiar with, but there's more mass to the design, something most noticeable at the sides. A black applique low down on the doors, there to also indicate the position of the battery, helps break the bulk. The fastback tail gives the A6 e-tron Sportback its eye-catching shape and to me, it looks best from the rear three-fourth angle. There's a lovely flow from roof to high-deck boot and the full-width lighting is really slick. A glowing rear logo is a first for an Audi and the digital OLED tail lamps almost have a language of their own with eight selectable patterns and the ability to display warning images to communicate hazards to vehicles behind. With split headlamps, a semi-concealed grille and a black ‘mask’ on the bumper to hide the air dams and ADAS hardware, frontal styling is a dramatic departure from the Audi template. The LED DRLs positioned up top get eight selectable patterns and this is a cool touch. A fact of note is that the A6 e-tron Sportback is the most aerodynamic Audi ever, and this bodes well for range. But, and this is just me, I'm not a fan of this newfangled organic styling. I like my Audi's angular. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback interior and features Inside, you'll see the latest from Audi and that's a good thing. The basic layout is similar to what we’ve seen on the Q6 e-tron which means it’s a cutting edge interior but also a screen-rich interior. There’s 11.9-inch digital dials, a 14.5-inch centre touchscreen as well as a 10.9-inch passenger screen. And that's not all. Versions with Virtual Mirrors (camera pods that replace the wing mirrors) also add in screens near the A-pillars. And lest I forget, there's also head-up display with augmented reality! The latest-gen digital dials are a huge upgrade from Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instruments we’ve seen for nearly a decade. It’s got crisp graphics, nice colours and plenty of info, though what’s missed is the option to go in-depth into EV stats. Over the driving I did find myself relying more on the head-up display, though. There's superb detailing and the augmented reality indications for ADAS and navigation that overlay warnings and symbols onto the driving environment are fantastic. The centre touchscreen is, again, slick and responsive but the menus can feel intimidating at first glance. Shortcuts and widgets do help personalise the screen for ease of use but packing in climate control settings on the screen is not ideal. Connected tech gives access to a full world of apps that can be downloaded on to the main screen. The passenger screen is a good way to keep your front passenger entertained while you're doing the hard work of driving a very nice and very soothing electric car. What’s nice is that the screen is not visible from the driver’s point of view on the go. Along with the closely related Q6 e-tron, the A6 e-tron marks a return to form for Audi in terms of quality. Everything you see and touch feels really high-end. The gloss look to the screens looks rich and goes well with the piano black on the center console. Also really nicely done are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering. They work really well and better than what we've seen on the latest lot of Mercedes cars. There’s a touch panel on the door too for the lights. Front seat comfort is good, helped in part by the option for ventilation, heating and massage. A leather-free interior is optional and I have to say the fabric upholstery on the seats and dashboard is tastefully done. Of the other elements, there's ambient lighting that subtly adds some color to the cabin and flashes warnings such as for safe exits. The A6 is also available with the option of a full glass roof that can go from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. There's also the option of an 830-watt Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system. Four of the 20 speakers are integrated onto the front headrest for a more personalized sound right near your ears. Soft close doors are part of the package too. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity The rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed too but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack. Luggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1330 litres of room. There's no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European spec. The tailgate is powered and handily, Audi has added in a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to kick to activate the opening or closing function. There's a small 27-litre frunk too and uniquely, it too can be opened with a swipe on the bonnet. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range On to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor. Power is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range - 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80% charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling A drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect. The Performance version might be the long variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it's fast, it's responsive and overtakings don't require much thinking. But what's different about the A6 is that it's not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things. You feel as much when toggling between the drive modes too. There's comfort, efficiency, dynamic and balanced modes and each impact the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi's lineup. Don't get me wrong because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you're in the mood. It's just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking The A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check.  Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency and dynamic modes for best aero but in India, owners will probably use the lift function more than anything else. Quick as the A6 is, it's just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddleshifters. There's also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi's system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What's really nice is that you can't sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they're working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy dense battery and high efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict The Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025, the A6 e-tron sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it's a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back. Refinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung performance versions get you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of one crore rupees ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car. The A6 e-tron Sportback represents the shape of things to come from Audi and it sure does impress.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-ix-prototype-review-flagship-ev-gains-more-range-and-power",
    "description": "More energy-dense battery and efficiency gains for leading luxury EV As the star player of its electric car range, the BMW iX pretty much smashed it out of the park at the first attempt. Well-appointed and packed with technology, showcasing both fantastic refinement and effortless performance, when it launched back in 2022 the large SUV nailed its luxury EV brief with aplomb. If, that is, you could get past the styling.  The iX will shortly receive a mid-life facelift, which will be unveiled early next year and on sale in the summer – but we've had a first taste of with a drive in a late prototype test car. Let's get the styling out of the way first: if you didn’t warm to the iX’s ‘distinctive’ grille, temper expectations of this facelift: even with our test car sporting camo wrap, you wouldn’t need an ultrasound to diagnose that it retains a swollen kidney. Remember, that sizeable panel is there for a reason: it houses many of the sensors that the iX’s semi-autonomous assistance features require - that's part of how this car serves as a technical flagship. While there have been some styling changes that we can't talk about for a while, that wasn't a priority here. As has been the trend with recent updates of electric cars such as the Audi e-tron GT and Porsche Taycan, instead of messing with the styling, BMW has focused on improving the iX’s performance, range and comfort, by upgrading the powertrain technology and electronic that is uses. When the iX launched it was taking on the likes of what is now the Audi Q8 e-tron and the Mercedes-Benz EQC, but consider the recent or impending arrivals that this car will take on, such as the Volvo EX90, Polestar 3 and impending Range Rover Electric and the need for continual technical improvement is clear. Plus, with a raft of new BMW EVs arriving from next year onwards, the goal is to keep this as a tech-focused halo car. The revamped iX retains the same basics, with a synchronous motor mounted on each axle giving all-wheel-drive. The e-motors are the same units as before, but now offer a bit more power – BMW has yet to give specific outputs – and use new silicon carbide inverters to improve their efficiency. The battery remains the same physical size, but BMW has been able to make it more energy dense and efficient. The result, BMW claims, is both an improvement in efficiency of around 10 per cent and increased performance. The latter means models will sport new model designations in line with the i5 saloon: so the xDrive60 we tested here is actually the mid-spec successor to the pre-facelift xDrive50. The equivalent to the iX M60 will, in turn, get its own higher number. Don’t stop to think about it too much and we’ll all be fine. In terms of range, the old xDrive50 had an official economy of 391 miles. Another 10 per cent would take the new xDrive60 to around 430 miles, which is a useful improvement. Elsewhere, there are new hydraulic rear axle bearings and ‘friction-optimised’ wheel bearings to improve the dynamics and ride comfort, while BMW has also worked to reduce weight. There are also new tyres with reduced rolling resistance, while the suspension has been tuned for each of the model levels. Our prototype rode on steel springs; air suspension with variable damping will be available. The dashboard of our test car was also largely concealed, but one point of note was the round M Sport steering wheel of our test car, which will now be optional on all models for those not sold on the hexagonal version. From behind the wheel, it’s apparent that the key strengths of the iX have been retained: it’s an incredibly smooth and refined powertrain, and there is performance in abundance if you need it – although there were precious few places to really experience that on our short, supervised test route.  We did have the chance to try the revamped drive modes, including a new Sport Plus mode that sharpens up the driving dynamics and offers fixed, rather than variable, levels of energy regeneration. That is done to ensure a consistent feel when braking, to give more response and feel to eager drivers. Meanwhile, BMW has also worked on the drive modes at the other end of the scale, with a new Max mode that it claims could draw an extra 20 per cent or so range, and happily it didn’t notably strangle the on-road performance as some eco modes do. While this doesn’t feel like a transformative mid-life upgrade, that’s in part because the iX was already an incredibly good luxury EV. What this does feel like is a welcome dash of extra refinement and range to that package, which should ensure the iX can hold its own against the new wave of luxury electric SUVs.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/electric-2026-alpine-a110-be-lighter-petrol-rivals",
    "description": "Alpine A110 E-ternité concept hinted at sports car's electric future Luca de Meo says investing \"a lot of money\" in A110 EV is \"not rational\" but crucial to brand's sporting credentials The next-generation Alpine A110, due in 2026, will be lighter than combustion-engined rivals despite adopting an electric drivetrain. Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo told Autocar that the company had made a “not rational” decision to “invest a lot of money” in a bespoke electric sports car platform for the next A110 and its derivatives – including a likely 2+2 version called the A310 – but it had “looked at Porsche for inspiration” in how to successfully build a sports brand. “Porsche has the 911 [platform] as their own, and then they use others [VW Group architectures] for the likes of the Taycan and Cayenne. You keep the heart then as very true to the brand,” he said. To that end, the Alpine sports car platform will be uncompromising in its purpose to root the French brand in performance models, which then lend credibility to its more lifestyle-focused mainstream models, such as the upcoming A390 SUV. “The next A110 will be lighter than a comparable car with a combustion engine but with no compromise in performance,” said de Meo. He added that making the bespoke architecture was objectively “a completely stupid decision” due to the likely return on investment in pure sales terms. A planned tie-up with Lotus on the architecture fell through but Alpine places such importance on bona fide sports cars that it has continued development by itself.  Alpine has experimented with lightweight electric models previously, such as with the A110 E-ternité concept, an electric conversion of the current A110 that just undercut the Porsche 718 Boxster at 1400kg.  The electric A110's design will be only subtly evolved from the current car, de Meo suggested. It \"needs to look like\" an A110, he said. \"Porsche doesn't make a square 911.\" More broadly, de Meo said “six or seven” uniquely positioned models would make up the Alpine range, including “some emotional pure sports cars”. Eighteen months ago, the brand said its intention was to launch seven models by 2030, starting with the new Alpine A290 hot hatchback. The plan is to crown the range with a supercar and Alpine CEO Philippe Krief hinted that this will come towards the end of the “really ambitious” range roll-out and serve as the flagship of its “dream garage”.  Krief said the firm is “not yet” ready to launch the model, which will be developed at a new R\u0026D centre born out of the firm’s soon-to-be-closed Formula 1 engine factory. He added that the launch of a supercar for the firm is a three-stage process: first a “brand exercise”, next a “tech showcase” and then the third one is “business”. To that end, Alpine has shown off a pure concept supercar called the Alpenglow as a brand exercise in 2022, followed by a hydrogen-combustion technology showcase version of it earlier this year, the Alpenglow Hy4. The working title for the production model is Future Alpine Supercar. Krief said Alpine wants to position itself as a “French sports specialist brand that also happens to be electric”, rather than call itself a pure EV maker.  Head of product Sovany Ang added that the firm wants to “retain accessibility” and will “target specific things and segments where it makes sense for us to be”, rather than try to be a volume or a premium car maker.  The dealer network is expanding to around 140 globally by the end of the year as Alpine looks to break itself out of France and it has established a new flagship facility in Barcelona that also includes e-sports and sim racing areas, as well as a bar and restaurant. This format will also be introduced in London and Paris. Krief confirmed that the current A110 will end production in 2026, when a small-series exemption for GSR2 regulations ends. The next six months of A110 production are sold out and 95% of the £276,000 A110 R Ultime’s production run of 110 units sold within two months of its unveiling at the Paris motor show.",

    "description": "High-end custom motorcycles are a joy to ogle, but owning them is often beyond the reach of us mere mortals. Not everyone has the skill or time to build pinnacle-level custom, nor the money to commission one. The average rider is more likely to see a custom bike they like, and then look at how they can add a smidgen of that style to their own ride. That’s why several custom workshops offer some of their best parts as bolt-on accessories—and why JSK Moto has now joined their ranks. This BMW R nineT café racer is the third custom R nineT that the California-based outfit has built, but it’s the first one that’s been designed with mass production in mind. Founded by Taiwanese ex-pat Samuel Kao in 2010, JSK Moto’s mission here was to build a slick custom that could be broken down into kit form.…",

Take Union Motorcycle Classics out of Nampa, Idaho, for instance, as the pairing of Mike Watanabe and Luke Ransom regularly brings about some of the highest-quality motorcycle restorations undertaken behind barn doors. Furthermore, Union has struck up the perfect relationship with a discerning client who regularly hauls in storied race machines in need of thorough reconditioning. It was for this unnamed client that Union just finished working their magic on a pair of remarkable F1-racing Suzukis—a Dunstall-prepped 1979 GS1000 raced by Barry Sheene and a 1982 Works XR69 raced to several podium finishes by Mick Grant. While the bikes were acquired separately, their history flows through a common vein, making for a rare opportunity to study Suzuki’s Formula 1 racing development.…",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "Images of Mahindra’s third INGLO-based electric SUV, which will be named the XEV 7e, have leaked online. It is slated to go on sale sometime next year and will essentially serve as an EV equivalent of the popular XUV700.   XEV 7e name trademarked alongside XEV 9e and BE 6e  XEV 7e is expected to share its powertrain with XEV 9e Its design will be less radical than the BE 6e and XEV 9e Mahindra XEV 7e new details  Leaked images preview the XEV 7e in its production avatar, and just like the BE 6e and XEV 9e, the XEV 7e has a lot in common with the concepts that were shown back in 2022. It is a three-row derivative of the XEV 9e coupe-SUV.  While the name XEV 7e has not been officially announced, Mahindra has trademarked it along with the XEV 9e and the BE 6e nameplates, with the latter two already used for models that are now on sale. As seen in the leaked images, the XEV 7e will be the less radical and more conventional of the trio, with a “practical” three-row XUV700-like cabin. Upfront, it has a unique design that mimics the XEV 9e, including the headlamps, the closed-out grille and the front bumper. On the sides, it looks very similar to the XUV700, with the rear styling that has EV-specific design tweaks. The alloy-wheel design is also reminiscent of the new XEV 9e with aero-looks.   The cabin has a lot in common with the XEV 9e, including the three-screen setup and the two-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated logo. Compared to the other two Mahindra EVs, one of the USPs of the XEV 7e is captain’s chairs for the second-row passengers, with ample headroom thanks to a conventional roofline. While there isn’t much clarity on the powertrain, we expect the XEV 7e to mimic the XEV 9e’s battery and motor setup. Expect more details on the XEV 7e to emerge closer to its market launch, which is expected by mid-2025.  IMAGE SOURCE Also see: Mahindra BE 6e review: A path-breaking EV Mahindra XEV 9e launched at Rs 21.90 lakh Mahindra XEV 9e Pack One variant price, features explained",

    "description": "In November last year, Tata Motors announced a collaboration with Jaguar Land Rover to share the latter’s born-electric Electrified Modular Architecture (EMA) for its upcoming Avinya range of vehicles. Jaguar’s new electric platform the Jaguar Electric Architecture (JEA) however would not be used by Tata Motors.  In an interview with Autocar India at the brands headquarters in the UK, Jaguar MD Rawdon Glover said “this platform is dedicated to Jaguar and currently there are no plans to do that (build Tata cars on it)” he elaborated further saying “this platform will only be used for vehicles designed, engineered and built in the UK.” This would mean that the platform would also not be used to build cars in other markets like China, a country where the brand has a local manufacturing presence. The idea of reserving the JEA cars as ‘British-built’ is a good one and would help build the brand's new high-end positioning.    The JEA platform was developed to support a range of high-end vehicles that Jaguar expects to reposition the brand and move it higher up from the ‘mass-premium’ segment that the current products operate in. Thus, in that sense JEA would be too far out for Tata Motors. The EMA platform on the other hand which was designed to underpin JLR's next generation mid-sized vehicles would make for a natural fit for Tata Motors higher segment premium range of vehicles.    More affordable Jaguars on the anvil While the 4-door GT will position the brand in the upper and more luxurious space, there will likely be more affordable models from Jaguar “there will be vehicles that will come after, that may perform a different role and target a wider audience” says Glover. Thus alluding to the fact that more affordable models are on the anvil. These could use both JEA and EMA platforms and would also support vehicles with different body types.
