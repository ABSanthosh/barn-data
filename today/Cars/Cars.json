    "description": "This 1966 Ferrari 330 GTC is the fourth of 598 examples built between 1966 and 1968 and was sold new in July 1966 to Carrozzeria Pininfarina for use as a design study. Chassis 8727 was subsequently modified by the Turin design house with experimental features including \"Supervis\" pop-up driving lights, hood vents in lieu of fender vents, cloth upholstery, directional dashboard vents, and other aesthetic and functional changes. After the implementation of the design changes, the car was reportedly driven by Sergio Pininfarina before being sold to a Milanese owner in 1967 and passed through two additional Italian stewards before being imported to the US in the 1970s. It was purchased in the 1980s by a pair of California owners who undertook a multi-decade refurbishment that included reinstating the Speciale fog lights before a repaint in the factory shade of Blu Scuro and a re-trim of the interior in tan leather. Following its completion in 2002, the car was sold in 2006 to a collector who retained it until 2023, when it was purchased by the seller. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 that is topped by triple Weber carburetors and is paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, 14” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, and a Becker Grand Prix stereo. This 330 GTC is said to be one of four produced with Speciale features for the 1966 model year and is now offered in Dallas, Texas, with a Marcel Massini report, invoices from current ownership, and a clean Montana title in the seller’s LLC.",

    "description": "The RV BlazeX is Revolt’s latest electric commuter, positioned as an alternative to 125cc motorcycles. Sitting between the RV 400 BRZ and RV 400 models, the RV BlazeX emphasizes practicality and daily usability. However, our test was confined to a go-kart track, limiting our overall riding experience. Revolt RV BlazeX design and features Sporting a minimalist aesthetic, the RV BlazeX adopts design elements from the RV1 and RV1+. Unlike the RV 400 and RV 400 BRZ, this model follows a traditional commuter style, featuring a round LED headlamp, LED indicators, and a long single-piece seat. While fit and finish are adequate for the segment, the wiring around the handlebar and the charging socket cover could benefit from better quality materials. The charging cover, in particular, feels flimsy and might not withstand much force. The switchgear quality also seems budget-oriented, with buttons feeling soft and less tactile. A new kill switch is now present, but the absence of a traditional start button may require new riders to be extra cautious when getting on the bike because it is ready to go when you turn the key on. While the overall design mirrors Revolt's lower-tier models, the most noticeable addition is the 6-inch LCD display. This unit allows riders to switch between three modes (Eco, City, and Sport), offers Bluetooth connectivity, and supports app-based features like geo-fencing and over-the-air updates. Two buttons beside the screen enable toggling through trip meters, but they require a firm press, making operation less seamless. Our test unit came with an accessory windscreen, wheel stickering, and a crash guard. While the pricing for these extras was not disclosed, Revolt states that more accessories are available in addition to these three. Revolt RV BlazeX charging and practicality Reinforcing its commuter focus, the RV BlazeX offers a well-cushioned seat and an accessible 790mm seat height. Revolt has also upgraded the suspension to support a higher payload of 250kg. Additional storage is available under the tank, which also acts as a cover for the removable battery. Riders have the flexibility to remove and charge the battery at home. However, the 3.24kWh battery weighs 20kg, which could be cumbersome for those living in buildings without an elevator. The standard charger replenishes the battery from 0-80% in 3 hours and 30 minutes, while an optional fast charger reduces this time to 1 hour and 20 minutes. If purchased separately, the fast charger costs Rs 14,500, but buying it with the bike allows for a trade-in against the standard charger, reducing the price to Rs 4,500. Revolt RV BlazeX performance and handling The RV BlazeX is powered by a new electric motor, delivering a peak output of 4.1kW and 45Nm (at the motor) and 180Nm (at the wheel). Revolt claims a top speed of 85kph, matching its flagship model. While these figures may seem modest, the BlazeX provides a surprising level of punch, especially in Sport mode, making it engaging on the tight go-kart track. However, the throttle response is inconsistent, sometimes feeling imprecise or sluggish. This raises concerns about real-world traffic performance, where smooth throttle control is essential. The suspension setup includes a telescopic front fork and twin rear shock absorbers. Though the track had minimal bumps, the few encountered were absorbed well, ensuring a comfortable ride. The softer suspension setup makes it better suited for city roads rather than track use. Braking performance is strong, with 240mm disc brakes at both ends working effectively, assisted by the CBS (Combined Braking System) for added stability. Revolt RV BlazeX verdict The Revolt RV BlazeX blends  performance, range, and modern features at a competitive price. Its commuter-friendly design and smart connectivity features make it an attractive choice for those transitioning to electric mobility.  However, certain aspects, such as the finish quality and throttle calibration, leave room for refinement in an otherwise practical package.

    "description": "The GP Tech V4 suit serves as a replacement for my Missile Ignition suit, which has served me very well for the past five years. The GP Tech V4 costs about half of what you’d pay for the top Racing Absolute suit used by the top racers, but it incorporates many of the learnings and top-tier materials that you will find there. The biggest improvement for me is the overall fit and comfort. The first time I wore this suit, I was in it from 8am to 4pm, with much of that time being spent hanging around the pit area. Normally, that would have been a rather uncomfortable experience, but the GP Tech was surprisingly pleasant. Much of this goes to all the work Alpinestars has put into incorporating stretch panels in strategic spots, but it’s also down to the materials. This suit uses kangaroo leather in certain panels on the chest, arms and legs, and this material has the benefit of being lighter than the usual bovine leather. I was surprised to see that the armour used is CE Level 1, but the reasoning is that it resides behind tough, hard shell protectors on the shoulders, elbows and knees, which amps up the safety but keeps weight and bulk down. The GP Tech V4 uses kangaroo leather in select areas. From a fit standpoint, the GP Tech V4 is superb once you squeeze into it, and the only thing that caught my attention was that it felt a bit tight behind the knees. However, this was only a problem when standing and not on the bike. My sole gripe is that the leather around the chest area bunches up slightly at the seams, which causes no functional issues, but it doesn’t look great. There are some innovative materials in use here, including Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. This helps reduce the heat buildup when leather drags on the tarmac at high speed, which can burn the skin. Then, there’s the MATRYX® material, which uses a combination of Kevlar and polyamide yarn and promises high levels of abrasion resistance as well as excellent breathability. The suit uses Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. Breathability is excellent, and there are even little intake ducts built into the hard armour on the shoulder and knees. One thing worth noting is that this suit is airbag-compatible but only with the newer systems. Older Astars airbag vests that need to be zipped into the suit don’t seem to be compatible with this one. Vents are built into the hard armour for better airflow. At around 2,000 dollars, the price for the GP Tech V4 hasn’t changed compared to its predecessor. You can get much more affordable suits for sure, even from Alpinestars, but if you’re a racetrack regular looking for the next step in comfort and protection, you’ll love the GP Tech V4.

    "description": "The V12 is dying: we’ve heard this year upon year for the last decade or so. And along comes a new high-strung V12 sports car from some exotic brand, and we rejoice, showering said brand with accolades and gratitude for being so brave in this ever-changing world. Yet, Rolls-Royce has exclusively been using this engine configuration for decades. In fact, three of the four models it currently sells are powered by a V12 – a mammoth twin-turbocharged 6.75-litre unit, no less – and in many ways, its most extravagant application is the Cullinan Black Badge. Yes, every Rolls-Royce is excessive, even a bit ostentatious, but the Cullinan somehow takes it a step further. It’s an SUV, for one, which in itself makes it the more conspicuous choice, and then there’s the Black Badge treatment. We’ll get to the engine’s extra exuberance later on, and the price that’ll set you back an additional Rs 1.6 crore, but the Black Badge also adds a certain menace to the SUV’s look that suits it oh so well. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II exterior design Dark chrome trim and optional 23-inch wheels The Black Badge looks a touch more menacing than the standard Cullinan. Rolls’ hallmark surfeit of chrome is replaced with dark chrome, and that includes the window surrounds, door handles, number plate garnish, exhaust surrounds, and most notably the pantheon grille and Spirit of Ecstasy emblem. The headlamp and tail-lamp internals are darkened as well and, yes, the badges themselves are black. You can now option 23-inch wheels on the Cullinan, a size that certainly doesn’t look out of place on this ‘high-sided vehicle’, as Rolls calls it, but here too, the Black Badge offers a more aggressive, two-tone design that bares the brake calipers for all to see. Colour customisation is near endless The facelift, to these eyes at least, injects some much-needed character into the imposing but uninteresting face of the original Cullinan, in the form of slimmer headlamps with vertical LED running lights that drop down into the bumper, which itself has fewer openings for a much cleaner look. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that, for a sum, Rolls-Royce will let you pick virtually any colour on the visible spectrum to paint your Cullinan with, with the possibility of further enhancement by way of crystal finish and hand-painted coach lines. But it encourages you to go bold, with bright colours that offset all that black well. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II interior and features Dashboard trim is limited to either piano black or dark metallic. It’s a similar story inside, where you could choose an uninspired all-black cabin, but you’re nudged towards yellows, blues and purples, which are in sharp contrast to the piano black or dark metallic dashboard trim – your only options in a Black Badge. Quality? Near faultless, of course; from the uniformity of the stitches to the flawlessness of the hide, to the micron-perfect fit of the trim pieces; the craftspeople really earn their commission. Mirroring its exterior, the Cullinan has a taller, bolder dashboard fascia than the rest of the model range, but the layout is familiar, and the Series II facelift has brought with it a wider array of personalisation options. Vast space, big windows, soft cushions; individual reclining seats also available. One option you won’t see in these pictures, but which we wholly recommend, is the ‘Sanctuary’ rear seat. This gets you two individual chairs – powered, heated, ventilated and massaging – as well as a drinks fridge and a glass separator for the luggage compartment. Either way, though, space is more than you’ve ever seen in an SUV, thanks to a limo-like 3.3-metre wheelbase, with a tall, stately seating position from which to survey your empire. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II engine and performance 600hp and 900Nm Remarkably easy to manoeuvre for something so large; great visibility helps. Now, back to the V12, which sits resolutely under that long bonnet, heralded by the lady atop the grille. The car may have been updated, but the engine remains largely the same, and while it ordinarily – if you can use such a word in a Rolls – deploys 571hp and 850Nm, in the Black Badge, that’s upped to 600hp and 900Nm. 'Low' mode sharpens throttle response These swollen outputs aren’t easy to perceive in everyday driving, but press the ‘Low’ button on the gear stalk, and you’ll notice a greater eagerness from the powertrain. A subdued burble pushes through several hundred kilograms of sound insulation into the cabin; enough to signal potency without being uncouth. Surprisingly easy to drive Mass management has always been part of Rolls’ dynamic remit. Once you’re done flexing, however, un-pressing the Low button reverts the Cullinan to the Rolls-Royce default spec, and really, this is what you’re actually paying for. The burble is now a whisper, the steering lightens up, the suspension relaxes, and the demeanour simmers from Hulk to Bruce Banner. It’s at this point you notice it’s not as intimidating to drive as a 5.3-metre SUV might seem, thanks to high seating, great visibility, rear-axle steering and easy-to-spot square edges. Composed around corners even at high speeds Every Rolls is unapologetically heavy, and the suspension is engineered requisitely robust to compensate. The 2.9-tonne Cullinan, however, has the added complication of a high centre of gravity, which it manages with aplomb. No, it isn’t a Porsche Cayenne around a bend, but its ability to deliver composure and comfort, whether at single or three-digit speeds, on any surface imaginable, has to be felt to be believed. Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge Series II price and verdict The Black Badge commands a Rs 1.59 crore premium over the regular Cullinan. Where every other Rolls-Royce is named after something ethereal – Ghost, Spectre, Phantom – the Cullinan is named after the world’s largest gem diamond. Big, bold, valuable and indestructible, it’s a name that fits. For an established, traditional brand to go down the SUV route to boost sales might irk the cynical amongst you. The simple fact is that it’s good business, and the Cullinan is by far the highest-selling model in the range. It’s even responsible for dropping the average Rolls owner’s age from 56 to 43, and the Black Badge version, with its almost rebellious attitude, has no doubt played a part. Rs 11.92 crore before options The Series II updates are subtle but effective, widening the personalisation possibilities and bringing a hike in price to an eye-watering Rs 10.33 crore for the standard version and Rs 11.92 crore for the Black Badge! The same cynics from earlier might scoff again, but the truth is, inside, outside and under the skin, it’s the same as a Phantom, albeit with a different form factor. An arguably more contemporary and desirable one, and certainly a more practical one. Titanic road presence, effortless performance and peerless luxury truly make this the monarch of SUVs.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/how-aerodynamics-have-moved-cars-forward-past-25-years",
    "description": "The Audi A2 had a particularly low drag coefficient but EVs are changing the game I’ve bought an Audi A2. It’s a 2003 74bhp 1.4-litre diesel and, because it didn’t have an MOT, it cost me £500. So far, I’ve fitted a new rear wheel bearing (£30), cleaned some mould from its crannies and sent it to be MOT tested. It failed only on headlight alignment and parking brake effectiveness, the latter perhaps because it has recently spent time sitting. By the time you read this, I hope to have sorted both, plus the sole advisory note about headlight cloudiness, meaning I will have a fully roadworthy, clean-MOTed A2 that the tester called “really tidy” for less than £550. You will hear more about it, of course, in future, and no doubt I will bang on about it at length on the podcast (get it every Wednesday from etc and so on). But it’s a photo from the previous owner, showing a return of 75mpg, that has got me thinking about just how efficient the A2 is – and could be. It’s aluminium-structured and compact so has a kerb weight of only 960kg in this form. But while running a sponge over it, I reminded myself how the field of aerodynamics has moved on in the past quarter century. The A2 TDI had a drag coefficient of 0.28, which a special low-drag, big-economy edition managed to improve to 0.25. It took things like 145-section tyres and an underbody redesign to do that. Yet today, in cars that somehow don’t look anything like so slippery, figures in the low 0.20s are increasingly common. On the face of it, the A2 looks a pretty efficient shape. The front is well rounded and the roof arches in a teardrop profile, which is the most aerodynamic shape there is. Cars could all be incredibly efficient if they were 12 metres long and tapered for a teardrop profile that would retain laminar air flow right along the body. But they’re not, so air has to break clear of the body somehow, and to cleave it off quickly is better than prolonging its departure, which is why so many modern cars have boot-lip or rooftop spoilers. A rounded rear end promotes air swirling and creating little eddies, almost clinging to the body and adding drag. That car designers go to the trouble of aerodynamically sculpting rear light clusters shows how it’s worth making even small improvements here. Especially with EVs, in which aerodynamics play a bigger part in the overall efficiency than in ICE cars, and because more drag doesn’t just add fuel cost but charging time too. It’s such little details that the old A2 doesn’t have. Its door handles stick out, its windscreen wiper sits above the windscreen edge and there’s (very subtle) body cladding. Practicality and regulations played their part too. The A2 has a little lip spoiler on its hatch, which could be more efficient if it were bigger, and could extend vertically down the sides of the car too, like the ones they put on the back of lorries. But that would make rear visibility even worse than it is and could have spoilt the lines of what I think is a very pretty little car. Ditto if the rear lights had been sculpted, rather than shaped to match the body: more efficient, less attractive. There are things Audi didn’t do at the time, then, that it would feel almost compelled to do today, especially on a car marketed, as the A2 was, as technically clever and uber-efficient. Still, for a late-1990s design, it’s hardly shabby. I haven’t done the calculations, but there are estimates that it would take only 10bhp, plus or minus (probably plus) a couple, to propel an A2 on the flat at 60mph. Which sounds like not a lot until you remember that a hire go-kart, much lighter and smaller but much less slippery, will do about the same with similar power. I think making an A2 as slippery as possible would be a fun project: reshaping its spoilers, fairing-in its rear wheels, extending its bonnet and so on. Yes, I know that none of those things would make it as efficient as an EV. And save for fitting skinnier tyres, I’m not going to do any of them anyway. I’m just going to enjoy this little marvel for what it is.",

    "description": "Performance, practicality, ride and handling balance: Legacy GT-B nails them all After 36 years, Subaru Legacy production is about to end. We reflects on the lineage’s diverse appeal The turbulence of this transforming new car market has already claimed some notable victims. Who would have imagined a world without Mondeos and Fiestas just a handful of years ago? And true car obsessives will soon have another name to mournfully raise a glass to, because Subaru Legacy production will end this spring. Okay, its loss won’t garner the same school-run or L-plate anecdotes as those famous Fords, but the Legacy is a car of importance to people like us. For those of a certain generation, it was a punchy purchase for a modest bunch of credits on Gran Turismo; for others, it’s the machine that Colin McRae drove to his first World Rally Championship win back in 1993. While its legend may pale beside the Impreza’s, its legacy (yes, yes…) is no less impressive. It’s a heck of a lot cheaper to buy used, too. As Impreza prices rise seemingly by the minute, the most celebrated 22B versions nudging quarter of a million, Legacys continue to sell for peanuts. The square plates signify the origin of the 1999 GT-B we have here as the Japanese domestic market (JDM), and it represents one of the most potent iterations in the Legacy’s 36-year life, yet it can be easily bought for less than £5000 in decent nick. Well, once you’ve found one for sale… Alongside it is the survivor, the amalgamation of Legacy DNA that you can still buy showroom-fresh in Britain. Indeed, 752 people did just that in 2024, making the Outback Subaru’s best-seller amid successful year-on-year stats. Launched in 1995 as a raised and cladded variant of the Legacy estate, the Outback soon became a model all of its own – one with a life still ahead of it. Once Subaru wound down its WRC programme and stopped selling asbo Imprezas, its UK audience returned to being a loyal, rural lot, and thus the sole spec in which you can buy the current Outback is targeted perfectly at them – so far away from the spec of the GT-B. Indeed, the two turbochargers of this pairing aren’t shared out evenly. While the 200,000-mile Legacy you see here puts 276bhp through Subaru’s famed symmetrical all-wheel drive system via a taut five-speed manual gearbox, its modern-day relative makes do with 167 naturally aspirated horses and a continuously variable transmission. No car has managed to extract thrills from one of those, but then the jumped-up suspension and rugged roof rails suggest the Outback treads a wholly different path to the gnarlier GT-B and its bonnet scoop. “Space, pace and a handsome face” was Subaru’s blueprint for the Legacy back in 1989, and its most luxurious car to date was designed primarily for the US market, where it and the Outback have sold well ever since, consistently surfing the crest of owner-satisfaction surveys. It wasn’t long before the enthusiasts within the company got their hands on it, though, and a seemingly infinite number of multi-suffixed specials fill racing games and online resources in a befuddling array of configurations. This GT-B is a prime example to highlight its performance prowess, although its besotted owner, Daren Patient, encourages prudence before I clamber into the enveloping sports seat, keen to fulfil an ambition held since I bought one of these in Mustard Mica via a PlayStation pad. “It doesn’t corner like an Impreza,” he warns, reminding me of the Legacy’s classier intent. He needn’t have worried. Nostalgia fizzes through me the moment I turn the key and the wubbah-wubbah of its idling 2.0-litre boxer permeates the chilled morning air like the twin rotors of an approaching Chinook. The engine is already warmed from photography runs and the long straight out of our glamorous lay-by is a perfect opportunity to experience late-’90s twin-turbo delivery, a world before the hot-vee and mild-hybrid solutions that help solve turbo lag today. Indeed, the power only truly hits at around 4000rpm, once both turbos boost in unison, when acceleration builds and soars, rather than hitting like a sledgehammer. Once into its stride, the GT-B feels unstoppable, and you end up wishing for more than its five gears, as if the speed would just keep climbing with the comically repeated upshifts of a movie car chase. Once a corner arrives, its brakes inspire confidence, and its dinky but well-spaced pedal box allows you to blip downshifts easily. Yet this laid-back Legacy never demands such intricacies from its driver. The significance of its ‘B’ affix can’t be underplayed, the work of its standard Bilsteins bordering on the ethereal. I’ve driven very few cars that balance ride comfort and handling nous to this degree. It resists roll with even ambitious cornering speeds and its responses are endlessly faithful, all without trading composure over the worst of a British back road. And what’s truly extraordinary is that this car runs on its original dampers, an engine rebuild being the only major mechanical blemish in its long life. While it never truly entertains like a hot Impreza, it’s a precise thing whose vast all-weather capability draws you in. I’m not sure that a modern Volkswagen Golf R Estate, with higher peak power and a quarter-century’s worth of tech development at its disposal, would pull out much of a gap ahead. The interior immediately ages the experience – of course it does – but exemplary refinement and rock-star flourishes like its frameless doors would delight every time you drove it. After that, the modern Outback can only feel like what it is: a crossover. Subaru reckons its 1995 progenitor began the trend (“the driving choice of everyone from the landed gentry to outdoors families”, reads the bumf), but it’s fair to say you’re unlikely to cross-shop this with many rivals nowadays. You surely buy a Subaru if you want a Subaru, and thankfully at least two people every day still crave the single-minded spec of this latest Outback. Curiously, they’re getting the car with more heft to its steering, drama to its damping and noise in its cabin of this pair. Which isn’t to say that it’s especially rough or boisterous, merely that it proves how thoroughly engineered and wide in its remit that GT-B truly was. From the off, the Outback is much less sporting, pitching and rolling its way through corners and demanding a concerted effort to get up to speed, its lack of turbos evident and its CVT droning away under big throttle loads. But once you’ve adapted to its power delivery, I can see this being a thoroughly easy thing to live with. It occupies a pleasing precipice between traditional engineering and new technology, blending in mandatory driver assistance systems as well as we can expect (Subaru launched its Eyesight technology suite more than a decade ago, long before the rulebooks demanded this stuff), while its big infotainment touchscreen is very neatly integrated. Daren is especially satisfied by the absence of the tacked-on-tablet aesthetic that many modern dashboards possess.  Starting at £37,995, it also feels good value in the area Subarus have always majored: perceived engineering, rather than the perceived quality its German foes have traditionally done so well.  I wouldn’t be surprised if this Outback is still going strong a few decades from now. It’s unabashed about its own USP, and in a market that can struggle for true diversity in light of vast platform- and powertrain-sharing, here’s a brand that proudly sells something rarer-groove. These two make a merry pair – one that really proves the flexibility of this model lineage. Even if they no longer share a name, there’s a common integrity that ties them together. While I would be reluctant to recommend the current Outback to many folks outside of its core customer set, it’s a charmer, and the bones of it are admirable. With more focused damping, extra power and a gratifying gearbox, it would properly satisfy its driver. All the elements that elevate its GT-B ancestor for a fraction of the price, essentially. Raise a glass to the Legacy – and buy one before everyone else realises what they’re missing.",

    "description": "Trends come and go, but tradition is everlasting, and you’d be surprised just how long scrambler motorcycles have been around. The term harkens back to the earliest days of motorcycle racing when competition was an A-to-B affair, and there were too few paved roads to limit competition to tarmac only—a scramble, as they’d come to be called. As such, racers crudely modified their machines to work on a mix of surfaces, adding more aggressive rubber, maximizing suspension travel and hiking up fenders to clear mud. The manufacturers eventually realized the marketability of a multi-purpose machine, and even after competition evolved, demand persisted for bikes that could (more or less) do it all. The popularity of the scrambler has ebbed and flowed through the years, but it’s safe to say demand is as strong as ever for these bikes.…",

Founded in 1935 by Victor Bastide, Précision Side-Cars got its start building sidecar rigs specifically for BMW motorcycles. The story goes that Monseiur Bastide visited Germany to secure the French import license for BMW, only to be turned down. So he returned to France and began manufacturing sidecars instead. Précision changed hands a few times over the years before being acquired by another French outfit, Alternative Side-Car, four years ago. “We used to work with the original Précision Side-Cars, but only to get their bodies to put onto our frames,” says Gene-Vincent Burdet, who runs Alternative Side-Car with Jene Burdet and Vivien Boisserie.…",

    "description": "A prototype Mercedes EQS sedan is being tested with a solid-state battery that could deliver a range of more than 1,000km on a single charge. The first production car to use this new battery is scheduled to hit roads before the end of the decade. Preliminary trials are being conducted in the UK to evaluate the efficiency, durability and performance of the solid state pack, which Mercedes-Benz has co-developed with US-based Factorial Energy. Mercedes EQS prototype has been lightly modified New solid-state tech claimed to 25 percent increase in range Mercedes EQS sedan prototype with solid state battery details The battery housing has been reworked   The EQS sedan being used since early February to test the battery has been lightly modified to accommodate the new pack. Mercedes says work was mainly focused on reworking the battery housing. The solid state battery pack uses a floating cell carrier, which has pneumatic actuators developed by Mercedes-Benz’s Formula 1 engineers in Brixworth. This system manages the expansion and contraction of materials inside the battery cells during charging and discharging for improved stability and longevity. Range claimed to increase by 25 percent compared to Li-ion battery   While the company has yet to reveal the full specifications, it confirms that the EQS’s current 12-module battery compartment allows for flexible configurations and capacities. The brand also claims that the solid state tech offers around a 25 percent increase in range compared with a lithium-ion battery of equivalent size and weight. In fact, Mercedes-Benz expects its new solid-state unit to push the EQS prototype’s real-world range beyond 1,000km. For reference, the EQS 580 sedan on sale in India comes with a 107.8kWh lithium ion battery that has a WLTP range of 588km (857km on the Indian MIDC cycle). Factorial Energy had confirmed in June last year that the battery cells it had supplied Mercedes with battery cells featuring an energy density of up to 391Wh/kg and a charging capacity exceeding 106Ah. The pack also holds a patented lithium-metal anode and polymer separator. Mercedes solid state battery future   The technology being trialled in the EQS prototype marks an initial step towards a more advanced solid-state battery. Codenamed Solstice by Mercedes and Factorial, this next-generation unit replaces the polymer separator with a sulphide-based solid electrolyte. The target energy density is 450Wh/kg and an estimated 80 percent range increase over today’s lithium ion batteries. Together with the new battery technology, Mercedes is also developing a new-generation of silicon carbide inverters and power electronics. The AMG High Performance Powertrain division in Brixworth is developing them to bring higher power efficiency and improved performance to Mercedes’ future models.

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUkhfi8pxw At sixteen, freedom came wrapped in a small rectangular bit of plastic. Alex Yust got a fresh driver’s license from the Hollywood DMV. It wasn’t just about transportation, it was about going places on his own terms. Still, cycling was his first real escape. He could ride to the beach, to Hollywood, anywhere his legs would take him. It was his first connection to the road, and that feeling never left. The M5 isn’t so different. It’s pure, mechanical, and direct. Feet move rods that open butterflies and push incompressible hydraulic fluid. Hands steer and levers move gear selectors. Like a bike, there are consequences when you push and pull on things. Unlike new cars, with the m5, there's no interference in-between doing, and happening. If his bike is Alex's simplest way to connect with the road, the M5 is the best way to amplify it. Then there’s the question: why does this car exist? Why did BMW take a race-bred engine and stuff it into a 5 Series? When it launched, it was the fastest sedan in the world, a car for those who wanted a family-hauler that could also outrun most sports cars. It was hand-built, absurdly over-engineered, and, in the U.S., available in exactly one color combination: black over beige. Why? Maybe it's that what the Germans thought we deserved, or maybe it was just German pragmatism. While European buyers got a wider range of options, BMW locked American customers into a single spec. No other colors. No manual seat adjustments. Just a black suit over a beige interior, no frills, no distractions. Before the M5, sedans were practical. After the M5, they had to be something more. The super-saloon market was born, and every automaker spent the next decade trying to keep up. Alex’s car isn’t stock anymore. It’s been tweaked, refined, made better. It sits lower, grips harder. It’s carried 212,000 miles of history, across the country, through years of memories, through the hands of his cousin before him. And it’s still here, still moving. Plenty of people have tried to buy it, but he’s not selling. Some things, once they become a part of you, aren’t meant to be let go. Continue...",

    "description": "Photos: Rosario Liberti Tuberculosis is a heck of a way to start an article about some ice racing history, and an even wilder way for a town to find its purpose, but here we are. Back in 1866, an Englishman named Arthur Edward Vansittart Strettell, while coughing his bloody lungs out, decided St. Moritz might just save his life. The pure alpine air (or luck) worked its magic, and he stuck around long enough for people to notice. Soon, more of Europe’s well-heeled started showing up,not just to breathe better, but to winter in style.   That might have been part of the beginning, but Johannes Badrutt, a Swiss hotelier, turned it into a destination. In 1864, he made a bold wager with his English summer guests: return in winter, and if you don’t love it, I’ll pay for your entire trip. They took the bet, expecting bitter cold and suffering. Instead, they found sunshine bouncing off snow-capped peaks, a winter unlike anything they had known. St. Moritz was no longer just a retreat, it is possibly the birthplace of luxury winter tourism. By the time it hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, St. Moritz was more than just ski chalets and cocktails. It was home to the Cresta Run, a skeleton track where men in tweed willingly hurled themselves face-first down a mile of ice. Horse racing? On ice. Polo? On ice. It was only a matter of time before we ended up with cars, on ice. If it could be done with risk and elegance, it happened at St. Moritz.  Fast forward to 2019, and The ICE St. Moritz started carrying that same spirit forward. But this time, instead of jockeys or sledders, it’s Ferrari 250 SWBs, Bugatti Type 35s, and Maserati 450Ss sliding across the frozen lake, their reflections blurry and fractal on the ice.  Part concours, part fever dream, spiked tires chew through ice while vintage race cars dance across a surface that was never meant for them. And then there’s the light, snow refracting golden-hour sunlight, exhaust vapor swirling in the cold. It’s a photographer’s paradise, a filmmaker’s storyboard, a dreamscape of speed and style. With a little history behind us, and that light in mind, we’re sharing a gallery of the finest photos from St. Moritz 2025. Enjoy the view.  Continue...",

    "description": "The 1967 Cadillac Eldorado was a styling revelation when it arrived, with front-wheel drive, covered headlamps, and sleek styling devoid of flim-flam. But the original look didn’t last long, as annual styling updates and regulatory changes made their marks immediately. While the 1968 was relatively the same as the ‘67 (with a larger engine), the 1969 version lost its covered headlamps, special ventilated wheel covers, received an ugly reversing lamp, and adopted the corporate dashboard used by the rest of the Cadillac lineup. And there were even more changes on the way for 1970 as the eighth generation prepared to fade away.",
