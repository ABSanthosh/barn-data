    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "Five years after its debut in India, the BMW 2 Series is being replaced by a newer, second-generation model. Like its predecessor, it’s high on style and design, but there are a few caveats – most notably, a new downsized engine. Can it still deliver the best of BMW in a compact and stylish package? BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: exterior design and engineering 9/10 Design remains its calling card, with sharp looks and increased dimensions. Based on the same UKL2 platform as before, which underpins BMW’s front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive cars, the new F74 2 Series Gran Coupe has grown in size. Although the wheelbase remains unchanged, length, width and height have all increased. Styling is sharp and eye-catching, but it’s less polarising compared to its BMW peers. At the front, it features a shark-nose profile, with a bonnet that swoops down and a bumper that angles upward, giving it a distinct shark-snout appearance. Redesigned adaptive headlamps are sleeker and have new LED DRLs.  The adaptive LED headlamps have been redesigned, and since this is the M Sport version, the bumpers sport sharp cuts and blacked-out elements. The modestly sized grille is now backlit, highlighting its signature look at night. From the side, the car appears more proportionate, thanks in part to the striking 18-inch wheels. While the wheel size remains the same, the tyre profile has increased from a 40 to a 45 section, slightly raising the overall height and boosting ground clearance to around 165mm. The rear has a clean design, devoid of a spoiler or exposed exhaust tips.  The swooping coupe roofline remains as stunning as ever, and the iconic Hofmeister kink has been subtly updated with the numeric ‘2’ embossed within. As before, the Gran Coupe features frameless doors for added style. At the rear, the design is more subdued, with simple individual LED tail-lamps and a clean overall look – no ducktail spoiler, no exposed exhaust tips. Overall, the sleek design is exactly what you’d expect from a Gran Coupe. BMW has played it safe here, avoiding the polarising look seen on some of its other models. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Interior Space and Comfort 6/10 Focused and minimalist interior, but rear seat space is disappointing. The interior follows the minimalist theme found in modern BMWs. The dashboard is largely devoid of physical buttons, integrating most functions into the touchscreen. The padded dash feels plush, and ‘M’ stitching adds a touch of flair. Ambient lighting beneath the AC vents change colour – red when you increase the temperature, blue when you decrease it. Dashboard design is minimalistic and sporty with lots of soft touch materials The curved glass panel merging the infotainment and instrument cluster is angled towards the driver. Though responsive and slick, the touchscreen interface is not very user-friendly. Even basic functions like adjusting the AC demand too much attention. Below the screen, there’s a wireless charger, two cup holders, and some space to store small items. The centre console houses a cluster of buttons for quick access to the gear selector, drive modes and camera. The front seats are sporty, with firm bolsters and adjustable under-thigh support for both driver and passenger. The M Sport steering wheel is chunky and adds a sporty touch. The driver’s cockpit remains a highlight for enthusiasts. Rear seat space is cramped, especially the headroom. Rear seat space continues to be a drawback. The coupe-like roofline reduces headroom, and the unchanged wheelbase limits kneeroom. Passengers over six feet will find it cramped. While rear AC vents and a panoramic sunroof help open up the cabin, it’s still not comfortable enough for long journeys. If the dark mocha interior feels too sombre, a brighter upholstery option is available to enhance the sense of space. 430-litre boot houses a space-saver spare wheel under the floor.  Boot space stands at 430 litres. The 2 Series no longer comes with run-flat tyres, so a space-saver spare wheel is stored under the boot floor. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Features and Safety 8/10 Decent equipment, but some basic features are missing. With most functions integrated into the touchscreen, better usability would have helped. There’s wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a crisp 360-degree camera and automatic parking. Drive modes change the car’s theme and setup, while safety and assist systems are helpful for highway driving. Thankfully, in erratic city traffic, these systems can be switched off manually. New Digital Key feature allows several functions to be controlled via your phone.  Safety features include Lane Keep Assist, autonomous emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. However, some basic features like ventilated seats, rear blinds and adaptive cruise control are missing. A new feature is the Digital Key, which allows remote control of basic functions such as lock/unlock, cabin pre-cooling, and boot access – all via smartphone – and can be shared with up to five users. There’s also a roof-mounted camera that can record video and photos, exportable to your phone. Roof-mounted interior camera can be used to record both photos and videos.    BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Performance and Refinement 6/10 Downsized engine not up to par; performance and refinement are average. The biggest change in the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is the updated powertrain. The 1.5-litre, 3-cylinder turbo-petrol engine makes 156hp and 230Nm – comparable to midsize sedans like the Hyundai Verna Turbo. 1.5-litre, 3-cyl turbo-petrol engine makes 156hp and 230Nm At idle, vibrations are felt through the steering and seats. It smoothens out once in motion, but acceleration isn’t particularly exciting. Power delivery is linear, and the engine becomes audible past 4,000 rpm; not coarse, but not sporty either. Switching to ‘Sport’ mode improves throttle response slightly, but not enough. With its sporty seating and BMW badge, you’d expect more punch, but it’s lacking. There is a ‘Boost’ mode, similar to larger BMWs, but since it lacks a 48V mild-hybrid system, it doesn’t add power. Instead, it tweaks the gearing electronically for quicker torque delivery, aiding overtakes; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds. Performance is progressive, not sporty; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds  The 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox performs well – smooth, quick and responsive through paddle shifters. It won’t hold gears indefinitely, but it doesn’t upshift too early either. Sedate driving suits the 2 Series best. The chassis, gearbox and suspension could easily handle more power. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218 Mileage 8/10 No diesel option, but smaller engine promises better efficiency. We couldn't conduct a full Autocar fuel test during the first drive, but BMW claims 16.35kpl. Unlike the previous generation, there is no diesel option – so the small-displacement petrol engine is the only contributor to efficiency. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Ride Comfort and Handling 8/10 Stiff suspension helps handling, but low-speed ride suffers. The handling is where the 2 Series redeems itself. Despite the lack of power, BMW has worked its magic on the chassis, steering and suspension. Dampers have been reworked, and tweaks to the front axle – like changes to the caster angle – enhance agility. Wider tyres also help grip, but apart from minor torque steer, the handling is sharp and engaging. It lacks pace, but redeems itself with agile handling.  Bends and twisties are enjoyable, and while it lacks straight-line speed, it shines in corners. The downside is ride quality. The stiff suspension is great for spirited driving but poor on city roads. Thuds from bumps and potholes are pronounced, and the ride lacks the comfort expected in daily use. Still, it feels like a BMW from behind the wheel – even though its front-wheel drive. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Price and Verdict 7/10 A style statement with badge value, but lacking in substance. Upon launch, it is expected to be priced between Rs 50-52 lakh (ex-showroom). The biggest challenge for the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is convincing buyers there’s more to it than looks. Prices aren’t out yet, but it’s expected to cost around Rs 50 lakh-52 lakh, making it the entry point to the BMW brand. While it scores high on style, features and handling, it falls short on comfort, practicality and engine performance. That said, if you’re after design, tech, agility and the BMW badge, it still holds strong appeal.

    "description": "We at Autocar India have a habit of setting new Guinness World Records, and our latest achievement is the ‘Greatest Temperature Change Achieved by an Electric Production Car’. The record-setting journey – made in a Mercedes EQS SUV 450 4Matic and piloted by Autocar India’s Rahul Kakar – started in Ranao in Rajasthan, and ended in Khardung La, Ladakh. The record figure for temperature variation is 51.2°C. Ranao, situated on the outskirts of Jaiselmer, had an ambient temperature of 47.5°C, while the temperature in Khardung La, one of the world’s highest motorable passes, stood at a frigid -3.7°C. Hence, the record figure of 51.2°C was achieved. Reflecting on this monumental achievement, Autocar India Editor, Hormazd Sorabjee, remarked, “Climate change is real – we’re feeling it, living it, and there is no greater emergency confronting our planet today. This unique Guinness World Records Title, which spans extremes of temperature change, is meant to draw attention to the existential crisis we face. At the same time, it highlights the remarkable diversity of India – a country of geographic extremes where a temperature swing of over 50 degrees Celsius is actually possible. And it’s fitting that this record attempt was done in the all-electric EQS 450 SUV. Switching to electric mobility is a clear step in combating climate change, and the phenomenal range of the EQS 450 SUV gave us the confidence to conquer the remote heights of Ladakh without the added worry of range anxiety on this challenging and historic drive.” Rahul Kakar, the man who drove the EQS 450 SUV on this record-breaking journey , said, “Having achieved a Guinness World Records title not too long ago, I was well aware of the challenges that come with such attempts. However, this one was very different and presented unique challenges, the biggest one being the weather, unpredictable and often deviating from the forecast. Thankfully, this was done in the lap of luxury, with the Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 4MATIC SUV, which drove effortlessly regardless of outside conditions. Most importantly, its phenomenal range meant I never once had to worry about range anxiety.\" For all the details on setting the Guinness World Records title, check out Recording Extremes: a new Guinness World Records™ title with the Mercedes-Benz EQS 450 SUV.

This resulted in a lower 860mm seat, and while the suspension was still capable, purists were unhappy with the compromise. Now, they can get their hands on the full international-spec bike for just Rs 15,000 more. The main difference is that the suspension travel is now 230mm at both ends. As a result, seat height goes up by 35mm to 895mm, and ground clearance also increases from 253mm to 277mm. Beyond that, the bike is largely the same, and it continues with the Mitas EO7 Enduro Trail+ tyres. Kerb weight is unchanged at 177kg as well.    The KTM 390 Enduro R is based on the same platform as the KTM 390 Adventure, and it can be considered a stripped-down ADV more than a hardcore Enduro. The bike gets a smaller 9-litre fuel tank and a slim TFT display to go with its dirt-bike-inspired bodywork. However, the main chassis and the engine are the same as the 390 Adventure, with a 399cc single-cylinder engine that makes 46hp and 39Nm of torque.  You can read our first ride review of the India-spec KTM 390 Enduro R here, or click here to read the comparison review with its similarly priced rival, the Kawasaki KLX 230.  Also see: KTM 390 Adventure X with cruise control launched at Rs 3.03 lakh",

The duo’s aura of sublime simplicity is complemented by a monochromatic wardrobe, consisting of black suits, ties, fedora hats, and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. Even after dark, the Ray-Bans took what could be a plain, G-man appearance to the epitome of cool. For motorcycle riders, sunglasses aren’t just an expression of style. They can be essential for protecting your eyes from wind and debris, not to mention reducing glare and increasing visibility in challenging light situations. And yeah, they can also make you look cool, but not every pair of shades will make the cut on the open road.…",

And what a way to bow out The Bugatti W16 Mistral is the final outing for Bugatti’s W16 engine after 20 years in production.It's a fitting end for an engine that made its debut in the 2005 Veyron, back when the Volkswagen Group had its hand on the tiller and Ferdinand Piëch’s decadent hubris had him setting new standards and breaking records that nobody else would ever be inclined to approach.He wanted a car that was as easy to drive as a Volkswagen Golf, met or exceeded VW’s existing or newly created quality and durability standards and, at the same time, you could climb into at the start of one of the straights at VW’s Ehra-Lessien test track and be doing 253mph by the end of it.He and his boffins specified a W16 engine to do it. Four banks of four cylinders, eight litres in total, four turbochargers and a four- figure horsepower number when such things were unheard of at the time. The Veyron’s W16 made 1001 metric horsepower – 987bhp – and it only went north from there. Faster versions since have knocked off various round metric horsepower milestones to end up, here, with 1578bhp – a round 1600PS and the same as a Chiron Super Sport 300+.",

    "description": "Christoph penned the lights for both A6 e-tron and Q6 e-tron Lighting chief talks inspiration, Vorsprung durch Technik, and Audi's slimmest headlight yet Welcome to part three of our exclusive four-part interview series, where we’re looking to find out what Audi’s iconic slogan – Vorsprung durch Technik, or progress through technology – means on a more personal level to the people at the forefront of Audi design and engineering. Here we sit down with Christoph Häußinger, the mastermind behind the groundbreaking lighting design for the new all-electric Audi A6 e-tron and Audi Q6 e-tron. Also in the series: Exterior design extraordinaire Frank Lamberty; head of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics, Dr. Moni Islam; and interior designer Ramon Bäurle. Discover the all-electric Audi e-tron range Introduce yourself and what you do…My name is Christoph Häußinger and I'm a lighting designer at Audi. This means I'm responsible for creating front and rear exterior light designs. There are many steps in the process of lighting design. We start by creating the overall light graphic itself – how the light will look, a bit like a graphic designer. Then we have to find the right character for the car – sporty, sleek etc. Then we move on to the materials and the hardware. Then, finally, on the A6 e-tron in particular, we focused on creating the welcome scenarios, the animations, the digitalisation, which is something totally new. It’s a really interesting and challenging job. What’s your personal interpretation of Vorsprung durch Technik?My interpretation of Vorsprung durch Technik is never stop exploring. It's about being curious and always questioning what's next. Where do you find inspiration for your work? I think I find inspiration mostly in good product design, so in high-quality products. I'm really looking into it and try to find solutions to bring this in our cars. Also, I'm inspired by faces of people and of animals. The humans are always looking for faces. If you're looking somewhere, you always see faces. And this is the same with cars. Why is light, and lighting design, so important? This is a big question! I mean, without light there is no life. Humans have always been connected to light. Without fire, for example, we wouldn’t have evolved into what we are today. Light is a crucial part of our life. In terms of light design, it’s so important because it gives the car the right look. It underlines the character. As light designers, we’re always talking about the eyes of the car. How is the car looking at you? With lights, with the eyes of the car, you can fundamentally change how a car looks, so I think it’s very important. Light design has always been a core pillar of Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik ethos. Which models from Audi’s history stand out as milestones? For me, a standout car in terms of lighting was the Audi A8 from 2013. It was the first model where we integrated the Matrix function, and I think it’s the perfect example of how to combine technology and design. If you look at the headlight, it doesn’t even look like a light you’d find on a car. It was really important for us to find a new look, a new feeling for this new technology, and we did. I would also point out the third-generation Audi TT (2013). For me, this is a really iconic light graphic with its two vertical lines. It was a really sporty touch – perfect for the car. Light design and exterior design go hand in hand. How do the two teams work together to reach a common goal? It’s certainly a challenge! But it’s fun. First I’ll just walk around the car with the exterior designer when they’re developing the volumes and the outline of where the lamp will go, to get the essence of what the car is all about, what they’re trying to achieve. For example, with the A6 e-tron they wanted to extend the shoulder of the car all the way to the lights, so you think about how you can help achieve this goal with the light design. The Q6 e-tron is a very good example of this where we’ve stretched the lines of the car seamlessly to the headlight. It’s good fun working with the exterior designers. The Audi A6 e-tron treads new ground for lighting design and technology. Let’s start at the front – what are the highlights? For the Audi A6 e-tron, the main goal was to have a really, really slim headlight to give a truly focused and sporty look to the face of the car. To do that we took out some functions you’d usually find in the headlight, like the high and low beam bulbs, and put them lower down in the bumper and hidden by a kind of black mask. And that left us with just the daytime running lights and indicators where the headlight would usually be. We also wanted them to be horizontal rather than vertical to really show off the width of the car. The result is the slimmest, sleekest headlight design we’ve ever created at Audi. And then there’s the digital content, the welcome scenarios. The A6 e-tron and the Q6 e-tron represent the first time ever that the driver has full customisation over the lighting graphics at the front of the car. Through their smartphone or the MMI touchscreen system they can choose from a number of different lighting signatures which allow them to subtly change the character of the car, while still retaining that Audi look. But what was also really important for me with the A6 e-tron was how the lights look even when they’re switched off. As light designers, we’re always talking about light. When the lights turn on there’s always this 'Wow!' effect, but for me when you switch the car off it has the same importance. It still needs to have the same elegant, high-tech feeling. When the car is off and parked in a space, you need to be able to walk around the car and see all the little details, almost like jewellery. That’s my passion, creating the product, not just the light. And what about at the back? The rear of the A6 e-tron is really exciting. First you notice the big wraparound lightbar which is designed to make the car look wider and more elegant, but also futuristic. This slim, homogeneous red light gives this really high-tech and science fiction feel. And then if you look closer you can see the OLED 2.0 technology we’re using for the digitalisation of the rear lights. This technology was first used on the Q6 e-tron, but now it’s using more pixels and a higher resolution to create these incredibly vivid, fluid light graphics at the back. At Audi we always wanted to bring light into motion. We started with the swiping indicators, and now with this new technology the lights on the back of the A6 e-tron are always moving, always in motion. It’s something that’s never been seen before on other cars. It’s an amazing feature. Finally, and most importantly, we come to the safety features. Light has always been a safety topic, because you have to use the indicators to turn, see where you’re going, and show other people that you’re stopping. It’s always been about light communicating with other drivers. Now, the A6 e-tron takes that to the next level with the triangle warning signal at the back of the car. When you put the hazard lights on, warning triangles will appear in the rear lights to warn drivers behind you. Equally, if the car detects a crash in front of you it will activate the triangles to warn others. And they’ll also activate if the car behind gets too close. It’s really clever technology. Where do you think Vorsprung durch Technik will take Audi in the future? It’s hard to say exactly because so much can happen in the future! But what I can say is I’m incredibly excited and curious to see where Vorsprung durch Technik will take Audi next, and I know there’s a lot to come in terms of light design and light technology.
