    "description": "Few products have had as tumultuous a journey from concept to reality as the Simple One. Shown first in 2021 with a promise to go on sale in 2022, it eventually went on sale in mid-2023. Fast forward to 2025, and after 1,817 units sold (as per VAHAN data), Simple Energy has updated the One. Simple One updates for 2025 The main update is that it now has a claimed 248km IDC range, up from the original 212km. It has the same 5kWh battery capacity as before, and the company says this increase has been achieved via some electronic trickery and a more efficient drivetrain.  There was no way to test those numbers in our limited time with it, but what I can tell you is that in 45km of mixed riding in all four modes (Eco, Ride, Dash and Sonic), the battery dropped from full to 76 percent SOC. Simple One design, performance This was my first time seeing a Simple One in the flesh, and I thought it was a smashing-looking thing, even if its sharp and angular design is somewhat similar to the Ather 450’s. Quality, too, is at a pleasantly high level, and there are no flimsy plastics or uneven panel gaps. At 30 litres, the One doesn’t have the biggest boot in the segment, but its shape allows you to fit an ECE-certified full-face helmet inside comfortably.   And once you swing your leg over it, you’ll discover the One has the go to match the show. With 8.5kW and 72Nm of torque on tap, acceleration in any mode is peppy, and even in the lowest mode, it can climb flyovers without slowing down. Achieving and maintaining the claimed 105kph top speed is effortless in Dash and Sonic. However, acceleration from a standstill doesn’t feel as spirited as in the Warp mode on an Ather 450. Simple One areas of improvement The problem is that in both of the top two modes, the scooter surges forward for a second or two even once the accelerator is closed, which can put you in trouble, considering the strong performance. We reported this issue when we first rode the prototype in 2022, and it’s disappointing that it hasn’t been resolved. Simple says it is aware of it and is working on a solution, but I think this should have been ironed out before customer deliveries began.   While the scooter’s sporty design language may lead you to believe that it will be stiffly sprung, the suspension setup is rather plush, and the One is one of the more comfortable electric scooters I’ve experienced. However, at 136kg, its weight isn’t something that you can shake off, and what only compounds matters further is the tall (for a scooter) 796mm seat height.  Simple One price, verdict Currently, Simple Energy has only 10 showrooms operational. The company says it plans to scale up to 150 showrooms by March 2026 and bring in a generation two product (the one we rode was termed ‘version 1.5’) to bolster its portfolio. Ultimately, all of that is in the future, and Simple still has much to prove. Until Simple Energy scales up its dealer network and builds a good after-sales reputation, the Rs 1.66 lakh One and its more affordable sibling, the Rs 1.45 lakh Dot One, will remain niche offerings.    All prices ex-showroom, Bengaluru Also See: Simple Energy One prototype review: A simple answer?",

    "description": "Audi’s line of ICE-powered performance estates goes out with a bang If you had stepped out onto the spotlessly clean floor of Audi’s Bollinger Hofe production facility five years ago, the place would have been littered with Audi R8 supercars in various stages of construction. Had you done the same thing three years later, you’d have seen a blend of R8s and Audi’s then new electric supersaloon, the Audi E-tron GT. And today? Well, today the plant no longer rings to the wail of V10 engines firing up for the first time, because with the R8 now having retired, Audi’s most hand-labour-intensive production line is entirely for the E-tron GT, which rolls into life near-silently.However, for a short period in recent times, the E-tron GT was joined by another car at this small facility, which has always been reserved for Audi’s most revered creations. It’s a car that, like the R8, carries an enormous petrol engine, albeit one wooflier in nature than the supercar’s V10. We’re talking about the Audi RS6 Avant GT, which is limited to 660 examples worldwide and whose hand-finishing at the Bollinger Hofe plant is justified by its unique bodywork, requiring a level of finishing that the regular RS6 line can’t easily manage. This is also the most powerful combustion-engined production Audi there has ever been, shading even the last-gasp R8 GT. This car is, in many ways, a farewell to the fast, all-conquering Audi wagon with four-wheel drive and at least eight cylinders (there have been as many as V10s in the past). The RS6 GT is therefore both a statement piece and a lovingly wrought valedictory special that references one of Audi’s best-loved racing cars.What we will now discover is just how fast this rip-roaring family car really is, and how lucky those 660 owners should count themselves.",

    "description": "Thornley Kelham's 911 restomod is a hand-built masterpiece Bespoke restomod projects are all the rage today, and this is no great surprise. Over-familiarity will have led to a weary cynicism in many of us, but equally who among us, given the time and means, wouldn’t love to have a crack at creating our dream car? To set out with no commercial imperative and draft a grand vision, then obsess over the details such that the end result fitted our wants and needs like a glove? It’s fantasy stuff. What I hadn’t appreciated until recently was the kind of person you need to be to pull it off to convincing effect, even before you’ve pinned down a team of the calibre required for expert engineering and fabrication – the people who will slowly bring your vision to life. Most of us would be better served keeping the dream confined to a beer mat and chasing after ready-to-wear options from Ariel or Ferrari. It makes the 0.0001% of wonder-machines that do become a reality as world-class, from-the-ground-up commissions all the more tantalising. Projects like Thornley Kelham’s recent European RS. “Hal could walk into the prep shop, look at his car from a distance of 10 feet and tell you the sill line is two millimetres out,” says Simon Thornley, co-founder of what is certainly an elite but under-the-radar British restoration company. “And he’d be right. That was the scary thing.” Hal Walter is a retired Australian architect who spends half his time in the Alps. This partly explains why his commission took the form of a 911 restomod blending the spirit of a 1973 2.7-litre RS and the more recent 997-generation GT3 RS 4.0, which he also owns (of course he does). It was an ambitious concept, but Walter is a man for details – every last one of them. Shortly after Thornley Kelham agreed to take on the project, a near-40-page document arrived: the instruction manual. When we visited the firm’s premises last year to see and drive the 95%-finished European RS, Thornley produced a printout and dropped it onto a table. It landed with a pronounced slap. “This is about the fourth version,” he said. “We’re now on version 23.” The level of detail in this tome was exquisite, inspiring, just a little unnerving and perhaps understandable for a man with an architect’s mind and many, many hundreds of thousands of pounds on the line. Part prescriptive (one can’t help but admire the inclusion of gear ratios), it took more of a manifesto form elsewhere. The intake needs to wail like this, the chassis balance should feel like that and so on. The car will weigh such and such in full running order (start with an original 911 T chassis, please, rather than a commonly used 964 one, as it will save us 300kg). There was also the design, both inside and out. The showstopping aesthetics of the European RS, down to the split-level ducktail, are mostly Walter’s handiwork. It’s hard not to be impressed. “The guy is a bloody perfectionist. We were painting things to concours standard that you will never see,” said Thornley, who himself had a 2.7-litre RS for decades. He jokes about the hardest part of this mesmerising project being ‘the owner’ and is vindicated when his phone starts buzzing away during our chat. Guess who. But the truth is that he and business partner Wayne Kelham are as mad about the details as Walter, and this really is a multi-disciplinary business. It isn’t solely turning out modified old 911s, as shown by the magnificent, fully restored Lamborghini Miura in one of the workshops. Adjacent to it was a Bugatti Type 40, and an engine-building facility sits across the road where, among other jewels, fettled 300bhp Virgilio V6s are prepped before being dropped into Thornley Kelham’s hot-rod take on Lancia’s B20 GT Aurelia. The presence of English wheels warms the heart, so too the shell of a Citroën SM. The place is a toy box – one in which any project, no matter how whimsical, can fully materialise. It was thus well placed to deliver something on the level of the European RS. But listening to Thornley, I still couldn’t help wondering if the reality could live up to the expectation – to the painstaking planning in Walter’s paperwork and his huge emotional investment in the project. As it happens, when you’re this committed and enlist just the right people, magic unfolds. The car is a hand-built masterpiece, its delivery of 380bhp from 3.7 litres of flat six feeling utterly open-ended and the integration of 997 GT3-style linkages into a feather-light chassis giving the handling adjustability reminiscent of today’s 992 GT3, only dialled up. And the details. Good grief, they’re fabulous. I’d love to think I could’ve masterminded such a car, but in truth? Hmm.",

    "description": "You can often tell when a custom motorcycle has been built merely to gawk at, and when it’s been built to be ridden. This rowdy Harley Sportster flat tracker leaves little room for doubt. Inspired by the iconic Harley XR750, it hits all the right aesthetic notes, with a build spec tailored to daily abuse. It belongs to Romain Leclerc—a filmmaker based near Toulon on the French Riviera. As a teen, Romain rode BMX with a group of friends who called themselves ‘Les Pirates.’ Years later, the guys graduated from bicycles to motorcycles, riding and customizing them with the same irreverent energy that marked their BMX days. This Sportster is Romain’s second custom build, not counting the bikes that he uses for racing and track days.…",

    "description": "The thing about EVs is that you don’t tend to stray too far from a home charger – or, in my case, the office charger. The Mercedes EQE SUV, which was part of our long-term fleet for a few months, rarely left town. Other than a quick dash to Pune, it’s been pretty much city-bound, gently gliding over Mumbai’s clogged and bumpy roads. Most of the time, I’ve been behind the wheel, enjoying its smooth drive. On occasions when parking is a struggle, I’ve had to switch to being chauffeur-driven. Even then, I find myself preferring the front passenger seat because the rear seat, while spacious, doesn’t hit the mark in terms of comfort. The lack of underthigh support and a backrest that is a touch too upright seriously compromise the ultimate comfort you want and expect from a Merc. The other issue is that the nearly 3-metre-long wheelbase (and the absence of rear-wheel steering) makes manoeuvring through tight spots challenging – or so it seems at first. However, the light controls and surprisingly responsive nature of this 2.7-tonne electric SUV take much of the sting out of navigating confined spaces. The rear seat lacks Merc levels of comfort and plushness. It’s confined spaces I am happy to leave behind as I hit the Atal Setu and head to, yes, you guessed right, Mahabaleshwar. The drive to Mahabaleshwar is my go-to testing ground for cars. The mix of six-lane expressways, single-lane stretches, and the twisty ghat roads that lead to the hill station is a perfect workout for any car. The EQE SUV aced the first leg of this journey, sucking just 55 percent of the battery for the 190km drive (from the office) to Poladpur at the foot of the ghats. The efficiency translated to 4.7km/kWh, which is very impressive for such a big and heavy car. One of the reasons for this remarkable efficiency is the EQE SUV’s aerodynamics. With a low drag coefficient (Cd) of just 0.26, the EQE SUV slices through the air far more efficiently than most vehicles in its class. Mercedes’ engineers have focused heavily on reducing drag, and it shows – not just in the numbers but in the car’s rounded, less traditional SUV-like design. Mumbai-Mahab run drained battery’s SOC to 22 percent. This aerodynamic philosophy mirrors what we experienced with the EQS sedan, which played a crucial role in our Guinness World Records title for the longest distance travelled on a single charge. While the EQE SUV’s shape has put off traditionalists looking for a boxy, rugged silhouette – like its ICE-equivalent GLE – it’s hard to argue with the results when you’re covering long distances with minimal energy consumption. With enough range in my pocket, or rather the battery, I threw range anxiety out of the window for the last 40km up the Ambenali ghat, which, as always, was a blast. The tarmac, which is ripped apart after every monsoon, was in surprisingly good shape this year. Mahabaleshwar to Mumbai run drained battery’s SOC to 43 percent. The colossal 858Nm of instant torque from dual electric motors and their near-silent operation made for an exhilarating drive. The EQE SUV’s ride quality is a bit of a mixed bag. On NH66, it managed the countless speed bumps with aplomb, flitting over them in a way that made the journey incredibly comfortable. However, at speed, the suspension felt a bit floaty and things didn’t improve much on the Ambenali ghat. Even in its stiffest setting, Sport, the suspension couldn’t quite rein in the car’s body movements. The EQE SUV felt a bit roly-poly leaning into corners. While it’s not a deal breaker for daily use, spirited drivers will find this soft setup a bit disappointing. Gravity and a heavy right foot took their toll on the range, which plummeted by the time I reached the top. Still, I arrived in Mahabaleshwar with a decent buffer of 22 percent charge remaining. Considering I completed the drive in a brisk four hours flat, that’s pretty efficient. Under normal conditions, a leisurely highway cruise with no significant elevation changes would translate to a real-world range of around 400km. The HUD has crystal-clear graphics and is unobtrusive. To put the effect of gravity or an uphill climb into perspective, the drive back on the same route, covering the same distance in the same time, resulted in a much healthier 42 percent charge remaining! No Mahabaleshwar trip of mine is complete without the boot packed to the brim. Whether it’s weekend luggage, shifting books to stock my library in the hills, or a couple of crates of strawberries on the way back, the EQE SUV’s 520-litre boot proved adequate, despite the spare tyre sitting on the flat and wide loading area eating into space. Light-coloured trim gets dirty very easily. Charging? Always tricky when you’re out of town. The public charger at the Taj in Mahabaleshwar, which I had planned to use, was out of order – an all-too-common issue in India’s fledgling EV ecosystem. As a result, I relied on my home 3kW slow charger, which, though reliable, is painfully slow and took over a day to top up the large 90.6kWh battery. Living with the EQE SUV, it’s hard not to be wowed by the cabin. The materials, the design, and the sheer tech on offer make it feel truly special. The Hyperscreen, which stretches across the dashboard, is the star of the show. Not only is it incredibly functional, but it also transforms the cabin into a futuristic lounge, especially at night when the ambient lighting adds to the drama. The Hyperscreen with large icons is easy to read and use. These few months with the EQE SUV gave me a nice taste of the future of electric luxury.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/maserati-grecale-review-india-friendly-maserati-434390#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Think Maserati, and you’d probably picture a seductive, low-slung sports car or perhaps a sharply suited sedan. The Maserati featured here is of a very different type, shape and form. This is the Grecale, and by virtue of being an SUV, it’s the most India-friendly Maserati you can buy. Maserati Grecale exterior design The Grecale is Maserati’s second SUV after the Levante, which is now in its run-out phase, with production having stopped earlier this year. The Grecale is half a size smaller than the Levante, and in dimensions, it slots in between a Porsche Macan and Cayenne. The Grecale’s job is to fly the Italian flag in a segment crowded by German alternatives, and design is the differentiator. The classic Maserati elements are all there – low-set concave grille, a trio of vents at the sides, the distinctive cut to the glass house and the trident logo on the D-pillar. The Grecale is undoubtedly sporty in its stance and, like the latest Maseratis, looks better in person than it does on screen. To my eyes, though, larger headlights would have given the Grecale a stronger face. Quad exhausts establish the Grecale as something serious at the back. Not to get geeky, but the boomerang shape of the rear running lights and ridge on the bumpers are a visual link to the 3200 GT’s iconic LED lights. All in all, the Grecale looks exotic, and that’s half the job done. Maserati Grecale interior and features Grecale’s interior neatly blends a new-age vibe with an old-world feel. The Grecale is very inviting inside, too, and it’s where old-school Italian craftsmanship meets new-age tech. There’s a generous use of leather all throughout the cabin, and the pattern stitched on the dashboard is a particularly rich touch. In fact, there’s a warmth to the Grecale’s cabin that you wouldn’t get in a Porsche. I’m not entirely sold on the classic analogue clock atop the dash making way for a digital one, but you can shuffle between three clock faces or have the screen display either a compass or a G-meter or brake and throttle measure. Touchscreen climate control is (relatively) easy to use There are three other screens – of course, large in size. The 12.3-inch IP is neat, while the 12.3-inch centre touchscreen is slick to respond, though it has lots to display, so the menus take some getting used to. There’s another 8.8-inch touchscreen lower down for the climate control system, among other functions. Touchscreens for climate control are not an ideal solution, but at least the Maserati’s is among the best of the kind: swipe left or right anywhere on the screen to control blower speed, swipe up or down to adjust the temperature. In effect, you don’t need to take your eyes off the road to aim at a specific area. The Grecale does have its quirks. For instance, while the steering is home to a lot of buttons, including the start-stop and drive mode selector, you won’t find any audio or volume buttons here. That’s because they’re hidden from view, behind the steering spokes. Then, there’s no gear lever at the centre console or Mercedes-like gear stalk behind the steering wheel either. Rather, the Grecale has buttons on the dash for park, reverse, neutral and drive, with dagger-sized paddles mounted on the steering column for gear selection. And when it’s time to exit the car, you’ll realise that there’s no lever to pull; a button does the job. In terms of features, the Grecale gets quite a bit, including a panoramic sunroof, front seat heating and cooling, a head-up display, a 360-degree camera, and three-zone climate control, with many of these being paid options. There’s plenty of kneeroom, but headroom is limited, and the backrest is a tad upright. The Grecale is not an SUV we’d wholeheartedly recommend for chauffeur-driven buyers. The kneeroom is comfortable for six-footers, but the headroom is limited, and the backrest adjust is also missed. Maserati has packaged in a fold-down centre armrest with two cup holders as well as storage for a mobile phone, and rear-seat passengers get a dedicated zone for the climate control system. There’s a very usable 535 litres of luggage space behind the rear seats, and flat-fold seats mean the space can be enhanced further. Sadly, there’s no spare tyre. All you get is a puncture-repair kit. Maserati Grecale performance and powertrain The Grecale is available in three flavours. There’s the range-topping GrecaleTrofeo with the 530hp Nettuno 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 petrol engine from the MC20. The Grecale Modena and this Grecale GT aren’t quite as special under the hood. A 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine is the source of power, but it packs in mild-hybrid tech to assist the engine at full load, and there’s also an electric compressor to help bottom-end performance. The numbers sure are promising: 330hp on the Modena and 300hp on this GT. This engine might not be large in absolute terms, but it’s got the soul of a larger engine. It’s got more to give low down in the rev band than you’d expect, and it doesn’t necessarily feel turbocharged as you go further up the rev range. The Grecale always feels light on its feet and very likeable. Find the right road, press down hard on the accelerator, and the Grecale will also rev very urgently to 6,000rpm. The 5.6-second 0-100kph time means that even in this mildest of guises, the Grecale is fast. Top speed is limited to 240kph. The Grecale sends power to all four wheels via ZF’s 8-speed gearbox. You’ll be very tempted to use the feelsome paddle shifters, but the gearbox isn’t lightning-quick in its responses and won’t grant you a high rpm downshift when you really want it. It’s best to leave the gearbox to its own devices. Maserati Grecale handling and ride quality The build of speed is backed up by a nice soundtrack. The engine sounds sweet, and the exhaust note is really wholesome. There is a buzzkill, though, and that’s the speed-warning buzzer. The other thing? The Grecale is quite muted inside and actually sounds better and louder when it passes by you. For the full sound effect, you’ll need to dial things up to Sport. There’s also a Sport setting for the suspension and steering that brings in a bit more weight and makes the Grecale feel pointier. The Grecale really comes into its own on a winding road. There’s a crispness to the whole setup; the steering is light but precise, and grip levels are good throughout. The Grecale really is up there with a Porsche Macan in handling, and that is very high praise. I’m not sure how many buyers will give handling much weightage, but the Grecale does comfort well, too. No, it’s not pillowy soft, and there is a firmness to the setup, but you won’t be chucked about even on the worst of patches. And remember I said it’s the most India-friendly Maserati? Speed breakers are the nemesis of low-slung Maseratis. Thankfully, this is not a problem for the Grecale as it glides over bumps without the underbody making ground contact. The Grecale GT packs in a few advanced driver-assistance systems, and they worked well enough on wide, well-marked roads on our route. Maserati Grecale price and verdict That’s a quick taste of the Maserati Grecale. It’s fast, comfy and stylish enough to stand out in a crowd of luxury SUVs. The thing is, the Grecale is not the largest SUV by size or engine capacity, and for the money Maserati wants for one, it’s sure to be a sticky point. Prices start at Rs 1.31 crore (ex-showroom) for this Grecale GT, which makes it more expensive than a Macan, though the Porsche is older and makes less power in base spec, too. At the top end, the Rs 2.05 crore GrecaleTrofeo does have the performance to hold its own amongst the super SUV heavyweights. The Grecale doesn’t quite make a watertight case for itself, and your decision to buy one would be one of heart over head. Then again, isn’t that true for all Italian exotics?

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/industry/tata-motors-announces-high-speed-ev-charger-network-400000-ev-chargers-by-2027-434566#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+News+feed",
    "description": "Tata Motors has announced the rollout of Tata.ev Mega Charger network for high-speed electric vehicle charging. Currently, the network is being established in partnership with four charging point operators (CPOs): Tata Power, Zeon, Charge Zone and Statiq, and the company says it will have 500 such outlets operational within the next 12 months. Each Mega Charger location will be able to deliver a combined 120kW via a single four-gun charger or two 60kW two-gun chargers. Tata Motors says the network is open to electric vehicles from all brands, but Tata EVs would get priority access and up to 25 percent lower tariff. Mega Chargers will have amenities like restrooms and restaurants and, in select locations, round-the-clock manned support, too. Irrespective of the partner operator, there is also a single toll-free number for customers to get 24x7 support. Plus, there will be a single payment app, a unified RFID device-based payment option and integration within Tata Motors’ existing iRA.ev app.  Tata.ev Zeon fast chargers. While the Tata.ev Mega Chargers are essentially being setup and operated by external CPOs, Tata Motors’ chief strategy officer, Balaje Rajan, told Autocar India that the company has “very clear service level agreements in place with each of the operators to ensure that the right kind of service level is provided”. To that end, for now, it has only tied up with four providers who have met all the criteria, he added. Tata Motors Open Collaboration Initiative In 2023, Tata Motors launched its ‘Open Collaboration’ framework, under which it partnered with CPOs and Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to expand the charging infrastructure. The company has now announced the ‘Open Collaboration 2.0’ programme with an aim to more than double the number of charging points to over 4,00,000 within the next two years; this includes 30,000 public chargers, with home chargers and community charging outlets accounting for the rest. Tata.ev Statiq fast chargers. The Mega Chargers will primarily be located within cities and also include key highways. Responding to a question from Autocar, the company’s managing director, Shailesh Chandra, said the city focus is mainly “to create visibility for an electric vehicle charging network, as our surveys show that those who do not consider EVs think that public chargers are too few.” He added that this is also because so many chargers today are within homes and dealerships, and each of these Mega Charger locations would also feature prominent Tata.ev Mega Charger branding. Also in the pipeline is a UPI-based payment for community charging using any UPI app and doorstep charging via a mobile charging van. Tata.ev verified chargers The Tata.ev Chargezone. In addition to its Mega Changer network, Tata Motors will introduce a ‘Tata.ev Verified Charger’ rating for CPOs in its iRA app. The score will be on a 5-point scale, where customers will rate the charger on four counts: the environment, accessibility, working condition and compatibility score with Tata EVs. Only those locations with a 4-star and above rating would secure the ‘.ev verified’ mark. While the ‘.ev verified’ mark would be crowd-sourced, Rajan said the company has also run a thorough audit to identify ‘.ev verified’ locations and will keep the checklist open for third parties to audit and verify these ratings.

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",

    "title": "Is This The New Le Mans Golden Age We've Been Waiting For?",
    "link": "",
    "description": "History Repeating: A New Golden Age for Le Mans Shines Brighter Than Ever The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the world’s most famous sports car race, and since its inaugural edition in 1923, the legendary event has seen fluctuating levels of manufacturer competition. Today, however, we are witnessing an unprecedented resurgence, as three iconic marques—each with a rich legacy of success—are set to join the already stacked grid of Alpine, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota in the battle for overall victory. Aston Martin will debut its radical Valkyrie hypercar this year, while Genesis—the luxury division of Hyundai—will enter the fray in 2026, embarking on a new motorsport chapter. Meanwhile, Ford recently announced a factory-backed return in 2027, and insiders suggest that McLaren is preparing to follow suit. A joint McLaren-Ford entry, reminiscent of their final Formula 1 season together in 1993 with Ayrton Senna, was initially explored but ultimately abandoned. However, McLaren’s announcement of a long-awaited return could be perfectly timed for the 30th anniversary of its stunning 1995 Le Mans victory. Watch this space! Aston Martin: A Lone Overall Victory, But a Storied Le Mans History Aston Martin returns to Le Mans with unfinished business. The British marque’s only overall win came in 1959, when Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori piloted a DBR1/300 to victory in a grueling race of attrition. Shelby, battling dysentery and carrying a nitroglycerin capsule under his tongue for heart issues, and Salvadori, who drove for 14 hours despite suffering from the flu, emerged victorious ahead of the sister Aston Martin of Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. Ferrari finished third, while Porsche endured its worst-ever showing, with all its cars failing to finish. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, running nearly every edition until it shifted focus to a less-than-successful Formula 1 campaign. However, it found further glory in GT racing, winning the GT1 class in 2007 and 2008 with the DBR9, famously defeating Corvette in fierce head-to-head battles. The brand's most thrilling modern Le Mans moment came in 2017, when its Vantage GTE snatched victory from a faltering Corvette C7.R in the race’s dying minutes. Now, in 2025, Aston Martin steps back into the top class with the V12-powered Valkyrie—a road-going hypercar developed in collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamicist genius Adrian Newey. Among its fiercest rivals? Ferrari, winners of the past two Le Mans editions with the 499P hypercar, and Porsche, the reigning World Endurance champions with a factory-backed effort led by motorsport legend Roger Penske. Ford: Iconic GT40 Dominance and a Triumphant Return Ford’s Le Mans legacy was immortalized in the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari, which dramatized Henry Ford II’s personal vendetta against Enzo Ferrari after a failed acquisition deal. Determined to exact revenge, Ford assembled an all-star team led by Carroll Shelby (yes, the ’59 winner with Aston, who was now focused on running the cars) and star driver Ken Miles, and together they steered the GT40 into a race-winning machine. In 1966, Ford famously secured a 1-2-3 sweep, though a controversial staged finish saw Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon take the victory over the Miles/Denny Hulme entry. Tragically, Miles was killed testing the car’s successor (The ‘J-Car’ which became the GT40 MkIV) but his legacy was assured. The GT40’s dominance continued, with Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt winning in 1967—an event best remembered for Gurney’s spontaneous invention of the champagne-spraying podium celebration. The Gulf-liveried GT40 of Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi triumphed in 1968, followed by Jacky Ickx’s legendary 1969 victory, where he deliberately walked to his car at the start in protest of the traditional sprint start, only to deliver a masterclass in racecraft by winning the race by a mere 120 meters. Ford returned to Le Mans in 2016, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its historic first victory by winning the GTE-Pro class with the modern GT, in a program managed by Chip Ganassi Racing. McLaren: The Shock 1995 Victory That Defined Its Hypercar Legacy This June is McLaren’s 30th anniversary of its jaw-dropping victory in 1995, when its F1 GTR won on debut in dramatic fashion. In tasting a sweet victory the Woking-based brand, which was better-known for its Formula 1 success, scored four of the top five positions, with only the second-placed Courage C34 prototype, that included racing legends Mario Andretti and Bob Wollek, putting up a fight. The destiny of the race win was transformed in the closing stages, as the race-leading Harrods McLaren, run by David Price, suffered gear selection problems. This writer just happened to be in pits with two hours to go when Wallace alighted and handed over to Derek Bell, and I only realized something was amiss when he insisted on briefing Bell at length before Derek climbed in, delaying the car’s departure. When it was eventually released, instinct told me to tail Andy into the garage (a journalist’s life was far easier in those days!) where he exclaimed to Price “It’s f*cked, Dave! The gearbox is completely f*cked! I’ve told Derek to leave it in sixth”. This led to a lot more swearing from Price, with whom I developed a warm friendship in years to come but, on that day, I was one of many in the vicinity who was told in no uncertain terms where to go, as he vented the frustration of losing a Le Mans victory in such cruel circumstances. That handed victory to the Lanzante-run Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing team’s lineup of JJ Lehto (who starred in wet conditions in the night), Yannick Dalmas \u0026 Masanori Sekiya. That team had solved the McLaren’s delicate gear linkage issue, which affected many of its entries, by repeatedly spraying it with WD40 at each pitstop. That helped it to win by a lap. While that remains McLaren’s sole success at Le Mans, its modern-day road cars, like the P1 and recently-launched W1, take huge inspiration from the endurance racing heritage established by the F1 GTR. The Future of Le Mans’ Golden Era Success at Le Mans cements a manufacturer’s place in motorsport history and leaves a lasting imprint on its brand identity. The race’s influence extends beyond the track, shaping the development of the world’s most celebrated hypercars. No wonder that so many marques are signing up for this current golden age of sports car racing. Continue...",
