    "description": "This Maserati 450S re-creation is the second of two examples commissioned by the seller in honor of his late father, who collected and raced original Maserati race cars over several decades. Constructed by The English Wheel Company in Argentina between 2017 to 2021, the car features a steel oval-tube-based space frame wrapped in aluminum coachwork that was hand-formed over a wire-form buck and is finished in red. Power is provided by a 4.9-liter Maserati quad-cam V8 that breathes through triple Weber 42 DCNF carburetors and is mated to a Tremec five-speed manual transmission. Additional features include a 3.31:1 aluminum-case differential, finned aluminum hydraulic drum brakes with Wilwood dual master cylinders, coil-sprung independent front suspension with houdaille lever arm shocks, a De Dion rear axle, 16” Borrani-style wire wheels, electronic ignition, electric cooling fans, riveted aluminum fuel and oil tanks, aluminum bucket seats trimmed in red leather, and a custom-made wood-rimmed steering wheel that is said to replicate a wheel given to the seller’s father by Juan Manual Fangio. In 2024, the car was selected to be featured at the San Marino Classic and the Macchinissima II show in Southern California. This 450S re-creation is now offered by the seller on behalf of its current owner with photos from its build and a clean California title describing it as a 1967 Maserati.",

    "description": "Here are two modern retro motorcycles that carry a British badge and a sizeable chunk of motorcycling history behind their names. At first glance, these two bikes seem relatively identical since they have similar designs, performance, engine capacity, weight and price. However, the difference is more apparent when these two are ridden back to back. BSA’s Gold Star is the new kid on the block and has no direct rival apart from Royal Enfield’s Interceptor 650. Both these motorcycles approach the same goal in a different manner, which delivers a very different riding experience overall. We’re here to tell you what those differences are and how these two stack up in the real world. Flamboyance \u0026 Flair Given their retro credentials, both motorcycles take a rather minimalist approach to their throwback aesthetics. There is abundant use of chrome, and while looks are subjective, I found myself gravitating a little more towards the Gold Star. Both motorcycles get a round headlamp, flat seats and a well-shaped fuel tank. They are available in multiple colours, depending on which the price can vary. Classy retro dials fit the aesthetic, but the tiny screens are hard to read. The feature list, too, is relatively minimal, and while the Interceptor 650 now gets an LED headlamp that outperforms the simple halogen setup on the Gold Star, BSA’s approach seems a tad more authentic, given the overall aesthetic. On the flip side, both motorcycles get analogue-styled dials, but I quite like the amber backlight on the Gold Star. However, there is no denying that the Interceptor 650’s dials are more readable and that the LCD screen has better visibility. The Gold Star is equipped with a Type-A and Type-C charging socket, while the Interceptor 650 gets a USB port that’s hidden away. Royal Enfield has also equipped the Interceptor with a set of adjustable levers – a welcome addition. While the 650 has more expensive-feeling switchgear with aluminium housings, the Gold Star’s conventional switches are more straightforward to use. In terms of build quality, both motorcycles lack the premium touch and feel like they’re built on a budget. That said, the Gold Star is by far the best offering to come out of Classic Legends’ stable despite having areas that could use improvement. Early signs of rust and  a loose-fitting side panel did seem concerning, but the brand says it is working on improving its overall quality. The Interceptor 650, too, has some signs of rust, but overall, it feels like the better-built machine in this comparison. Interceptor’s clocks are simpler, but the larger digital display is more legible. It is worth mentioning that the Gold Star does not come with a main stand as standard, and BSA – for now – doesn’t offer one as an accessory either. RE’s footpeg placement is a well-known issue. The Interceptor 650 is not only equipped with a main stand but also has a higher ground clearance. My issue with this RE is with its footpegs, which tend to jut out and come in the way while you ‘walk’ the motorcycle in traffic. While this issue is less bothersome for taller riders, shorter ones will find it more tedious. In the saddle The Gold Star’s riding position feels more natural and less aggressive in comparison. You get a slightly more upright seating posture and a more relaxed footpeg position. Coupled with a soft seat and a 780mm seat height, this is more approachable for shorter riders, but someone over 6 feet may find the leg space to be a bit cramped. Rishaad did wish for a slightly firmer seat, which is an easy fix in comparison to the Interceptor 650’s shortcomings. Gold Star has a wider seat with softer padding. Royal Enfield has built the Interceptor 650 with slightly more sportier ergonomics. It’s noticeable from the moment you swing your leg over its taller and narrower seat, and you’ll notice a more forward lean as you reach for the handlebar. Its footpegs, too, are slightly higher, and the narrow seat does rob it of some comfort as it puts more pressure on your tail bones and causes saddle soreness sooner than you’d expect. Royal Enfield does sell a more comfortable accessory, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem – only makes it slightly more bearable. Seat is well cushioned but uncomfortably narrow. Take aim, fire! The BSA Gold Star’s single-cylinder engine is one of the largest in its class and traces its roots back to the Rotax engine used in the BMW Funduro F650. This motor packs a healthy low- to mid-range performance, builds power from as low as 2,500rpm, and does so linearly. Despite the single-cylinder unit, BSA has done a commendable job of keeping the vibrations in check. Though it is short on one gear, the Gold Star’s engine and gearbox combination work well in tandem and will rarely ever leave you wanting that extra gear. That said, I have a few gripes with this motor, starting with its low-speed throttle response, which can sometimes feel too snatchy. We faced low-speed stalling issues with both motorcycles, but the Gold Star stalled more frequently. Underdamped rear shocks are the main complaint. The Interceptor 650, on the other hand, felt a lot smoother thanks to its extra cylinder and had a more pleasant sound to its exhaust. RE’s 650cc motor will happily cruise in higher gears at lower speeds, and the tractable motor will even reward you with a soothing note each time you downshift, but it is no match for the BSA’s mid-range punch. It felt like the more engaging motor, regardless of the speed or riding style I took up. Our numbers reveal that the Gold Star is the quicker motorcycle of the two. Not only did the Gold Star have better acceleration figures, but it also showcased quicker in-gear acceleration. It is also worth noting that we tested the BSA in the wet, which means we could expect even better numbers with dry tarmac. Interceptor’s suspension setup does a better job. Fuel economy is where the Interceptor 650 shines with a larger fuel tank, longer range and better city and highway efficiency. Its engine also handles high-speed touring better, with a calmer demeanour at higher RPMs. However, in city traffic, the BSA is more accessible to ride due to its more relaxed riding position and lighter clutch. Neither engine had a heating issue in bumper-to-bumper traffic and kept their cool in tight jams.  It’s about to get bumpy   In terms of weight, both motorcycles have a mere 5kg variance, but the difference feels higher, and the Interceptor comes across as a heavier, more cumbersome machine. The Gold Star is nimble at low speeds and showcases capable handling around flat, well-paved corners. However, its underdamped rear suspension is its biggest flaw and renders the ride and handling a bit too wallowy around most bumpy roads. It can take getting used to, but it does hamper the overall day-to-day experience with this motorcycle. On the flip side, the Gold Star’s Pirelli tyres and Brembo brakes do a fantastic job of providing stopping power, and the lever packs a decent amount of feedback. All in all, the bike rides well, but it deserves better rear suspension.  RE’s brakes and tyres aren’t as good as the BSA’s. While not exceptional, the Interceptor 650’s suspension has been improved over time and feels more balanced than the BSA’s. However, its brakes and tyres could use some improvement. Regarding handling, the Interceptor feels more capable with higher lean angles, but it takes more work to manage at low speeds in heavy traffic. BSA’s fit and finish can be improved. Old but gold Price isn’t likely to be the deciding factor, as both bikes are similarly priced. The actual choice comes down to the experience you’re looking for. The BSA Gold Star offers a more authentic retro experience with a delightful torque-driven engine. It’s more comfortable, easier to manage in the city, and can be fun around well-paved corners. Although it falls short on one cylinder and the lower refinement that comes with it, it makes up for it with its engaging power delivery and solid braking performance. It is our choice when it comes to a modern, classic riding experience. However, Classic Legends must prove its long-term reliability. And while the quality levels on its bikes have improved over time, there is still some way to go. BSA’s brake and tyre combo works surprisingly well. The Royal Enfield has a gem of an engine, and if you want a twin-cylinder experience, it has to be the RE. What also works in its favour is RE’s extensive service network and its vast accessory list. So, while we enjoyed riding the BSA more, the Interceptor 650 might be the safer bet for some people. Also See: BSA Gold Star 650 vs Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 comparison video",

    "description": "It’s been nearly a year since I got my hands on RS Taichi’s waterproof backpack, which is available in five colours and a unique Resident Evil edition. I’ve gone for the plain black shade due to its stealthy look and was quite eager to see just how usable this bag would be during monsoon. The WP backpack’s construction mainly comprises polyester and thermoplastic polyurethane. The bag consists of a primary 25-litre waterproof compartment, a smaller compartment located near the primary compartment’s opening and an external quick-access pocket that isn’t waterproof. Main compartment holds 25L. The bag uses a roll-up top system to seal the main compartment and can be adjusted based on how full it gets. It’s easy to use and even includes a Velcro strap to keep it tightly sealed. Its 25-litre storage is a boon for when I’m travelling, and over time, I’ve fit huge items in this compartment, including Rishaad’s fully packed Kriega R25 backpack! Secondary compartment is handy storage for small items The secondary compartment is only water-resistant, even though it uses the same opening as the main compartment. It can be used for smaller items, such as a pair of gloves, balaclavas and cleaning cloths. The third external pocket is mainly designed for items you’d like to keep handy that aren’t fazed by the rain, like a set of keys. Outer pocket is not waterproof. This bag gets a chest harness and a waist belt; both of these can be further adjusted to your size and do a good job of preventing the straps from slipping off the shoulders and distributing luggage weight evenly, especially when on the bike. Chest harness divides the load and provides a better fit. The overall fit, finish and feel of this bag are premium, and it feels built to last. However, after all this time, I did lose the rubberised end on the zipper pull tab located on the external pocket. Honestly, this is quite a minor issue and can be easily replaced. I’ve had absolutely no complaints with this bag otherwise. It’s been quite handy and dependable through my daily commute during peak Mumbai monsoon. Waist harness helps keep the bag secure while riding. Given that this bag is waterproof, you are prone to wearing it outside your protective rain gear, which can make it susceptible to dirt and grime being flung on it by the rear wheel. In such cases, a quick wipe-down with a wet cloth helps, and fortunately, the bag doesn’t stain permanently. This bag is currently available on special order at 6kiom.com and will cost approximately Rs 15,000. Velcro strap help seat the two main compartments well. I managed to buy it for far less overseas, and you may also have to wait anywhere from one to four months for it to be delivered. Just like most imported products, the RS Taichi WP backpack comes at a price, but it gives you good quality and performance in return. Also see: Ixon Dirt Air gloves review",

    "description": "With the introduction of this CNG version, the Tata Nexon becomes the first car in India to be offered with four fuel options – petrol, diesel, CNG and electric. It’s also the first CNG to use a turbocharged engine and come with a 6-speed manual ’box. Here’s what it’s like to drive. Tata Nexon CNG: exterior and interior Cosmetically, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the Nexon CNG apart from the rest of the ICE range. The only tell is the ‘i-CNG’ badge on the bootlid and the CNG stickers in the front and rear windshield. Other than that, it retains the standard Nexon’s edgy styling with the same alloy wheel design and LED lighting elements. The Creative Ocean and white dual-tone paint scheme you see here also makes it stand out. Save for the iCNG badge, its exterior is identical to the rest of the ICE Nexon range. Inside, too, the changes are minimal but there are some noticeable ones. For starters, this variant – Persona in Tata speak – gets all-black upholstery with blue stitching on the seats.The trim piece on the dash is also slightly different. There’s a CNG button on the centre console that lets you switch between fuels on the fly, there are CNG-specific graphics in the digital instrument cluster that show you the usage split between petrol and CNG modes, and a CNG-only trip meter. The rotary knob for the drive modes – just behind the gear lever – has also been done away with and it’s replaced by a small cubby that can hold small items like the key fob. Perhaps, Tata could have used this opportunity to give the Nexon at least one proper cup holder; it continues to get them inside the glove box. The front seats are sufficiently large and supportive, and it’s easy to find an ideal driving position. At the back, there’s enough room to sit three passengers in relative comfort and it’s nice to see that the panoramic sunroof hasn’t eaten into the headroom. Boot space is down by 21 litres compared to the petrol Nexon, at 321 litres. The Nexon uses Tata’s innovative twin cylinder tech, which means that you don’t lose out on proper usable boot space or a spare wheel. The two CNG tanks, which have a capacity of 60 litres, are placed below the boot floor while the spare wheel is mounted under the car. Boot space has reduced by 61 litres over the standard Nexon to 321 litres (measured from floor to roof), but you can still fit in a couple of suitcases and soft bags. The space saver spare wheel, meanwhile, can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor and it's a relatively fuss-free affair. Tata Nexon CNG features and safety Tata was the first manufacturer to offer a CNG even on top-end variants of the Tiago and Tigor, and the Nexon is no different. The Nexon CNG is available in four trim levels, so buyers can opt for the lower running costs of the CNG without having to compromise on features.  The Fearless + PS DT variant you see here is loaded with equipment,with the headlining feature, quite literally, being the panoramic sunroof.This has debuted on the CNG and we expect it to trickle down to the petrol and diesel versions soon. Other features include leatherette upholstery,ventilated front seats (not electrically adjustable), two 10.25-inch screens for the infotainment and instrument cluster, auto climate control, auto headlamps and wipers, a wireless phone charger, and a superb-sounding JBL audio system. But there are some glitches with the screens that need to be ironed out. Rear seat is spacious and it's nice that the panoramic sunroof hasn't compromised headroom. Safety kit like six airbags and ESP are standard on all variants, with the top-spec variant getting a crisp and high-res 360-degree camera, a tyre pressure monitor, front parking sensors and an auto-dimming IRVM. It also received a 5-star safety rating from Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. There are some CNG-specific safety features that are a part of the package, too: a fire extinguisher, the engine won’t start if the fuel filler flap is open, and it’ll also cut-off CNG supply and release the gas into the atmosphere if it detects a leak in the system. Spare is mounted under the car and can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor. Tata Nexon CNG engine and gearbox Powering the Nexon CNG is the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbocharged engine as the petrol Nexon, but it makes 100hp and 170Nm –while the torque is the same, it is 20hp down over the petrol version.However,the torque band is less – it is only available for 1000rpm, unlike the petrol’s 2,500rpm. It comes only with a 6-speed manual gearbox, but Tata could offer an AMT variant later. Thanks to the single ECU that this employs, it can be started up directly in CNG mode, which helps conserve that little extra bit of petrol at startup. There is some noticeable noise and vibration from the engine at idle, but it does smoothen out on the move. Rev it hard though, and the noise does get intrusive inside. Response off the line is good, both in petrol and CNG, and it’s quite eager to respond to part throttle inputs, too. The engine revs freely, but there are some inconsistencies in the power band. Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm. 1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm. There is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect. The CNG doesn’t make it feel breathless or strained, which means you’ll be happy to let it run in that mode most of the time. the ability to switch between petrol and CNG on the fly makes the entire experience seamless, butthere are no drive modes. The 6-speed manual gearbox has well-defined gates, but the throws are long and the shift action isn’t the most pleasing. What also doesn’t help matters is the snappy nature of the clutch, so you’ll have to get used to its modulation for a smoother drive.  It gets two fuel guages and CNG-specific graphics in the instrument cluster. Tata Nexon CNG performance and fuel efficiency What’s impressive though is the performance, as can be seen in the numbers. In petrol mode, it does the 0-100kph sprint in 13.97s, which is less than a second quicker than the CNG mode. What’s interesting, though, is that it's quicker to 60kph in CNG. There’s a prominent gap in the in-gear acceleration, though, with it being quicker in petrol in both the 20-80kph and 40-100kph runs. Tata Nexon CNG: performancePetrol modeCNG mode0-20kph1.87s1.72s0-40kph3.92s3.37s0-60kph6.55s6.29s0-80kph9.57s10.44s0-100kph13.97s14.69s20-80kph (in 3rd gear)11.21s12.58s40-100kph (in 4th gear)15.53s16.11sBraking (80-0kph)26.25m, 2.66s26.25m, 2.66s Tata claims an ARAI-rated efficiency figure of 24km/kg, but expect real-world figures to be lower. While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations. Tata Nexon CNG ride and handling The CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight. However, there’s not a lot of difference to the way this rides or handles compared to the standard Nexon, and as such, it remains one of this SUV’s strengths. Despite the additional weight, ride and handling remains a strength.  To account for the additional weight of the tanks at the rear, it does feel a bit softer, and though there’s slightly more vertical movement at the rear, it isn’t uncomfortable. Bump absorption remains impressive and the Nexon CNG comes across as a composed SUV. The steering is light at low speeds, enabling you to manoeuvre easily in traffic, and it weighs up nicely as you pick up pace. Tata Nexon CNG price and verdict  Prices for the Nexon CNG range from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and buyers will appreciate that it is offered from the base to the top variant. In comparison, its main rival, the Maruti Brezza CNG, is priced from Rs 9.29 lakh to 12.10 lakh (ex-showroom). What’s also nice is the 3 year/ 1,00,000km standard warranty it comes with. Nexon CNG is available in four trims, priced from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh. With the CNG, the Nexon now has the widest powertrain choice in our market, and given the multiple trims and variants on offer, there’s a Nexon for everyone in the range. The top variant is pricey, the refinement isn’t the best and it continues to suffer from ergonomic issues like the standard Nexon. However, with the CNG, you get the benefits of lower running costs.It also delivers in terms of its drivability and performance, so much so that you can use it in CNG mode only. That, coupled with the fact that you don’t miss out on a boot and a spare tyre, sweetens the deal further.

    "description": "Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde announced in the latest cabinet meeting that all light motor vehicles entering Mumbai via five entry points will be exempt from paying toll from today. No toll to enter Mumbai from five entry points Rule applicable for light motor vehicles only Mumbai Toll Waiver to be “permanent” According to the latest announcement, motorists entering Mumbai from Dahisar, LBS Road at Mulund (West), Eastern Express Highway Mulund (East), Airoli Creek Bridge and Vashi will not be charged any toll. This decision will not just help consumers save money but will also result in cutting down the massive traffic jams caused by these tolls. Chief minister Shinde said that the \"masterstroke\" move would save time, fuel and reduce pollution. \"It was a long pending demand to waive toll at Mumbai's entry points,\" he said. \"Many activists, including I, had approached the court demanding the same. It is a masterstroke decision.\" Sources tell us that the toll waiver will be “permanent”. Until yesterday, these booths collected either Rs 45 or Rs 75 per vehicles, and as many as 2.8 lakh light motor vehicles cross these tolls every day.",

    "description": "Team MRF Tyres’ Andrea Mabellini and co-driver Virginia Lenzi won the eighth and final round of the 2024 European Rally Championship (ERC), Rally Silesia in Poland. As for the overall championship, while the team couldn’t make it three consecutive titles, it did finish second overall in the standings. MRF Tyres second overall with 167 points Mabellini becomes the eighth different ERC winner this year Driving a Skoda Fabio Rally2 Evo, Mabellini trailed Hayden Paddon by 6.8 secs heading into the final day. But the wet conditions on Sunday played in Mabellini’s favour, with the Italian driver benefitting from selecting a cross tyre formation of soft compound dry tyres and wet weather covers.  He went 8 secs quicker than Paddon to take the rally lead and eventually won with a margin of 18.3 secs. “I’m extremely happy. I want to thank Team MRF Tyres for believing in me from the start. We’ve worked hard together, and achieving this result is a huge satisfaction for all of us,” said Mabellini, who became the eighth different ERC rally winner this season. “A big thanks also to Virginia [co-driver Lenzi], who understands me perfectly, guides me, and without whom I wouldn’t be able to give my best, and to everyone who supported us from Italy. It’s been an incredible weekend, a season finale to remember. We’re enjoying this moment.” MRF Tyres second overall in 2024 European Rally Championship This was Team MRF Tyres’ first win and fourth podium finish this season. With a total of 167 points, the team finished second overall in the championship, 24 points behind BRC Racing Team.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/alfa-romeo-will-launch-range-topping-luxury-suv-2027",
    "description": "Likely to be an SUV, model will be key to brands ambitions to push into US market Alfa Romeo’s fifth model line will be a large E-segment vehicle to sit at the top of the range. Outgoing CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato confirmed the car would most likely be a SUV, meaning it would rival the likes of the BMW iX and Porsche Cayenne, but he would allow his replacement Santo Ficili to reflect on the decision before further details are announced. “He can reflect on this E-segment proposition in the coming months,” he told reporters at the Paris motor show. This car would sit on parent Stellantis’s STLA Large architecture, which allows both combustion and electric set ups – the latter available with ultra-fast charging (via an 800V system) and can accept a range of high-powered motors and large batteries up to 118kWh allowing for some 500 miles of range. Previously billed to arrive in 2027, it will follow next generations of the Stelvio in 2025 and a Giulia in 2026, both of which will sit on that same STLA Large platform rather than continue on Alfa’s bespoke Giorgio platform. Imparato said the new Stelvio and Giulia would still “maintain and protect” Alfa’s driving dynamics despite this switch and it was “very, very impressive with the level of performance that can be achieved” with this architecture. They would be offered with hybridised internal combustion engines and electric drivetrains as part of Stellantis’s multi-energy platform strategy and the firm would be able to adapt production up to 100% in one direction or another based on customer demand. The new Stelvio and Giulia have already been shown to customers in Italy, Germany and the USA in clinics; Imparato said simply “boom!” had been the reaction from potential customers. More generally on Alfa’s performance, Imparato said that Alfa had gone from “losing hundreds of millions to making hundreds of millions” in profit off the back of cutting costs and increasing the prices of its models. He said the firm was not chasing volume, rather profitability, and to that end the firm had strong margins on every car sold and the “stock was clean” with every unit made being sold to a true buyer. Earlier in the day at the Paris motor show, Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares had said that “Alfa was deeply in the red” at the start of the Stellantis merger, “it was for sale” but “we turned it around”. He said it now makes “good margins and profits”, although Stellantis does not split out the individual performance of its brands.",

    "title": "The 2024 Paris motor show marks a return to form",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2024-paris-motor-show",
    "description": "We recap the best new cars and concepts at a motor show to remember That was more like it. The 2024 edition of the Paris motor show felt comfortable in its own skin, not trying to be too big or apologising for who wasn't there, rather embracing the brands that were there and fitting them into the right space accordingly. Any talk of the demise of the motor show is counterintuitive: the more they get talked down, the less likely the are to survive and the less opportunity the industry gets to come together with the latest cars and people who've made them. Still, the 2022 Paris show felt so small and apologetic that it could have brought the whole concept of a motor show down with it – something that was also true of the returning (but now axed) Geneva show earlier this year. The fact that French president Emmanuel Macron turned up in 2022 felt the biggest news draw of the day. Thankfully, the 2024 edition was far more uplifting, building on the busy feel of the 2023 Munich show with which Paris now alternates. Even Tesla turned up. Macron did again, too, but this time just seemed to get in everyone's way by constantly closing stands he wanted to visit.  After carrying the candle for both Paris 2022 and Geneva 2024 almost single handedly, the Renault Group went big again in its own backyard with significant unveilings from Renault, Dacia and Alpine. The Renault 4 will look to follow the 5 as a successful retro reinvention; Alpine will at last go from being a model to a brand with the A390; and Dacia will look to conquer the C-segment in the way it has the B-segment with the Bigster.  Yet for once Renault wasn't alone. Stellantis brands Peugeot, Citroën and Alfa Romeo all had a significant presence at the show, too, yet it was their new sibling brand Leapmotor that got most of the attention. If you can't beat Chinese companies at making low-cost electric cars, then why not buy one? It's a clever play from Stellantis, and outgoing CEO Carlos Tavares seemed like a man with a bit less on his shoulders than normal in his address at the show, the China 'threat' to Stellantis that two years ago felt like an existential crisis having been solved in an innovative way. Volkswagen Group brands Audi, Skoda and Volkswagen all had stands, albeit run by French local representatives rather than head office. Such a technicality wouldn't bother paying punters: the latest models were all there. BMW Group brand Mini displayed its new John Cooper Works models, too. Several Chinese car makers were in attendance. BYD remains the best known and most credible for export and unveiled its Sealion 7 SUV. Tavares was the first person of the day to visit the BYD stand, doing so before the show had opened to the public; it remains the brand the established car makers want to know the most about. Aito, GAC and Skywell were among the other Chinese brands at the show, but their cars and offerings didn't stand out as much, due to the lack of branding and recognisable features. Still, at least their stands were stands; Tesla's 'stand' was so bad it was good, perhaps done ironically, with cars plonked randomly in close proximity to one another with not even a carpet underneath to group them together. At least Tesla turned up – something I’d expect to see more car makers do again in future with this more buoyant feel to the show. One a year in Europe feels right.  Mark Tisshaw The best new cars and concepts at the 2024 Paris motor show Alfa Romeo Junior hybrid The hybrid version of Alfa Romeo’s new compact crossover has made its public debut at the Paris show. Named the Junior Ibrida, it’s fitted with the same 134bhp mild-hybrid powertrain as the related Fiat 600 and Jeep Avenger. Read our Alfa Romeo Junior review Alfa Romeo Tonale Alfa Romeo has unveiled the 2025-model-year update of the Tonale, bringing a refreshed interior. The family crossover gets a sleeker centre console with a new rotary gear selector and the intstrument display's layout has been revised to more clearly show information such as the plug-in hybrid system's remaining electric range. Alfa Romeo Tonale update brings refreshed interior Alpine A110 R Ultime All good things must come to an end, and so it proves for the Alpine A110. The French brand’s celebrated sports car is due to bow out due to new EU safety regulations, but not before getting one final and extreme outing. The A110 R Ultime is boosted by 49bhp to 345bhp, while an aggressive aero kit increases its downforce by up to 160kg compared with the A110 R. Just 110 will be built, priced from a whopping £209,000 – with the possibility to add another £70,000 in personalisation. New Alpine A110 R Ultime is a £276k swansong with 345bhp Alpine A390 Beta The linchpin in Alpine’s ambitious growth strategy will be an electric crossover conceived as an “A110 for five”. The A390 Beta concept is a first look at that car, with a radical new look that has been described as being 80% ready for production.  Alpine A390 Beta previews rakish 2025 EV with A110 handling Alpine Alpenglow Hy6 Alpine’s testbed for hydrogen combustion engines has gone from a modified Oreca four-pot to an all-new 3.5-litre V6 designed by Alpine itself. The company has prioritised efficiency and upped power from 335bhp to a huge 730bhp. And it can rev to 9000rpm to boot. Alpine's hydrogen V6 hypercar could make production Audi Q6 E-tron Sportback A more rakish version of Audi’s new electric flagship, the Q6 E-tron Sportback packs an extra 15 miles of range compared with its more conventional SUV counterpart. That gives the longest-legged model, the rear-wheel-drive Performance, a total range of 408 miles. UK deliveries will kick off in April, with prices starting at £62,475. Audi Q6 gains Sportback version with 408 miles of range BYD Sealion 07 The new BYD Sealion 7 is one of six models the Chinese brand is bringing to Europe over the next 14 months, as it ramps up its attempt to steal market share from the likes of Tesla and Volkswagen. It's based on an updated version of the platform used by the Seal saloon and will initially be offered in dual-motor, four-wheel-drive form, with a 0-62mph time of 4.5sec. It will land on UK shores (ahem) later this month, with pricing set to start at around £45,000. BYD Sealion 7 revealed as new Tesla Model Y rival Citroën Ami facelift Citroën’s diddy EV is celebrating its fourth birthday with a new look inspired by the legendary 2CV. Its new “sympathetic and more mature” look brings vent-like grooves on the front wings, black ‘eyelids’ on the headlights housings and a smile-shape indentation in the housing of Citroën’s new logo. Nothing has changed under the skin, however. Citroën Ami microcar gets new look inspired by 2CV ancestor Citroën C4 facelift The Citroën C4 hatchback and its C4 X saloon sibling have been refreshed with a new look and revised line-up of powertrains. It has gained a new 99bhp mild-hybrid engine but dropped the 99bhp atmo petrol unit, meaning you can no longer have a C4 with a manual gearbox. Deliveries begin early next year, with prices set to broadly align with the outgoing car. Citroën C4 drops manual gearbox in design refresh Citroën C5 Aircross Concept The Citroën C5 Aircross SUV is one of the brand’s final cars not to be offered with electric power, but that’s soon set to change. The current model will soon bow out for an all-new one, twinned with the new Peugeot 3008, prioritising aerodynamics and ushering in a radical new look. 2026 Citroën C5 Aircross EV previewed by rakish concept Dacia Bigster The aptly named Bigster is Dacia's biggest model to date. Arriving next year, the SUV will target the Skoda Kodiaq and the Ford Kuga, with greater ambitions to even steal a few sales from the more premium Land Rover Defender. It looks like it will have all the tools to do so, including four-wheel drive, rugged styling, LED headlights, 19in alloy wheels and a more powerful hybrid powertrain.  Dacia Bigster is brand's largest, most expensive model to date Leapmotor B10 Stellantis-backed Chinese brand Leapmotor has revealed its first global model, the B10 electric crossover. A rival for the Jeep Avenger, Mini Aceman and Renault 4, it's set to arrive in the UK next year, priced below £30,000. Leapmotor B10 is UK-bound crossover to rival Renault 4 Mini John Cooper Works EVs Mini is the latest brand to shift its performance arm into the electric era, with John Cooper Works variants of the Cooper and Aceman EVs. The amped-up duo both offer more power - enough to rival the Volkswagen Golf GTI - with 254bhp and 251lb ft produced from a front-mounted electric motor. That's enough to fling the Cooper from 0-62mph in just 5.9sec and the Aceman the same in 6.4sec.  Mini reveals 255bhp hot versions of Cooper and Aceman hatches Mobilize Duo Miss the Renault Twizy? Well, pine no more: the Mobilize Duo is the electric quadricycle's spiritual successor, bringing modern technology, a larger battery and a more powerful motor. Its battery has a capacity of 10.3kWh – enough to deliver around 100 miles of range on a single charge, a big upgrade on the old Twizy's 62 miles. Mobilize Duo is reborn Renault Twizy with 100-mile range Peugeot e-3008 Long Range and Peugeot e-5008 Long Range Peugeot is showing Long Range variants of its new e-3008 and new e-5008 electric SUVs at the Paris motor show, offering ranges of 435 miles and 415 miles respectively.  That's thanks to a new 96.9kWh battery pack – 23.9kWh bigger than the existing 73kWh one, which yields 327 miles of range in the e-3008 and 315 miles in the e-5008. Read our Peugeot e-3008 and e-5008 reviews Peugeot e-408 Peugeot has completed its EV line-up with the battery-powered version of its 408 crossover. It packs a 58.2kWh battery pack and a front-mounted 207bhp motor, yielding a range of 281 miles. It's making its first public appearance at the Paris show. Peugeot e-408 arrives as Polestar 2 rival with 281-mile range Renault 4 E-Tech The Renault 4 is back, this time as an electric crossover to rival the Mini Aceman. The second model in Renault’s ‘Iconic Family’, the 4 follows the recently launched Renault 5 supermini, bringing a similarly retro-futuristic design. It comes with a front-mounted, 118bhp electric motor and a 40kWh battery as standard, producing up to 190 miles of range, while higher-spec models ramp up performance to 148bhp, gaining a larger 52kWh battery for 250 miles of range.  Renault 4 reborn as bold electric crossover for under £30,000 Renault 17 Electric Restomod x Ora Ito Bemused by the Ford Capri’s metamorphosis from bold coupé to conformist SUV? This new Renault 17 might just be the answer, bringing the Capri’s contemporary rival up to date with a 270bhp electric motor and a carbonfibre chassis. Penned in collaboration with French designer Ora Ito, it’s slightly wider and lower than the original 17 but retains its cabin, door, windows, glass and underbody. Renault 17 reborn with 270bhp, RWD and carbonfibre chassis Renault Emblème This coupé-SUV is Renault’s idea of how hydrogen-fuel-cell power could offer long-range transport while slicing carbon emissions by 90% compared with today’s petrol Captur. Its exterior is being shown at Paris, but we will have to wait until later this month to see the interior too. Renault Emblème revealed as hydrogen coupé-SUV for 2030 Renault Twingo Renault’s next retro revival after the 4 is the cute new Twingo, which is scheduled to go on sale in 2026. The Paris show marks the city car's public debut. Renault Twingo to return in 2026 as sub-£17,000 EV Skoda Elroq The new Skoda Elroq is the brand’s third electric car (don’t forget the Citigo-e iV!), and the Czech brand hopes it will poach sales from some of the car industry’s biggest players. Available to order from 18 October, the Elroq will be capable of up to 360 miles of range in its highest specification. It’s biggest trump card, however, is its price of £31,500, which undercuts most of its rivals, including the Kia Niro EV.  Skoda Elroq revealed as 230-mile electric SUV for £31,500 THK LSR-05 We will forgive you if you've never heard of Japanese parts supplier THK, but its latest concept is well worth paying attention to. Penned by Nissan GT-R designer Shiro Nakamura, it's a showcase of the company's latest technological developments, including in-wheel motors and wireless car charging. It's making its European debut at Paris. Japanese firm shows high-tech SUV penned by Nissan GT-R designer",

Showing only 21,401 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO I example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example is among the lowest mileage ones in the world. The Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO I was developed from DTM racing to challenge BMW in the German touring car championship. Built to meet Group A homologation requirements, it featured a Cosworth-tuned engine producing 202 hp, along with aerodynamic upgrades like a rear spoiler and wider fender flares for improved downforce and handling. With a revised suspension for racing demands, the EVO I set the stage for Mercedes’ later dominance in DTM and paved the way for the more aggressive EVO II. Both models reflect the close link between motorsport and street-legal performance cars.   Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II Location: Miami, Florida Country of original delivery: Netherlands Chassis/VIN: 741313 Mileage: 176.0 kms (109.4 miles) Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this museum-grade, impeccably preserved, and concours-ready 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II. Showing only 176.0 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO II example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example to be the 2nd lowest mileage one in the world, as we are aware of a lower mileage car located inside the borders of Russia. The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II was born out of Mercedes' ambition to dominate the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), Germany’s premier touring car championship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As DTM regulations required manufacturers to base their race cars on production models, Mercedes developed the EVO II as a homologation special, producing only 502 units for road use. Furthermore, the EVO II introduced significant upgrades over the EVO I, primarily in aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling. Its bold, wind tunnel-tested body kit featured a larger rear wing and front splitter for improved downforce and high-speed stability. The 2.5-liter engine was also more powerful, delivering 235 horsepower compared to the EVO I’s 204 hp. The EVO II’s adjustable suspension, larger 17-inch wheels, and enhanced chassis provided sharper handling and a more responsive driving experience, making it better suited for both the track and the road. These refinements solidified its dominance in DTM racing. Continue...",
