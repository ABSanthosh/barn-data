    "description": "We recently took the Tuono 457 to the CoASTT High Performance Centre for our annual track day, and even though I missed out on testing it on the street, hopping on it at the track was worth the wait. It was so impressive, in fact, that it deserved a standalone story of its own. Aprilia Tuono 457 design (8/10) A good looking design but the traditional Tuono face is missed. The Tuono is essentially an RS 457 in streetwear – same engine, chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres. The tank is slightly reshaped, and of course, those upright handlebars change the ergonomics. But the big surprise was that the lap time in Rajini Krishnan’s hands was nearly identical to the RS 457’s at our 2024 Track Day. No clip-ons, no wind protection, and less front-end load, yet it hung right in there. That’s remarkable. The fuel tank shape is slightly reprofiled on the Tuono. A few things played to the Tuono’s advantage this year. The track surface at the CoASTT was in better shape than the last time we visited, the weather was a little kinder, and, as always, familiarity counts. This bike also ran the optional quickshifter, something Rajini appreciated. It’ll set you back Rs 20,000 – not cheap by any stretch, especially on a sub-Rs 4 lakh machine – but it works well and really adds to the experience. Aprilia Tuono 457 ergonomics (6/10) Acessible seat height but cramped for tall riders. Like with the RS 457, the real gem remains the engine, and Aprilia’s 457cc parallel-twin continues to be the segment’s crown jewel. 48 horsepower and segment-leading torque only tell half the story. The motor is also very smooth, and it packs crisp throttle response and a rich and evocative sound. With that wide, sculpted tank between your legs and the bike’s superbike-like soundtrack, there’s a genuine sense of occasion every time you roll on the gas. That said, it’s not all roses. Ergonomics is where the Tuono 457 will leave taller riders wanting – especially on track. I found myself cramped against the rear seat bump stop, with the bike’s bodywork feeling particularly slippery. The already compact RS 457 felt more accommodating with its wide, more forward set clip-ons, but the Tuono’s setup makes the cockpit feel more restrictive. Some of this can easily be fixed by adding some grip tape and maybe by modifying the rear seat to allow the rider more room to slide back. But if you’re close to 6 feet tall, you will find this bike cramped – particularly in how the fuel tank recesses lock your knees in place – and that won’t be just at the race track. Aprilia Tuono 457 performance (9/10) Superb mid-range makes up for flat top-end and it makes a great sound. Beyond the hard metrics, the Tuono 457 is engaging, playful and, crucially, fast enough to make every session exciting. The aluminium chassis, firm suspension and impressive Eurogrip Pro Torque Xtreme tyres all come together to make this (along with the RS 457) probably the most impressive handling bike ever to be made in India.  Quickshifter is an impressive but expensive option CoASTT is a flowing circuit with few heavy braking zones, and while the 457’s front brake fade is a known issue, it wasn’t a problem here. That said, if you plan on hitting more tracks with more demanding braking zones, upgrading the pads, fluid, or master cylinder is something you’ll have to look into. Aprilia Tuono 457 handling (9/10) Chassis, suspension and tyres work well but brake fade needs to be addressed. What makes the Tuono so special is that it isn’t a detuned RS that trades capability for comfort. It carries the same spirit, the same capability, and nearly the same lap times. Unfortunately, it’s not all perfect. First, there’s the bike’s size and the fact that the design isn’t as evocative as the RS 457, which is more visually linked to its bigger siblings.  More worryingly, however, there have also recently been some customer reports of unexpected engine reliability issues, and this is something that Aprilia needs to address in a speedy and decisive manner. From a sheer capability standpoint, though, the Tuono 457 has exceeded expectations, and that’s not something that happens very often. Aprilia Tuono 457 verdict (9/10) Nearly as capable as the RS 457 and with considerably more seat comfort.  What really struck me is how this bike stacks up against the competition. Whether it’s KTM’s singles or Yamaha’s twin-cylinder offerings, the Tuono feels like it’s operating on a higher plane – especially on a fast circuit like CoASTT that rewards power and flow. In fact, the lap time is closer to more powerful bikes like the Suzuki GSX-8R and Ducati Hypermotard Mono than it is to rivals like the KTM 390 Duke and Yamaha R3.

Luckily, our good friend Winston Yeh doesn’t share our reservations.

He clutched the “Best in Show” award, netting him a brand new 120R motor from Harley-Davidson that came with the commitment of building a bike around it for the next year’s show. “My mind started spinning immediately,” says Scott. Within days, there was a sketch. The idea was a naked superbike – a bike with a silhouette that looked like the race machines that Eddie Lawson and Wes Cooley piloted to AMA victories. Before work started, however, Jones found himself in the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After a full day’s time inside the museum that blew his mind, there was a new idea: “The silhouette was going to mimic the WR Racers of the 1940s.”…",

    "description": "The first product from Vietnamese EV maker Vinfast to be assembled and sold in India will be the VF7. The brand, which has a wide range of products positioned both above and below the VF7, has chosen this as the debut model for India as it wanted to enter a competitive segment, while also playing its premium card first. Some brief time with the model at Vinfast’s factory testing track in Hai Phong, Vietnam, gave us a better idea of how it could be positioned in our market, and suffice it to say, there’s more to it than first meets the eye. 2025 Vinfast VF7 exterior design and engineering – 7/10 Full of interesting details, but estate-like form factor lacks presence. A design signature of all Vinfast models is the moustache-like ‘V Face’ LED DRL band that sits on the nose and dips in the centre underneath the brand’s logo. Viewed head on, this does make many of their models look similar to one another, particularly this and the VF6, but look closer and you’ll see unique touches in each of them. V-face LED DRL band is the signature element bringing a family look to Vinfast EVs. The VF7 gets a pair of brushed metal ‘blades’ in the front air dam, while the bumper itself has an indented or concave look. In fact, this muscular surfacing can be found all over the car, and on the side, flush door handles help give the sculpted doors a clean look. For India, the VF7 will get 19-inch wheels, and ground clearance has been raised to 190mm. Only when viewed in profile do you realise this is a 4.5-metre-long vehicle with a 2.8-metre wheelbase, though the front and rear overhangs are quite short. Vertically oriented tail-lamps with interesting details look attractive. At the rear, there’s more sculpture to the tailgate, a slim windscreen and attractive vertically oriented LED tail-lamps. While the details are excellent, its long and low-slung shape means it doesn’t quite have the road presence of a boxy SUV, or even the coupe-like look of its smaller sibling the VF6, which could work against it in India, where a more traditional form factor is generally preferred. 2025 Vinfast VF7 interior space and comfort – 8/10 Big on rear seat and boot space, quality generally good too. While it might not look large on the road, it certainly is on the inside. Under the powered tailgate you’ll find a capacious 537-litre boot, although there is no spare tyre. Rear seat space should endear it to chauffeur-driven owners, because both leg and head room are vast. Due to the high floor, you’re sat a bit knees-up, but you don’t feel it as much when you’re stretched out. Rear seat leg and head room are both vast; gets a reclining feature, too.  Speaking of which, new for the Indian model is the ability to recline the rear seat back a generous amount, and the cushioning is soft and supportive, especially for the lower back. The windows are long but slim and set quite high, although the sense of space is greatly enhanced by the huge fixed glass roof that stretches from edge to edge. Interior is clean and uncluttered; infotainment screen is angled towards driver. Up front, the VF7 replaces the traditional instrument cluster with a heads-up display (plus essential info as a permanent fixture in the touchscreen) to give an uninhibited view over the low-set dashboard. The 12.9-inch touchscreen takes pride of place, angled proud of the dash with a set of drive-select toggle switches below it. This, combined with the light-coloured, soft-touch vegan leather trimming the dash and doors gives it a unique and premium look, albeit one without much flash value. Fit and finish are good, although some dull and basic looking plastics are a distraction. Soft-touch vegan leather trimming on dashboard gives a premium feel.    2025 Vinfast VF7 features and safety – 9/10 Loaded with features and targeting a 5 star Bharat NCAP score. Vinfast has chosen to only launch a single fully loaded trim level called Plus, in India, as a competitive feature set was deemed a high priority. Features like the aforementioned rear-seat recline, a wireless phone charger, vegan leather, ventilated seats and one-litre bottle holders in each door were said to be non-negotiables. Seven airbags are also standard, as are a host of electronic safety aids, including a radar-based ADAS suite with Level 2 Autonomous driving, all in the quest, Vinfast says, to achieve a 5-star Bharat NCAP rating. Other feature highlights include dual-zone climate control and the big glass roof. Small icons and graphics on the screen make it difficult to use on the move. While there are a few physical controls in the centre console and on the steering wheel, most functions are relegated to the touchscreen. Though this is a common practice these days, what makes Vinfast’s system less than ideal is the small size of the icons and graphics on the screen, which are difficult to target while on the move. 2025 Vinfast VF7 range and efficiency – 6/10 Large battery holds promise, but low WLTP rating is a concern. While there is only one trim level and one battery size for the VF7, it will be offered with two powertrain options – single-motor FWD and dual-motor AWD. The battery is a 70.8kWh LFP unit which can be charged at up to 7.2kW on an AC charger or on a CCS2 DC charger, although speeds and times were not specified for the latter. European-spec VF7 has a maximum WLTP-certified range of 450km. Vinfast says the Indian-spec car has had some tweaks to its powertrain and thus it’s best to wait for official MIDC or ARAI range figures. However, the WLTP rating for overseas models is rated at 450km for the FWD model and 431km for the AWD model. 2025 Vinfast VF7 performance and refinement – 9/10 AWD version offers addictive acceleration, modes alter character well. Vinfast VF7 specificationsLxWxH4545mm x 1890mm x 1635.75mmWheelbase 2840mmBattery capacity70.8kWhDrive layoutFWD/AWDMotor power204hp/350hpMotor torque 310Nm/500NmKerb weight 2090kg/2205kg0-100kph 9.5sec/5.8secAC charging Up to 7.2kWWheel size 245/50 R19 The Vinfast VF7 FWD model uses the same 204hp, 310Nm front-mounted motor as the VF6, which is claimed to get it to 100kph from a standstill in 9.5 seconds. However, the version we got to sample was the dual-motor version, which adds another similar motor on the rear axle. Total outputs for this version are 350hp and 500Nm, which shreds the 0-100kph sprint down to just 5.8sec. In practice, it feels genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration from low speeds. The ferocity of the power delivery starts to taper off close to about 120kph, but it will hold those speeds with ease. The good news is that it is civilised and manageable at low speeds, making it suitable for city driving too. The VF7 is genuinely fast, even spinning up its wheels under hard acceleration. Refinement was hard to judge on the relatively smooth expanse of Vinfast’s test track but the requisite electronic whine in the cabin was a welcome indicator of the power being deployed. The brakes felt strong and confidence inspiring, and the VF7 AWD’s not-inconsiderable 2.2-tonne mass was kept well in check. 2025 Vinfast VF7 ride comfort and handling – 8/10 Feels solid and confidence inspiring at high speeds. The dynamic capabilities of the VF7 were also hard to ascertain on the smooth track with almost no corners present. However, the general sense was of a secure and planted vehicle in the vein of what we’ve come to expect from European cars. The choice to move down a size from 20-inch to 19-inch wheels and tyres (Apollo tyres, no less) seems to have been the right one, as there is a degree of absorption that perhaps would have been lacking with the upsize. It feels secure and planted at high-speeds, almost European-like.  The longer wheelbase of the VF7 appeared to give it a greater sense of stability at high speeds than the VF6, if perhaps robbing it of a bit of handling playfulness in the process. That said, the drive modes did well to add (or remove) steering weight for the desired driving conditions. 2025 Vinfast VF7 price and verdict – 8/10 If priced aggressively, it could be a unique proposition in India. While the Vinfast VF7’s estate-like form factor might not be to everyone’s tastes, those seeking substance over style will appreciate it. The rear seat and boot are incredibly spacious, making this a great car for families or the chauffeur driven. Plus there’s the AWD version for those who like the occasional hit of performance on their Sunday drive. With local assembly from the get go, Vinfast is expected to go aggressive with the price, and we expect it to be in the region of Rs 25 lakh (ex-showroom) for the FWD version, going up to about Rs 29 lakh for the dual-motor AWD version. With the features and safety kit on offer, that should make it very competitive. Upon launch, prices are expected to range between Rs 25 lakh-29 lakh (ex-showroom). Whether in look, spec or character, the VF7 is a unique proposition for the Indian market, and perhaps that’s exactly what new entrant Vinfast needs to make people sit up and take notice. We’ll know more when the VF7 (followed closely by the VF6) goes on sale in India in the festive season of 2025.

    "description": "Reports from Cycle World have indicated that Ducati is developing a semi-automatic transmission technology aimed at production and motorsport. Ducati’s patent indicates a system similar to that of Honda’s E clutch The mechanism is aimed at performance and motorsport Ducati’s semi automatic system is more performance focused Two distinct versions have been proposed  In recent years, quite a few manufacturers have introduced automatic or semi-automatic transmissions, including Yamaha, BMW, KTM, and most famously, Honda, with their DCT as well as the new E-clutch system.  Ducati’s plans for a semi-automatic system are quite similar to Honda’s E-Clutch, albeit with a few minor differences, according to the two propositions seen in two patent drawings.   Both patent drawings feature a computer control unit connected to an electric motor that operates a hydraulic clutch master cylinder. Like Honda’s system, this means that the clutch can be automatically controlled, but the rider still has to shift gears themselves. In Ducati’s first version, the master cylinder is hydraulically actuated by the clutch lever, as usual, with an added chamber and piston being actuated by the electric motor when you aren’t engaging the clutch. In the second, the added chamber and piston remain the same, with the difference being that the clutch lever speaks to an electronic control unit, which then tells the actuator to disengage the clutch but could do so on its own as well.  Both systems mean the exact same thing for the rider – you can shift gears with or without manually using the clutch, depending on your preference. Ducati reportedly also mentions a launch control system with this technology, allowing you to rev out the motor and dump the clutch, letting the electronics maximise your acceleration.  The gear shifting would be managed using load sensors in the shifter to detect an upshift or downshift, while engine management would handle auto-blipping the throttle. In its patent application, Ducati has been clear that this mechanism is aimed at performance and motorsport, indicating applications to the production bikes, hence allowing legal use in WSBK and WSS as well.  WSBK bikes are largely dictated by the road bikes that they are based on, which is why they can’t use technologies like the seamless shift gearboxes seen on MotoGP bikes. A performance-oriented semi-automatic gearbox could give Ducati a crucial advantage.   Also see: Ducati Diavel V4 RS leaked, launch expected in 2026",
