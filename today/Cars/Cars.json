And then there’s the infamous iPhone camera and its propensity for failing under vibration. Many riders I know and trust swear by Quad Lock’s products. So I was pleased as punch when the Australian company offered to send over a handful of products to test. I sent Quad Lock a list of five or six items that I thought would work, and they responded by sending a huge box of goodies for me to tear into.

    "description": "Audi’s fastest and most aggressive SUV ever has set two Nurburgring lap records – and now it's been given even more power With 631bhp, the twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre petrol V8 beneath the bonnet of the new Audi RS Q8 is the most powerful combustion engine ever offered in an Audi Sport model, eclipsing the 621bhp tune of the same engine in the RS6 Avant and RS7 Sportback. Given that there’s no electrical hybrid boost here, it’s a pleasingly old-school achievement worthy of some celebration – even if you might prefer Audi Sport’s most potent engine to be offered in a fast estate or coupé, rather than a hulking great big 2.3-tonne SUV. Even if the power hike keeps pace with the 628bhp BMW X6 M Competition and 626bhp Range Rover Sport SV, you might wonder why. After all, the 592bhp offered in the standard RS Q8 is enough for 0-62mph in 3.8sec and for us to describe it as ‘physics-bashing’. Well, if you could strap Albert Einstein into this Performance version and give him a hot lap of the Nürburgring, where the RS Q8 Performance has just set a 7min 36.698sec SUV lap record, he might start questioning his theories.",

    "description": "Lotus advertised Player’s Gold Leaf brand and more famously JPS years later \"Advertising on racing cars in England doesn’t exactly seem to have taken place by storm, but I gather that several people are working hard behind the scenes with sponsorship deals,” wrote Autocar’s motorsport columnist, Eoin Young, in December 1967. “It’s interesting that the Rhodesian Gunston tobacco company is considering John Love [reigning champion of the high-profile South African Formula 1 series] for a season on the World Championship circuits.” And indeed it would be Love and fellow Rhodesian Sam Tingle who would make history at the 1968 season-opening South African Grand Prix as the first drivers of sponsored cars, their Brabham and LDS machinery painted in the bright orange of Gunston’s cigarette packets. Teams were in a tricky spot financially after BP, Shell and Firestone pulled their support, and so Gunston’s scheme caught the attention of Lotus chief Colin Chapman, and for race two in Spain (weirdly, a full four months later) his cars would appear not in their traditional green and yellow livery but in the red, white and gold of Gold Leaf fags. This was problematic for British fans wanting to watch Graham Hill win from home, due to the BBC’s and ITV’s unmoving aversion to advertising. A month prior to the Spanish GP, Autocar had reported on a televised discussion between motorsport and TV management about sponsorship. “[The BBC’s] Peter Dimmock outlined the position regarding the government’s ban on TV tobacco advertising and said the Lotus tie-up with Gold Leaf had sparked off the situation. Colin Chapman said he was surprised [to hear this] and suggested that it might have been better if Lotus had been contacted [about the issue by TV men] in the first place,” this debate being the first contact he’d had with them. Enjoy full acccess to the complete Autocar archive at themagazineshop.com After the Spanish GP blackout, Autocar broke its neutrality about the issue, editor Maurice Smith commenting: “We are told that the TV authorities are prepared to accept static advertisements as an inevitable part of all sporting stadiums since long before TV and radio were invented; but that they cannot allow advertisers to take advantage of the medium by placing decals on ‘prime movers’ in the heart of the action – whether cars, men or whatever. \"That the racing car constructors cannot afford to run teams without such sponsorship [any more], or what might become of motor racing if sponsors withdrew, seems to have been lost from view. “Though obviously of great importance to the few directly involved, these esoteric aspects of TV ‘big business’ are of no interest whatever to the public, for whom and through whom, solely and exclusively, the TV service exists. Now, all TV broadcasts of motor races are to be suspended until the position has been resolved – showing a total disregard by the TV authorities for their prime responsibility. “Those of our readers who cannot get to races have left us in no doubt that they resent this whole squabble, and we support their feelings.” Thankfully, the issue was settled with the BBC that August, meaning Hill’s second title victory at the end of the season wouldn’t be missed. By then, the floodgates had been opened already: oil companies STP and Elf backed March and Matra, before a wider variety of sponsors came in through the early 1970s. That wasn’t totally the end of the issue, however: in 1976, British fans missed one of F1’s finest title fights – Niki Lauda versus James Hunt – because Surtees was advertising condoms. Commentator Murray Walker would later recall: “As far as the BBC was concerned, a visible Durex logo was totally unacceptable for family viewing.” A few years later, football teams would have to fight a similar fight, as they introduced sponsor logos on players’ shirts. Governing body the FA permitted this from 1977, but broadcasters didn’t. The BBC even made Coventry City design a special kit for televised games, on the basis that its T-shaped stripes too obviously referenced local car maker Talbot even with the logo removed. Not until 1986 would all sponsorship restrictions be lifted.",

Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu.

    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "Exactly 25 years ago, in September 1999, Autocar India started its innings with the new Ford Ikon on the cover. A world exclusive, the story showcased Ford’s new sedan for India, powered by the powerful and responsive 1.6-litre Rocam engine. The car was a delight to drive, the engine was super responsive, and this set the tone for the future of Ford in India. The even bigger story, though, was that this was Ford’s first new car after the Mahindra-Ford JV had been dissolved. Fast forward 25 years and Ford India is set to make a comeback after its planned Mahindra alliance was aborted. Talk about history repeating itself. And the Ford that is likely to go on sale first is the 2024 Everest. Previously known as the Endeavour in India, Ford’s new Everest is an SUV that is much missed here. A more sophisticated rival to Toyota’s Fortuner, Ford’s big SUV always rode better, drove better and was more luxurious and comfortable inside.   The plan Now, with the closest place we could get our hands on Ford’s Everest being Nepal, and Ford almost certain to retain the Everest name in India (for the first time), we just had to try and drive the Everest up to where we could see Mt Everest. You can catch a glimpse of the famous mountain from the top of a hill not too far from Kathmandu, called Nagarkot. Getting to Nagarkot, however, involves a long ascent where you climb almost a kilometre, and once up, there’s no guarantee we’ll be able to see Sagarmatha or ‘head of the sky’ as Mt Everest is called in Nepali. The mountain is around 110km away and appears as a small peak between two closer (so ‘taller’ looking) peaks. And that’s not it; with monsoon clouds bouncing off the high Himalayas and collecting at their base at this time of  year, we’ll need a gap in the high clouds to see it.  View from Nagarkot, 2,175m, in pictogram above. (SOURCE: Google Maps)   Familiar but different Nepal initially feels very familiar. There are plenty of Tatas, Mahindras and Marutis present and the drivers in Nepal seem to have graduated from the same driving schools as drivers in India. Bikes slip though every gap, drivers here practice the same ‘cut, thrust and parry’ and not even monks practice defensive driving.  20-inch wheels and ‘tough’ alloys hit the spot. Coming face to face with the new Everest at the Go Ford dealership gives me some succour. It looks even more imposing and larger. And around the side, it gives me the impression of being larger than even the Endeavour we had in India. Marginally longer and built on a 40mm longer wheelbase, the real reason it looks bigger, however, is that this big body-on-frame SUV is now even more block like. The nose is wider and more square and the ‘C’-shaped LEDs that frame the headlight clusters accentuate the width. The flat bonnet is also full of cuts and creases, the chrome bars that flank the Ford logo give the bluff cowl a modern look and what also adds muscle are the mildly flared fenders. In profile, the big 20-inch wheels help give this big SUV a solid, planted look, and I really like the ‘tough’ two-tone design of the alloys. The bi-turbo badge below the fender tells us this diesel has two turbos placed in series. Go back further and the widened rear fenders help give the Everest a nice wide stance from the rear as well. The cabin isn’t too tall, it’s nicely tucked in from the lower body and what really catches my eye are the clear tail-lights that light up bright red. I even like the manner in which the word Everest has been boldly emblazoned across the rear.  Everest iconography shifted here from the spare. in India as well.   Endeavour, expidition It’s afternoon by the time we leave Kathmandu. The traffic hasn’t gotten any better and slipping this massive supertanker into the stream of traffic proves to be tricky. The arterial roads we initially traverse are narrow and full of parked vehicles, so I really have to inch forward carefully. Visibility from the driver’s seat is good, and the light and very accurate steering makes it easy to place the Everest; important in a vehicle of this bulk. The steering doesn’t quite seem to have the heft of the earlier Endeavour, but the Everest’s steering is quicker at low speeds. That, along with the relative lack of effort to twirl it, sort of makes this bulky SUV feel a bit easier to manage.  As we leave the confines of the city and get onto faster roads, I notice that the ride is very comfortable. It isn’t just the bump absorption, that SUVs like this one normally ace it’s also the refinement, the flat ride and the relative lack of secondary movement associated with a body-on-frame SUV like this. Ride isn’t pillow soft, but the manner in which the Everest absorbs a section of bad road – silently, smoothly and without any hint of heave-ho – makes it both comfortable to sit in and effortless to drive. I just don’t need to slow down unless the holes are particularly large and deep. And the Everest also feels very stable at speed. It even feels more planted the faster you go; Ford’s big boy really does give you plenty of confidence to press on. The climb Once we turn off for Nagarkot, we transition onto some wide ghat roads that sweep around in a nice flow. Leading us ever upwards, the wide sweepers are well paved for the most part. Since there’s practically no traffic, I can really enjoy the drive up. The big takeaway here is that the Everest feels light on its feet and ever ready to change direction.  And it isn’t just the quick steering, it’s a combination of factors. One key contributor has to be Ford’s superb body control and poise. Almost always comfortable in a corner, it feels well balanced and ever willing to alter its line. This is a clear step up on the last-gen Endeavour sold in our market and the confidence it delivers from behind the wheel means you always feel relaxed and enjoy going quicker. Wish the brakes had more bite though. The only time you ‘feel’ the weight of the Everest is when you have to get relatively hard on the brakes. More initial bite and better pedal feel needed here for sure.   Bi-turbo engine gives the Everest an X factor. Half way through our one kilometre or so climb, we run into what feels like a mini cloudburst. Rivulets of water stream down the ghats and we have to clamber over some small rocks that have run down along with the water and silt. The Everest just takes everything in its stride, casually hopping over everything.  As we carry on our way up the mountain, now looking down on the weather below, what I also realise is that the bi-turbo engine contributes significantly to the Everest’s  effortless nature. Incidentally, the engine’s still made in India, and it’s smooth, refined and always on the boil. Refinement, in fact, is so good, it feels like a new generation of engine. And what I especially like is how quickly it responds to a tap on the throttle. With 210hp and 500Nm of torque, it clearly can deliver the goods at higher engine speeds. And here, too, there is no hesitation. There are no flat spots and no surges over practically the entire rev range. And that’s despite the engine being driven by a pair of turbos in sequence; something that’s difficult to do. Not sure how seamlessly this engine will transition from its current EU IV state of tune to our BS VI equivalent, though. 2.0 diesel is made in India; is smooth, seamless and makes 210hp and 500Nm of torque. Even the 10-speed automatic gearbox feels more responsive and intuitive. It still shifts up too early when you lift off the throttle to cruise and only comes a gear down, instead of two, when you tap the throttle. Still, the gearbox works better with this bi-turbo engine as the small turbo spins easily providing sufficient boost at low engine speeds. What irks is that there are no paddles on the steering wheel, only fiddly plus and minus buttons on the gear lever; odd on an otherwise well-specified SUV. What’s cool, however, is how the electrically driven gear selector returns on its own to P if you open the door or even switch the car off in D; remember to try it.   You can shift gears manually using these buttons.   Looking out, looking in We only reach the top of Nagarkot at sundown. Our weather app says there should be a small window the next morning, especially when it comes to medium clouds, and that’s just what we are hoping for. The next morning, though, it all seems pointless – we are enveloped in cloud. So we begin to shoot the exterior; details, highlights and some bits inside the cabin that are well lit. Then, just as we are about to give up hope, a sliver of light opens out, with the gap getting larger every minute. Soon, we can see many peaks close to us and some of the high Himalayas in the distance. We quickly look in the direction of the Everest using our GPS and train our cameras on the dark peak; it’s often the one with the least snow on it because of the high winds. But now, the clouds are back – in batches – drawing a veil of white over the range on and off. Clouds bubbling up from below as the earth heats up. More gaps open later and we see what we think is the Everest. Drive modes and off-road settings are easily accessible from here; no need to fiddle with screen. But the clouds cover it again, and with nothing to do but wait, I decide to take a closer look at the cabin. There’s loads to like here and my attention is initially drawn to how it feels like there’s a bit more space inside. This Everest feels wider and there appears to be more driver space. This version also gets powered and cooled front seats that are big and comfortable even on long drives.  What I am drawn to next is the 12-inch Tesla-like screen with its portrait orientation and sharp details. Apple CarPlay works nicely here and what’s neat is that you can scale up Apple CarPlay at the touch of a button. The screen runs Ford’s Sync 4A software and what’s also Tesla-like here is that you get a digital sketchpad; for when you are waiting and the kids are bored. It’s only software, so why not. You also get a 360-degree camera and, as earlier, a valet mode. Cool graphics work with off-road modes. The Everest also gets a full suite of ADAS functions, with pre-collision assist and automatic emergency braking. The version we are driving has 4X2, 4X4 and 4-low modes, accessible via a dial. In addition, you can select various off-road modes: tow (which is new), slippery, mud and ruts, and sand. Do this and the display even pops up and tells you how the four-wheel-drive system is being optimised with locking diffs, à la Range Rover. The touchscreen has fan and temperature controls, but there is also a set of physical air-con control knobs and buttons. Twin gloveboxes, but plastic quality isn’t great. Narrow door pockets apart, storage and stowage are also decent. The square elbow box is huge, the twin gloveboxes manage a good amount of room between them and there are full-sized cup holders and a tray to keep knick knacks below the central console. The black on black dash, however, looks more utilitarian than upmarket, and plastic quality in and around the central console is only ordinary. Ford will certainly need a more upmarket version of the Everest for the Indian market. And while the digital instrument panel proffers up some great graphics, the ‘digital’ tachometer and small temperature, fuel and oil pressure gauges on the instrument panel need to be more legible. Come on Ford, this is easy. Space in the second row of the Everest is also improved. Legroom and even headroom are more than sufficient, and as the cabin is wider, there seems to be more space in general. The seat is set a bit low, so the seating position is a bit knees-up. You can, however, slide the second-row bench forwards or back and the backrest can be reclined as well. You also get a blower control in the back as well as a regular plug point, so you can charge or power even laptops. Even more space at rear, but seat is low. There’s also a bit more room in the third row, especially after optimising and adjusting the space used for the first and second row. Getting in isn’t easy, but once you are in, short journeys are sort of manageable.  What the Everest also gets, even three rows up, is a fair amount of boot space. You can stack around four pieces of hand baggage in the back or even two big bags. The third row seats can be folded electrically (up and down) for more space. Third row now gets a bit more space but small seats are still only for short drives or children.   Up where it belongs Ford’s new Everest is a full-size SUV that ticks almost every single checkbox. And it is a long list. Big, bold, spacious, comfortable and well-equipped, the new Everest is a large-sized body-on-frame SUV that delivers a solid build, real off-road ability and is practical. It is also refined, sophisticated, easy, effortless and enjoyable to drive. It drives so well, in fact, that it feels like it’s built on a monocoque chassis.  Then there’s the bi-turbo diesel, which is smooth, punchy and responsive. You do miss having paddle shifters, and Ford needs to look at a more upmarket version of the Everest, with a higher quality dash (in particular); paddle shifters would make for a welcome addition, too. But, be in no doubt Ford, when you eventually decide to make a return, this is the SUV to do it with.  FORD’S COMEBACK When will Ford return to India? This is a question that is difficult to answer. What we can tell you, however, is that Ford has held on to its plant in Chennai and is currently working on a plan to make a comeback. And from what we hear, the Everest is part of that plan. Ford is likely to assemble the car here in India, just as it did earlier, and it is also likely to use the Sanand-made diesel engine. There’s even a bi-turbo 3.0 V6 diesel that makes 250hp and 600Nm of torque if Ford wants to get the Everest in as an import, and that sure will get the attention of SUV lovers.

    "description": "It was one of those perfect drives, a rare window of relative emptiness on India’s busiest highway. A mid-morning dash to the BU Bhandari showroom for the launch of the Mercedes-AMG GLC 43 was the easiest Mumbai-Pune trip I’ve done in a long time. Making the drive particularly relaxing was the new addition to Autocar India’s fleet, the all-electric Mercedes EQE SUV, which got its first highway outing. It took just two hours and six minutes in the ultra-smooth (and quick) EQE SUV to go from the Autocar HQ to the BU Bhandari Showroom on the Pune bypass. That’s less than what many office folks take to get home on a typical working day in Mumbai. It does help that the AtalSetu has brought our office closer to the edge of Mumbai, and a 10:15am departure was a sweet spot (or time). The early-morning highway rush was over, the toll plazas had no long queues, and even the Lonavala Ghat, which is choked most of the day (and night) on Google Maps, was surprisingly ‘blue’. Traffic flowed without holdups, even on the steepest sections where trucks otherwise block all lanes while trying to ‘overtake’ at a crawl. Strong and smooth powertrain effortlessly gobbles miles. The Atal Setu is always a great place to try out the ADAS system on any car. The wide and perfectly marked lanes and the gentle curves on this 21km sea bridge were perfect for checking out the EQE SUV’s ‘Level 2’ ADAS capability. That meant letting the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which I have set at 99kph (just below the 100kph speed limit), and the Lane Keep Assist do the work while I sat back and relaxed with just a light hand on the wheel, enjoying the harbour’s breathtaking views. The Lane Keep Assist worked brilliantly, keeping the big Merc centred nicely in the fast lane. When changing lanes, I was impressed with how the ACC reacted smoothly. When you signal and shift into the overtaking lane, the ACC provides strong and linear acceleration without abrupt power surges to match the new lane’s speed. Active Brake Assist activates at the slightest hint of an obstacle. While the ADAS in the Mercedes EQE SUV is highly advanced, it has some limitations, especially when dealing with erratic drivers who slice across lanes like it’s a normal thing to do. If some idiot abruptly cuts into your lane from a sharp angle, the ADAS can struggle to react promptly. This is not the case with just the EQE SUV – no ADAS is fully capable of handling such unpredictable events, which is a reminder of why the tech can only assist and not replace the driver. Mercedes’ Active Brake Assist, while a great safety feature on paper, can become a nuisance – and even a potential hazard – in Mumbai’s chaotic traffic. Designed for controlled environments, it doesn’t quite account for the unpredictability of pedestrians darting across roads or scooters weaving through tight gaps. The system often triggers unnecessarily, slamming on the brakes at the slightest hint of an obstacle. In such congested conditions, this overly sensitive response can be more dangerous than helpful. These fierce and abrupt stops are hugely unnerving for the passengers and could catch a driver behind you off guard, increasing the risk of rear-end collisions. It’s best to switch the Brake Assist off, which you have to do every time you start the car. The monsoons have made mincemeat of the Nhava Sheva road, which connects the Atal Setu to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, and on such surfaces, the EQE SUV is out of its comfort zone. To be honest, it doesn’t quite live up to its SUV credentials and isn’t comfortable dropping in and out of potholes like its IC engine brethren. That’s because the softly sprung EQE SUV uses up its suspension travel quite easily, and deep ruts and craters crash through. In fact, it’s best to use ‘Sport’ drive mode as the default setting. The suspension feels overtly soft in Comfort and Normal modes, which is fine when you are crawling in rush hour, but up the pace a bit on even a slightly smooth road, and you’ll find the EQE SUV tends to wallow and feel floaty. In Sport mode, the suspension tightens nicely to give a more settled ride, which is what you want on the highway. Wallows at speed because of soft suspension. Two areas where the EQE SUV stands out are performance and range, and both are interlinked because, with great range, you can enjoy the performance without keeping an eye on the SOC meter. Plant your foot down, and this big and heavy SUV lunges forward with an intensity that can take you aback but in a very pleasing way. The EQE SUV gathers with velvet smoothness, and before you know it, you’ve sailed past the speed limit. On the Mumbai-Pune expressway, which is now infested with speed cameras, it is hard not to get a speeding ticket. To stay out of trouble, I limit my indulgence to short jabs of the accelerator pedal just to enjoy all the 408hp and 858Nm of torque that puts most IC engine SUVs to shame. I averaged 66kph on the 140km drive to BU Bhandari, which is pretty good if you consider that this included slow, non-expressway sections. Not that the expressway raises your average speed dramatically because with so many cameras staring at you, I’m forced to show a lot of restraint! With 332km range left, I didn’t need to use the Pune Mercedes dealers’ on-site 180kW fast charger, but it’s good to know that it’s there and that the dealership is happy to let non-Merc owners plug in as well. Located just off the Pune bypass, it’s an incredibly convenient place for EVs on a long-distance trip to Mahabaleshwar or beyond to quickly top up their batteries. Phenomenal range eliminates range anxiety. The return journey was equally uneventful. Using the regen down the Lonavala Ghat, I could extend the range even further, which, on this round trip, I calculated to be 504km. That is a truly impressive figure, considering how hard I was driving the EQE SUV. In fact, there was enough charge left in the battery (36 percent) for me to make another trip to Pune! The other area where the EQE SUV shines is refinement. The EQE SUV is not just quiet; it’s like being inside a luxury vault on wheels. The adaptive air suspension noiselessly glides over any surface, and then there’s the acoustic insulation, which Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Road, tyre and wind noises, even the electric motor’s faint whir, are gone. The cabin is like a calm oasis, and that’s what makes the EQE SUV special. It is luxury in its most serene form.

    "description": "Max Verstappen scored an emphatic win at the Brazil GP, battling his way up from P17 on the grid and acing the difficult conditions to cement his 2024 F1 championship lead. His closest title rival and Brazil GP polesitter ended up P6. Alpine scored an unexpected double podium finish, with Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly benefitting from a red flag stoppage. Verstappen scores first win since Spanish GP in June Alpine jump from ninth to sixth in standings Both RB drivers score points Verstappen’s Brazil GP masterclass Sao Paulo was a rollercoaster of a round for Verstappen. In Qualifying (which was postponed to Sunday morning due to poor weather conditions), the Red Bull driver failed to make it out of Q2. Combined with his five-place grid penalty for a power unit change, this meant he had to start the race from P17 on the grid. With the threat of rain looming, the Brazil GP was off to a rather chaotic start as Lance Stroll crashed on the formation lap. This led to further confusion over the aborted start procedure, and polesitter Lando Norris and a handful of other drivers ended up completing an extra formation lap. When the race did finally start, the rain started pouring down and Mercedes’ George Russell had a stronger launch to take the lead ahead of Norris. Verstappen also gained a number of places and was up to P10 on the opening lap itself. As the rain continued to intensify, Russell and Norris pitted for fresh intermediate tyres during the Virtual Safety Car, triggered by Nico Hulkenberg’s Haas being beached off track. They re-joined the track in P4 and P5, respectively, but Norris wasted no time and soon overtook Russell to gain another position. But it was Ocon, Verstappen and Gasly who benefitted by staying out as the race was red flagged just a few laps later due to Franco Colapinto’s crash. Ocon defended his lead well when the race was re-started, and even managed to open up a bit of a gap to Verstappen. But he’d have to do it all over again, with the Safety Car being called out on Lap 40 after Carlos Sainz’s crash. This time around, Verstappen had the better re-start and snatched the lead from Ocon, while Norris ran wide and dropped down to P7. From there on, Verstappen delivered a masterclass drive in the wet conditions, setting fastest lap after fastest lap on course to taking victory by 19.477 secs.  \"My emotions have been a rollercoaster with the red flag in qualifying. Starting P17, I knew it was going to be a really tough race but we stayed out of trouble, we stayed calm and we were flying - all these things made this possible,” beamed Verstappen, who scored his first win since the Spanish GP back in June. Double podium for Alpine Both the Alpine drivers held on to the podium spots, giving the team a much-needed reason to celebrate after a difficult season so far. This also has some big consequences in the standings, with Alpine jumping from ninth to sixth in the constructors’ championship. Russell ended up finishing fourth, followed by Charles Leclerc and Norris. Oscar Piastri crossed the line in seventh place, but dropped to eighth after being handed a 10-second time penalty for his collision with Liam Lawson.  Both the RB drivers scored points, with Yuki Tsunoda finishing seventh and Lawson ninth. Lewis Hamilton rounded out the top 10. 2024 F1 standings Verstappen’s win swings the championship pendulum in his favour and he now leads the standings with an advantage of 62 points over Norris. Leclerc is third overall, 24 points behind Norris.

    "description": "Hyundai has takn the wraps off the Initium concept, a hydrogen fuel cell SUV that may preview the styling and technology of the next-generation Nexo. The concept is meant to demonstrate Hyundai’s commitment to hydrogen as a fuel source, and comes with a new powertrain that’s said to offer much greater performance than the one in the Nexo FCEV. Hyundai Initium concept gets 204hp motor Hyundai is targeting a 650km range Plus-shaped graphic to help differentiate Hyundai’s hydrogen cars Hyundai Initium concept: powertrain The Initium concept gets a single electric motor that puts out up to 204hp, 40hp more than the Nexo, and it is said to provide a smoother drive at highway speeds. The Korean company says it is targeting a range of more than 650km between fill-ups, which is equivalent to the official 666km figure for the Nexo. It also has vehicle-to-load capability, which allows the battery to power external devices. Hyundai Initium concept: design In addition to the technical developments, the Initium is the first Hyundai that sports the new design language called ‘Art of Steel’. It is said to be “solid and safe”, having been created in response to customer demand for SUVs. The plus-shaped graphic on the front DRLs and tail-lights is new, and will be used to differentiate Hyundai’s hydrogen cars and SUVs from those with battery-electric powertrains and internal-combustion engines. That aerodynamics have been given a high priority can be seen in the roofline, which is more rakish than Hyundai’s other SUVs. Hyundai claims the Initium concept previews a production fuel cell car that’s scheduled to be unveiled by next summer. This is most likely to be the successor to the current Nexo, given its design closely mirrors that of prototypes that have been spotted testing on public roads around Europe. There’s no word on whether this model will come to India, though Hyundai had evaluated bringing the Nexo to our market, and had showcased it in New Delhi back in 2018. The company is currently working on bringing the Creta EV to a showroom near you early next year.
