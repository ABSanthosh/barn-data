    "description": "This 1989 Porsche 911 Carrera is a right-hand-drive coupe that underwent a backdate build by Rennsport in the UK, which was completed in 2018. Work involved a longhood conversion and the installation of backdated steel bodywork, composite bumpers, and 16\" Fuchs-style wheels along with a repaint in Slate Grey, a rebuild of the 3.2-liter flat-six, and a refresh of the G50 five-speed manual transaxle. The interior was reupholstered and features sport seats trimmed in black leather and houndtooth cloth along with lightweight door panels, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a PCCM stereo, and a 917-style shift knob. EZ Electric power steering was added following completion of the build, and the car was imported to the US under prior ownership. This backdated Carrera coupe was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve in Newport Beach, California with a clean Montana title.",

    "description": "This 1973 Ford Bronco is one of a limited number of Baja models built by Ford from 1971 to 1975 to commemorate victories in the Baja 500 and Baja 1000 by Bill Stroppe-prepared Broncos, and it is reported to be one of a handful finished in a special-order color rather than the standard red, white, and blue Baja Bronco paint scheme. It was also specified with the full Baja Bronco conversion package, which added dual shocks all around, 15x8.5\" wheels, a roll bar, rubberized steering wheel, rear fender flares, and a branded spare tire cover and decals. A Stroppe auxiliary transmission cooler was also installed at the Stroppe facility during the conversion. The truck was sold new through Friendly Ford of Fresno, California, and remained with the first owner in the Fresno area until his passing in 2015. The current owner purchased the truck in 2017, and work completed in 2020 included re-trimming the Parchment vinyl seats, replacing the floor pans, overhauling the suspension and power steering system, and rebuilding the 302ci V8, the three-speed automatic transmission, and the dual-range transfer case. This Baja Bronco is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a Deluxe Marti Report, letters from Baja Broncos Unlimited, service records since the 1970s, and a clean California title in the owner's name.",

    "description": "The Aprilia SR line of scooters, especially the larger 150s and 160s, has been synonymous with sporty Italian design, fun demeanour and strong performance. What they have also been known for is their rather single-minded approach to performance and being priced on the higher side, more so in the BS6 era than ever. Enter the SR 175, Aprilia’s latest sporty scooter that aims to rectify some of these issues.  But before we begin to talk about the scooter itself, I must stress how unusual it is that Aprilia India hasn't officially launched the SR 175 yet but strangely, customer deliveries have begun! One of these new customers has very kindly loaned us his scooter for a review, which is how this story has been possible.   Aprilia SR 175 design and features - 8/10 Striking bodywork unchanged from before; gets two new colours The Aprilia SR 175’s sharp and angular bodywork is almost identical to the SR 160, and this design is now the better part of a decade old, but it still manages to turn heads and stand out in the sea of humdrum commuters on our roads. The SR 175 gets two new colours – white/red and purple/red – both of which are inspired by the RS 457 sportbike.  The SR's colour palette is the same as the RS 457's. While the design remains unchanged, what has seen a step up from before is the feature set. And all of that is primarily down to the crisp new 5-inch TFT display – also borrowed from the RS 457 – and brand-new switchgear to control all the functions. This colour TFT replaces the rather basic and dull-looking monotone LCD on the SR 160 and brings in things such as turn-by-turn navigation, call/message alerts, as well as music playback control once you connect your smartphone to the display via Aprilia’s proprietary app. The inclusion of this colour TFT dash now makes the Aprilia one of a handful of ICE scooters – besides TVS’ Jupiter 125 and Ntorq and Honda’s Activa and Dio models – to have this feature.   The 5-in colour TFT is borrowed from the RS 457 but has a new layout. The new dash is bright and can automatically switch between day and night modes, depending on ambient light. There are also two display modes, with all the above functions only available to use in the ‘Digital’ mode. I personally prefer the clean and uncluttered look of the ‘Analogic’ mode, which has a faux round speedometer and a needle. The overall UI/UX is fairly straightforward for nearly all functions, and no secret handshakes are needed here.  However, convenience-enhancing features, such as a multi-function ignition key slot, a cubby on the front apron, a brake-lock clasp, an external fuel filler and start/stop tech or even a quiet start, are missing. Boot space has never been an Aprilia SR’s forte, and the 175 is no different – you’ll struggle to get even an Indian half-face helmet in there.  Underseat storage not as spacious as that of a conventional scooter. Then, there are other issues specific to our test scooter. The side stand cut-off doesn’t seem to work, and a whine comes from the front wheel once you get rolling, which we feel appears to be down to a moving mechanical part that hasn’t been greased well. On what is a Rs 1.50 lakh scooter (on-road, Mumbai), these things will leave a customer wanting and reduce its feel-good factor.  Aprilia SR 175 performance and efficiency - 8/10 Packs in strong and eager performance; reasonably fuel-efficient, too But once you swing a leg over and start riding, the SR 175 will have you grinning ear to ear. It’s eager from the word go and is great fun accelerating away from stop lights and leaving traffic behind! Aprilia has enlarged the SR 160’s engine to create this new 174.7cc mill, which makes 12.9hp at 7,200rpm and 14.14Nm of torque at 6,000rpm – a discernible step up from the previous 11.27hp at 7,100rpm and 13.44Nm at 5,300rpm.  EngineEngine174.70cc, single-cyl, air-cooledPower12.9hp at 7,200rpmTorque14.14Nm of torque at 6,000rpm The power delivery, while strong, is smooth as well as predictable, and younger riders will benefit from that. There’s no sudden surge of power, and it has a measured yet strong pull all the way to a speedo-indicated 90kph. The SR 175's riding experience in a nutshell: fun! In our tests, the SR 175 was quite close to the Yamaha Aerox 155 in the sprint to 60kph, after which the more powerful Japanese scooter starts increasing the gap. This is commendable performance from the Aprilia’s simpler 3-valve, air-cooled engine, and what also pleasantly surprised us was its fuel efficiency. It returned an impressive 41.7kpl out on the highway and a decent 35.2kpl inside the city. For the sort of engine this is and the performance on tap, these numbers are commendable.  PerformanceAcceleration0-40kph2.76s0-60kph5.69sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph2.88s30-70kph6.37s50-80kph7.37s The Aprilia SR’s engine has always been a gruff thing, and while that character continues onto the 175, its refinement isn’t a dealbreaker. There is some juddering below 20kph, especially so with small or constant throttle inputs, but once you open the taps, this engine becomes reasonably smooth with just a mild tingle in the floorboard. Our scooter had less than 500km on the odo, so perhaps this could improve after performing the first service.  Aprilia SR 175 ergonomics and comfort - 7/10 It can feel tight for bigger riders; suspension is firm, not harsh Focused and sporty scooters like this can’t match the outright comfort and spacious nature of mainstream practical offerings. The Aprilia SR 175 follows that theme to some extent, but it isn’t as single-minded as its predecessors. Its sloped rider’s seat, which forces you to adjust your seating position every so often, continues into 2025, and it isn’t the most spacious or well-padded unit around. But its suspension comfort has proven to be an area of surprise.  Fuel economyCity35.21kplHighway41.78kplOverall38.50kpl The first day of riding the SR 175 entailed going from Andheri in Mumbai’s western suburbs to Panvel East. Traversing the breadth of the monsoon-ravaged city, I’m happy to say that the SR’s suspension kept me reasonably comfortable as I encountered an unceasing barrage of road imperfections. Of course, it’s still a sporty scooter with taut suspension, but it’s not as downright uncomfortable as the Aerox. The sloping seat forces you to reposition yourself every so often. The SR 175 is quite a tall thing by scooter standards, and while I, at 5’11”, didn’t have any issues with flat-footing it, I foresee that to be a challenge for anyone under 5’7”. Riders with bigger feet will also wish for a little more room on the floorboard, as I felt my feet had little wiggle room and felt quite locked in place. I wear size 12 shoes, so I’m on the larger end of the spectrum, and this is a subjective thing.  Aprilia SR 175 ride and handling - 7/10 14-inch wheels lend stability and confidence when leaned over Sporty handling and surefooted manners at high speeds have always been the Aprilia SR line-up’s forte, and the 175 happily continues that trend. The large 14-inch wheels shod with chunky 120-section rubber inspire loads of confidence when chucking the SR 175 into a bend, and the scooter stays planted no matter the size of the bump on the road. Vee Rubber tyres are rather average in the wet. These Vee Rubber tyres are rather average, however, and Aprilia also offers MRF and CEAT as tyre suppliers, both of which fare better in terms of grip and feedback, although what your scooter comes equipped with is entirely a game of luck.  BrakingBraking (60-0kph)19.18m Stopping performance, too, is superb, and it feels like this scooter wants you to brake like you’re on a motorcycle. The front brake has a strong yet progressive bite and shoulders the majority of the load, with the rear drum brake mainly there to keep you steady. Just like the SR 160, the SR 175 comes with a single-channel ABS as standard, and while this safety feature works well for the most part, it feels like it intervenes a little too early when you clamp down hard on the binders and robs you of power. The 14-inch wheels lend the SR a motorcycle-like planted feel. Aprilia SR 175 price and verdict - 8/10 A lot more scooter for not a lot more money  By now, we’ve established that the SR 175 is a perceivable step up over its predecessor. Happily, you get this improved experience without having to pay extra, and in Mumbai, the SR 175’s ex-showroom price is Rs 1.26 lakh, which is more or less on par with the top SR 160’s asking price. Considering that there’s really no petrol scooter in this space (the Yamaha Aerox now costs over Rs 1.50 lakh), the Aprilia SR 175 makes a rather compelling case for itself.  Aprilia SR 175 left rear static in field Its performance and sporting ability are attributes few other scooters can match. Its striking good looks and fancy TFT display add to its allure, and it isn’t entirely impractical. Areas of improvement are more to do with the company rather than the product itself – a small Aprilia dealer network limits availability, and service will generally be more expensive and quite likely not as frictionless as for scooters from other brands.   PricePrice (ex-showroom, Mumbai)Rs 1.26 lakh However, if you’re willing to look past that, the Aprilia SR 175 is a thoroughly enjoyable scooter at a fair price that will stand out in the crowd.",

    "description": "In line with Toyota’s global ambition to reduce the carbon footprint of its entire line-up, the Japanese carmaker has introduced ‘Neo Drive’ variants of the Fortuner and Legender in India. The highlight of these variants is a 48-volt mild-hybrid system paired with the 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine, aimed at improving fuel efficiency. Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Exterior Design \u0026 Engineering — 8/10 Besides a badge on the boot, there are no other cosmetic changes to this variant. New 'Neo Drive' badge marks out the mild-hybrid variants of the Fortuner. There are no styling changes to the Fortuner Neo Drive variants – it continues with the familiar slim headlights, prominent chrome grille and signature kinked window line. The only distinguishing element is the new ‘Neo Drive’ badge positioned beneath the Sigma 4 emblem on the tailgate. Despite its age, the Fortuner remains a handsome, imposing SUV with immense road presence. Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Interior Space \u0026 Comfort — 7/10 While the interiors feel built to last, neither the design nor the quality feels up to the mark. The Fortuner’s interior design has remained largely unchanged for 9 years now. Climbing into the high-set cabin still takes some effort, but once inside, the front seats offer excellent comfort and a commanding driving position. The second row is spacious and features recline and slide adjustments, while the third row can also accommodate adults for extended durations. However, the cabin design feels dated, having remained largely unchanged for nine years. The material quality, too, doesn’t quite match expectations for a vehicle at this price point. While everything feels built to last, the premium quotient is lacking. Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Features \u0026 Safety — 8/10 Fairly well-equipped, but the deletion of ventilated seats feels like an unfortunate compromise. The Neo Drive variants bring two new features to the Fortuner line-up: a 360-degree camera and a Multi-Terrain Select (MTS) system. That said, the camera quality is underwhelming for a vehicle in this segment. The MTS system offers selectable off-road modes to enhance capability across various surfaces like Mud, Sand, Rock, Dirt and Snow, by altering throttle responses, braking and traction control. The 360-degree camera is a new addition, but its resolution is underwhelming.  A new wireless charging pad has also been added, carried over from the Legender. Surprisingly, ventilated front seats have been dropped, a step backwards given they’re still offered on lower variants. Toyota attributes this to packaging challenges, as the DC-DC converter for the mild-hybrid system sits beneath the front passenger seat.  New Multi-Terrain Select (MTS) system offers selectable off-road modes. Other notable features include auto LED headlamps, 18-inch alloy wheels, leatherette upholstery, an 8-inch touchscreen, dual-zone climate control, and a powered tailgate. Safety equipment comprises 7 airbags (including a driver knee airbag), vehicle stability control, hill descent control, and hill start assist. However, no variant offers Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Engine Refinement \u0026 Performance — 7/10 There’s no getting away from the grumbly diesel engine sound, and the benefits of the mild-hybrid system are negligible. The powertrain remains the same 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine producing 204hp and 500Nm of torque, paired with a 6-speed torque converter automatic. What’s new is a 48-volt mild-hybrid system comprising a belt-integrated starter generator, a DC-DC converter and a secondary lithium-ion battery. Toyota Fortuner mild-hybrid specsEngine 4-cylinder, turbocharged Displacement 2,755cc Drive layout Four-wheel drive Gearbox 6-speed torque converter Power 204hp Torque 500Nm Mild-hybrid system 48V 0-100kph (tested) 11.8 seconds Key functions include auto engine start-stop, torque assist under load and brake energy regeneration. On startup, the engine feels noticeably smoother and quieter, and the initial throttle response is more refined. However, that sense of diesel grumble quickly returns at mid and higher revs. Around town, tapping the accelerator sends the revs soaring to 2,000rpm with minimal corresponding acceleration, resulting in a droning sound reminiscent of a CVT, even though this is a torque converter (automatic) setup. New mild-hybrid system has made the initial throttle response a little more refined. Performance-wise, the Fortuner remains strong. The mild-hybrid assist is subtle and barely perceptible under regular driving. Our GPS-based test clocked a 0-100kph time of 11.8 seconds with three passengers onboard – 0.2 seconds quicker than the older BS4 Fortuner 4x4 AT. Drive modes include Eco, Normal and Sport, with the MTS system adding further adaptability for off-road terrain. Despite the added hybrid hardware, located beneath the seats in the cabin, the Fortuner retains its impressive 700mm water-wading capability. Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Mileage — 6/10 The 48V mild-hybrid system barely enhances fuel efficiency. Toyota hasn’t officially disclosed the fuel economy figures for the Fortuner Neo Drive 4x4 AT. However, the company claims the new mild-hybrid system allows for an additional 43 kilometres on a full 80-litre tank. This translates to a minimal real-world gain, and for a vehicle of this size and price, the improvement feels marginal at best. Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Ride Comfort \u0026 Handling — 6/10 Feels indestructible, although handling isn’t its strong suit. The Fortuner continues to feel bulletproof in its construction. The suspension setup is rugged and built to take a beating, making light work of bad roads and rough terrain. However, that toughness comes at the cost of comfort. Ride quality, especially at lower speeds, feels bumpy and unsettled. Ride quality at low speeds is unsettled.  Its tall stance and high centre of gravity also contribute to noticeable body roll during cornering, pronounced nose dive under braking, and a generally top-heavy feel. The heavy steering further adds to the effort required at low speeds or while parking. Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive Price \u0026 Verdict — 6/10 While feature additions are welcome, the negligible benefits of the mild-hybrid system and deletion of ventilated seats don’t justify the price increase. Toyota has introduced the Neo Drive mild-hybrid system exclusively with the 4x4 automatic variants of the Fortuner and Legender, priced at Rs 44.72 lakh and Rs 50.09 lakh, respectively. These updated variants are around Rs 2 lakh more expensive than the now-discontinued standard 4x4 AT versions. According to Toyota, this price hike is unlikely to deter price-agnostic buyers, who typically opt for the top-end versions of the SUV. Interestingly, the range-topping Fortuner GR-S misses out on this mild-hybrid upgrade. The mild-hybrid system has increased the prices of 4x4 AT variants by about Rs 2 lakh.  While fuel efficiency has never been a key concern for Fortuner buyers, the addition of a 48V mild-hybrid system brings little real-world improvement on that front. What’s more disappointing is the deletion of ventilated front seats in these mild-hybrid variants, likely due to packaging constraints – especially since this feature continues to be available in the lower variants. This raises the question: why fix it if it ain’t broken? However, there isn’t a credible direct alternative to the Fortuner, and even though there are more refined and better-equipped cars available, none offer the same brand equity, reputation for reliability, or rugged appeal as the Fortuner. That’s precisely why, despite ever-rising prices and visible shortcomings, it continues to keep Toyota’s cash registers ringing in India. Also See: Toyota Fortuner Neo Drive video review",

    "title": "Why the Skoda Superb is a 5-star car",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advertising-promotions-promoted-by-skoda/why-skoda-superb-5-star-car",
    "description": "The outstanding Superb impresses with its roomy, pleasant interior, frugal engines and great driving manners Some things in life are hard to achieve. Hitting a hole in one? A fantasy for most. Even getting a toddler dressed and out the door on time is a challenge. And getting a five-star review from Autocar? That’s seriously tough. So it’s no small feat that the new Skoda Superb has managed to bag that elusive top-tier verdict.  Such an accolade is a recognition of the ingenuity and dedication of the people tasked with developing the new Superb, a car that is designed to be comfortable, easy to live with and efficient – exactly what customers demand of a large hatchback and estate car. Skoda has really listened to what buyers of such cars want. And that’s why it’s so highly regarded by the Autocar editorial team. Here are five standout features that earned the Superb a five-star rating. Learn more about the Skoda Superb #1 Vast cabin space Talk about a legacy to live up to. Ever since the first modern-era Superb was launched in 2001, the car’s USP has been enormous cabin space, an attribute given even more precedence when the Superb Estate was released in 2009. Big shoes to fill, but the new Superb doesn’t just match the achievements of its predecessors, it expands on them. To that end, the latest Superb is truly vast. It’s the sort of car that would make dignitaries feel special, and if a company sent a chauffeur in a Superb to pick you up, you’d feel like they really valued your business. As Autocar writes: “By our measurements, typical rear leg room has increased by 65mm over the outgoing model – already a very spacious car. The flat estate roofline means that head room is generous, too.” Better still, the new Superb truly feels every bit as roomy as its dimensions suggest, as Autocar notes: “The cabin space combines with large side windows to make for a real sense of space, as well as outstanding visibility.” The new Superb also majors on luggage space. The hatchback model offers an enormous load area of 645 litres when all five seats are in use, and 1195 litres when the rear seats are folded flat. Meanwhile, the Superb Estate offers 695 litres with the rear seats raised, and 1145 litres when they’re folded down.  Autocar continues: “As befits a Skoda, the boot has plenty of pop-out hooks and bins, and there are two levers to fold the rear seats down.” In other words, ease of use has been placed front and centre in the new Skoda Superb. #2 Excellent ride and handling It’s tough to have a truly broad appeal when it comes to the way a car drives, because everyone wants something slightly different. And the risk a car runs in trying to appeal to everyone is that it comes across as being neither one thing nor the other.  Not the Skoda Superb, which manages to have real driver appeal at the same time as being truly comfortable. As Autocar states: “The new Superb is neither overtly sporty nor exquisitely comfortable, but it lives in the crowd-pleasing middle ground,” before adding: “It has gained a dash of driver appeal.” The car’s suspension manages to isolate occupants from deteriorating road surfaces while keeping the body under complete control. During performance testing, Autocar noted: “A few laps of the Millbrook Hill Route showed the Superb to remain composed even at higher speed, staying unaffected by the severe compressions.” Your connection with any car is fundamentally through the steering wheel, and here the new Superb comes up trumps, because it has a steering system that’s “intuitively geared and gradually builds weight as you load up the suspension in a corner, giving you plenty of confidence in the car’s road-holding.” High praise indeed. And the Superb is equally adept in built-up areas, with Autocar commenting on how easy it is to manoeuvre, saying: “The steering’s strong self-centring effect and the impeccably round wheel help, too.” #3 Attractive running costs The Skoda Superb engine range truly has something for everyone. It starts with a 150PS 1.5-litre TSI petrol engine that emits just 117g/km of CO2, and which manages a WLTP combined average of 56.5mpg in the hatchback version. The next petrol engine in the hatchback range is the 204PS 2.0 TSI, which achieves a CO2 output of 151g/km and can do 40.4mpg. The top petrol engine in the range is the 265PS 2.0 TSI, which is linked to Skoda’s four-wheel-drive system as standard, and which emits 175g/km and still manages an amazing 35.3mpg – all while having the sort of performance that allows the Superb hatchback to accelerate from 0-62mph in 5.6 seconds and hit a top speed of 155mph. Skoda also knows that there is still a place for diesel in the world today, so offers the Superb with a 2.0-litre turbodiesel engine in two states of tune, with 150PS or 193PS. The former emits as little as 127g/km and can do an official 56.5mpg in the hatch, or 153g/km and 47.1mpg in the four-wheel-drive estate version. Autocar was deeply impressed with the Superb’s economy, stating: “Our entry-level 2.0 diesel’s real-world fuel economy was excellent. Over the course of our test, including the performance testing, it averaged 52.7mpg, and in regular use 60mpg was easily achievable.” And finally, the 1.5 TSI iV plug-in hybrid model offers a fully electric range of 83 miles, and emissions of 7g/km, which places the car in the super-low 6% band of Benefit-in-Kind taxation – perfect for business drivers.  #4 Clever, intuitive infotainment There’s a large 13in touchscreen front and centre in every Superb, through which you are easily able to control a vast array of the car’s systems, including audio functions, mobile phone mirroring, and satellite-navigation, which includes traffic reports. Autocar’s testers are fans, saying: “The home screen has customisable tiles that let you keep the navigation and the media on screen at all times. At the top of the screen is a bar of configurable shortcuts that gives you direct access to functions like the start-stop system and the auto hold. It works quickly and logically.” Indeed, the system perfectly complements the 10.25in virtual cockpit that comes as standard on every Superb, and which has three different layouts depending on your preference. And if you have a SportLine-spec Superb, it also seamlessly integrates with the head-up display. Skoda has also been truly innovative by developing three clever Smart Dials on the dashboard. The pair of outside dials allow you to control various aspects of the cabin ventilation system, including temperature and airflow direction, plus the heated seats. The centre dial, meanwhile, allows you to control functions such as the car’s driving modes, audio volume, and even zoom in on the satellite-navigation system’s map. Autocar was full of praise, saying: “It’s a brilliantly simple, yet tactile and intuitive system.\" #5 Luxury equipment As we said earlier, the new Skoda Superb is the sort of car that would make anyone, including dignitaries, feel special. It does this not only through being luxuriously spacious, but also by having a high-end ambience, which is partially achieved by the comprehensive standard equipment it features. For example, the SE Technology entry point to the range comes with heated and massaging front seats, wireless smartphone charging, LED lights front and rear, parking sensors at both ends, a rearview camera, adaptive cruise control and self-dimming interior and driver’s side mirrors. As Autocar says: “You needn’t spend more to get a fully featured family car.” But if you do, the next trim level up, SE L, adds matrix LED headlights, electric memory seats, keyless entry, leather seats and an electrically operated tailgate with kick-to-open function, while SportLine trim adds niceties such as Progressive dynamic steering and Dynamic chassis control plus, as well as sports seats with massaging function and a self-parking system. The top-spec Laurin \u0026 Klement models feature unique interior trims, and seats with an Advanced Massage Function. Verdict Autocar perfectly sums up the Skoda Superb when it says: “By sticking to the essentials – space, efficiency, ease of use and intuitive driving characteristics – and doing those well, Skoda has produced a car that is outstandingly fit for purpose, makes the case for the estate car like few current rivals and does it at a price that significantly undercuts its competition.” It’s a car that has been designed to make living with it easy, but also to make owners feel more than a little special about their choice. Sounds simple, but it’s remarkably difficult to do. And it’s something that Skoda has undoubtedly managed with a car that is simply superb. Learn more about the Skoda Superb",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/developments-china-mean-self-driving-closer-ever",
    "description": "ADAS features are gradually increasing in sophistication in the slow move to self-driving Autonomous driving and the technology behind it played a significant part at this year's Shanghai motor show. For over a decade, the industry has believed that there won’t be a sudden leap from conventional cars to fully automated self-driving cars. Instead, it has expected ADAS features to gradually increase in sophistication until they become capable of taking over control of the car. Currently, the focus for car makers and suppliers is the transition from level two to level three, as laid down by the SAE’s six levels of driving automation. Up to level two (like the latest adaptive cruise control with steering input and lane-keeping), the driver is always ‘driving’ when assistance features are engaged. But at level three, the car is doing the driving unless it asks the driver to take back control. In reality, the lines are blurred and the industry is talking about level two-plus and level two-plus-plus, which are creeping rather than leaping to level three. According to Volkswagen, which showed its latest AI-powered ADAS features in Shanghai, level two-plus is expected to be in over 80% of Chinese vehicles by 2030 and level two-plus-plus, which handles urban as well as highway driving, in 75% of new vehicles. Volkswagen is bringing level two-plus to the road this year and level two-plus-plus with Urban Navigate on Autopilot (NoA) will be launched next year. ZF has developed several ‘transitional’ level-two features as well. For example, its level-twoplus coDrive has 360deg camera perception to enable hands- and feet-free driving as well as automated lane-changing. It has already lined up a product called coPilot, which covers level two-plus to level four and includes automated overtaking, all-round sensing of the environment, garage parking and route learning. Continental showed two solutions, called Luna and Astra. Luna is an entry-level system with ADAS features and parking functions. Astra supports more advanced level two-plus-plus driving functions and can cope with a wide range of scenarios. It also has NoA, which, says Continental, can cope with China’s complex urban road environment and covers narrow road detour avoidance and left and right turns where there are no traffic lights. It can also deal with on/off ramps. Behind the tech are its intelligent driving sensors, including sixth-generation radar and cameras. It has a single-radar autonomous emergency braking solution that meets China’s standards and it’s introducing an AI-powered night-vision camera. Given the popularity of autonomous driving in China, the scale of the market should help speed its development. China sold more new cars in March this year (1.97 million) than the UK did in all of 2024.",

    "description": "The color black has been a staple of motorcycle customization for as long as the art form has existed, but it’s often overused. While it’s tempting to murder a bike out from head to toe, the results can look cheap and nasty. The trick is to add some contrast—like Reier Motors has done with this Honda CB350 café racer. Based in Salzburg, Austria, Reier Motors is a full-service workshop that handles everything from maintenance to full-on custom builds. The 1973-model CB350 was booked in by a client with a short list of requests. “He wanted café racer styling with black all over, except on the engine and exhaust system, and he wanted some special details,” explains the shop’s founder, Christian Reier.…",

    "description": "Taiwan’s blossoming custom motorcycle scene regularly introduces us to domestic-market bikes that would be considered obscure almost anywhere else. The Kymco KTR 150 is a firm favorite among local workshops, as are the humble commuter machines from Hartford. Another nimble runabout has just emerged from under the radar: the Suzuki BS125. Manufactured in Taiwan during the 1980s and sold exclusively on the local market, the Suzuki BS125 was a single-cylinder, two-stroke motorcycle that quickly gained popularity among delivery riders. This 1985-model BS125 belongs to Chiu—a designer at the Taiwanese parts company Fangster, who also runs a multidisciplinary industrial design studio on the side under the handle ZEROVECTOR. The story of the ZEROVECTOR Suzuki BS125 goes back a decade, to when Chiu was still at university.…",

    "description": "We’ve already discussed how the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will potentially benefit buyers of imported (CBU) cars in India.

No duty on India-made EVs, hybrids imported in the UK Benefits will come into effect from the sixth year onwards Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, Tata Motors and Mahindra could gain India-UK FTA: Customs duty on made-in-India EVs, hybrids explained  As per this agreement, made-in-India electric vehicles (EVs), hybrids and hydrogen-powered vehicles will be eligible for import into the United Kingdom free of customs duty from January 1 of the sixth year. From the sixth year, 17,600 vehicles will be eligible for this benefit, and this quota will steadily increase to 88,000 units by the fifteenth year. However, this customs waiver will not apply to made-in-India vehicles costing above GBP 80,000 in the 15-year horizon. As per the agreement, passenger vehicles are bifurcated into four categories based on their cost, insurance and freight (CIF): under GBP 20,000, GBP 20,000-40,000, GBP 40,000-80,000 and above GBP 80,000.

Further, the company is also developing smaller series hybrid vehicles that could be exported to the UK. Other manufacturers that could potentially benefit from this agreement in the years to come include Toyota, Mahindra and Tata Motors. While neither Mahindra nor Tata Motors currently exports EVs to the UK, this pact could certainly help these homegrown companies gain a foothold in the UK, a market where Tata Motors once sold its products.    Also see: Commuter bike sales fall as premium bikes gain traction in Q1 FY2026 Tesla DC Supercharger network to come to India Hero MotoCorp to enter UK and Europe with Vida VX2",
