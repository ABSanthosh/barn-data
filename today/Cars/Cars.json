    "description": "This 1967 Maserati Ghibli is one of 1,170 coupes manufactured during six years of production and was produced in July 1967 before delivery to Rolma Automobili S.r.l. in Milan, Italy. Chassis 042 is said to have been purchased in the early 1970s by an owner whose family retained it for several decades. The car was later purchased in 2018 by its current owner, who moved it from the US to Belgium and kept it in storage for seven years before a recommissioning was performed. Finished in silver over red, the car is powered by a 4.7-liter quad-cam V8 that breathes through four Weber carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. Additional features include servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, independent front suspension, center-lock 15” Campagnolo wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt radio. This Tipo AM115 is now offered as a running project on dealer consignment in Roeselare, Belgium, with Maserati Classiche documents, copies of its factory build sheet and shipping notice, a tool kit, and Belgian registration that lists a 1969 date of first registration.",

    "description": "The full-fat Range Rover is going all-electric for the first time, but will it be any good? We drive a prototype to find some clues This is the new electric Range Rover, in still-secret prototype form. And we've driven it off-road. Join Matt Saunders here as he guides you through the new Range Rover EV's technical details, some of which are still to be confirmed. What we can tell you is that it'll have two motors, one at each end, totalling 542bhp. There's a 118kWh battery underneath the car too, which because it's a stressed element helps make this the strongest Range Rover yet built. It may well be the heaviest too, but we'll know more about that when final details are released, ahead of the car's launch this coming autumn. For now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the sound of silence as this exceptionally quiet EV goes about its off-roading business.

    "description": "Eight years after the Jaguar I-Pace, we drive JLR's second all-electric model: a Range Rover like none of its line Right now, 2.8-tonnes of high-end automotive real estate is gently picking and clambering its way up a dusty, rocky forest track. It’s doing so in a part of rural Herefordshire where its various predecessors have been brought to earn their stripes for decades, as one of the most celebrated lineages in British car-making has advanced: that of the Range Rover. We are at JLR’s Eastnor Castle offroad development and demonstration centre, and we’ve come for our very first taste of arguably the very boldest full-sized ‘Rangey’ there has ever been.The Range Rover Electric is JLR’s first EV since the Jaguar I-Pace of 2018. It will be introduced to the global market later in 2025, at a time of uncertainty for the wider adoption of electric cars. And yet there’s an equanimity about this car’s execution, and an authenticity about its identity, that suggests it’ll do alright whichever way the wind of public opinion happens to blow.That’s because, rather than a novelty item, this car derives its strength from being just another Range Rover. It won’t replace or supplant any other Range Rover derivative; and nobody will be obliged, cajoled or persuaded to buy one. It’s an extension of the Range Rover model line, to be sold alongside the various petrol, diesel and PHEV derivatives that already exist; and designed to be every inch as capable, luxurious, enveloping and special as any of them.",

    "description": "While no one doubts motorcycles and fashion have been playing in the same sandbox since the beginning, visit some of today’s custom motorcycle shows and you’ll quickly discover a bit of confusion over the difference between what is fashion and what is style, both from modern and vintage custom machines. Walking the alleys of a motorcycle show recently, I’m pushing through what feels a bit homogenized. Sometimes it’s hard for the eye to make a connection to something new and fresh. After a few hours, I finally brake hard at a BMW custom. Surprised by what I’m looking at, my slow brain fires off a foolish thought: This must be the new BMW modern classic that I haven’t heard about yet (that no one is talking about).…",

We also take a look at the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC, and a custom Indian Chieftain PowerPlus, built by an ex-freestyle motocrosser for a pro skateboarder. Brough Superior x Richard Mille RMB01 In what might seem like an unlikely alliance, boutique motorcycle brand Brough Superior, and prestigious watchmaking company Richard Mille, have teamed up to create a very special machine—the Brough Superior RMB01. Dive a little deeper into the history of both brands, though, and you’ll see that, just like high-end luxury timepieces, limited-production, hand-built motorcycles are constructed with meticulous craftsmanship and care. Both disciplines require the use of cutting-edge technology and are a labor of love, rather than a way to make a quick buck.…",

    "description": "It’s always refreshing when riding gear blends into your routine without demanding attention, and over the past month or so, that’s exactly what the Raida UrbanR riding shoes have done. They’re pitched as casual shoes with light protection, and while that mostly holds true, there are a few nuances worth noting. Raida’s own website suggests going a size down, and I found this accurate. Thankfully, there’s almost no break-in needed – within two days, they felt quite natural. My usage was mostly city commutes with a few highway runs, and that’s where the UrbanRs shine. I wouldn’t use these for aggressive riding or off-road. But for everyday duties, they balance on-bike function with off-bike comfort. The top of the shoe can dig into your shin a bit if your bike has rear-set pegs, but overall comfort is decent. Despite Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, the mesh does its job. Protection-wise, there’s reinforcement at the ankle, heel and toe, plus SAS-TEC ankle inserts rated to EN13634. It’s not touring boot-level protection but good enough for city use. The ATOP dial and Velcro strap feel secure and hassle-free. Grip levels are fine on dry ground and on the bike, though not ideal on wet tiles or mossy sidewalks.  Glove-friendly lacing system can be used with one hand. They’ll handle a light drizzle, but anything more, and water seeps in – a natural trade-off for the breathability. That said, they’ve held up well, with no scuffing or visible wear, and they’re easy to clean. At Rs 7,000, they’re solid value when you consider most riding boots cost twice as much. You’re getting sneaker-like pricing with proper motorcycling protection. I’d recommend them to daily commuters or casual riders who are on their feet a lot. A small nitpick – the shoe looks a tad too bulky at the top, making the upper look a bit bulbous. Not a dealbreaker, but something to note. All in all, the Raida UrbanR is a well-rounded, commuter-focused riding shoe that nails the basics – comfort, breathability and light protection.

    "description": "SUVs, big and small, are all the rage, but there’s another story developing on the sidelines – the rise of MPVs. MPVs outsold sedans in India last year, and there’s record interest in the body style high up the price ladder, too. Kia’s Rs 64 lakh (ex-showroom) Carnivalis sold out for the year, while Toyota delivered over 1,000 units of the Rs 1.22 crore Vellfire over the past 12 months. It’s customers like these who are happy to spend big on an MPV that MG wants to win over with its own luxury MPV. Meet the M9. MG hasn’t announced prices as yet, but it has hinted that the M9 will slot in right between the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. Giving the M9 more distinction is the fact that it’s the first all-electric luxury MPV in India. As you’d imagine, there’s a lot to talk about.   MG M9 exterior design and engineering - 7/10 At 5.27 metres long, 2 metres wide and 1.8 metres tall, the MG M9 is massive. For perspective, it’s longer and wider than the Carnival and Vellfire. The 3.2-metre-long wheelbase is huge in its own right and hints at the space inside. At 5.27 metres, the M9 is longer than a Carnival and Vellfire.  In its basic shape, the M9 is boxy to allow maximum cabin space. It’s not a looker, but then again, MPVs are all about what they are like on the inside rather than visual appeal. The front end is home to slim daytime running lamps up top, main headlights lower down on the bumper and a large grille at the base, with generous use of chrome to add some flash. This being an EV means the bonnet lifts to reveal storage – a handy 55-litre frunk in the M9’s case. 19-inch wheels and a stylistic chrome finish at the window line help uplift the slab-like sides. At the back, if the size doesn’t do it, the lighting that drops down at the side will surely help identify an M9.    Under the bonnet is a 55-litre frunk. The M9 uses a monocoque construction and positions its 90kWh NMC battery pack under the floor. The battery powers a front motor that drives the front wheels. The MG M9’s 19-inch rims come wrapped in Continental Contiseal tyres. What makes these tyres special is a viscous sealant layer that self-seals punctures up to 5mm.  19-inch rims come wrapped in self-healing tyres.   MG M9 interior space and comfort - 9/10 Access to the M9’s middle row is via powered sliding doors that can be opened with a button on the door, the key fob or controls near the driver. It’s a slight step up into the cabin, but a large grab handle at the B-pillar does help the journey in. The doors open to a massive cabin, and what gets you first are the middle-row seats. XL-sized, beautifully cushioned and finished in perforated leather and suede, the seats – scratch that – armchairs immediately establish the M9’s core competency: delivering a VIP experience for the boss seated at the back. M9's middle-row seats are more like armchairs. The standard seat position is comfy in its own right, and there’s a 16-way power adjust, too, to control everything from backrest recline and headrest height to seat slide and leg-rest position. One-touch functions make the job of setting the seat easier. For the full effect, you need to experience the seats at maximum extension (made possible with the middle-row seat all the way back and the front passenger seat electrically slid forward). With the backrest at full recline and leg rest rolled out, the seat feels no less than a recliner. Oh, and there’s seat ventilation and heating, too, as well as eight soothing massage functions to choose from. The experience is every bit business class on land. In standard position, the middle-row seats are already very comfortable. While middle seat comfort is central to the M9’s appeal, the experience at the very back is pretty good, too. You’ll have to make your way to the third row via the passage between the middle row chairs. It’s not quite a walk-in and is convenient enough as far as third rows go. The seating position is comfortable, and there’s room for three average-sized adults to sit in comfort. Unusually, there’s no middle seat headrest or fold-down armrest for the third row. Also note that the third row is all but unusable with the middle row seats fully extended. Stretching out the seats to their max gives a recliner-like experience. What’s noteworthy is that front seat occupants have it nice, too. The seats are fully powered and also pack in heating, ventilation and massage functions. The driver environment does take some getting used to, partly because of the M9’s sheer size and partly because of the layout of the controls – the gear selector sits on the right stalk behind the steering, while the left stalk is for lights and wipers. Third row has space for three adults but no middle seat headrest. The M9’s dash is neatly done, but the flush finish to the climate control functions on the dash panel looks better than it is in practice.   MG M9 features and safety - 9/10 The M9 is offered in a single fully loaded variant. And MG has really gone the distance to pamper those seated at the back. As mentioned, the seats are fully powered with ventilation, heating and massage functions. There’s 64-colour ambient lighting, a dedicated climate control zone for the middle row, an on-board air purifier, a panoramic sunroof for the cabin’s rear section and a sweet-sounding 13-speaker JBL sound system. Plus, you can also get rear entertainment screens as an accessory. Middle-row passengers get a dedicated climate zone and panoramic sunroof. Seat adjustment, cooling and lighting functions are controlled by a screen on the middle seat armrests. The trouble is that the fixed position of the screen makes it hard to read in some lighting conditions and hard to reach when the backrest is all the way back. MG should have also provided powered sun shades for middle-row windows. The manual operation isn’t in keeping with the M9’s price. On the subject, there are no sun shades for the third-row windows, and that means middle-seat passengers will feel the heat on their faces at full recline. Armrest-mounted screen controls seat, cooling and lighting functions. Up front, you also get dual-zone climate control and a single-pane sunroof. Taking pride of place on the dash is a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay and eSIM-based connected tech. The 7-inch digital dials, in comparison, look small and basic. What is nicely done is the digital mirror. It relays a feed from a rear camera and gives a crisp view of the world behind. Touchscreen measures 12.3 inches; it supports wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay. The MG M9 hasn’t been rated by Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP as yet, but it’s reassuring to know that the big MPV is a 5-star Euro NCAP car. As standard, the M9 gets seven airbags, ESC, all-around disc brakes, Isofix child seat mounts, a tyre pressure monitor and a 360-degree camera (the resolution is so-so). Camera- and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are included as well. Functions such as lane-departure assist worked well on the smooth and well-marked roads in Goa. Also part of the package is a driver attention system that monitors drowsiness and distractions like mobile use and even smoking!     MG M9 performance and refinement - 8/10 Power delivery is strong and nicely measured out. The MG M9 has a front axle-mounted motor that puts out 245hp and 350Nm of torque. There are Normal, Eco and Sport drive modes also, but all that doesn’t transform this luxury cruiser into a rocket ship, and that’s a very good thing. All too often, all manner of EVs dump their power in one go for wild acceleration, just because an EV can. But not the M9. Make no mistake, though. It’s not slow; a sub-10-second 0 to 100kph time is what should be possible, and that’s quick enough. What’s nice, however, is that its power delivery is strong and nicely measured out, perfectly in sync with the vehicle’s character. Overtaking is, thus, easy, even in Eco mode; put your foot down and the M9 moves off smartly. Road, wind and suspension noises are very well-contained.  Refinement is a highlight on the M9. You do hear a whirr from the electric motor at very slow speeds, but otherwise, the powertrain runs quietly. Road, wind and suspension noises are also well-contained, yielding a soothing atmosphere on the go. MG M9 range and efficiency - 7/10 The M9 has a 90kWh battery, and while an ARAI-certified range figure is awaited, MG claims a 548km range achieved over internal tests. Internationally, though, the MPV has a certified WLTP range of 430km. On our drive, the M9 indicated a range of around 300km, but that was with a lot of time spent idling with the AC on during the shoot. We’ll only know the actual range once we put the M9 through our instrumented tests in Mumbai. The M9 has a certified WLTP range of 430km. Given the unreliable charging infrastructure on our highways, the M9 isn’t ideal for long cross-country trips. Delivering supreme comfort over intra-city commutes is the M9’s forte.   MG M9 ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Where MG could have done more to pamper the M9’s crorepati clientele is in ride comfort. There’s a stiffness to the setup, which means body movements are well-contained at higher speeds. However, the suspension and tyres can’t iron out smaller imperfections at lower speeds as successfully. The low-speed ride feels a bit busy for what is a luxury car.   It handles surprisingly well for its size and mass.  The MG M9 manages its bulk around corners fairly well; driven sensibly or even slightly quickly, body roll is well-contained, no doubt helped by the battery mass down below. The steering and brakes also have two drive settings – Normal and Sport, the latter of which firms up the steering and is generally nice to use. The Sport mode on the brakes, though, wasn’t to my liking, given that at lower speeds it comes off as grabby. Speaking of brakes, there are adjustable regen modes with three levels: L1 offers deceleration akin to a conventional ICE vehicle, while L2 and L3 provide stronger retardation; however, there is no single-pedal driving. MG M9 price and verdict - 8/10 The MG M9 is easy to drive for something so large, but let’s be honest, it’s not intended for the self-driven owner. It’s for the chauffeur-driven. And it’s this target clientele that will have much to like about the M9. Middle-row space and seat comfort are fantastic, refinement is really impressive, and MG has also packed in a whole lot of goodies. Ride comfort could have been better, but it’s not a dealbreaker.  The M9 delivers on the brief of a luxury MPV quite appropriately.  The promise, then, is for Vellfire-like comfort for a whole lot less money (we estimate a price of Rs 90 lakh ex-showroom). To help convince buyers to see the M9 as a vehicle worthy of the big bucks, MG will retail the MPV from its new, premium MG Select dealerships. The M9 might not be the first luxury vehicle that comes to mind for anyone shopping in this price bracket, but it sure deserves a look. It might just surprise you.  Also see: MG M9 interior, seating and comfort review 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed review: Luxury SUV embraces its sporty side",

    "description": "Nissan driver Oliver Rowland was crowned 2025 Formula E champion at the Berlin E-Prix, with two rounds still to go. The title battle was prolonged to the second Berlin race after Rowland retired on Saturday, while his prime rival Pascal Wehrlein finished P2. However, Sunday’s race saw a reversal of fortune. Wehrlein didn’t score any points in the race, leaving the door open for Rowland to clinch the title with a P4 finish. Berlin also ended up being a strong round for two Indian-backed teams – Jaguar TCS Racing and Mahindra Racing. Rowland wraps up title with 59 point lead over Wehrlein Jaguar wins both races Mahindra third in Race 1 Berlin E Prix: Nissan’s Rowland seals 2025 Formula E title Porsche leads Teams’ championship. Not only did Rowland retire from a wet race on Saturday but he was also handed a five-place grid penalty for causing a collision with Maserati’s Stoffel Vandoorne. He started Sunday’s race from eighth on the grid, while Wehrlein started from pole. In fact, Wehrlein was leading till Lap 29 of 41, but started losing ground during the Attack Mode activations. While those around him opted to use their first Attack Mode activation for four minutes, Wehrlein used it for just two minutes. He slipped out of the points as a result and ended up finishing P16. Rowland, meanwhile, pulled off some key moves to finish P4 – enough for him to seal the title with two rounds still to go. “After a tough day yesterday, I approached the race thinking about limiting the potential damage to my lead, but that strategy almost never works in Formula E, especially in this kind of race. So in the end, I trusted myself and focused on delivering the best possible performance, and it paid off,” explained Rowland. “Since I came back, Nissan created an environment which I can thrive in, and this is the perfect fairytale. The whole team has worked tirelessly and delivered to the highest standard, and I would like to thank each and every one of them for their amazing effort throughout this campaign,” he added. While the drivers’ title is wrapped up, the battle is very much on in the teams’ championship. Porsche currently leads the standings, 23 points ahead of Nissan. Berlin E Prix: Jaguar scores double victory Evans, Cassidy win a race each. Jaguar took a clean sweep at Berlin, with both Mitch Evans and Nick Cassidy winning a race each. Evans controlled Saturday’s race from the very start and even built a lead of over five seconds before a late Safety Car wiped out his advantage. Nevertheless, he held on to score his first win (and points) since the season-opening Sao Paulo E-Prix. Cassidy took a specular win on Sunday, battling his way up from 20th on the grid. The Kiwi has scored more points than any other driver in the last eight races (92 points, precisely), and moves up to fifth in the standings as a result. Berlin E Prix: Mahindra on podium Mortara clinches back-to-back podiums. Mahindra Racing continued its strong form, scoring back-to-back podium results. Edoardo Mortara secured his first podium finish of the season at the Jakarta E-Prix, and he followed it up with a P3 finish at the first Berlin race. He made a strong start in Race 2, but the Safety Car came out just as he took his first Attack Mode activation, hampering his strategy. He clawed back towards the top 10, but ended up finishing P11 after making contact in the closing laps. 2022 F2 champion Felipe Drugovich, meanwhile, was called in to replace Nyck de Vries, who was competing in the 6 Hours of Sao Paulo. He finished his debut race P17 after a number of setbacks, including a drive-through penalty for a gearbox change. But he bounced back in Race 2, going from P19 to P7 to score his first points in Formula E. Mahindra is now sixth in the teams’ championship, just one point behind McLaren and 20 points behind Jaguar. Reflecting on the weekend, Mahindra Racing CEO and team principal Frederic Bertrand said, “The weekend as a whole has been another promising one for the team – another podium, points on debut for Felipe and we will go to London with a chance of finishing in the top five in the World Championship, which has been the goal all season.” He added, “We have two weeks now to reset and get ready for the season finale in London. I’m sure it will be dramatic as always, but we will bring our ‘A game’ to make sure we end what has been a promising season on a high note.” Formula E will now head to London for the last two races of the season on July 26 and 27. 2025 Berlin E Prix Round 13 results 2025 Berlin E Prix Round 13 resultsPosDriverTeam1Mitch EvansJaguar2Pascal WehrleinPorsche3Edoardo MortaraMahindra Racing4Taylor BarnardMcLaren5Nick CassidyJaguar6Max GuentherDS Penske7Sebastien BuemiEnvision Racing8Nico MuellerAndretti9Dan TicktumCupra Kiro10Antonio Felix da CostaPorsche11Sam BirdMcLaren12Stoffel VandoorneMaserati13Robin FrijnsEnvision Racing14Jake HughesMaserati15Sergio Sette CamaraNissan16Zane MaloneyLola Yamaha ABT17Felipe DrugovichMahindra Racing18Lucas di GrassiLola Yamaha ABTNCOliver RowlandNissanNCJean-Eric VergneDS PenskeNCDavid BeckmannCupra KiroNCJake DennisAndretti 2025 Berlin E Prix Round 14 results 2025 Berlin E Prix Round 14 resultsPosDriverTeam1Nick CassidyJaguar2Jake DennisAndretti3Jean-Eric VergneDS Penske4Oliver RowlandNissan5Mitch EvansJaguar6Taylor BarnardMcLaren7Felipe DrugovichMahindra Racing8Antonio Felix da CostaPorsche9Sergio Sette CamaraNissan10Jake HughesMaserati11Edoardo MortaraMahindra Racing12Lucas di GrassiLola Yamaha ABT13Stoffel VandoorneMaserati14Dan TicktumCupra Kiro15Pascal WehrleinPorsche16David BeckmannCupra Kiro17Nico MuellerAndretti18Zane MaloneyLola Yamaha ABTNCRobin FrijnsEnvision RacingNCMax GuentherDS PenskeNCSam BirdMcLarenNCSebastien BuemiEnvision Racing Also see: 2025 Formula E: Mahindra Racing on podium at Jakarta E Prix",

    "description": "At the Osaka Motorcycle show earlier this year, Honda had shown a new concept called the CB1000F as a new neo-retro offering from the brand, styled to mimic the design of UJMs (Universal Japanese Motorcycle) of the past. Now, the company has teased the reveal of another concept, the CB1000F SE, ahead of its reveal at the famous Suzuka 8 hours race in Japan, slated to be held on August 1-3. Honda CB1000F concept is a neo-retro roadster CB1000F SE variant teased ahead of debut, has a small fairing Both concepts share engine with CB1000 Hornet SP sold in India Honda CB1000F concept: will it go into production? CB1000F shares engine and main frame with CB1000 Hornet. The original CB1000F concept (pictured below) had a round headlight, classically styled body panels, a stepped, single-piece seat, and an upswept exhaust muffler – all design elements seen on UJMs of yesteryear. The CB1000F SE concept that has been teased appears to build on that platform, but has a small bikini fairing. That the two concepts share a large part of their fundamentals, is of little doubt.  When Honda showcased the CB1000F concept earlier in March, there were strong hints that this concept would turn into a production model down the line. It used Showa suspension, Nissin brakes and a rolling chassis that was more or less in production-spec guise. To recap, the CB1000F shares its engine and main frame as well as some components with the CB1000 Hornet supernaked (whose SP variant is sold in India). Just like Kawasaki did with the Z900 and Z900RS or Suzuki did with the GSX-8S and GSX-8T, Honda will differentiate the CB1000 Hornet and the CB1000F primarily through its style. The main visual difference between the chassis on the existing CB1000 Hornet and the CB1000F concept is the rear subframe. While on the Hornet, the subframe is a sharply raked one with a small pillion seat (like a Kawasaki Z900), the CB1000F uses a near-flat subframe which accommodates some neo-retro bodywork and a stepped single piece seat (like a Kawasaki Z900RS). As of now, engine specifications remain under wraps. It remains to be seen if Honda will simply give the CB1000F a different tune to suit its more relaxed character while retaining the same engine fundamentals or if it will make more comprehensive internal changes. Honda will reveal the CB1000F SE concept at the prestigious Suzuka 8 hours race in Japan in the coming weeks, with more information set to trickle in. If it does go into production, the CB1000F will be one of the handful of Japanese four-cylinder motorcycles to have a retro design. Also See: Yamaha India big bike plans delayed but still on",
