    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/our-favourite-cars-2024-microlino",
    "description": "As cars get bigger, heavier and harder to use, this fashionable city slicker is a breath of fresh air On a purely subjective basis, the Microlino might not be my favourite car of the year – if you'll permit me to stretch the oxymoronic to the point of… well, maybe just moronic.  This quirky runaround, this Isetta reincarnate, is a good laugh – obviously, look at it – but it's not the most fun car I've driven this year. Nor is it the most practical, efficient, sensible, capacious, comfortable, safe, well equipped or dynamic. And it's very, very far from being the quickest. But these days, I find myself increasingly drawn to those cars that are most contextually relevant – and not just personally, but societally. Okay, yes, I live in south London, drive a maximum of 40 miles in an average week and don't have kids or a dog, so the Microlino would actually suit me down to the ground, to be honest. Zoom out, though, and you might join me at the conclusion that this faintly comical two-seater is not far off the exact type of vehicle we should be building and using in 2024. Well, those of us who can, at least.  The cars we're forced to drive and buy are becoming ever more bloated, over-digitised, controversially (or forgettably) styled, uncontrollably quick and fiscally unobtainable. They are resource intensive, faddish and purposely disposable, designed to be à la mode for a maximum of a decade before being swapped for something that does the same thing for a few grand more.  The Microlino (for better or worse) flies in the face of those conventions – most of them, at least – in its positioning as a functional and relatively basic commuter car that's specced to about the bare minimum while also retaining some level of aspirational quality. It's not got any technology to go out of date, it weighs as much as a couple of big motorbikes, it's got all the battery capacity it'll ever need and it's perfectly sized for the environments in which it's destined to be most often driven – which is more than can be said for the vast majority of EVs I drove in 2024. It's nice to drive too: quiet, smooth, not quick but sufficiently perky and nimble enough to navigate the multi-storey at Westfield, if a touch unnervingly unstable with it. And slow.  Most of all, it's got universal kerb appeal and a sense of humour – attributes you'd be hard-pressed to attach to the likes of the Dacia Spring and Leapmotor T03. You smile while you drive it, and the whole world smiles with you – kids at bus stops, lorry drivers, tourists and haggard commuters united in their visible appreciation of a car that seeks to delight as much as convey.  I don't want to disingenuously paint it as the very saviour of global automotive, of course. This is still very much a fashion-first and relatively rudimentary runaround – only really superior to a moped by virtue of its roof and seatbelts – and you can bet you won't see many of them, but if the mainstream marques were to approach the thorny subject of urban mobility with such irreverence, the collective disillusionment towards modern motoring might just subside. Sure, for the best part of £20,000 you could take your pick from any number of roomier petrol hatchbacks, and there's even a growing number of 'full-sized' electric cars available for not much more money. Not to mention the dazzling array of bigger, brainier and all-round better alternatives you could pick up second-hand, but do you lift the whole front end off to get in them? Could you park them end on in a bay space? Could you take the entire sound system with you – in one hand – when you get out of the car?  So there we go: my favourite car of 2024 was probably the worst I drove all year – but, even in the context of all the gleaming exotica I drove over the past 12 months, it's the one I'd spend my money on.",

    "title": "Audi RS6 GT shows we’re in a golden era for special edition cars",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/audi-rs6-gt-shows-we%E2%80%99re-golden-era-special-edition-cars",
    "description": "New limited-run RS6 GT provides the sensory excitement to justify its obnoxious look In short succession, we’ve had a one-of-660 Audi RS6 Avant GT delivered to Autocar HQ, Toyota has announced a run of laudably hardcore GR Supras and Alpina has been in touch to ask if we would like a go in the dreamy, last-of-the-line B3 GT. We appear to be living in the midst of a special-edition bonanza (no prizes for guessing why), and it’s an excellent thing. One day, most of these cars will have shed their ridiculous price tags and be spectacular used buys. The ‘special edition’ is a familiar ploy for shifting old metal, but do it well and icons can be born. It will be particularly interesting to chart the RS6 GT’s value trajectory. We’re talking about a £180k estate here – one with manually adjustable dampers, which is of course what every family wagon needs. Madness. It also appears to have the most kerbable alloy wheels (white, too!) since Jay-Z’s Maybach Exelero. And I can’t have been the only one who thought that Audi had made a bit of a Horlicks of the design with the eyeball-searing IMSA GTO-inspired graphics. Yet when you see the thing in the metal, it works, having the aura not of a messily jazzed-up mega-estate but of a practical supercar. Special? Yeah, and then some. Genuinely good to drive, too. As to where the bottom of the depreciation curve will lurk, the regular RS6 has stubbornly held its value and you will struggle to find even four-year-old examples for less than £70k. The RS6 GT’s three-year, 36k-mile value is something that the experts at Cap HPI don’t even attempt to predict, and who can blame them? As with the BMW M5 CS, it will take a while for prices to come to earth, but they will. The desirability of a special edition is generally proportional to the level of effort that went into creating it. The reason nobody can now afford a half-decent Tommi Mäkinen Lancer Evolution VI is because Mitsubishi didn’t just do a snazzy sticker job and send the car on its way. It fitted the titanium-bladed turbocharger from the proper homologation Evos for the World Rally Championship, a quicker steering rack, improved aero and ‘Tarmac’ suspension settings that put you 10mm closer to the road. The decals were a £700 option in 2001 – just the cherry on top. Contrast that with Citroën’s C4 by Loeb, a breathtakingly banal special edition, of which aesthetic tweaks were the main event. There’s one for sale in Tonbridge for £1295. Name-checking legends of motorsport doesn’t have to be done either expensively or cynically, though. I’ve always had a soft spot for the Fiat Stilo Schumacher GP: five-pot tickled to 170bhp, some smart wheels, Prodrive-tuned suspension. Nice. Most of the special-edition landscape is, of course, opportunistic drivel. Aston Martin is a repeat offender with its Bond-referencing and Pagani often feels a bespoke paint job is reason enough to deploy a press release. I don’t have a problem with that old Audi favourite, the Black Edition, often seen on A3s and so on, because such cars are usually good value, throwing lots of kit into the mix. And I don’t mind the silly stuff either (the Volkswagen Polo Harlequin, haute-couture Fiat 500s), but they’re just that: very silly. But still, the expertly executed, well-targeted, performance-flavoured special remains a rarity. So what’s out there now that already happens to be temptingly priced? In recent years, BMW has revived the CS line and the F82-shape M4 CS is now a fine proposition. One-owner cars with 30k miles can be had for around £40k – a fair chunk, sure, and the lightweight door cards and so on do have an impact in terms of usability, but what a machine. So light and fizzing, and meaningfully different to the regular car. Today you will notice a slight lack of structural stiffness compared with the G82 M4, but for new Golf GTI money you’re getting 454bhp of meticulously fettled, right-sized M car that cost its first owner nearly six figures. The M3 version is just as good. Moving a notch along the hardcore spectrum, we come to the Lotus Exige 390 Final Edition. In truth, I thought these might have slipped more than they have; you still need around £60k. It appears there’s nothing quite like the company doing a philosophical volte-face when it comes to shoring up the values of the old guard. Still, it would be money well spent – a Goldilocks Exige. But the gem in the used special-edition field? Audi’s R8 RWS, now at £65k. For that you get a V10 and a beguiling supercar-GT character for £25k less than a new M4. The RS6 GT may be a final spasm of pre-EV Audi humour, but the rear-drive RWS was an exquisite moment of mayhem.",

This fine specimen was built by KC Kawano over the course of one winter to exacting specifications: his own. He is a man of few words, but his work speaks for itself. He didn’t build the bike to talk about it. He built it to ride it.

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-road-test-review-433878#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "The Kia Sonet facelift has crossed the 1,00,000 sales milestone in 11 months since its launch in January, and variants with a sunroof accounted for 79 percent of it, the South Korean car brand noted. Eighteen variants (petrol and diesel combined) of the Sonet come equipped with a single-pane sunroof, excluding the entry-level HTE and HTK trims.  Diesel variants make up for about 24 percent of total Sonet sales About 66 percent of the demand for the Sonet is for manual versions While Sonet’s line-up starts at Rs 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom, India), prices for its sunroof models range between Rs 8.31 (HTE (O)) and 14.91 lakh (X-Line). Notably, the compact SUV was also featured among the 10 bestselling UVs of 2024. Kia further stated that 76 percent of Sonet sales came from variants with petrol engines – 1.0-litre turbo and 1.2-litre naturally aspirated. “The 1.2-litre petrol engine brings the most buyers for the Sonet,” Kia India MD and CEO Gwanggu Lee told Autocar India during an interview earlier. The rest came from the 1.5-litre diesel motor, which also powers the larger Kia Seltos and, most recently, the Syros. As for the transmission, automatic (including iMT) variants make up about 34 percent of the sales, and the remaining demand is for manual versions. From March 2021 to August 2025, the compact SUV had a 37 percent share in Kia’s overall sales, second only to the Seltos’ 48 percent share. The pre-facelift Sonet also crossed the 1,00,000 sales figure within a year of its debut. The sales goal of 1,50,000 units was achieved in 2022, followed by 2,50,000 units in 2023. The run from 2,50,000 to 3,50,000 units took about 15 months. The Sonet rivals the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO and Hyundai Venue.   Kia India has completed almost 1.6 million vehicle dispatches from its Anantapur plant, including over 1.2 million domestic sales and over 3.67 lakh exports. With more than 4.5 lakh connected cars on Indian roads, Kia is among the connected car leaders in the country’s market. The company has a network of 700 touchpoints across 300 cities and is focused on strengthening its footprint across India.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz will launch the new AMG CLE 53 in India by late 2025, Autocar India can confirm. The AMG CLE 53, unveiled in December 2023, gets styling upgrades and a boost in performance over the E 53 coupe it replaces. Mercedes also sells the CLE 53 AMG convertible in international markets, but it is yet to be ascertained which one is headed to India. CLE 53's top speed can be increased to 270kph with Driver's Package Gets a 449hp, 600Nm, 3-litre twin-turbocharged engine Will rival the BMW M2 Competition Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 design The AMG brings with it a Panamericana radiator grille and LED headlamps with sleeker Daytime Running Lamps. There's a large air intake below the grille to increase airflow. There are smaller air intakes on either side, and a long bonnet and raked windshield add to the stance. Along the sides are flared wheel arches, which make the track wider than the standard CLE's by 58mm and 75mm at the front and rear, respectively. As for alloy wheels, there will be 19 and 20 inchers on offer, the latter being an optional upgrade. The two-part LED tail-lights are connected but do not get a light bar. There are quad exhausts – two on each side – integrated into the rear diffuser. Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 features There’s an AMG Performance flat-bottom steering wheel with touch control buttons. It also gets a 12.3-inch driver’s display, which sits next to the third-generation MBUX-powered 11.9-inch potrait-oriented touchscreen. It also gets 64-colour ambient lighting, over-the-air (OTA) software updates, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Burmester sound system and a wireless charger. The CLE 53 AMG also gets rear-wheel steering that turns in the direction of the front wheels up to a maximum of 0.7 degrees at speeds of over 100kph. Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 performance, expected price The performance-focused CLE borrows the ‘M256’ 3.0-litre twin-turbocharged straight-six mill from the E 53 sedan, coupled to a 48V mild-hybrid system. Combined output is 449hp and 560Nm, and you get an additional 40Nm torque boost with the Overboost function. This power is sent to all four wheels via a 9-speed gearbox. The AMG CLE 53 does 0-100kph in 4.2 seconds and maxes out at 250kph; the top speed goes up to 270kph with the AMG Performance Package. The AMG CLE 53 Cabriolet takes 0.2 seconds more to reach 100kph, owing to the additional weight. For reference, the BMW M2 has a sprint time of 4.2 seconds (manual) and 4 seconds (automatic). As for pricing, we expect the AMG CLE 53 coupe to have a price tag of around Rs 2 crore.
