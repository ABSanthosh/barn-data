    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/%C2%A3100k-peugeot-205-gti-cured-my-restomod-fatigue",
    "description": "Rather than create a highly exclusive, limited run car, Tolman perfects the original with delicate engineering I was about four years old when I first laid eyes on a Peugeot 205: an Alpine White 1.9-litre GTi. Even then I knew it was special, and its clean-cut, Pininfarina-penned lines etched themselves onto my brain as the genesis of what would become my hot hatch infatuation. Later, I was shuttled to and from school in one, and 20 years on it’s still part of the family, albeit currently residing under a sheet and in a very sorry state of affairs. But while the 205 was pleasing to the eye and rewarding to drive, it was also a rather tricky hot hatch to tame. Not only that, but it was prone to being struck down by various engine issues, too (go on, ask me how I know). You can imagine my excitement, then, when Warwickshire firm Tolman Engineering took Peugeot’s seminal ’80s hot hatchback and reworked, fettled and fine-tuned it into the car it was always destined to be. The Tolman Edition 205 GTi is on the face of it a restomod, although in many ways it doesn’t quite fit the brief. A vast number of restomodders seem hell-bent on making astronomically priced, highly exclusive collectibles that are a far cry from the original car. But even if I’m after an improved version of a classic car – with modern technology added here and there – I still want it to retain the spirit of the original. And that is exactly what Tolman has achieved with its 205. When it took part in Britain’s Best Driver’s Car 2023, the Tolman GTi struck a chord with our testers for its engaging drive on the road and its playful nature on track. With its reworked engine and trick differential, it was as fun to punt around Anglesey as the eventual winner of the contest, the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato. What I also love about Tolman’s 205 is the balance of old and new: glance at the instrument cluster and you’ll assume they’re the original Veglia items, but they are in fact digital recreations that swap to T16-style dials when you switch the car to Sport mode. Very neat.  This is the sort of sympathetic attention to detail enthusiasts crave from a restomod. The price for such a capable and usefully modernised machine? Well, there’s no easy way of saying it: £60,000, or double that for a fully loaded example. So yes, it’s pricey, if not astronomically so, but then this is a car that is put together by a company that used to run its own team in the British GT Championship and which has an excellent reputation for restoring historic racing cars. Tolman also restores Lotuses, and it has churned out modified versions of the Sunbeam Lotus and, more recently, a Ford Escort XR3i. Tolman is clearly on a mission to become a bigger player in the restomod game, and it has every right to be ambitious. No longer do we have to lament wistfully that “they don’t make ’em like that any more”, because Tolman does. In fact, it makes ’em even better.",

    "description": "Two of the most compelling options in the mid-capacity category in India are the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure and the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450. While both bikes promise adventure-ready capabilities, they take different approaches to design, features, performance and ride quality. However, the most significant difference between the two is their price, and we’re here to tell you if the new kid on the block justifies its higher price tag. Form and function The latest KTM 390 Adventure embraces a more rugged ADV-focused design. While it appears more premium than its predecessor, its underbelly exhaust design deviates from traditional adventure bikes. The KTM’s headlamp easily outshines the RE’s. Available in only two colours, the KTM’s aesthetic may not appeal to everyone, but it does feel modern and carries less visual bulk than the Himalayan. However, the extensive use of plastic panels means you will need to learn to live with buzzes and rattles, something our test bike already had. The RE’s headlamp has adequate illumination. The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 has less of a traditional ADV aesthetic and instead focuses on a more muscular naked look with a big fuel tank, minimal bodywork and a small windscreen. The larger dimensions, heavier weight and distinct side-stand lean angle make it feel like a bigger motorcycle, but the downside is that this makes it heavy and intimidating for some riders. The Himalayan’s more metal-heavy construction gives it a greater sense of durability and toughness. The 390 Adventure's TFT has a better user interface. Both motorcycles have essential electronics such as a TFT display, switchable ABS and riding modes, but the KTM 390 Adventure goes one step ahead with segment-first features like cruise control, traction control, cornering ABS and dedicated ABS modes. KTM's switchgear feels higher quality and more tactile. The KTM’s user interface is smoother, retains rider preferences even after being switched off, and has a more premium feel with tactile switchgear. Himalayan's circular TFT is legible even on a sunny day. In contrast, the Himalayan 450’s electronics feel less refined. The mode-switching response is inconsistent, and the built-in Google Maps navigation, while excellent in theory, requires an unlocked smartphone screen to function, making it less practical. The Enfield's switchgear doesn't feel nearly as tactile as the KTMs. The toggle switch to browse the menu also feels flimsy and tricky to control, diminishing the user experience. Given these quirks, the KTM’s interface feels more polished and rider-friendly.  Comfort and convenience The KTM 390 Adventure has an upright seating position with wide handlebars, making it comfortable for taller riders. Its slightly forward-leaning stance aids control, while the taller windscreen provides better wind protection. However, the non-adjustable windscreen can be intrusive for some and blocks airflow, making city riding in hot weather uncomfortable. Its LED headlamp is among the best on any Indian motorcycle, significantly outperforming the Himalayan’s. KTM doesn’t offer an alternative to their hard seat. KTM has equipped the 390 Adventure with crash bars, a bash plate and handguards, but the bike lacks a centre stand and has limited luggage-mounting points. While KTM offers optional accessories, the Himalayan takes the lead in customisation. Useful rear rack and optional touring seats make the Himalayan better equipped for a long tour. Royal Enfield offers a wide range of OEM accessories, including luggage options, seat choices and crash protection. It has better standard luggage mounting points, and its tank guard doubles up as an extra mounting location. The optional touring seat is among the most comfortable in its class, making it better suited for long rides. Off the beaten path The KTM 390 Adventure is a significant 13kg lighter than the Himalayan, making it easier to manoeuvre. The lighter weight also helps shorter riders feel more confident in handling the bike, particularly off-road. The KTM’s throttle response is precise, its electronics enhance trail riding, and its brakes offer better control. Thanks to its lighter weight, the KTM is easier to handle off-road. The bi-directional quickshifter is a great addition, making gear shifts seamless – especially when wearing off-road boots. However, the KTM’s suspension struggles with aggressive off-road riding, frequently bottoming out. While KTM offers adjustable suspension, it doesn’t cope as well as the Himalayan, even when firmed up, and most riders would prefer a well-balanced setup out of the box. The Himalayan 450, on the other hand, offers a superior suspension setup that absorbs off-road bumps effortlessly. Despite its heavier weight, it manages low-speed manoeuvres and jumps surprisingly well. The torquey engine is easy to control, and the clutch, though precise, is not as light as the KTM’s. The brakes require careful modulation, as the rear locks up easily. While lacking advanced electronic rider aids, the Himalayan still performs admirably in off-road conditions, handling about 95 percent of what the KTM does and keeping its rider more comfortable while at it. On the open road On highways, the KTM 390 Adventure is more engaging and stable and equipped with cruise control, which is a game-changer for long-distance touring. The KTM shares its main frame and engine with the 2024 KTM 390 Duke, but it features a bespoke rear subframe, swingarm and steering head for enhanced stability. It holds triple-digit speeds effortlessly and accelerates faster than the Himalayan. In our tests, the 390 Adventure was nearly a second quicker to 100kph, while roll-on acceleration is almost on par. The Himalayan 450 offers a more tractable mid-range and better overall comfort. Its plush suspension smooths out rough patches, making it the better option for long-distance touring. It also has a larger fuel tank, improving range. However, the Himalayan’s handlebar vibrates at higher RPMs, leading to numb hands after extended riding. Despite this, the Himalayan performs well as a commuter, with a tighter turning radius and smooth lane-splitting capabilities. Meanwhile, the KTM feels  smooth at highway speeds but has harsh vibrations in the footpegs at lower revs within the city. What took me by surprise were the Himalayan’s braking figures, which were pretty much on par with the KTM’s despite a significantly higher weight. Different strokes for different folks  Both motorcycles present compelling options depending on rider priorities. The KTM 390 Adventure offers lighter weight, superior electronics and stronger performance. The main attraction is that it is lighter and easier to ride than the Himalayan, and it has a chassis that is engaging both on and off the road. On the other hand, the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is a more rugged, comfortable and budget-friendly alternative. The KTM is clearly the better adventure bike, but the issue arises when you look at the on-road price difference, which stretches to as much as Rs 80,000-90,000 in Mumbai. If you simply want the KTM’s lighter and friendlier nature, then the lower-spec 390 Adventure X with its 19-inch front wheel is the answer, especially since it costs the same as the Himalayan. However, those willing to pay additional money for the standard 390 Adventure will probably be doing so for the extra edge in off-road performance, and that’s where the KTM’s suspension doesn’t quite match the expectation. That’s why, in this particular comparison, the Himalayan 450 just about wins by a whisker from a value-for-money perspective.

    "description": "It was only fitting that the first intercity run in our long-term Curvv EV was to the Tata Motors plant in Pimpri for a special occasion – Tata Motors’ EV Day, celebrating the milestone of 2,00,000 Tata EVs sold! No other Indian manufacturer has achieved this feat, a testament to Tata’s pioneering role in the country’s electric mobility revolution. Launched in August last year, the Curvv EV is the latest addition to Tata’s electric line-up. Essentially a ‘coupe-fied’ version of the Nexon, it packs a larger battery, more power and faster charging. While we’ve yet to test its DC fast charging speeds, our first top-up was on our office’s 22kW AC charger. The Curvv EV supports AC charging at 7.2kW, which is sufficiently fast when the car is parked at work. The charging port is conveniently located in the nose, so it’s easy to access from any side. However, accessing the charging port wasn’t as simple as expected, and it had a glitch. The flush-fitting charging flap, designed to slide open via a haptic touch control on the dashboard, refused to budge. No amount of pressing or coaxing worked, and in the end, I had to physically pry it open by hand – hardly ideal when you’re plugging in regularly. This fault was reported to Tata Motors, and after a quick workshop visit, it was rectified. That said, the location of the charging port – neatly integrated into the Curvv’s nose – is a definite advantage. In our office parking, where the designated EV slot is right next to a wall, side-mounted charging ports can be a hassle, often requiring an awkward squeeze to plug in. More often than not, you end up brushing against the wall and dirtying your clothes. With the port up front, there’s none of that frustration – just a clean, open space to manoeuvre the charging gun into the socket with ease. Gliding up to Tata Motors’ plant on the outskirts of Pune took under three hours, thanks to the Atal Setu, which has changed our lives. Getting in and out of Mumbai is unbelievably easy and even pleasant. I started off with a full charge and an indicated 338km range and drove fairly hard, revelling in the Curvv EV’s high-speed stability and settled ride. But I kept an eye on my speed – not just to conserve range, but because of the swarm of speed cameras that now dot the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. A single violation can cost you Rs 2,000, and with some sections frustratingly capped at 60kph, avoiding a fine feels almost impossible. Throttle pedal has a large initial dead zone, making it difficult to modulate in stop-go traffic. The 10km climb up the Lonavala Ghat is brutal on an EV’s battery, draining range at an alarming rate. That’s why I wasn’t too concerned when I reached Pimpri with a 46 percent charge and just 140km of range left, despite having 150km to cover on the return journey. The downhill run would help me recoup some charge, and by the time I usually hit the toll plaza at the base of the ghat, my range is often higher than it was 10km earlier. So, I skipped recharging at the Tata Motors factory, eager to find out if the Curvv EV could truly pass the acid test of completing a Mumbai-Pune round trip on a single charge. Turns out, it just about could. I was much gentler on the accelerator on the return trip, toggling between Eco and City modes. In both these modes, you hit an initial dead zone when you press the accelerator pedal, so you miss that instant response EVs are known for. The Curvv EV is much more responsive in Sport mode, but I didn’t want to risk indulging in it with the battery more than half empty. On the drop down from Lonavala to the toll plaza, the electric motor’s regen wasn’t particularly effective, and despite using the strongest L3 regen mode, I couldn’t recoup as much charge as expected and only managed to claw back 2-3km of added range. The Mumbai-Pune round trip proved difficult, with the descent not recouping sufficient charge. It’s likely that the Curvv EV’s brake regeneration is deliberately not too strong because with the car being front-wheel drive, all the regen happens on the front wheels, and the regen strength has been limited to prevent excessive front-end dive. It meant that as I entered the Atal Setu, the SOC dipped below 10 percent, triggering power-saving mode and capping my speed to around 50kph. I moved to the slow lane and had the ignominy of Wagon Rs and Altos overtaking me! I’ve never driven so slowly on the Atal Setu before. I reached the office (and not home, which was another 7km away) with just 6 percent and a huge relief, finally plugging the car into our wall-box charger. Curvv’s aircon cools the cabin effectively, with the express cool working particularly quickly. Living with the Curvv EV has otherwise been painless, and it’s turning out to be an excellent city car. The big standout feature for me is the air-conditioning system. The fixed-scroll aircon compressor is silent, and during an unusually sizzling March, it cooled the cabin brilliantly. For the next few months, the Curvv EV will be my daily driver, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it fares in the long run.

    "description": "The new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé is a car that has made an important course correction. Now sportier in its demeanour and re-engineered to be more dynamic, it is a car that seems to have more BMW DNA in it. New BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe exterior design Sportier exterior design This is clearly visible, even at first glance. The design of the nose is now more compact and sporty. The shark-like flat nose with the ‘overbite’ makes it look rakish, and add in the peeled-back headlamps and bonnet lines that converge, and you have a car with plenty of individual identity. New 2 Series Gran Coupe has plenty of individual identity. Around the side, the new car gets bigger wheel arches, fleshed out to make room for wider and taller wheels. And what gives this car a neat profile is that the roof and rear windshield flow into the boot seamlessly. Around the rear, the addition of new angled tail-light clusters adds freshness. The boot now gets a capacity of 430 litres, but that’s without the spare tyre. Indian cars will get a space-saver tyre that will reduce space considerably. New BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe interior and features Interior draws from BMW’s larger sedans Step inside, and you’re greeted by a freshened-up cabin that takes a leaf from BMW’s latest style sheet. The look-and-feel of the cabin is now in line with other sedans from BMW’s range, and the new curved display with BMW’s latest software is one of the highlights. It’s also full of clever little features like big, bold ambient lighting bars and highlights that react to temperature adjustments you make on the screen – blue when you ask for cooler temperatures and red for a warmer cabin. Cabin look, feel, quality and tech are now not too far removed from top cars. While space in the rear is marginally improved and it doesn’t feel quite as cramped as the earlier car, this still remains a car that is better experienced from the front seats.  New BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe underpinnings Increased chassis rigidity, stiffened springs Under the skin, BMW says it is doing its best to align the 2 Series with the sporty appeal of cars like the 3 Series. Built on a front-wheel-drive platform (the M2 and the 2 Series Coupé, interestingly, use a rear-wheel-drive platform), BMW has stiffened the front springs, used new multi-valve dampers and increased the rigidity of the chassis. This, it claims, helps the new 2 feel both more agile and precise on the road. In addition, it has increased the caster offset of the front wheels to ensure more stability, and at the rear, the anti-roll bar is now pre-loaded so that the stabilising effect comes into play earlier. There’s marginally more space in the rear, and the seat is slightly larger.   New BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe powertrain, specs New 1.5-litre mild-hybrid turbo-petrol engine Under the hood, the Gran Coupé is likely to get a downsized engine. Featuring mild-hybrid tech, the three-cylinder 1.5 turbo-petrol makes a total of 170hp and 280Nm. This is marginally down from the earlier car. Still, what is likely to make it feel more responsive is the addition of 20hp from the E-motor (included in the 170hp), which also helps the car do 0-100kph in a claimed 7.9 seconds. Sufficient power, but nothing more. While BMW is expected to carry on with the 2.0 diesel engine that does get four cylinders, power is expected to be 163hp (down from 190hp) and torque a strong 400Nm. The 2.0-litre diesel engine is expected to continue, but with lesser power.   New BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe expected price Expected to be in showrooms towards the middle of the year, with prices expected to range between Rs 45 lakh and Rs 47 lakh, BMW’s new 2 Series Gran Coupé is a car for self-driven owners who are looking for a fun, dynamic drive. Some are likely to want more power and performance, though.

    "description": "Every motorcyclist grows up dreaming of the bike(s) they will ride one day. But how many of them end up owning the exact machine that sparked their passion when they were young? Very few, but that’s the story behind this well-worn 1955 BSA Gold Star. The bike’s current owner used to spot it on the road frequently growing up, intrigued and often wondered who the rider on board was. Many years later he discovered Reinhard Neumair’s workshop on the outskirts of Munich, Germany; imagine his surprise when he saw the fully-faired Gold Star parked there. If you’ve never heard of Reinhard Neumair, it’s probably because he keeps a very low profile. Now in his late sixties, he spends his winters making magic in his workshop, and his summers following the classic racing circuit all over Europe, with his wife in their van.…",

Is it the visual distinctiveness of powerplants like the no-nonsense airheads or the outlandishly equipped K-series? Or possibly the rigorous engineering that makes these platforms stand the test of time. Whatever the cause, BMWs are a staple of the custom scene, and the factory has embraced our will to make these bikes our own by building-in modularity and offering a robust line of customizable parts. Support for customizers extends beyond the corporate level, and the BMW Motorcycle Owners of America group wants to see what you’re working on.
