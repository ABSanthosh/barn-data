    "description": "This 1988 Lamborghini Countach is one of approximately 610 examples of the 5000 Quattrovalvole variant produced between 1985 and 1988. The US-market car was brought to Canada around 15 years ago and underwent a repaint in its current red finish by Lamborghini Montreal in 2020. It rides on gold-finished 15″ Ruote OZ wheels and features a European-specification front bumper and a V-shaped rear wing along with pop-up headlights and scissor doors. Inside, fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in Champagne leather are accompanied by a Raid steering wheel paired with a gated shifter as well as an Alpine AM/FM cassette stereo and air conditioning. Power is supplied by a 5.2-liter quad-cam V12 linked with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Work completed in 2024 prior to the selling dealer's 2025 acquisition involved an engine-out service as well as installation of a replacement clutch assembly. Now showing 13k kilometers (~8k miles), this Countach 5000 QV is offered by the selling dealer with manufacturer's literature, a tool kit, partial service records, and Connecticut registration.",

    "description": "This 1974 Porsche 914 was acquired by the current owner in 2004 and built into a race car by Zuffenhaus Eurowerks of Monroe, North Carolina shortly thereafter, competing in PCA, SCCA, NASA, and HSR events for several seasons before being put into storage around 2016. Power comes from a twin-plug 3.4L flat-six that was rebuilt in 2023, and it is equipped with a 993 oil pump, 50mm PMO carburetors, an Electromotive ignition system, and custom exhaust headers. A GT-class roll cage has been added to the chassis, which rides on Ground Control adjustable coilovers with an ERP 935 front suspension system, Elephant Racing sway bars, and adjustable front caster and camber plates. The race-prepped cabin houses an ISP aluminum racing seat, a MOMO steering wheel, an AiM MXL digital dashboard, and Coolshirt and fire suppression systems. The engine is linked with a G96-50 six-speed manual transaxle, and additional build highlights include a Rennspeed hood, fender flares, front and rear spoilers, CCW Classic 17” wheels, \"Big Red\" 993 disc brakes, a Fuel Safe fuel cell, Peterson oil tanks, and dual Setrab oil coolers.

It had the Lexus UX 300e for a while, but that was never quite a heavy hitter.Whereas this car is and goes toe-to-toe with the likes of the Tesla Model Y, Nissan Ariya and Hyundai Ioniq 5.The RZ shares its e-TNGA platform – which is bespoke to EVs – with the Toyota bZ4X and Subaru Solterra.A cheaper two-wheel drive mode (badged 300e) joined the range in 2024 to address issues concerning range and price.",

    "description": "Like countless small-bore Hondas, the CBX250 Twister is approachable, reliable, and affordable. But, like countless commuter bikes, it’s built for getting you to work and back—not for customization. It takes vision to look past the Twister’s funky bodywork to see something classier lurking within. If you’ve never heard of the Honda CBX250 Twister, don’t fret. It was sold as the CBF250 in Europe, and never made it to the States. But in countries like Argentina, it was (and still is) a hit. This peppy 2005-model Honda CBX250 Twister comes from Karma Motocicletas in Rosario—a city in central Argentina that lies on the west bank of the Paraná River. Mauricio Martínez runs Karma as a one-man band and does everything in-house, short of specialist tasks like upholstery and coatings.…",

The connection from your ear drums to your right wrist plays an undeniable part in raising your pulse, making aftermarket exhausts one of the most common mods on a new motorcycle. But if you’re going down that road, just know there’s a lot more to think about than amplified acoustics. A good aftermarket motorcycle exhaust will enhance performance and cosmetics, while a bad one may leave you with a deafening drone and a fix-it ticket. We’ve just added a line of killer stainless steel exhaust systems from Stealth Pipes Inc. to the Bike EXIF Store, ranging from the Honda Monkey to the new M8 Softail.

    "description": "The Xoom 125 is the latest scooter from Hero and it has all the makings of being the latest success story for the company. Hero Xoom 125 design and style Xoom 125 has a catchy design and good presence The new Xoom makes a strong impression thanks to its design and presence. This is not an excessively large or bulky scooter, but it does stand out. Those big 14-inch wheels wrapped in fat rubber do wonders for the overall silhouette. Hero has also done well to give this scooter its own unique design, and it looks quite different from the Xoom 110, even though the family resemblance is immediately identifiable. Catchy colours and sharp styling help the Xoom 125 stand out on the road. There are four colour options and the matte yellow you see here looks particularly good, even if it's quite clearly inspired by the TVS NTorq 125. Nevertheless, with its sporty stance and striking looks, this is a scooter most young riders would love to be seen on. Hero Xoom 125 engine and performance Motor borrowed from Destini 125 but makes more power here The motor is borrowed from the Destini 125, but it produces a little more power here – 9.9hp and 10.4Nm. On the move, the feeling and sound is of a rather conventional automatic scooter and throttle calibration is very smooth. There is a hint of vibration in the floorboard at around 20kph, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the motor smoothens out beautifully as the speeds rise and it is absolutely refined at about 60kph. Engine is shared with the Destini 125 but is more powerful here. Hero claims a segment leading 0-60kph time of 7.6s, despite the fact that this is one of the heavier 125cc scooters (121kg) and its power figures aren’t segment leading either. It’s hard to verify that claim from the riding experience as well because the power delivery is quite linear. While there is a pretty strong pull at lower revs you have to twist the long-travel accelerator wide open to find it – even then, it doesn’t quite have as strong a surge as you’d find in something like the TVS Ntorq. Just like the 110, the Xoom 125 gets two spacious cubbies on the front apron. The overall performance can be described as quick and refined but not particularly exciting. Top speed should be above a speedo indicated 90kph and the scooter managed to climb up to 80kph without much stress, even on a slight uphill section. As for fuel efficiency, Hero claims 54.9kpl, which is par for the course with this segment.  Hero Xoom 125 chassis, handling and comfort Xoom 125 is one of a handful of Indian-made scooters to ride on 14-inch wheels The Xoom 125 shares the same basic chassis as the Destini 125 and Xoom 110, but with a different wheelbase and steering angle. The big deal here is the use of 14-inch wheels, which makes this the only other locally manufactured scooter to offer them apart from the Yamaha Aerox 155 and the Aprilia SR range.  14-inch wheels lend the Xoom 125 good stability. Big wheels bring in stability and the Xoom feels very well balanced at low speeds, which addresses that nervous feeling you can get from scooters with smaller wheels. Low-speed agility is still quite good despite the long 1,327mm wheelbase, but it certainly doesn’t have the super-light steering feel you’d get from a conventional scooter. There wasn’t a whole lot to judge about outright handling on the crowded Delhi streets we rode on, but this does come across as a confident and fun handling scooter. The Xoom 125 gets a tethered USB charger. The only dynamic aspect I didn’t like was the braking. The actual performance is fine, but the levers feel hard and require some effort to slow the scooter down. As for the suspension comfort, it seems to strike a middle ground between the harsh Aprilia and the soft and plush Ntorq. On Delhi’s smooth, tarmac roads, comfort was good, but we’ll need to see what it’s like on Mumbai’s fast but bumpy concrete surfaces. Hero Xoom 125 seating comfort, features Xoom 125 is a decently comfortable and feature-rich scooter The seating position is decently spacious and while the handlebar will meet a tall rider’s knees at full lock, it’s not bad and is easy to manage. At 777mm, the seat height is low enough, but the seat (and scooter) is fairly wide and riders shorter than 5’6” may not be able to get both feet flat on the ground.  It is decently comfortable but the seat is wide, which could hinder shorter riders from getting their feet on the ground. As for features, unlike the Xoom 110, this scooter thankfully comes with an external fuel-filler cap and there’s even a warning chime in case you forget to close it. Beyond that, some things are nice like the standard LED projector headlamp, or the glovebox with a USB charger and the scrolling LED indicators that come on the top model. However, there are a few missing things like a parking brake lock and a silent-start system. Some may also find the LCD display a bit basic in an age where rivals are moving on to TFT units, but this display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the top model.  LCD display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the ZX variant. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict It could be another win for Hero, priced almost on par with TVS Ntorq 125 What needs to improve is the overall quality and attention to detail, and a closer inspection will reveal uneven panel gaps in a few places and cheap feeling, flexible black plastics in others. That being said, the value is excellent and priced between Rs 86,900 and Rs 92,900, this scooter is on par with the lower variants in the Ntorq line-up and about Rs 30,000 cheaper than the only other 125cc scooter with 14-inch wheels in our market – the Aprilia SR 125. The Xoom has some real desirability to it and it is priced very well too. And with such good pricing, I think Hero has pulled off another win with this scooter, much like they have with the Xtreme 125, which is selling superbly well for the company. Like that bike, this is a very good looking thing, and it has real desirability to it – I’d love to have rocked up to college on this scooter back in the day. But there’s more on offer as well, because, just like the Xtreme 125, the Xoom is quick, fun, practical and very good value for money. Also See: Hero Xoom 125 video review",

    "description": "Then Porsche first introduced the Taycan, the enthusiasts said it was sacrilege. How could Porsche, renowned for some of the best ICE sports cars in history, slap its crest on a four-door, two-tonne electric sedan? But as usual, Porsche has proven naysayers wrong, as the Taycan is now known as the enthusiasts’ EV of choice. We can attest to that after setting the fastest lap time by an EV at the Buddh International Circuit in it, racing it against a sailing boat, and even drag-racing it against its petrol-powered stablemates. But Porsche is not one to rest on its laurels. There’s an updated version with even more performance now, and we sampled its Turbo and Turbo S variants in and around Dubai to see what to expect. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift exterior design The rear bumper and light signature have been mildly altered. You’ll have to be a real Porsche nerd to spot the design differences on this facelift; they are so subtle. It has more aero-efficient bumpers on the front and back, tweaked headlamps that now get LED Matrix tech as standard, a revised rear light bar and new colour and wheel options. Porsche lettering on tailgate lights up There’s even an option to illuminate the Porsche lettering at the back, which looks quite cool, and the Turbo and Turbo S also get the new ‘Turbonite’ satin-matte accents, which feature on the logo, too. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift interior and features Active air suspension aids cabin entry There’s good room behind, but you’re seated in a low and knees-up position. Before I even got inside, the Taycan showed off one of its party tricks. Air suspension is standard fit, but Taycans can now be equipped with the optional Porsche Active Ride system, which instantly lifts it off the ground by 55mm to ease entry into the cabin. While 55mm may not sound much, it makes a big difference, given how low-slung the Taycan is. The updated UI is more user-friendly; there are ‘Turbonite’ Porsche badges inside and on the exterior. The interior is more or less the same, but there are changes to the interface for the infotainment screens to make it more user-friendly. The Turbo and Turbo S also get the Porsche emblem finished in ‘Turbonite’, much like on the exterior, and buyers can opt for a fully leather interior or one with sustainable materials, in line with the EV’s green cred. The car retains its four-screen layout, including one for the passenger, which gets a special coating so that it can’t distract the driver. The rear seat has good room, but the seating position is low and knees-up. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift ride and handling 'Leans' while cornering to minimise body movement The Taycan's handling belies its near-2.3-ton kerb weight. Circling back to the new Porsche Active Ride, this system is a technological marvel. Sure, Dubai’s pristine roads aren’t the best place to judge a car’s ride, but the Taycan walks the tightrope between handling and comfort with precision like few others. Around bends, it ‘leans’ like a motorcycle to maximise corner speed, and it also compensates for body movements like squatting and diving while accelerating or braking. The entire system is so clever that it does without anti-roll bars. And despite sitting on huge 21-inch wheels (Turbo S), the ride feels quite supple. Carbon ceramic brakes are standard fitments Handling is typical Porsche, which means the Taycan corners flat, and there’s tremendous grip, too. With the way it changes direction, you won’t be able to tell it weighs nearly 2.3 tonnes. That, coupled with the sharp and responsive steering, makes it the best-handling four-door EV on the market. The brakes are immense as well, and you get a good feel from the pedal. It’s worth noting that the Turbo S gets carbon ceramic brakes as standard. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift performance 0-100kph takes 2.7 seconds Immediate power delivery helps the Taycan Turbo S match the 911 Turbo's performance. On the move, the Taycan Turbo feels absolutely manic. With a max output of 884hp and 890Nm from its dual-motor setup, there’s always so much power in reserve that you can barely floor the throttle for a couple of seconds before doing illegal speeds. Mind you, the limit is 120kph in certain parts of the UAE. From a standstill, 100kph is dismissed in just 2.7 seconds – that’s as quick as the 992-gen 911 Turbo! And as it’s an EV, there’s no delay or lag in performance. Moreover, the clever Porsche Torque Vectoring system keeps all wheels in check without losing traction. That makes acceleration almost a non-event, aside from the ferocity with which it launches forward – that simply scrambles your brain. But there’s no getting away from the distinctive lack of sound, which, in a Porsche of all the cars, is essential to the driving experience. Taycan Turbo S develops 952hp and up to 1,110Nm Next up is the Turbo S, which dials things up even further. Power is now up to an eye-watering 952hp (from 761hp) while torque is up to 1,110Nm (from 1,050Nm) with the ‘Overboost’ or push-to-pass function, which gives you full power for up to 10 seconds. The difference in performance between the Turbo and Turbo S is like splitting hairs. Porsche will tell you that the S does 0-100kph in just 2.4 seconds, 0.3 seconds quicker than the Turbo, but the truth is that both feel equally relentless. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift battery, range, and charging It now gets a larger yet lighter battery, more efficient regen braking and can accept charge up to 320kW. Besides the added performance, Taycans now get a larger 105kWh ‘performance’ battery that weighs less than the older 93kWh unit, revised electronics and more efficient regenerative braking. The results are more range and quicker charging times. Charging speeds bumped up by 50kW Both the Turbo and Turbo S have a combined claimed range of up to 630km (WLTP), but in urban conditions, the former is claimed to give up to 683km and the latter up to 691km. Both can accept charge at speeds of up to 320kW, up 50kW from before, and the max regen capacity is also said to have improved by 30 percent. 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo facelift price and verdict Taycan Turbo S not coming to India While the Taycan Turbo S isn't on the cards for India, the base 2WD, 4S, and Turbo are on sale here. In India, Porsche sells the Taycan 4S for Rs 1.89 crore and the Taycan Turbo for Rs 2.52 crore; the base two-wheel-drive variant is due for a launch soon. However, Porsche won’t offer the Turbo S or the Nürburgring record-holding Taycan Turbo GT here. Nevertheless, the performance from the more ‘regular’ Turbo is mind-numbingly fast, and the Taycan remains the most electrifying EV out there. The updates have only made it more compelling. Not only is it quicker, but it also has more range, can charge faster and has more tech. It remains the enthusiasts’ EV of choice – for a price, of course.

    "description": "First previewed by a concept in September 2023, the Mercedes-Benz CLA has now been officially revealed as the brand’s new entry-level sedan with both EV and hybrid powertrains. In a first for Mercedes, the CLA EV and the CLA hybrid will share a common model name. This marks an end to Mercedes’ strategy of entirely bespoke EVs being developed to sit alongside their combustion-engined equivalents. CLA has been developed as an EV first, and then a hybrid Both EV and hybrid models look similar inside out CLA debuts Mercedes’ new MB.OS operating system Mercedes Benz CLA EV battery, range and powertrain CLA EV has more range than flagship EQS sedan The CLA EV lineup starts with the entry-level 250+ with EQ Technology that is claimed to deliver a range of 792km. Meanwhile, the all-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology is claimed to deliver 770km. What’s notable here is smaller disparity compared with the rear-driven version than is typical of most other EVs. Do note that these figures are still pending homologation under the WLTP cycle. However, what’s really interesting is that the rear-wheel drive CLA leapfrogs Mercedes’ own flagship EQS 580, which manages 770km per charge (WLTP) from a 118kWh battery. That remarkable range figure is thanks to Mercedes’ efforts to minimise the CLA EV’s energy consumption: it has a nickel-managanese-cobalt (NMC) battery of just 85kWh in capacity. This means the CLA EV achieves an efficiency figure north of 9.0km/kWh. Comes in both RWD and AWD configurations The CLA EV’s new rear-mounted permanent magnet motor is also significant to its efficiency. It produces more output in a smaller package, is lighter and has greater torque density, too. The motor also gets a Porsche Taycan-style two-speed gearbox, rather than the usual single-speed reduction gearing. The powertrain puts out 272hp, which allows the CLA 250+ to complete the 0-100kph dash in 6.7 seconds. The four-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology gets an additional 108hp motor with a single-speed gearbox on its front axle, giving a combined output of 354hp. This cuts its 0-100kph sprint time down to 4.9 seconds This additional motor is decoupled from the front axle when it isn’t needed, reducing energy losses to friction by 90 percent. Braking primarily relies on the motors’ regenerative effect (which can provide up to 200kW of stopping power), helping to keep the battery topped up. Can charge at up to 320kW, thanks to 800V architecture The CLA EV can be rapid-charged at rates of up to 320kW, thanks to its 800V electrical architecture, allowing for a 300km top-up in just 10 minutes. In addition to the 85kWh battery, a 58kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) pack will also be offered at a later stage. Mercedes Benz CLA hybrid powertrain Mercedes says it has diesel levels of efficiency The new CLA will also be offered in hybrid form. Specifically designed to fit in the same space as the EV’s front motor, its powertrain pairs a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a small, 1.3kWh battery and a 27hp electric motor. These combine to send either 136hp or 163hp through the front wheels or, in the range-topping 4Matic model, 191hp to all four wheels. Mercedes claims the new hybrid powertrain gives the CLA “diesel levels of fuel efficiency”. Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius also announced that the hybrid will be priced at par with the EV in a push for greater parity between EVs and combustion models. Mercedes Benz CLA exterior design and aerodynamics CLA has a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21 The CLA EV’s impressive range figure is in no small part thanks to its aerodynamic design. Although the car is larger than its predecessor in every dimension (25mm wider, 25mm taller and 30mm longer), much work went into minimising its frontal area, and smoothing the flow of air around it. For example, the wheels are set further in-board of the arches than its predecessor. Small inlets on the front bumper (and corresponding outlets at the rear) guide the flow of air around each corner, relatively undisturbed by the alloy wheels’ flush-faced designs. The efforts net a slippery drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21, just behind that of the EQS (0.20). CLA EV and CLA hybrid share the same design Also, in a first for Mercedes, the CLA hybrid and CLA EV will look almost identical inside and out. The new CLA emphasises on the brand’s three-pointed star logo with its lighting elements. The motif features in the CLA’s headlights and rear brake lights, and the EV also gets a flush front grille with no fewer than 142 backlit stars. They surround the main front badge, which is also backlit. The CLA hybrid is differentiated by a traditional open grille, needed to provide cooling airflow to the engine. Mercedes Benz CLA interior and features Superscreen setup continues in CLA Inside, the new CLA takes on a sportier character than its more luxurious stablemates. The front seats have chunky side bolsters, for example, and there are more exuberant material choices, such as a combination of black and white Alcantara and faux leather with red stitching. The dashboard is designed around the latest iteration of Mercedes’ Superscreen, whose three digital displays (a 10.25in one for the instruments in front of the driver; a 14.6in infotainment one centrally; and, optionally, a 14in one for the front passenger) span its entire width. New MB.OS operating system brings AI functions Thanks to Mercedes’ latest MB.OS operating system, the screens can be used to play video games or stream shows and films via Netflix and other such services. The system also features the latest iteration of Mercedes’ virtual assistant, which blends various artificial intelligence functions (ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Bing) to provide more accurate answers to questions. In cars without the Superscreen, the passenger screen will be replaced with a glass panel with LED-backlit star logos, which match the interior’s ambient lighting. Boot space is rated at 405 litres. In a first for a modern Mercedes, the EV gets a frunk that adds another 101 litres of storage space. Mercedes Benz CLA launch details India launch expected by end of 2025 The CLA will first go on sale in its EV guise, around October in Europe, with the hybrid following a few months later. Joining the sedan will also be a new CLA estate version with both powertrain options, and is expected to be showcased around September at the Munich Motor Show. The CLA sedan is expected to arrive here in India by the end of 2025 as well.  Also See: 2025 Defender Octa price announcement on March 26 New BMW iX3 design previewed by Neue Klasse X prototype",

    "description": "https://youtu.be/gF_VI4Ooafw Jean-Philippe Duval never finished school. In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. Continue...",
