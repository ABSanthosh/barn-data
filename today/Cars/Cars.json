    "description": "This 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500 fastback is one of 2,048 examples produced for the model year and was completed on January 12, 1967. It was first delivered to Mel Burns Ford in Long Beach, California, and the car spent time with several owners in the state and was refurbished at some point under prior ownership. Power is provided by a 428ci Cobra Jet V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission. Work in 2024 included servicing the carburetors and replacing the shift shaft seal and fuel-sending unit. Finished in green with white stripes, the car is equipped with functional hood scoops, a rear spoiler, power-assisted front disc brakes, power steering, and 10-spoke 15″ wheels in addition to a folding rear bench seat, an AM radio, and a heater. This GT500 is now offered by the seller at no reserve with a Deluxe Marti Report, a Shelby Registry report, a spare set of wheels, spare parts, and a clean Arizona title in the name of the late owner's estate.",

    "description": "Rejuvenated icon promises better on-road manners without compromising off-road capability The Toyota Land Cruiser is proof that the Japanese firm truly offers the most diverse model range in the business. Sure, one could haul a Mercedes A-Class inside a Mercedes Actros, but they don’t live next to each other in showrooms. Whereas you could drive away from a Toyota dealer in anything from a 65mpg hybrid supermini to a straight-six manual sports car – or an off-roader with a ladder-frame chassis, a live rear axle and a 2.8-litre four-cylinder diesel engine.The Land Cruiser helped build the Japanese brand’s reputation for solid engineering, and although it is a bit of a niche thing in Europe, elsewhere it’s still massive.You can take that literally: in some markets, the Land Cruiser has its own model range, including the 4.6m-long Land Cruiser 300 Series and the ultra-old-school Land Cruiser 70 Series. That comes with a 4.5-litre V8 diesel and a manual ’box.Over here, we get just the 250 Series, also known as Prado, and it entered a new generation in 2024. It’s not electric, it’s not even a hybrid (not over here, anyway) and the mechanical specification hasn’t radically altered from the old one.But although the new J250-generation Land Cruiser isn’t a radical departure from the J150  before it, there’s still plenty to talk about.The Toyota Land Cruiser range at a glanceAll Land Cruisers sold in the UK are powered by the familiar 2.8-litre four-cylinder diesel engine from the old Land Cruiser and the current Toyota Hilux pick-up truck, although it has been updated for a broader spread of torque through a new, smaller turbocharger. A 48V mild-hybrid version will join the range later.The four-pot diesel is paired with a new eight-speed automatic gearbox. Toyota calls it Direct Shift, which means it is a torque converter with a lock-up clutch that closes at lower speeds than before. Toyota offers two specifications: Invincible and First Edition. The First Edition, offered in limited numbers and now sold out, exclusively features a paint job reminiscent of the classic 1960s Land Cruiser 40, with round headlights and either Smoky Blue or Land Sand paint, matched with a grey roof. All cars come as standard with black leather upholstery, dual-zone air conditioning, a 12.3in touchscreen and a head-up display. Other equipment includes a JBL stereo, a panoramic reversing camera, a digital driver’s display, 20in alloy wheels and a sunroof.What’s quite unusual is that you can choose from two entirely different headlight designs: one square, one circular. First Edition cars get the circular lights as standard, and Invincible cars get square ones.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jeep-avenger-electric-undercuts-key-rivals-prices-slashed-5k",
    "description": "Entry-level Avenger is £1801 less than the rival Mini Aceman Stellantis brand's lone electric model gets big discounts to close the gap to the petrol version Jeep has slashed prices for the Avenger Electric, meaning the small SUV now undercuts rivals such as the Mini Aceman, Smart #1 and Volvo EX30 by a significant margin. The entry-level Longitude model now starts at £29,999, which is £5000 cheaper than previously. That’s £1801 less than the Aceman, £1951 less than the #1 and £2850 less than the EX30. It also puts it on a par with the new Ford Puma Gen-E, which starts at £29,995. The Avenger's middle-rung Altitude trim is now £31,999 (£4700 less than before), while the Summit range-topper is £33,999 (down by £4900). Asked by Autocar why the discounts had been introduced, Jeep parent company Stellantis said: \"This pricing adjustment makes the transition to an electric Jeep Avenger more accessible for customers, offering them an electric alternative without a significant price gap compared to an ICE Avenger model.\" The petrol Avenger is priced from £24,949. It’s possible that the move has also been made in order to stimulate greater demand for the Avenger Electric, as government-mandated EV sales targets ramp up in 2025. The UK's zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate dictates that 22% of any given car manufacturer’s new car sales must be electric, and the proportion will rise to 28% next year. Companies that miss their targets face fines of £15,000 for every combustion-engined car they sell over the allowed threshold. Autocar understands that Jeep’s current EV sales figures put it on track to meet the stricter 28% ratio next year, but only by a fine margin. Discounting the Avenger Electric – currently its only EV – will surely help the brand (and by extension Stellantis) meet that target more comfortably.",

    "description": "The early 1970s were trying times at Harley-Davidson. The effects of AMF’s takeover in 1969 were trashing the company’s reputation and finances, and the flood of incoming Japanese standards provided reliable low-cost alternatives. To make matters worse, Harley’s grip on dirt track racing was in jeopardy after Brits had twisted the AMA’s arm for a single allowable displacement, no matter the valve configuration. With the backbone of Harley’s racing department threatened, it was a mad dash to regain AMA supremacy from Triumph and BSA, resulting in the all-conquering XR750 and a lesser-known pavement star called the XRTT. With scant resources to operate on, Harley’s initial effort at an OHV 750 was based on the 900 ci Iron-Head Sportster, with the engine de-stroked dramatically to fall with the allowable displacement.…",

    "description": "High-end custom motorcycles are a joy to ogle, but owning them is often beyond the reach of us mere mortals. Not everyone has the skill or time to build pinnacle-level custom, nor the money to commission one. The average rider is more likely to see a custom bike they like, and then look at how they can add a smidgen of that style to their own ride. That’s why several custom workshops offer some of their best parts as bolt-on accessories—and why JSK Moto has now joined their ranks. This BMW R nineT café racer is the third custom R nineT that the California-based outfit has built, but it’s the first one that’s been designed with mass production in mind. Founded by Taiwanese ex-pat Samuel Kao in 2010, JSK Moto’s mission here was to build a slick custom that could be broken down into kit form.…",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "First things first. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback you see here is not an all-electric replacement for the ICE A6 we’re all familiar with. In fact, the two models have little in common. You see, under Audi’s new naming system electric vehicles will have odd numbers in the name with ‘e-tron’ as a suffix (eg. Q4 e-tron, Q6 e-tron, Q8 e-tron) while ICE models will run odd numbers. The next-gen A6 will become ‘A7’, ‘A5’ is the name for what is the latest-gen A4 and so on.    This A6 e-tron is the second Audi model after the Q6 e-tron to be built on PPE or premium platform electric co-developed with Porsche. Advancements on the motors, battery and architecture promise enhanced efficiency, faster charging and superior performance. The A6 e-tron has been unveiled in Avant or estate form that's sadly not headed to India and this Sportback bodystyle which is headed to India in 2025. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback design The A6 e-tron looks substantial because it is. It's about the same size as the A6 petrol we are familiar with, but there's more mass to the design, something most noticeable at the sides. A black applique low down on the doors, there to also indicate the position of the battery, helps break the bulk. The fastback tail gives the A6 e-tron Sportback its eye-catching shape and to me, it looks best from the rear three-fourth angle. There's a lovely flow from roof to high-deck boot and the full-width lighting is really slick. A glowing rear logo is a first for an Audi and the digital OLED tail lamps almost have a language of their own with eight selectable patterns and the ability to display warning images to communicate hazards to vehicles behind. With split headlamps, a semi-concealed grille and a black ‘mask’ on the bumper to hide the air dams and ADAS hardware, frontal styling is a dramatic departure from the Audi template. The LED DRLs positioned up top get eight selectable patterns and this is a cool touch. A fact of note is that the A6 e-tron Sportback is the most aerodynamic Audi ever, and this bodes well for range. But, and this is just me, I'm not a fan of this newfangled organic styling. I like my Audi's angular. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback interior and features Inside, you'll see the latest from Audi and that's a good thing. The basic layout is similar to what we’ve seen on the Q6 e-tron which means it’s a cutting edge interior but also a screen-rich interior. There’s 11.9-inch digital dials, a 14.5-inch centre touchscreen as well as a 10.9-inch passenger screen. And that's not all. Versions with Virtual Mirrors (camera pods that replace the wing mirrors) also add in screens near the A-pillars. And lest I forget, there's also head-up display with augmented reality! The latest-gen digital dials are a huge upgrade from Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instruments we’ve seen for nearly a decade. It’s got crisp graphics, nice colours and plenty of info, though what’s missed is the option to go in-depth into EV stats. Over the driving I did find myself relying more on the head-up display, though. There's superb detailing and the augmented reality indications for ADAS and navigation that overlay warnings and symbols onto the driving environment are fantastic. The centre touchscreen is, again, slick and responsive but the menus can feel intimidating at first glance. Shortcuts and widgets do help personalise the screen for ease of use but packing in climate control settings on the screen is not ideal. Connected tech gives access to a full world of apps that can be downloaded on to the main screen. The passenger screen is a good way to keep your front passenger entertained while you're doing the hard work of driving a very nice and very soothing electric car. What’s nice is that the screen is not visible from the driver’s point of view on the go. Along with the closely related Q6 e-tron, the A6 e-tron marks a return to form for Audi in terms of quality. Everything you see and touch feels really high-end. The gloss look to the screens looks rich and goes well with the piano black on the center console. Also really nicely done are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering. They work really well and better than what we've seen on the latest lot of Mercedes cars. There’s a touch panel on the door too for the lights. Front seat comfort is good, helped in part by the option for ventilation, heating and massage. A leather-free interior is optional and I have to say the fabric upholstery on the seats and dashboard is tastefully done. Of the other elements, there's ambient lighting that subtly adds some color to the cabin and flashes warnings such as for safe exits. The A6 is also available with the option of a full glass roof that can go from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. There's also the option of an 830-watt Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system. Four of the 20 speakers are integrated onto the front headrest for a more personalized sound right near your ears. Soft close doors are part of the package too. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity The rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed too but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack. Luggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1330 litres of room. There's no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European spec. The tailgate is powered and handily, Audi has added in a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to kick to activate the opening or closing function. There's a small 27-litre frunk too and uniquely, it too can be opened with a swipe on the bonnet. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range On to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor. Power is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range - 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80% charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling A drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect. The Performance version might be the long variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it's fast, it's responsive and overtakings don't require much thinking. But what's different about the A6 is that it's not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things. You feel as much when toggling between the drive modes too. There's comfort, efficiency, dynamic and balanced modes and each impact the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi's lineup. Don't get me wrong because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you're in the mood. It's just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking The A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check.  Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency and dynamic modes for best aero but in India, owners will probably use the lift function more than anything else. Quick as the A6 is, it's just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddleshifters. There's also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi's system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What's really nice is that you can't sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they're working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy dense battery and high efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict The Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025, the A6 e-tron sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it's a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back. Refinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung performance versions get you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of one crore rupees ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car. The A6 e-tron Sportback represents the shape of things to come from Audi and it sure does impress.

Refreshed models produced in 2023 get up to Rs 2.70 lakh off, while benefits of up to Rs 45,000 are available on the MY2024 Harrier and Safari. Both of Tata’s flagship SUVs are powered by the 170hp, 2.0-litre diesel engine, mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox. The 5-seater Harrier is priced between Rs 14.99 lakh and Rs 25.89 lakh, while the 3-row Safari is between Rs 15.49 lakh and Rs 26.79 lakh. Tata Nexon discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.85 lakh Like with the larger SUVs, some dealers still have the pre-facelift inventory of the Nexon, which is being offered with massive discounts of up to Rs 2.85 lakh. This includes cash discounts and an exchange or scrappage bonus. However, units of the Nexon facelift produced in 2023 get benefits up to Rs 2.10 lakh. MY2024 Nexons get discounts of up to Rs 45,000, depending on variant. There are no discounts yet on the recently launched Nexon CNG. Tata’s website lists 100 variants of the Nexon, which comes with as many as seven powertrain options (not including the all-electric version). The 120hp, 1.2-litre, turbo-petrol engine has a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, 6-speed AMT, and 7-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox options, while the 115hp, 1.5-litre diesel has 6-speed MT and AMT options. When running on CNG, the 1.2-litre mill produces 100hp, and is available only with a 6-speed manual gearbox. Prices for Tata’s answer to the Mahindra XUV 3XO and Hyundai Venue range from Rs 8.00 lakh to Rs 15.80 lakh. Tata Tiago, Tigor discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.05 lakh MY2023 versions of Tata’s smallest models, the Tiago hatchback and its compact sedan counterpart, the Tigor, get whopping discounts of up to Rs 2.05 lakh this month. 2024 models get discounts in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 45,000, depending on the variant. Both come with a 1.2-litre, three-cylinder engine that makes 86hp on petrol and 73.4hp on CNG. In either case, 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT options are on offer. The Tiago currently costs between Rs 5.00 lakh and Rs 8.75 lakh, while the Tigor is priced between Rs 6.00 lakh and Rs 9.40 lakh. Tata Altroz discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.05 lakh Altroz hatchbacks produced in 2023, in petrol, diesel, and CNG forms, all come with discounts of up to Rs 2.05 lakh, which is a lakh more than last month. Meanwhile, most MY2024 models get up to Rs 60,000 off, depending on the variant. The performance-oriented Altroz Racer gets Rs 80,000 in total discounts this month. The Altroz range is priced from Rs 6.50 lakh to Rs 11.16 lakh, with Tata saying that there are a total of 46 variants on offer. It should be noted that the Altroz is the only model among its rivals (like the Hyundai i20 and Maruti Baleno) to offer a diesel engine option. Tata Punch discounts in December 2024 Save up to Rs 1.55 lakh The Punch SUV currently has discounts up to Rs 1.55 lakh on MY2023 models, up massively from just Rs 40,000 last month.  Units produced in 2024 have benefits of up to R 20,000, again, depending on the variant.

Tata’s rival to the Hyundai Exter and Maruti Ignis comes with a 1.2-litre engine, making 88hp on petrol and 73.5hp on CNG. While select petrol variants get an AMT option, the CNG ones are manual only. The Punch’s price starts at Rs 6.13 lakh and goes up to Rs 10.15 lakh.

    "description": "Hero’s electric subsidiary Vida has launched its new V2 e-scooter, which is available in three variants: Lite (Rs 96,000), Plus (Rs 1.15 lakh) and Pro (Rs 1.35 lakh).  Lite variant gets a 2.2kWh battery, 94km claimed IDC range V2 Plus, Pro identical to V1 models Battery packs come with 3-year/30,000km warranty Vida V2 model lineup explained The Vida V2 is an evolution of the V1 range that Hero had kicked off its EV innings with. The most affordable V2 Lite is an entirely new variant and comes with a small 2.2kWh battery pack that has a claimed 94km IDC range. It also has a lower 69kph top speed compared to the Plus and Pro variants, which have top speeds of 85kph and 90kph, respectively. Only two riding modes are available on the V2 Lite – Ride and Eco – but the rest of the feature-set is very similar to the other two, including the 7-inch touchscreen TFT display.  At Rs 96,000 (ex-showroom, Delhi), Hero’s Vida V2 sits bang on par with the TVS iQube 2.2 and Bajaj Chetak 2903 models, in terms of price and battery capacity. When it comes to the V2 Plus and V2 Pro, the changes are rather hard to make out. Essentially, these versions are uncannily similar to the V1 models, if not the same. The Rs 1.15 lakh V2 Plus has a 3.44kWh battery pack, an 85kph top speed and a 143km claimed IDC range. The range-topper in the Vida V2 lineup is the Rs 1.35 lakh V2 Pro, which has a 3.94kWh battery, 90kph top speed and a 165km claimed IDC range.  The e-scooter comes with a 5-year/50,000km warranty whereas the battery packs come with a 3-year/30,000km warranty.  Vida has slowly but steadily made inroads into the EV market, with sales numbers for Hero’s electric subsidiary growing steadily every month. With the launch of this new affordable V2 Lite, and the growing network of Vida showrooms across India, expect the company to cement itself in the top five players in the EV game in the coming months.
