    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-we-finally-love-toyota-supra-just-it-gets-axe",
    "description": "Occasionally it takes time for a car's virtues to become apparent. Why? I'm not so sure... With a limited-run Final Edition special, the Toyota GR Supra is about to depart this earthly realm, nearly six years after it was launched early in 2019 at the Detroit motor show. It doesn’t seem like six years to me, even though Toyota had been talking about building a new Supra since 2012, we saw prototypes in 2018 and in September 2019 I drove a still-disguised pre-production ‘A90’. Perhaps it’s my age, but it still seems like the Supra hasn’t long arrived, and yet with a 429bhp special, away it goes. Not that it was that easy to buy one in the UK later in its life anyway. This market was granted a small annual allocation of cars and the Supra was in and out of Toyota’s price lists as a result. The Final Edition is limited to 300 examples globally, and it’s not year clear how many the UK will get. But it brings with it a serious number of changes: extra power, adjustable KW dampers from a GT4 track variant, new drilled brake discs, an Akrapovic exhaust, baffles in the sump to prevent oil starvation, extra body bracing, exterior aerodynamic addenda and some incredibly uncomfortable-looking seats. Sounds like a proper circuit weapon. But even though it seems (to me) like the Supra has been around for no time at all, my attitude towards it has shifted markedly – totally unlike, say, how I feel about the Alpine A110, which hasn’t had too dissimilar a lifespan. I loved the A110 at launch and still love it the same way now. (Incidentally, while the A110 is still around, its non-compliance with the EU’s General Safety Regulations 2 means Alpine can sell no more than 1500 across Europe per year. Why hasn’t the UK exempted itself from this? Why aren’t we marching on parliament to demand more A110s?)  Meanwhile, the Supra is a car that I think I like more now than when in 2019 our road test found “it left us wanting more”.  It was something of a ‘not quite’ car: not quite an A110, not quite a Porsche 718 Cayman. Good but perhaps the least satisfying of the group of cars that all decided they might be able to take on the Porsche all at the same time. Today I’m more sold on the general attitude of the Supra than ever. I don’t want ‘more’ than the ordinary one, with a six-cylinder engine, an automatic gearbox and whatever else it came with at the time. While it has a 51:49 weight distribution (remember, the platform is shared with the BMW Z4) and it’s a quick coupé and surely it’s agile enough, it cuts a relatively relaxed vibe when you’re driving one. And I’m here for that. As a future classic car, it has bags of appeal, in my view. I think some cars do get more appealing as they age, and as yet I haven’t put my finger on exactly why. But sports cars that weren’t class-leading at the time but seem more mellow now are certainly chief among them. A mate has an early Mercedes-Benz SLK, far from the world’s greatest roadster new, but he loves it as a summer cruiser, and I get it. The other week, I drove around parts of the US where it’s common for people to park a car by the side of busier roads with ‘for sale’ signs in the windows. I mostly saw run-down muscle cars, old pick-up trucks and scabby 4x4s. All were surely pretty dreadful to drive, yet it would almost be worth moving there just to be able to buy and daily any of them. Plus, I think in the Supra’s case, as is the way with many other Japanese sports cars, the lack of an immediate replacement brings an extra sense of loss. There were decades between Honda NSXs, there’s no Toyota MR2 or Celica at the moment, nor is there a Honda S2000 and nor can you buy a rotary-engined Mazda coupé. The Japanese seem more comfortable with hiatuses coming between models. Maybe they knew to appreciate the Supra more when it was around, rather than just when it looked like it was going.",

    "title": "Private buyers bought fewer new cars last year than Covid-hit 2020",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/private-buyers-bought-fewer-new-cars-last-year-covid-hit-2020",
    "description": "Overall car sales did rise last year but were heavily propped up by fleets – sparking industry worry The number of new cars bought by UK private buyers last year was fewer than in 2020, when the country was in the midst of the Covid pandemic. Around 746,000 cars were sold to private buyers in 2024, some 1000 fewer than five years ago, when car buying was temporarily halted by lockdowns. It was also down 8.7% on 2023. Despite this, car sales still rose 2.6% on 2023 to 1.95 million. However, 1.16m of these were fleet sales (up 11.8% year on year), accounting for six in 10 new cars sold.  This is a worrying position to be in, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) boss Mike Hawes said, as the split between private and fleet sales used to be closer to even. Hawes blamed the drop in private sales on “the confusion for buyers of which vehicle to buy”, a comment aimed at mixed messaging from the government over the past few years. This was a key reason for many car makers not hitting the government’s zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate target of 22%, the SMMT claimed, with just one in 10 new cars sold to private buyers being battery-powered. A market share of 19.6% was, although under the target, a record for EVs – one of the few positives to come from the year. During 2024, 381,959 EVs were sold, up 21.4% on 2023 – the year’s biggest riser. This total made EVs the second most popular car type behind petrol (1.02 million sales) and 'self-charging' hybrids (261,396). In a sign of the times, petrol car sales were down some 40,000 on 2023 and fewer than 125,000 diesel cars were sold. “This should be a success story, with a record share of EV sales and [overall] numbers up,” Hawes told journalists at a year-end briefing. ”But instead the cost of delivering that, and that [EV sales] are still shy of the government’s ZEV targets, cast a shadow.” He added: “If we did not have the [ZEV] mandate, we would say that this was a good year.” Hawes used the 2024 results to again call on the government to bring back buying incentives for EV buyers, which were pulled in 2022. This would be in the form of lowered VAT on car purchases and VAT parity between public and home charging. “Incentives make a big difference, as they help people into these vehicles while also sending the right messages,” said Hawes.  He added that fleet incentives – delivered via benefit-in-kind tax breaks – should be transferred to private buyers. Similarly, Kia UK boss Paul Philpott told Autocar: \"There aren't enough carrots for the consumers, other than in fleet market, and the fleet user-chooser is proving that where they have relatively sensible incentives behind electric vehicles, buyers want to try them; where there aren't, they're more reticent to move in numbers.\"  Hawes claimed that car manufacturers are already shelling out billions of pounds in lowered car prices to incentives buyers in an attempt to hit the ZEV mandate’s target, but “manufacturer incentives shows an unhealthy market”. Although there seems to be appetite for change from the new Labour government which has already launched a consultation on potentially amending the ZEV mandate, Hawes warned that any changes – expected at the back end of 2025 at the earliest – might be too late, given that “a number of car makers have warned me they won’t hit mandate targets this year”. For 2025, car makers must, in real terms, increase EV sales by 46% in order to hit the mandate’s new 28% sales target – goals that increase each year. This, the SMMT claims, won’t be hit: of the 1.97 million new cars that it predicts will be sold this year, just 23.3% are expected to be EVs. Elsewhere, the SMMT’s figures revealed that, with 48,340 sales, the Ford Puma was the UK’s best selling car, narrowly pipping the Kia Sportage (47,163) to top spot. The Nissan Qashqai (42,418) and Nissan Juke (34,454), both UK-made, placed third and fourth. In fifth was the Tesla Model Y, with 32,862 sales, which also made the SUV the country’s best-selling EV, a year on from being crowned the world’s most bought car.  The Model Y was the only EV to place in the overall top 10. That might not be the case in 2025, though, with an influx of more affordable EVs – such as the Renault 4, Renault 5 and Citroën ë-C3 – joining the market.",

    "description": "Many custom bike builders develop a signature style over time—but that style is often attached to one particular make, model, or era of motorcycling. Then there are craftsmen who can apply their distinct art to any canvas, without compromise. Kengo Kimura of Heiwa MC is one such artisan. Based in Hiroshima, Kimura-san is one of the leading lights in the Japanese custom scene. His custom bikes are recognizable for their elegant tapered silhouettes, and the way each part harmonizes with the next. Most of his projects use older models as donors, but he’s just as adept at modifying new bikes—as evidenced by this handsome 2024-model custom Triumph Scrambler 900. What’s remarkable is how much Kengo’s been able to manipulate the modern Triumph to suit his vision.…",

They’re usually existing models, upgraded with fancy liveries and, in some cases, numbered plaques. But the fact that they come out twice a decade (and in strong numbers) sort of diminishes their allure. It’s little wonder, then, that the owner of this 100th Anniversary Harley Springer Softail had no qualms about handing it over to our man in Taiwan, Winston Yeh, for a Rough Crafts makeover. As implied, the 2003-model Harley-Davidson Springer Softail followed The Motor Co.’s typical Softail formula, with a vintage-style springer front end added to the mix. This particular example had already been dressed in a handful of aftermarket parts, so Winston’s client had no illusions about keeping it stock.…",

    "description": "After Ather debuted Magic Twist and traction control on the 450 Apex, they trickled down to the family-centric Rizta. Now, the company has endowed the 450X with the same, and also peppered it with other small changes. Ather 450X changes for 2025, new features Unlike the Rizta, where the systems are simply on or off, the ones on the 450X are adjustable. Magic Twist has two levels – Low and High – while traction control has three – Rain, Road and Rally – and both can be turned off entirely as well. Both TC and Magic Twist can be switched off entirely. I’ve been using Magic Twist on our Rizta long-termer for a few months now, and I find it to be a useful, intuitive feature on my commutes. I think the adjustability of this feature on the 450X only exemplifies its usefulness. In chock-a-block traffic, I preferred to leave the Magic Twist in Low, which helped reduce the aggressiveness of the regen. It was still effective enough to bring the scooter to a halt without using the brakes.  The Magic Twist has also brought with it an added bonus – a big claimed increased range. For the 2.9kWh 450X variant, Ather claims that TrueRange has gone up from 85km to 105km, and that of the 3.7kWh variant has seen an even larger increment, from 105km to 130km. In the short time frame of this first ride experience, we weren’t able to put these claims to the test, so we’ll reserve our judgement until we can conduct a thorough road test in Mumbai.  Some of the aforementioned range increase is also attributed to the new Zapper N e-tred tyres, co-developed by both MRF and Ather. Ather claims these tyres have lower rolling resistance, thereby helping increase the scooter’s range. The company also claims that there’s a minuscule trade-off in grip, but it’s nothing I felt during my time with the 450X. Visually, these are identical to the earlier MRF Zapper tyres and have the exact same tread pattern; the difference lies purely in how they are constructed. New tyres help increase range, look the same. When it comes to traction control, I found myself leaving the scooter in Rally mode for almost the entirety of my time with it. Rally allows a fair bit of slip on loose surfaces before it reins the scooter in, letting you have fun while keeping you safe. Even when I was riding in Warp mode over some properly rough surfaces, it worked smoothly in the background. The other two modes are more cautious, for those of you who don’t like getting ‘Swayze’ every now and then. The final change is the obvious one: new colours. You’ve got this bold Hyper Sand option as well as a more subtle Stealth Blue option. The former is reserved just for the 450X, while the latter can be optioned even on the 450S.  The discreet belt drive cover looks neat, goes with the 450X's aesthetic. The 450X has always been a sleek, sharp-looking thing, and a small update that Ather has made in the recent past, which may have flown under the radar, is the new belt drive cover. It is ultra-sleek and not bulky like the Rizta’s. Ather 450X handling, issues we faced Beyond that, the 450X is the same as it’s always been. That means it’s still the same energetic, eager, and properly zippy thing that we’ve come to know and love over the past seven years.  Experiencing the 450X at the tight Aruani Grid go-kart track made me remember what a fun machine this is! It is by far one of the sharpest and most fun scooters in the market today, price notwithstanding.   Yes, it is still a little tight for taller folks, and its stiff ride quality is not very pleasant over bad roads – something available in abundance in our country.  The one additional gripe I have with the updated 450X is that locking up the rear wheel has become easier than before, with Magic Twist working hand-in-glove with the sharp rear disc. Riding it on Bombay’s slippery, gravel-ridden concrete roads is one additional concern I foresee.  Ather 450X price, verdict Ather’s software update for the 450X has given it some useful features and additional range, which is always welcome.  The price increase varies from variant to variant, ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,400. The biggest hike has actually gone to the 450X 2.9, but Ather will now supply the faster 700W charger with this variant, which alone is well worth the extra money. With its updated pricing, the 450X retains its premium position in the market, and if you’re browsing for a fun scooter, this is still one of the most entertaining ones available.  Also see:  2025 Ather 450X video review",

    "description": "Only here for three quick months that flew by in a flash, the Punch EV didn’t feel like a ‘long’ termer in the same way most of our others do. That is partly due to the fact that it frequently changed hands within the team since everyone wanted to have some time with it, and thus, no one ever used it for a long enough spell. On a less favourable note, it’s also because we’ve actually had two Punch EVs in the fleet, as Tata gave us a temporary replacement car when it took this one in for inspection after it threw up a critical alert in its first week with us, and would not start. Once it was back, the error never showed again, though it was not without other electronic gaffes, such as the camera feeds sometimes going blank, the infotainment system freezing, wireless charging stopping frequently, and my phone being regularly booted out of Android Auto. They really need to address these software gremlins soon. I’m also not a fan of how it has an auditory alert for… everything! Changing drive modes, engaging the parking brake, and even leaving the rear seatbelts unfastened (even without passengers) fires off some form of annoying alert. Show, don’t tell, Tata Motors. No rear load sensors means seat belt warning beeps unless buckled at all times. More time behind the wheel has allowed me to dig into the nuances of the powertrain a bit more. Mixing it up with other EVs, I’ve found Tata’s Acti.ev architecture could do with a bit more refinement. No, I don’t mean the NVH levels (those are excellent), but rather the control weights, brake blending and power delivery. It can feel abrupt and erratic as you move from accelerating to coasting to braking, and with the rapid rate at which EVs are evolving, there are others that now do it more seamlessly.  It’s not, however, enough to take away from the fact this is a great all-round package – and that’s before you even consider its price or its compact and convenient size. I’ve loved my commutes to work in it and the ability to park in the tiniest of spots – an essential trait for a car in Mumbai. Plus, it goes like hell if you want it to and has an almost uncanny ability to absorb even the harshest of bumps at any speed. While I’m far from the most efficient driver, even I managed a superb 6.9km/kWh in the Punch EV. But my colleague Lokesh from our Hindi channel WhatCar? India managed 8.5! The battery may not be huge, but you can really rinse out every cell in this car. Good design, light colours give it a premium feel inside. Perhaps the brevity of its tenure has also afforded me a greater appreciation of its light-coloured interior since I’m not the one who’s going to have to get it detailed every second month. When it’s clean, though, the effect it has is tremendous – as if it’s trickled down directly from Tata-owned Range Rover. Even the steering wheel is dual-tone leatherette-wrapped, grey and cream, which is a bold choice in an entry-level EV, and then there’s the liberal use of gloss black plastic that looks great, though it is prone to smudges, scratches and reflections. Helpful battery, charging data on screens (when they work). There is a sense with this car, and a lot of Tata models if I’m honest, that design comes first and foremost, whether inside or out, and I like that. The brand’s family aesthetic runs through the Punch EV, and it extends not just to the bodywork and upholstery but also to the screen graphics. Yes, those screens may glitch, and the text is too small in places, but boy, do they look good! They’re colourful, clean, and actually pack in a good amount of data and features. Tata’s EV reign may have plateaued – the MG Windsor even took the top spot on the sales charts – but that appears more a function of market trends. The brand does need to sort out its electric and electronic gremlins immediately, which is something that’s plaguing the ICE models, too. Because once they do, the model range on offer is nothing short of impressive, and it’s only growing. As I’ve said before, there are bigger, better Tata EVs, but the Punch EV is a concentrated distillation of everything the brand has done so far. Will we have another electric Tata in our fleet soon? I hope so. Also see: Tata Punch EV long term review, 7,000km report Tata Punch EV review: Feels like a mini-Nexon EV",

Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "Ather has updated its sporty 450 range of electric scooters with some new features and more range. Prices start at Rs 1.30 lakh for the 450S, then you step up to the mid 450X 2.9 at Rs 1.47 lakh and finally, you have the top 450X 3.7, which costs Rs 1.57 lakh.  450X 3.7 sees the smallest price increase 450X 2.9 sees biggest hike but now comes with 700W charger Two new colours on offer - brown and blue The updated Ather 450S now costs Rs 4,400 more than before and you now get a slightly faster 375W charger (in comparison to the older model which came with a 350W unit). This results in faster charging times in comparison to the previous model. Ather has also raised the price of the Pro Pacl on the 450S to Rs 14,000, which is one thousand rupees more than before. Most features on an Ather e-scooter come bundled in with the Pro Pack so this is worth bearing in mind.  Both variants of the 450X now get Magic Twist and Traction Control (both are adjustable with various levels) as well as two new colours. The 450X 2.9 has seen the biggest hike, at Rs 6,400, but Ather now sells this scooter with the faster 700W charger, which has almost halved the charging time.  The range-topping 450X 3.7 has seen a price increase of just Rs 2,000 and except for the new features and colours, it remains identical to the previous version. On this top variant, you have two levels of Magic Twist (Low and High), whereas on the lower 450X 2.9, you can only turn it off or have it on.  While the prices of both 450X variants have changed, the Pro Pack will cost you the same as before at Rs 17,000 and Rs 20,000, for the 2.9kWh and 3.7kWh variants, respectively.  There are also two new colours - Hyper Sand and Stealth Blue. The former is reserved only for the 450X, while the latter can be had on both the Ather 450s. To read our review of the updated 450X, you can tap HERE.

    "description": "If you are a performance car enthusiast and if you’re lucky enough to afford one, it seems like you’ll be spoilt for choices for new cars to choose from in 2025. From an all-new Lamborghini and Ferrari, two new Aston Martins, updates to existing nameplates, and even some new electric sportscars, there are a lot of high-performance machines arriving in India this year. Let’s take a closer look at each. Aston Martin Vanquish The all-new Vanquish, Aston Martin’s flagship front-engine tourer, is powered by a 5.2-litre twin-turbo V12 that produces 835hp and a massive 1,000Nm. The company claims a 0-100kph time of just 3.3 seconds, and a top speed of 345kph. It casts a longer, more flowing silhouette than its siblings, the DB12 and Vantage, befitting of its ‘hyper tourer’ status. The launch is expected in the first quarter of 2025, and prices are likely to be around the Rs 6 crore mark. (ex-showroom). Aston Martin Vantage Roadster Vantage coupe used for representation Aston Martin will bring the drop-top version of its Vantage sports car here shortly after its global debut. Other than the convertible roof top, the updates from the coupé will carry over, including the AMG-sourced 665hp V8, and the generous equipment list. There’s nothing entry-level about Aston’s junior sportscar though, with prices expected to be around the Rs 5 crore mark (ex-showroom). The Vantage Roadster will arrive by the middle of the year, but before that, the updated DBX 707, with its new interior, is also scheduled to arrive in the first quarter of 2025. Audi e-tron GT facelift The facelift for Audi’s all-electric performance sedan is headed here to take on the Porsche Taycan and Mercedes EQS. Along with subtle cosmetic changes, the e-tron GT gets quite a significant power boost and battery upgrade. The 97kWh battery (up from 84kWh) powers a 680hp dual-motor setup in the entry-level e-tron GT, an 857hp setup in the RS e-tron GT, and 925hp in the range-topping RS e-tron GT Performance. Prices for the e-tron GT are expected to be in the range of Rs 1.90 crore and Rs 2.20 crore (ex-showroom), and the launch is expected in the first quarter of this year. Audi RS Q8 Performance The fastest production SUV around the Nürburgring, the RS Q8 Performance will sit atop the Q8 range in India. Its V8 engine has been tuned to produce 640hp (up 40hp from the RS Q8), and it is 0.2 seconds quicker to 100kph, which it completes in a supercar-baiting 3.6 seconds. Along with sportier design outside and in, the RS Q8 Performance also gets a sportier, more evocative sounding exhaust. It is expected to arrive in the first quarter of this year, with an expected price of around Rs 2.50 crore (ex-showroom). Bentley Continental GT The all-new Continental GT, in Speed guise, eschews the iconic W12 engine for a hybridised V8, which makes 782hp and 1,000Nm of torque. Power is channelled to all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic gearbox. Bentley claims a 0-100kph time of 3.2 seconds, a top speed of 335kph, and an all-electric range of 80km. The exterior is very Batur-inspired and while the interior layout is familiar, there’s more tech on offer. The launch is expected in the second quarter of this year, and prices are likely to be north of 6 crores (ex-showroom). Ferrari 12Cilindri Ferrari’s celebration of 12-cylinder engines in their purest form is the appropriately named 12Cilindri. The 6.5-litre V12 unit from the 812 now makes a staggering 830hp and 678Nm, with the Italian marque claiming a 0-100kph time of 2.9 seconds, and a top speed of over 340kph. The 12Cilindri is undeniably Ferrari’s best GT car, one that can thrill on both road and track while boasting a bold mix of cutting-edge tech and heritage design inspired by the likes of the 1968 Ferrari 365 GTB/4. While its interior is similar to that of the Purosangue, the GT features a 10.25-inch central infotainment touchscreen. Apart from the coupe, Ferrari also revealed the Spider, which gets a roof that can retract in just 14 seconds at speeds of up to 45kph. But whether both will come to India is still unknown. The launch is expected before mid-2025, and it will likely cost around Rs 7.5c crores (ex-showroom). Lamborghini Temerario The Huracán’s successor is powered by an all-new hybrid V8 making a staggering 920hp and 800Nm of torque. The Temerario, which has clear visual links to the Huracán and the Gallardo, sprints from 0-100kph in a claimed 2.7 seconds, and has a top speed in excess of 340kph. The interior also carries the hexagonal motifs seen outside, along with Lambo’s typical fighter jet-themed cockpit. It is, however, only arriving much later in the fourth quarter of 2025 with prices expected to around Rs 5 crores (ex-showroom). Lotus Emira What may be the last ICE sportscar from Lotus, and a purists’ delight, will arrive in India with three powertrain options. The Emira will get an AMG-sourced 360hp four-cylinder turbo-petrol paired to an 8-speed dual-clutch auto, and a Toyota-sourced 400hp supercharged V6 that comes with either a 6-speed manual or an automatic. The launch is expected over the next couple of months, but with prices expected to exceed Rs 3 crores (ex-showroom), it will be quite expensive for what is only an entry-level sportscar. Lotus Emeya Lotus’ first performance sedan since the 1990 Carlton will arrive in India with a 102kWh battery that has up to 600km of range, and powers motors on each axle making a combined 918hp and 984Nm. The Emeya has a Porsche Taycan Turbo S-matching 0-100kph time of 2.8 seconds, and its wow factor outside and inside, and performance and handling makes a compelling case for itself as an addition to a multi-crore garage. The launch is expected around December this year with prices expected to range between Rs 2.25 crore and Rs 3.0 crore (ex-showroom). Maserati GranCabrio The GranTurismo’s drop-top sibling will come with a twin-turbo V6 engine that produces 550hp; all-wheel drive is standard. The heavier GranCabrio is slightly slower to 100kph (the coupe does it in 3.5 seconds), but its folding fabric top can be lowered or raised in 14 seconds, at speeds of up to 50kph. It will be more expensive than its coupe counterpart, likely touching the Rs 3 crores mark (ex-showroom), and the launch is expected by mid-2025. Maserati GranTurismo Folgore The electric counterpart of the Maserati’s GT, called the GranTurismo Folgore, is coming this year with an 83kWh (usable) battery with a claimed range of 450km. It produces 761hp and 1,350Nm of troque, which propels the coupé from 0-100kph in just 2.7 seconds. The GT Folgore also sports a slightly tweaked, EV-specific design. The launch is expected in the second half of 2025 with prices expected to be around Rs 3.5 crores. (ex-showroom). Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 The performance-focused CLE has a mild-hybrid twin-turbo straight-six making 449hp and up to 600Nm. Merc claims a 0-100kph time of 4.4 seconds, which can be lowered to 4.2 seconds with the AMG performance package. Mercedes also sells the CLE 53 AMG convertible in international markets, but it is yet to be ascertained which one is headed to India. As for pricing, we expect the AMG CLE 53 coupe to have a price tag of around Rs 2 crore, and the launch is expected by late-2025. MG Cyberster MG will dial up the cool quotient with the all-electric Cyberster that goes on sale this January at the Bharat Mobility Show. The Cyberster is based on a born-electric platform, and in India, it will be offered with a 77kWh battery pack, paired with two electric motors on each axle, simulating an AWD setup. This powertrain produces 510hp and 725Nm of peak torque, with a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.2 seconds. MG claims a maximum range of 580km on a single charge (CLTC cycle). The convertible all-electric sports car will come to India as an import but pricing will be competitive.

They've been comparing it the coverage of the involvement of a Ford pickup truck in a terror attack in New Orleans, and claiming reasonable differences in how the events were covered are somehow a signifier of anti-Tesla bias. As if often the case with these sorts of things, it's a bunch of bull dung.",
