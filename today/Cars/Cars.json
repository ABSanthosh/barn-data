    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/gordon-murray-reveal-more-focused-t33-s-summer-2025",
    "description": "\"Tougher\" final version of T33 will be followed by a \"completely\" different kind of car, Murray reveals Gordon Murray will reveal the hardcore 'S' version of his T33 V12 supercar in summer 2025, Autocar can reveal, and a \"completely\" different type of car will follow it in the coming years. In an exclusive interview on Autocar's My Week in Cars podcast (listen below), the legendary automotive designer and engineer gave new details of the company's status and upcoming products, confirming that the ultimate version of the GMA T33 will arrive in a matter of months. \"Next summer we'll launch the third and final variant, which will be the 33 S, and that's going to be tougher and more focussed,\" he told hosts Matt Prior and Steve Cropley. He refused to say whether it would be any lighter than the 1072kg standard car, but confirmed it would be quicker, with \"more downforce\" and \"much more focused suspension settings\". Importantly, Murray said, it is \"not a track car\", unlike the hardcore S version of the T50. \"It's a road car but it's more track-oriented\". It will be based around the standard T33's carbon-aluminium monocoque chassis and draw its power from the same Cosworth-designed 3.9-litre V12 - though it's possible the T33 S will boast more than the standard car's 607bhp and could have its rev limit lifted above 11,100rpm. While it will be more road-focused than the 852kg, £3.1m T50S, it is expected to be marked out from the standard car by a prominent aero package that will increase downforce. The standard car produces 150kg at 150mph, according to GMA. The company will build no more than 100 units of any T33, though it's possible the S could be sold in even smaller numbers, in keeping with its ultra- exclusive range-topping status. A price tag north of £2 million is likely.  No specific reveal date has been given, but the T33 and both versions of the T50 made their public debuts at Goodwood, so an unveiling at Festival of Speed in July could be on the cards.   Murray did not offer a timeframe for customer deliveries, but T33 production will begin when all of the T50s have been delivered. \"We're into the 40s now\", he said, leaving just over half of the T50 build run and 25 examples of the T50S to come. All four of GMA's existing cars – T50, T50 S, T33 and T33 Spider – are sold out. The three versions of the T33 – coupé, Spider and S – will take GMA through to 2028, when the company will introduce a completely new model based on a new architecture, which Murray revealed he \"just finished the other day\". \"I don't want to just regurgitate the same stuff all the time, so the next car we do after the final version of T33 S will be a brand new platform again - a brand new motor car.\" He was tight-lipped on what to expect of this new model, but said it is a \"completely\" different style of car - \"but it will be the best of its type, that's what we aim to do\". The most concrete clues Murray would offer as to his new car are that \"it's a car I've always wanted to do\", and will be limited to a production run of 100 units in total, as with the T50 and T33.  \"It could absolutely be the best driver's car in its segment,\" he added, stopping short of revealing what that segment is. \"We've got seven principles and the top one is driving perfection. Whatever we do, the driver comes first ahead of power figures, lap times, 0-60mph, 0-100mph... I honestly don't care.\" Asked where the engine is, Murray jokingly replied: \"It's just down in the bottom of the building.\"  But he did reiterate his commitment to combustion power, saying that GMA's small size relative to rivals means that \"we can hang on to the last minute\" to make decisions on powertrains\", while other companies \"have to start changing over to hybrid or electric much earlier\". \"So we'll be able to hold on to the V12 for a bit longer\", Murray said, adding that the company is currently investigating ways of electrifying the Cosworth engine. But importantly, any hybrid element will always be \"the minimum we need and the least interference to our seven principles, always.\" Murray said the company has signed off its product and platform strategy through to 2038, which \"takes into account the rule changes as they stand at the moment\". \"Of course, that may have to be modified from a timing point of view, but it won't be modified from a product point of view\".",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/our-favourite-cars-2024-mercedes-benz-g-class-electric",
    "description": "What the G-Class EV loses in V8 shoutiness, it makes up for in whimsy To drive the Mercedes-AMG G63 is to make quite the statement.  It costs £180k, puts out 603bhp and makes enough noise to get you kicked out of the cul-de-sac WhatsApp group. It’s an exercise in excess, a wilful dismssal of the concepts of etiquette and good grace. There are those who will decry the G-Class going electric and sacrificing some of that shoutiness, but the truth of the matter is that the new G580 with EQ Technology is the unstoppable 4x4’s most extreme and capable iteration yet. With 579bhp and torque at 859lb ft, it is only marginally less potent than the V8-powered G63. It weighs three tonnes. It will only do around 2.0mpKwh. It is absolutely ludicrous in a number of ways, but it drives supremely, it’s even better off-road than a G63 and it has one thing that the AMG doesn’t: a sense of humour. It can turn on the spot like a tank, for one, and it can brake just the inside wheels in a turn to help you whip round tight hairpins in the most challenging of environments - or the Westfield car park. It works a bit like a really techie handbrake turn. The electric G-Class is also roughly the same price as its shoutier sibling, and it justifies that parity by being less practical but more whimsical.",

This fine specimen was built by KC Kawano over the course of one winter to exacting specifications: his own. He is a man of few words, but his work speaks for itself. He didn’t build the bike to talk about it. He built it to ride it. When we take into account that KC is an old-school hot-rod builder, and we stand that next to the Knucklehead, we can surmise a pretty good idea of the intention: build an American custom that would capture the spirit of the 1950s.…",

    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-road-test-review-433878#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "From “The Perfect SUV” to “Undisputed. Ultimate.” The Creta’s positioning statements might seem pompous, but based on its stellar sales performance, Hyundai has every right to boast. Competitors have come and gone, yet the Creta continues to stand tall with demand growing from strength to strength. A lot has been documented in our reviews and comparisons on the good and not-so-good bits of the Creta 1.5 Petrol IVT. So, in this long-term report, I’ll keep the focus on my Mumbai-Goa-Mumbai drive experience, a round trip of about 1,200km. I started my journey at the break of dawn, and the fastest route suggested by the Creta’s on-board maps was NH66, commonly known as the “old Mumbai-Goa highway”. I had forgotten to carry my phone charger, and because the Creta lacked wireless smartphone integration, I had to rely on its in-built navigation throughout. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with its accuracy and the detailed guidance it provided. I particularly appreciated it when it clearly suggested whether I had to climb onto a flyover or go from below. How did I manage to charge my phone? Well, its wireless charger had me covered.  On-board maps are surprisingly accurate and even get detailed guidance. With light traffic and some newly laid roads, I managed to keep the average speed high. However, the default ‘City’ mode felt a bit inadequate, especially on the winding uphill sections. Sport mode added more pep, with a sharper throttle response and the IVT gearbox keeping the engine spinning in a higher rev band. I must add that the engine doesn’t enjoy being driven hard, as it feels out of its comfort zone and sounds strained, though it does the job asked of it. What I didn’t like was that in Sport, even the steering weight increases, which didn’t add any more feel but only added to the effort required. Also, keeping the transmission in ‘S’ mode wasn’t ideal, as it spun the engine closer to its redline, thus making it sound very boomy. Hence, my ideal setting on a highway drive is to keep the gearbox in ‘D’ and drive mode in ‘Sport’, heavy steering notwithstanding. The SUV’s high-speed stability is good, and handling is predictable, but it rolls a fair bit; hence, sporty it isn’t. And over wavy surfaces, you can experience vertical movements more than in its Volkswagen or Skoda rivals. While the ride quality is generally good at low speeds, it hits sharp potholes in a rather jarring manner. Sharp potholes come through in a rather jarring manner. What’s the fuel efficiency it achieved? With empty roads, Sport mode and an enthusiastic style of driving, the Creta returned a little over 9kpl. On the positive side, I reached Goa in just 9.5 hours, which included an hour’s worth of stops to refuel the car and myself. However, for my return, I left closer to noon – a bad, bad decision. The journey on the NH66 felt starkly different in terms of traffic, and all the diversions I had sailed past on my way to Goa were suddenly clogged and seemed never-ending. As a result, average speeds were much lower. Over the course of this journey, I got a chance to experience some other bits in more detail. For example, the Bose sound system is good, but I think Mahindra’s Sony, MG’s Infinity and Tata’s Harman speakers are noticeably better. Also, its rear speakers are noticeably softer, so the audio experience at the back is quite poor. A sliding armrest is missing in an otherwise well-equipped car. The Creta’s lane assist works in an unobtrusive manner, giving you gentle feedback to stick to the centre of clearly marked lanes. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) works the smoothest when the distance between your vehicle and the one in front is set to maximum. However, once the vehicle ahead slows down and picks up speed, the Creta accelerates automatically to its preset speed very slowly. The auto high beam assist worked like a charm, dipping the high beam upon detecting vehicles ahead. I wish the throw of its LED headlamps (in low beam) was better. Finally, for a car that’s ergonomically spot on, the non-adjustable armrest felt like a glaring oversight on Hyundai’s part. I would have preferred a sliding unit. The journey to Mumbai was nearly 2.5 hours slower, but with a mix of City and Sport drive modes and much lower average speeds (52kph), the Creta’s fuel efficiency was around 12.5kpl.  Powered, ventilated driver’s seat is comfy for long drives. My highway drive reiterates that the Creta petrol IVT isn’t an enthusiast’s choice but is perfect for a majority of buyers who value its refinement, relaxed nature, interior comfort, and the sheer amount of features it packs in. This is reflected in its sales, too. The share of petrol variants in the Creta’s sales is around 60 percent, of which merely 10-15 percentare turbo-petrol (including N Line). And quite honestly, for its sheer well-roundedness, the petrol IVT is the one I’d recommend. Is it “The Perfect SUV”? Well, not quite, but it certainly comes very close.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki India has registered total despatches of 16,25,308 units in January-November 2024, which marks marginal 1 percent year-on-year growth (January-November 2023: 16,02,890 units). The surging demand for the company’s utility vehicles compared to the flagging sales of its passenger cars and sedans is now reflected in its specific model-wise performance at the top. A deep dive into the company’s sales statistics for the first 11 months of CY2024 reveals that the Ertiga MPV, with 1,74,035 units, has outsold the longstanding Maruti Suzuki best-seller, the Wagon R (1,73,552 units), by 483 units. Whether the Ertiga holds onto the lead in December to be the company’s new No. 1 model for a calendar year remains to be seen, albeit given the trend of the last month of the year, it should. Maruti Ertiga sales up 49 percent year on year Maruti Wagon R sales decline 10 percent year on year Maruti’s SUV and MPV sales contribution increases to 40 percent In CY2023, the Wagon R had sold 2,01,301 units, while the Ertiga had sold 1,29,968 units – a difference of 71,333 units, which puts the two models’ performance this year in a different perspective, and representative of the trends in their respective segments. While the Ertiga’s UV segment continues to thrive, the Wagon R’s hatchback market has seen a marked decline. Maruti Ertiga sales: 1,74,035 units, up 49 percent YoY The Ertiga has been on a roll this year. Its wholesales of 1,74,035 units in the first 11 months constitute handsome 49 percent YoY growth (January-November 2023: 1,16,993 units). The MPV’s best sales month in this year to date has been the festival-laden October (18,785 units). Strong and sustained demand, particularly for the CNG variant, means that this model has already sold 44,067 units more than its entire CY2023 sales of 1,29,968 units (when it was UV No. 5), with December sales still to be counted. Between January and November 2024, the Ertiga has outsold the Wagon R in five months – May and from August through to November (see 11-month wholesales data table below). The Ertiga sold 69,956 units in August-November compared to the Wagon R’s 57,693 units. This makes for a sizeable difference of 12,263 units, which has helped the Ertiga bridge the sales gap of the preceding seven months. Maruti Wagon R sales: 1,73,552 units, down 10 percent YoY The Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, which recently completed 25 years in the Indian market and is one of the longest-surviving nameplates, has been India’s bestselling car for the past three fiscal years in a row – FY2022 (1,88,827 units), FY2023 (2,12,340 units / up 12 percent), and FY2024 (2,00,177 units / down 5.73 percent YoY). However, in the January to November 2024 period, sales of the tall-boy hatchback are down 10 percent compared to last year’s 1,92,723 units in the same duration. The decline in the Wagon R’s sales can also be attributed to strong consumer shift from passenger cars towards SUVs and MPVs. This is amply reflected in Maruti Suzuki’s segment-wise sales performance for the first 11 months of CY2024. Maruti SUVs, MPV share increases by 8 percent to 40 percent As the segment-wise split of Maruti Suzuki India’s total passenger vehicle sales (11-month data table below) shows, UV sales have helped buffer the sharp decline in the company’s hatchback and sedan sales. Combined sales of hatchbacks (Alto, S-Presso, Baleno, Swift, Wagon R, Celerio, Ignis) and sedans (Dzire and Ciaz) at 843,261 units are down 12 percent YoY (January-November 2023: 956,326 units). This has also impacted their share of total PV sales – currently at 52 percent from the 60 percent they had in the first 11 months of CY2023. And the Wagon R is part of that story. Meanwhile, in sharp contrast and in line with the overall industry trend, demand for Maruti Suzuki’s UV model range has grown stronger with every passing year. Between January and November 2024, a total of 6,55,020 UVs were dispatched to dealers across India, making for robust 26 percent YoY growth (January-November 2023: 5,20,588 units). This performance has seen the UV share of Maruti Suzuki’s overall PV sales jump to 40 percent from 32 percent a year ago – making up the same 8 percent decline in car sales. Maruti model-wise sales in January-November 2024 Of the 6,55,020 UVs sold in the January-November 2024 period, four models with six-figure sales stand out. The Ertiga leads with 1,74,035 units, just 3,212 units ahead of the Brezza (1,70,823 units), and Fronx (1,45,484 units) compact SUVs, and the Grand Vitara (1,15,564 units). The fifth model in Maruti Suzuki’s UV pecking order is the XL6 MPV (38,199 units), followed by the Jimny (7,634 units) and the premium Invicto MPV (3,191 units). Meanwhile, the Wagon R (1,73,552 units) leads the rest of the 10-model Maruti Suzuki portfolio. At No. 2 is the premium Baleno (1,62,982 units) just 595 units ahead of sibling Swift. The Dzire sedan (1,51,415 units) is the No. 4 passenger car model, followed by the Eeco van (1,27,027 units). The Alto (98,512 units), Celerio (35,299 units), S-Presso (26,172 units), Ignis (26,111 units) and the Ciaz (6,831 units) make up the rest.

    "description": "The Kia Sonet facelift has crossed the 1,00,000 sales milestone in 11 months since its launch in January, and variants with a sunroof accounted for 79 percent of it, the South Korean car brand noted. Eighteen variants (petrol and diesel combined) of the Sonet come equipped with a single-pane sunroof, excluding the entry-level HTE and HTK trims.  Diesel variants make up for about 24 percent of total Sonet sales About 66 percent of the demand for the Sonet is for manual versions While Sonet’s line-up starts at Rs 7.99 lakh (ex-showroom, India), prices for its sunroof models range between Rs 8.31 (HTE (O)) and 14.91 lakh (X-Line). Notably, the compact SUV was also featured among the 10 bestselling UVs of 2024. Kia further stated that 76 percent of Sonet sales came from variants with petrol engines – 1.0-litre turbo and 1.2-litre naturally aspirated. “The 1.2-litre petrol engine brings the most buyers for the Sonet,” Kia India MD and CEO Gwanggu Lee told Autocar India during an interview earlier. The rest came from the 1.5-litre diesel motor, which also powers the larger Kia Seltos and, most recently, the Syros. As for the transmission, automatic (including iMT) variants make up about 34 percent of the sales, and the remaining demand is for manual versions. From March 2021 to August 2025, the compact SUV had a 37 percent share in Kia’s overall sales, second only to the Seltos’ 48 percent share. The pre-facelift Sonet also crossed the 1,00,000 sales figure within a year of its debut. The sales goal of 1,50,000 units was achieved in 2022, followed by 2,50,000 units in 2023. The run from 2,50,000 to 3,50,000 units took about 15 months. The Sonet rivals the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO and Hyundai Venue.
