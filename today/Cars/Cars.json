    "description": "This 1994 Porsche 911 Speedster is one of 936 examples produced between 1992 and 1994, just 427 of which were built for the US market. The car was sold new to seven-time National League MVP winner and Major League Baseball home-run record holder Barry Bonds, for whom it was converted into a steel-bodied Mega Speedster by tuner Vittorio Strosek. It was purchased by the current owner in 2021 and subsequently sent to Germany, where it was modified by the seller, Evomax, with carbon-Kevlar bodywork and a custom white leather interior. Finished in Meissen Blue, the car is powered by an M64 flat-six that was reportedly built to a displacement of 3.8 liters by Andial at the time of the Strosek build. Additional features include a six-speed manual transaxle, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with Big Red calipers, adjustable KW coilover suspension, staggered-width 18” multipiece wheels, an HJS exhaust system, a cream-color convertible top, Porsche 918 carbon-fiber seats, air conditioning, power windows, and a Bluetooth sound system. This Evomax Speedster was brought back to the US in 2024 and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in San Clemente, California with documentation from previous ownership, owner’s manuals, early-2000s calendars featuring the car, and a clean California title.",

    "description": "Despite what gear manufacturers will have you believe, no one motorcycle jacket will perform well in every possible scenario. But some jackets can play a handful of roles well, offering enough versatility to earn a spot in your gear closet. The Icon Slabtown is one such piece. Named after the district in Portland, Oregon, USA where Icon Motosports is based, the Slabtown jacket is pitched as a three-season street riding jacket. It’s not waterproof, nor is it designed for extremely hot days. But for anything from chilly to warm weather, it works a treat. Aesthetically, the Slabtown is all business, featuring a slightly subdued take on the urban brawler styling that Icon is famous for. It’s cut with Icon’s ‘sport’ fit, which means it’s boxy rather than tailored, with generous hook-and-loop waist adjusters and pre-curved sleeves.…",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/1996-yamaha-trx850",
    "description": "Back in the 90s, Yamaha broke from their tradition of building Deltabox-framed sportbikes to create the TRX850. Sporting a trellis frame and the parallel-twin mill from the TDM850, the Yamaha TRX850 was made to entice sportbike riders away from the Ducati 900SS. So its design was an oddball, yet charming, mash-up of East and West—and although it wasn’t a huge seller, it was, by all accounts, a very capable machine. London-based fabricator Seb Hipperson has been wringing the neck of this 1996-model Yamaha TRX850 for fifteen years, and has finally given it a long overdue makeover. Seb mostly works on furniture, but he’s also a motorcycle enthusiast and racer—so he makes time to wrench on bikes whenever he can. It was the TRX850’s trellis frame that originally attracted Seb to it—that, and the fact that it was something of an obscure donor bike for a build, compared to the more popular Ducati SuperSport.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/gwms-flat-eight-motorbike-proves-chinese-car-makers-can-have-fun",
    "description": "Flat eight reportedly makes around 150bhp and 140lb ft Firm behind the Funky Cat also builds a 2.0-litre flat-eight couch on wheels It has come to my attention that the people behind the Funky Cat (Great Wall Motor, who later renamed the Ora EV something much more prosaic) have made something actually funky. This column item is ultimately going to be about cars, so I beg the patience of any reader who will write in when they see mention of a motorcycle on these pages, but I should tell you about the Souo S2000. It’s the debut motorbike from a new arm of GWM, a grand tourer in the vein of the Honda Gold Wing – a motorcycle that even non-motorcyclists will surely know about. But the S2000 is bigger and bolder even than the Gold Wing. It’s a huge, 400kg-plus, comfortable-looking cruiser, and I bring it up here because it’s powered by nothing less than a 2.0-litre flat eight-cylinder engine, reportedly making around 150bhp and 140lb ft of torque. That got my attention, as it might yours. I thought it significant for two reasons. One is that we’re becoming very accustomed to the Chinese bringing us electrified products. The cars no longer come as any surprise; some are pretty dull inside and out, sure, but others, notably those with traditional European badges, can be (a little more) interesting. There’s a school of thought that Chinese companies invest in brands with European design and engineering facilities because they need them to impart the character and soul their own products would otherwise lack; that their cars are well built and good value but that they’re not creative. Even their most interesting sports cars or off-roaders have to rely on bouncing on the spot or spinning in tiny circles, because the design is so unspectacular. If you have a longer memory, does that sound at all familiar? I think mid-late last century, the same argument was put out about Japanese cars: coming over here, putting the boot into local products by being good value but otherwise being extremely dull. Little more than white goods on wheels. I’m just about old enough to remember the derogatory phrase ‘Jap crap’, which I’d have heard said about Japanese cars when I was a kid in the 1980s. It took us a long while to appreciate the fact that Japanese products weren’t so boring after all. With only four television channels, print media and no internet, it’s not like there was swift and easy exposure to the people behind the Datsuns and Hondas of the day and the cultures that produced their cars. And then they made the Datsun Z cars, the Toyota Supra, the Honda NSX and more: cars with as much soul as anything from here. And from then to now, we’ve gone from being scared of the Japanese and their imports to thinking that they’re a pretty fun bunch. Their cars are cult classics. I wonder how long it will take us this time. We know that the Chinese can make boring electroboxes, that Geely factories have signs on the wall above urinals that read “Even a small mistake is not allowed in 2024!” and that we don’t much like the politics. But hang about: here comes a Chinese motorbike with a 2.0-litre horizontally opposed eight-cylinder engine. So, perhaps it turns out they can make machines with soul and a sense of humour after all. What an impish thought More on the car front from that GWM engine. Swapping the inline four-cylinder engine from a BMW K1200 motorcycle into a Hillman Imp like mine is a relatively common conversion. I’ve been tempted but dithered for a number of reasons. I know of one Imp that has had a flat six-cylinder Gold Wing engine conversion – more interesting but a more complex task (I don’t think you can buy a kit). But imagine instead a 2.0-litre flat eight back there. Now, would one fit without modifying the chassis and necessitating a Q numberplate? I doubt it. Would it blow the Imp’s gearbox? Undoubtedly. Am I going to do this? Absolutely not. But still, what a thought.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/tired-or-wired-uk-road-trip-260000-mile-tesla-model-s",
    "description": "We plotted a route from the Supercharger in Exeter to another at Westfield shopping centre in London Landmark EV is now a decade old – yet it still has what it takes to rival the latest and greatest \"The Model S is, quite simply, a landmark moment in our lives.” Our tester’s words, printed in these very pages back in 2013, when we put an early, left-hand-drive Tesla Model S up against the Porsche Panamera and Aston Martin Rapide – and crowned the Tesla the winner. Sales of the Tesla Model S actually began in the UK a few months later, in 2014. This, of course, was the real start for the American brand. Sure, the dainty little Tesla Roadster whirred off the production line at Hethel and into a five-star Autocar road test verdict in February 2009. But when the Model S arrived in 2014, that was the game-changer. The Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe and BMW i3 had been chipping away at electrification for the mainstream market, but in a world where every other EV did something like 90 miles and charged at less than half the speed? Well, the Model S with its 300-mile range and charging speeds of over 100kW was the iPhone to everybody else’s Nokia 3310. But how about now? A decade on, how does the Model S stack up? What better way to find out than with a road trip in this mighty, streamlined hunk of metallic beige. Meet our Tesla Model S 90D. I gaze at it, coffee in hand, dawdling back past Exeter’s banks of 32 Tesla Supercharger points. This is one of the newest Tesla Supercharger hubs, not to mention one of the biggest; the most modern of henges, gleaming in the morning sunlight. Our road trip starts here, and I’ve broken all electric car etiquette by allowing our nine-year-old Model S to charge its battery to 100%, because I want to find out what real-world range you can get from a hard-used Model S. And it really is hard used. This car has been owned by Tesla from the off and used by its engineers to travel between Supercharger sites, racking up nearly 260,000 miles on the original lithium ion nickel-manganese-cobalt battery, not to mention a few scuffs, scrapes and bumps around the bodywork’s extremities. The destination for our trip is one of Tesla’s original UK sites: the Westfield shopping centre in west London. Here, the company opened its first dealership at the end of 2013. One of the early Supercharger locations also lurks in the car park beneath the bright lights and perfume. Back to Exeter, and this being a new Supercharger site, our old Model S needs a converter to be able to charge from the CCS cables. It’s all straightforward, though, and in under 60 minutes I manage a full charge from the 44% that I arrived with. Now, we all know that electric car batteries degrade over time and mileage, and this one is no exception. This nine-year-old car now has 84% of its original 85kWh usable capacity, but the 230 miles showing on the ‘guess-ometer’ at 100% charged suggests that it’s still got a very usable real-world range. Rolling out of the Supercharger hub, I head east, towards the A303. The car is confident that it can reach Westfield, telling me that it will cover the 178 miles and still have more than 20% battery remaining. It is yet another of Tesla’s miracles that it mastered the art of over-the-air software updates from the off, so this car has the same software that you will find in any modern Tesla. It also feels pretty solid around the cabin, and smells like an airport taxi. Which isn’t unpleasant but does make you wonder what precisely it is that makes modern high-mileage cars smell of the same, gentle musk. The journey starts easily. I keep the 90D in ‘Chill’ mode, rather than Standard, as I don’t feel the need for any 4.0sec 0-62mph sprints anyway. Other than that, I’ve got the air-con and the radio on, and regen in the lighter mode that I favour. This isn’t an economy run and I want to know what a Model S will do on a single charge if you drive it in a completely normal fashion with the comforts that we all expect. Predictably, the miles tick past smoothly, the light bouncing off the super-shiny steering wheel and the Tesla just doing its thing. It doesn’t take long before, on clear roads, the estimated range starts to drop more quickly than the real miles. At one point, it falls to 11% predicted charge remaining at our destination, before it creeps back up towards 20%. Inevitably, the free-flowing traffic along the hilly stretches of the Devonian A303 was chiefly responsible for the drop in efficiency, but I’m still happy to sit back and enjoy the far-reaching views to the left and glimpses of the sea to the right. Still happy to trust that the Tesla will make it. Before you know it, it’s everyone’s favourite traffic jam: Stonehenge. A convenient halfway point on our route, this Neolithic hotspot is one of the UK’s most visited tourist attractions, as you’ll have been able to tell if you’ve ever tried to drive past it. At this point, the Tesla’s range is getting a bit on the teeth-sucking side of things, not least because we have also taken a few detours to do some photography and added roughly 10 miles to our route. As such, our total distance is going to be just over 190 miles. So I’m beginning to do electric car range maths – a complex branch of maths closely related to that executed at the end of a restaurant meal for many people, when the bill is being split. In the end, the car is still confident that it will make it – sometimes with only 5% battery remaining, sometimes with over 10% – so I trust it and go with it. It’s worth saying that there are plenty of rapid chargers, Superchargers included, on this route. I don’t need to play range roulette at all but, on this occasion, I’m keen to stretch the car and see what it will do. Onwards, then, and the M3 motorway flashes past, as do the rapid chargers at Fleet and those on the roadside, as London proper starts to crowd us. It occurs to me, as we creep towards Shepherd’s Bush, that a Parisian-spec Model S is the ultimate London car. It’s already lightly scuffed and kerbed, so you’re not precious about it. Yet it’s still got way more kudos than the overly common Tesla Model 3, not to mention its crushing traffic-light performance, a cushy ride, ULEZ exemption… I’d even live with the fact that the frameless driver’s window doesn’t always go back up after you’ve closed the door, so you have to get in from the passenger side and raise it yourself. There’s also no keyless entry, which feels weird for a car that has flush door handles and a proximity sensor so that they pop out as you approach them, yet you have to double-press the top of the key, which all feels a bit PC computer interface circa the early 2000s. Our car’s efficiency as we creep through town is unsurprisingly impressive and the predicted range has simply stopped ticking down and has even started to rise. There’s no question that we’ll make our destination with energy to spare and we eventually execute the Shepherd’s Bush gauntlet without issue and dive into Westfield’s underground car park. Sure enough, the car was right to be confident. We pull up in the slightly sinister red glow of the Tesla signs that gives this bank of chargers the feel of a seedy members-only club. Which isn’t entirely untrue, given that this Supercharger hub is Tesla-only – as opposed to the 76 Supercharger hubs that are now open to any electric car. The figures? We have used 58kWh of energy en route over 192 miles. That is average efficiency of just over 3.3mpkWh, at a cost of 20p per mile on Tesla’s Supercharger rate of 67p per kWh. We still have 29 miles of range showing and 11% of battery remaining. Let’s call it a real-world range of 200 miles in summer before you’re going to want to find a charger pretty sharpish. I’d expect winter running would reduce that to around 160-170 miles, which is not bad at all for a car of this kind of mileage that has been rapid-charged often. It just goes to prove the longevity of these Tesla’s batteries. So, in hindsight, was the Tesla Model S a landmark moment? Absolutely. And then some. After all, if you were asked to name a car brand that’s changed the world – never mind the car market – in the past decade, which would you choose? Well, exactly. Happy birthday, Tesla. What a decade it’s been.",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "First things first. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback you see here is not an all-electric replacement for the ICE A6 we’re all familiar with. In fact, the two models have little in common. You see, under Audi’s new naming system, electric vehicles will have even numbers in the name with ‘e-tron’ as a suffix (Q4 e-tron, Q6 e-tron, Q8 e-tron) while ICE models will run odd numbers. The next-gen A6 will become the ‘A7’, the A4 has already given way to a new ‘A5’, and so on. This A6 e-tron is the second Audi model after the Q6 e-tron to be built on the PPE or Premium Platform Electric co-developed with Porsche. Advancements in the motors, battery and architecture promise enhanced efficiency, faster charging and superior performance. The A6 e-tron has been unveiled in Avant or estate form – that’s sadly not headed here – and this Sportback body style coming to India in 2025. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback design The A6 e-tron looks substantial because it is. It’s about the same size as the A6 petrol we are familiar with, but there’s more mass to the design, something most noticeable at the sides. A black applique low down on the doors, there to also indicate the position of the battery, helps break the bulk. The fastback tail gives the A6 e-tron Sportback its eye-catching shape and to me, it looks best from the rear three-quarter angle. There’s a lovely flow from roof to high-deck boot and the full-width lighting is really slick. A glowing rear logo is a first for an Audi and the digital OLED tail-lamps almost have a language of their own – eight selectable patterns and the ability to display warning graphics to communicate hazards to vehicles behind. With split headlamps, a semi-concealed grille, and a black ‘mask’ on the bumper to hide the air dams and ADAS hardware, frontal styling is a dramatic departure from the Audi template. The LED DRLs positioned up top get eight selectable patterns and this is a cool touch. A fact of note is that the A6 e-tron Sportback is the most aerodynamic Audi ever, and this bodes well for range. But, and this is just me, I’m not a fan of this newfangled organic styling. I like my Audis angular. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback interior and features Inside, you’ll see the latest from Audi and that’s a good thing. The basic layout is similar to what we’ve seen on the Q6 e-tron, which means it’s a cutting-edge interior and also a screen-rich one. There’s a curved display that comprises 11.9-inch digital dials and a 14.5-inch centre touchscreen, aside from which is an optional 10.9-inch passenger screen. And that’s not all. Versions with Virtual Mirrors (camera pods that replace the wing mirrors) also add screens near the A-pillars. And lest I forget, there’s also a head-up display with augmented reality! The latest-gen digital dials are a huge upgrade from Audi’s Virtual Cockpit instruments we’ve seen for nearly a decade. It’s got crisp graphics, nice colours, and plenty of info, though what’s missed is the option to go in-depth into EV stats. I did find myself relying more on the head-up display while driving, though. There’s superb detail and the augmented reality indications for ADAS and navigation that overlay warnings and symbols onto the driving environment are fantastic. Interior is premium and trio of screens give it a techy look. The centre touchscreen is, again, slick and responsive but the menus can feel intimidating at first glance. Shortcuts and widgets do help personalise the screen for ease of use, but packing in climate control settings on the screen is not ideal. The passenger screen is a good way to keep your front passenger entertained while you’re doing the hard work of driving a very nice and very soothing electric car. What’s nice is that the screen is not visible from the driver’s point of view on the go. Along with the closely related Q6 e-tron, the A6 e-tron marks a return to form for Audi in terms of quality. Everything you see and touch feels really high-end. The gloss look to the screens looks rich and goes well with the piano black on the centre console. Also really nicely done are the touch-sensitive controls on the steering that are better executed than what we’ve seen on the latest lot of Mercedes cars. There’s a capacitive touch panel on the door, too, for the lights. Augmented reality overlay on HUD is brilliant. Front seat comfort is good, helped in part by the option for ventilation, heating and massage. A leather-free interior is optional and I have to say the fabric upholstery on the seats and dashboard is tastefully done. Of the other elements, there’s ambient lighting that subtly adds some colour to the cabin and flashes warnings such as for safe exits. The A6 is also available with the option of a full-glass roof that can go from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button. There’s also the option of an 830-watt Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system. Four of the 20 speakers are integrated into the front headrest for a more personalised sound right near your ears. Soft-close doors are part of the package, too. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback rear seat and luggage capacity The rear seat experience isn’t quite as nice as the one up front. Kneeroom is decent but not exceptional for what is a large car with a long wheelbase, and headroom is just adequate for tall passengers. The backrest recline could be more relaxed, too, but the biggest spoiler is the knees-up seating position which is a recurring complaint on electric cars that position their battery pack under the floor. Oddly enough, Audi mitigated the problem on the e-tron GT with clever ‘foot garages’ or cutouts in the battery. The A6 e-tron uses a fully flat battery pack. Kneeroom is good but knees-up seating position is a spoiler. Luggage capacity seems a lot larger than the 502 litres mentioned on the spec page. And should the need arise, you can fold down the rear seats to free up up to 1,330 litres of room. There’s no provision for a spare tyre, at least in this European-spec model. The tailgate is powered, and handily, Audi has added a light guide for the gesture control so you know precisely where to ‘kick’ to activate the opening or closing function. There’s a small 27-litre frunk, and uniquely, it can also be opened with a swipe on the bonnet. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback battery, motor and range On to the heart of the matter. The Audi A6 e-tron Sportback uses a lithium-ion battery pack with a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry. Battery options include 83kWh and 100kWh capacities. The larger of the two is available with rear motor as well as dual-motor, all-wheel-drive layouts. The version most likely headed to India is the Audi A6 e-tron Sportback Performance that uses a 100kWh battery that powers a single rear permanent magnet synchronous motor. Power is rated at 367hp with up to 380hp on call with launch control. Peak torque is 565Nm. The headline number for this version, however, is range – 756 kilometres on the WLTP cycle. What’s more, the 800V architecture allows DC charging at up to 270kW, which means a 10-80 percent charge in just 21 minutes. We are still some time away before 270KW chargers become commonplace in India, so the standard 11kW AC charging and optional 22kW AC charging capabilities are of greater relevance. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback performance and handling A drive around the breathtakingly gorgeous island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands gave an indication of what to expect. The Performance version might be the long-range variant of the A6 e-tron, well, range, but it’s no slow coach. 0-100kph takes 5.4 seconds and the top speed is capped at 210kph. Of course, this being an EV, it’s fast, it’s responsive, and overtaking doesn’t require much thinking. But what’s different about the A6 is that it’s not one of those EVs that slams you back onto your seat. Its build of power is nice and gradual and the general feeling is of an easygoing and chilled-out car that wants to do luxury better than all other things. The general feeling is of an easy-going and chilled-out car that wants to do luxury well. You feel as much when toggling between the drive modes, too. There are Comfort, Efficiency, Dynamic and Balanced modes, and each impacts the throttle responses, steering and damping. Even in the sportiest of the driving modes, the A6 still feels very relaxed and gentle around the curves. Sure, there is nicer weight around the steering and the suspension does firm up, but if you want an agile sporty car, you should probably be looking at the RS e-tron GT in Audi’s line-up. Don’t get me wrong, because the A6 drives with confidence and is fun to drive when you’re in the mood. It’s just that it masks its speed eerily well. Refinement is spectacular and there’s only a bit of wind noise from the wing mirrors at speeds upwards of 100kph. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback ride comfort and braking Quick as the A6 is, it’s just as happy to slow down. The A6 e-tron packs in regen braking and you can control the levels of regen using the paddle shifters. There’s also a ‘B’ mode which brings in one-pedal driving. It feels very natural and was my go-to setting for the drive on the hills of Tenerife. The interesting thing is that Audi’s system marries the motor braking with the actual friction brakes, so they work together to give a stronger effect of regen braking. What’s really nice is that you can’t sense that handover from regen braking to friction braking or when they’re working together. The regen braking supplements the slippery shape, energy-dense battery and high-efficiency motor to deliver fantastic range. Refinement is spectacular and allows the A6 e-tron to mask high speeds eerily well. The A6 e-tron Sportback is really good on ride comfort, too. Steel springs are standard but higher-spec versions like our test car get air suspension. Unfortunately (or fortunately) there weren’t any India-spec potholes to test on our drive route in Tenerife. Even so, the 21-inch tyres dismissed any uneven surfaces with the air suspension doing a great job of keeping body movements in check. Ride height lowers by 20mm in efficiency mode for best aero but owners in India will probably use the lift mode more than any other suspension function. Audi A6 e-tron Sportback price and verdict The Audi A6 e-tron will follow the Q6 e-tron electric SUV and will likely launch in India in the second half of 2025. The A6 e-tron Sportback has an eye-catching shape and is high-tech inside, though it’s a vehicle to buy for the front seat experience rather than the one at the back. Refinement and range are highlights and even the middle-rung Performance version gets you all the power that you can really use. We expect prices to be in the region of Rs 1 crore, ex-showroom, which will be competitive for this size and class of electric car. The A6 e-tron Sportback represents the shape of things to come from Audi, and it sure does impress.

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",

    "description": "Indu Chandhok, the doyen of Indian motorsports with which he was accociated for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 93. Indu Chandhok was born in Kolkata on July 22, 1931, and then moved to Chennai in 1932. He was one of the founder-members of the Madras Motor Sports Club in 1953. He also helped found the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI) in 1971, of which he was the president (1978-79). He was also an integral part of the Trust that purchased and developed the Madras International Circuit (erstwhile Madras Motor Race Track) at Irungattkottai, and about 40km from Chennai. His involvement with Indian motorsports for the last 60 years – first as a competitor and later an organiser – earned him the sobriquet of \"Godfather of Motor Sports in India\". Off the racetrack, he was involved with the Punjab Association Trust of which he was the chairman; the DAV School; Camp Tonakela; the Madras Round Table which he founded; the Masonic Lodge; and he was president of Indian Motor Parts Dealers Association, and involved with the 41 Clubs of India, an association of ex-Round Tablers whose international President he became. His son Vicky Chandhok, is a former National Rally Champion and is the current MMSC vice president. His grandson Karun Chandhok, is India’s second Formula One driver (after Narain Karthikeyan), and is now a well-known F1 race commentator and analyst. Regarding the passing, Madras Motor Sports Club (MMSC) president Ajit Thomas, said, \"In Indu Chandhok’s demise, the MMSC and Indian motorsports have lost a giant and an institutional figure. He was instrumental in providing definitive direction to motorsports in India and we are now enjoying the fruits of his untiring efforts. He also shaped MMSC to what it is today. We deeply mourn his passing away and offer condolences to his family.\" Indu Chandhok’s son and MMSC vice president Vicky Chandhok, said, \"The Patriarch of the Chandhok family, passed away in his sleep this morning. Total legend he was. 'BIC' lived his life filled with a great sense of humour until the end. He was a fantastic father and protector. In a way, he was also the patriarch of Indian motorsports who saw the big picture with a clear vision for the growth of the sport. The family and the motorsports fraternity will miss him.\" Former FMSCI president Shramik Masturlal, said, \"Indu was an institution in himself. His co-founding of the FMSCI, his huge efforts in making Sholavaram races what it became, the creation of the new track from scratch, the birth of the MMST etc, all bore the stamp of Indu’s efforts in furthering motor sports to unimaginable levels. Indu leaves gigantic footprints. An era has passed!\" Also see: Tested Like Samsonite with Karun Chandhok Mercedes engine deal hints at plans to sell Alpine F1 team: Karun Chandhok",

    "description": "Mahindra has announced that its recently revealed BE 6e electric SUV, which is priced from Rs 18.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India), will be renamed to BE 6. However, the SUV specialist will contest the right to use the BE 6e name, in court. BE 6e trademark registered in a different class from IndiGo's Mahindra says trademark is for BE 6e, not 6e  Mahindra finds IndiGo's objection to be inconsistent with previous conduct Despite saying that the born-electric SUV, which will rival the Tata Curvv EV and upcoming Hyundai Creta EV, will be renamed to Mahindra BE 6 for now, the company has cited several reasons why it will contest the rights in court. The company has stated that the BE 6e trademark has already been registered under the Class 12 section, which is different from the section where InterGlobe Aviation Limited (which runs IndiGo Airlines) has registered the 6e name. In addition, Mahindra's trademark is for \"BE 6e\", not the standalone \"6E\". Futher, Mahindra also states that they find InterGlobe's objection to be inconsistent with its previous conduct. The SUV-maker pointed out that back in 2005, Tata Motors had objected to the airline company's use of the IndiGo nameplate, as the carmaker had its Indigo sedan on sale at the time. At least until the dispute between Mahindra and InterGlobe is resolved, the all-new electric SUV will go on sale under the BE 6 nameplate. The first of Mahindra's born-EVs comes with 59kWh and 79kWh battery pack options, with MIDC ranges of 556km and 682km. Deliveries will commence towards the end of February or early March 2025, though the full price list is expected to be revealed in January.
