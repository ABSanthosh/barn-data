    "description": "This Maserati 450S re-creation was constructed by the seller’s company in Madrid, Spain, between 2023 and 2024 and features a steel oval-tube spaceframe wrapped in hand-formed aluminum bodywork. Following its completion, the car was displayed at Retromobile Paris in 2025 before undergoing a color change from blue to red. Power is provided by a Maserati Tipo 107 V8 that was overhauled to a displacement of 4.6 liters with components reportedly including lightened cylinder heads, forged pistons, and modified camshaft profiles. The car is also equipped with quadruple Weber carburetors, a five-speed manual transmission, disc brakes disguised as finned hydraulic drums, four-wheel independent suspension, silver-painted wire wheels, dual side-pipe exhaust, a riveted aluminum fuel tank, bucket seats upholstered in black, and Jaeger instruments. This 450S re-creation is now offered in Madrid, Spain, with photos and invoices from its construction and Spanish registration identifying it as a 1966 Maserati 4200 GT.",

    "description": "In the ADV world, the GS moniker carries some serious baggage – but the good kind. A brand that’s instantly recognisable, even in the remotest of trails. But what if you want that GS clout without lugging around upwards of 250kg of flagship girth off-road? That’s where the F 900 GS rolls in. It costs Rs 1.25 lakh more than its predecessor and is now lighter, livelier, and loaded, but there’s also a bit of a catch. BMW F 900 GS design and quality (8/10) The F 900 is now more compact and lighter than its predecessor The F 850 GS looked like a skinnier F 850 GSA. The F 900 GS, however, comes across with a rally-raid aesthetic that looks even narrower and more focused. BMW has redesigned the fuel tank with plastic panels, resulting in a slimmer midsection. The entire silhouette looks leaner, and the motorcycle is now 14kg lighter than before. It appears someone has already kicked the indicator/brake light The bike is currently offered in two variants: Style Passion and Style GS Trophy. The Style Passion variant, which is the one tested here, features 20mm less suspension travel, a more accessible 835mm seat height, plastic handguards, a clear visor and misses out on a bash plate. For an additional Rs 25,000, you can opt for the Style GS Trophy variant, which offers 20mm more suspension travel, a taller 870mm seatheight, rugged metal handguards, a black tinted visor, and a slightly thicker, more comfortable seat. High quality and tactile switchgear make navigating the user interface a breeze While this motorcycle is specced out nicely, it misses out on the Enduro Pro Package available internationally. That would have included a 45mm fully adjustable Showa fork, a black handlebar with aluminium forged risers (20mm taller), and other enhancements that would’ve raised its off-road credentials. The new rally raid aesthetic looks more focused the F 850 GS Everything you see here is standard, except for the engine guard (Rs 40,000 extra). While the overall design is purposeful, the São Paulo Yellow paint may divide opinion. The headlight (same as the G 310 GS) could’ve been brighter, and the brake-light setup, which is integrated into the indicators, also looks like it could be a fall or an accidental snag away from a trip to the service centre. BMW F 900 GS position and comfort (7/10) Overall riding position is better suited for off-road riding The lower seat height of the Style Passion variant will help shorter riders, but this is still a tall bike. While the reach to the handlebar feels slightly stretched while seated, that same reach works well when you’re standing on the pegs. Seat padding and comfort could have been better The tank is now narrower, the seat more rally-style, and the overall ergonomics are off-road-biased. While standing on the pegs feels natural and confident, long-distance comfort is compromised. Another thing worth mentioning is that while the seat height is lower, the seat padding is also thinner, which eventually results in saddle soreness. It isn’t very pillion-friendly either. The advantage of this firm seat is that standing up from it feels a lot easier, but it will come at the cost of long-distance comfort. If height isn’t a concern, pay the extra money and get the GS Trophy variant instead Range is another limitation. The new tank holds 14.5 litres – half a litre less than before. Compared to the F 900 GS Adventure’s 23-litre tank, the standard F 900 GS will likely cover under 300km on a full tank. The lack of grab rails and mounting points also hurt its touring credentials. BMW does offer panniers and luggage racks, but these are optional extras that could set you back over a lakh. BMW F 900 GS performance and refinement (9/10) It has more performance and better refinement than the model it replaces Under the skin, BMW has worked on the old 853cc motor, bumping displacement to 895cc. It now makes 10hp and 1Nm more than before. Fire it up, and the engine has a bit more character, thanks in part to the standard Akrapovič can. Akrapovic exhaust looks great but not much louder than stock On the move, the bike feels livelier across the rev range. The broader torque spread allows for easy chugging in higher gears and confident overtakes. There’s no explosive top end, but the mid-range is very strong, perfect for trails and highway cruising. The F900 GS's motor is pretty refined at triple digit cruising speeds Despite its upright stance, the F 900 GS is deceptively quick and will get into high triple-digit territory with ease. Above 160kph, the blocky Metzeler Karoo 4 tyres become the limiting factor. City commutes don’t reveal much heat despite the season, and it shouldn’t be a problem in traffic. Punchy motor and well calibrated electronics ensure controlled slides Hit the dirt, and power delivery is strong but predictable, with plenty of bottom-end grunt to crawl up rocky climbs or make any overtakes on highways. The off-road traction control system also works well, enabling plenty of slide, but not too much. The six-speed gearbox is slick, but the bi-directional quickshifter requires a firmer foot, especially with standard road boots. It improves with off-road boots but lacks the smoothness of some rivals. BMW F 900 GS ride comfort and handling (8/10) It handles like a proper GS, with less bulk to manage There has been a complete overhaul in terms of the chassis, and the reduced weight, revised steering geometry, and shorter rear subframe make it feel more agile than the 850 GS. It still retains that familiar, planted GS feel, but now with more willingness to play. Despite the knobby tyres the F 900 GS handles rather well At 226kg, it’s not light by enduro standards, but its weight is so well-balanced that it never feels intimidating. The suspension has a soft baseline tune but can feel firm over sharp bumps. Meanwhile, there’s not much you can do about the front on the Style variant as rebound and preload adjustability can only be tweaked at the rear. The F900 GS feels right at home off-road The GS Trophy variant gets an additional 20mm of travel and would be a better pick for serious trail work. Even in this spec, though, the F 900 GS manages light to moderate trails quite well, and it’s predictable and easy to handle on loose surfaces. While there is a lack of feedback, the F 900 GS is quite eager to fall into corners Enduro Pro mode is the only fully customisable mode, and, even with traction control on, it rarely cuts in unnecessarily. ABS, however, cannot be fully switched off at the front, and there were a few instances of it intervening unexpectedly. Early signs of wear are a bit concerning On the road, the bike feels surprisingly light and easy to filter through traffic. Around corners, the chassis feels composed, but the Karoo 4s start to show their dual-purpose nature. These tyres work well off-road but wear quickly, with significant wear already visible with less than 3,000km on the odo. BMW F 900 GS features and safety (8/10) The F900 GS has a whole host of electronic aids that can be fine tuned to suit your style It features a crisp and clear 6.5-inch TFT with an easy to read and use layout. Additionally, this TFF supports Bluetooth connectivity and other app based features. As standard, the F 900 GS gets four riding modes (Rain, Road, Enduro and Enduro Pro). The best TFT in its class with an excellent layout While the other modes cannot be tweaked, the Enduro Pro mode is the only one that allows you to fine tune its parameters. Additionally, this model also gets heated grips for India which should be handy in colder parts of our country. The F 900 GS also gets adjustable gearshift and brake levers to suit riders of different shapes and sizes.  BMW F 900 GS price and verdict (9/10) The F 900 GS significantly under cuts its closest rivals BMW hasn’t just added 50cc and changed the paint; it’s a proper evolution of the F 850 GS. With sharper handling, better ergonomics, and stronger mid-range performance, this is a much more focused machine than its predecessor. Even without the international-spec Showa fork or Enduro Pro pack, the Indian version remains a well-equipped and versatile ADV, especially for those who prefer trails to tarmac. Factor in BMW’s aggressive pricing, despite being a CBU, and this bike undercuts its key rival. If you prefer broken trails and dirt roads over well paved tarmac, the F 900 GS is one to consider If you were to throw in the extra Rs 25,000 to get the top variant and spec in some accessory extras, you’d still manage to undercut the Triumph Tiger 900 Rally Pro and the Ducati Desert X by a fair margin. If road touring is your goal, BMW has you covered with the F 900 GS Adventure. But if you’re after a lighter, more playful GS that still carries the badge’s spirit, the F 900 GS, particularly in GS Trophy trim, might just be your Goldilocks bike.

    "description": "Happy tenth birthday to the Bentley Bentayga! It’s hard to believe the SUV has been around this long, and over the years, it has seen many powertrains, a much-needed facelift, and the addition of an extended-wheelbase version. But while it was a pioneer of sorts when it was launched, a decade on, the market is flooded with super-luxury sports SUVs. So, as a sort of birthday present to itself, the performance-oriented Speed variant has been reintroduced, albeit repositioned slightly to help it stand out better in a crowded marketplace. Where the previous Speed represented the ultimate in Bentley excess, the new one leans more into its sporty side. The W12 engine has been replaced by the twin-turbo V8, albeit without the hybrid system of the Continental GT Speed, the suspension has been stiffened, and almost all mechanical aspects of the car have been retuned to make it more agile, more responsive and more emotional. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed exterior design and engineering – 8/10 Bigger wheel option adds drama to an SUV already high on road presence. Optional 23-inch wheels are largest ever on a Bentley. You’ll have to be well versed in Bentley’s various model lines to identify the Bentayga Speed, because the visual cues are few and subtle, and much can be changed in customisation. For example, red brake calipers are standard on the Speed, but you can specify other colours. You can also specify silicon carbide brake discs – the largest in the world, measuring 440mm at the front. You can also option 23-inch wheels for the first time ever on a Bentley – finished here in Grey Satin – and these do well to highlight the Speed’s added performance. There are ‘Speed’ badges on the front doors of course, and by default, bright chrome is replaced by dark chrome, the headlamp internals are dark, while the tail-lamp lenses are clear. Headlamp internals get a darkened finish on the Speed variant. These changes aside, there are of course different bumpers on the Speed compared to other Bentaygas, and the options list does include a few unique extras. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed interior space and comfort – 8/10 Classy place to spend time, enhanced with a few sportier trim options. The Bentayga Speed is not available in EWB guise, but don’t think that means it is short on space, comfort or luxury. The rear seat can be had as a single bench or a split, two-seat layout with powered chairs, heating, ventilation and massage, and a fixed centre console between them. These offer exceptional support and comfort, ‘Speed’ embroidered into the seatbacks and the option of sportier upholstery options, like Alcantara. You get the option of a panoramic sunroof as well, and powered window blinds and a touchscreen controller are also part of the package. The Speed is not available in EWB guise, but there's no shortage of space or comfort.  Quality is, expectedly, exceptional, save for the front centre console, which as in all Bentleys, continues to be plagued by very ordinary-looking plastic buttons. Elsewhere though, you’ll find thick hides, generous cross stitching, shiny chrome and vast customisation possibility (although not quite as much as in the range-topping Mulliner variant). This includes a huge choice of trim levels, including stone instead of wood – something unique to Bentley. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed features and safety – 8/10 Good amount of standard features, and lots more possible via the options list. As with any luxury vehicle these days, prepare to spend for additional specification and personalisation, but in the Bentayga Speed, the upgrades are more performance oriented. That said, the standard specification for the SUV appears to be pretty generous as well. It includes a 590W, 12-speaker audio system (20-speaker Naim audio is optional), Matrix LED headlamps, 8 airbags, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, park assist, onboard Wifi and a digital assistant. Centre console still retains tactile physical controls for essential functions. The 10.9-inch central touchscreen will be familiar if you’ve used other VW Group luxury cars, and the layout is generally simple and easy to navigate. Bentley must be credited here for providing tactile physical controls on the centre console for all essential functions and then some. The digital driver’s display has also come a long way in a decade and now has several customisable displays, including some unique to the Speed, all of which look sensational. There’s also a heads-up display, and while clean looking, it doesn’t show you a whole lot of information; there’s an ADAS suite on offer as well. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed performance and refinement – 8/10 Feels strong and surprisingly aggressive, but not quite up there with the peak super SUVs. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed specsEngineTwin-turbocharged V8Displacement3996ccPower650hpTorque850NmGearbox8-speed automaticDrive layout Permanent all-wheel drive0-100kph (claimed)3.6 secondsTop-Speed (claimed)310kph Yes, the venerable 6.0-litre W12 that Bentley introduced in 2003 is no more – it was simply too expensive and low-volume to keep upgrading for newer emissions norms. Bentley says customers have been very accepting of the 4.0-litre V8, including its PHEV versions, but for the Bentayga, it will be non-hybrid only. This not only saves over 200kg in an already heavy car, but wound up to 650hp and 850Nm in the Speed, it’s more powerful than the W12 ever was. And it’s not just bigger turbos that have brought them to these figures. The V8 uses higher-flow fuel injectors, the compression ratio has been lowered and lag is said to be reduced too, thanks to greater turbo control. The throttle map has been made more responsive, and the gearshifts quickened, and there’s also launch control for the very first time. Venerable W12 has made way for a non-hybrid, 650hp 4.0-litre V8 engine. The result is 0-100kph in 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 310kph, making this the quickest and fastest Bentayga ever, and Bentley says all this comes into play only in Sport mode; Comfort and ‘Bentley’ mode remain as refined as they ever were. What can’t be put into numbers is the effect the new sports exhaust has. By default, the Speed gets a steel sports exhaust different to the rest of the range, but as an option, there is a titanium Akrapovic option that saves 12.5kg. It also sounds utterly wild, especially from the outside; almost unbecoming of a car with the Flying B on its nose. Inside, they’ve chosen not to enhance the sound through the speakers, so though a little muted by all that sound insulation, what you hear is real. Acceleration is forceful in Sport mode, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes. Performance is every bit as strong as you’d expect, with launch control, in particular, feeling almost comically aggressive in a luxurious barge such as this. And, as Bentley said, there is a huge difference between Sport and the lesser modes. Acceleration is forceful, backed by a raucous roar from the titanium pipes, and when you’re ready to rein it in, those massive brakes haul you back down with ease. It’s, of course, not as strong as some of its PHEV rivals like the Cayenne Turbo S e-hybrid or Lamborghini Urus SE, or even its stablemate, the new Continental GT Speed, but they’ve managed to deliver an eagerness and potency far greater than any previous Bentayga has delivered. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed mileage and efficiency – 6/10 The kind of efficiency you’d expect from an ultra-luxury performance SUV. Standard Bentayga V8 has a WLTP-rated fuel efficiency of 7.5kpl. Of course, mileage in a 2.5-tonne twin-turbo V8 SUV is not going to wow you, and at no point on our test drive did we even look at the figure. As the product is brand new, Bentley has yet to reveal an official fuel economy figure for it. However, for reference, the WLTP rating of the standard V8 variant is 7.5kpl, while the Speed’s W12-powered predecessor was rated at 6.99kpl. If you are after reasonable running costs, though, there is the V6 hybrid version of the Bentayga, rated at a solid 33.33kpl on the WLTP cycle. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed ride comfort and handling – 9/10 Deftly hops between limousine plush and razor sharp at the flick of a switch. More impressive than even the performance of the Bentayga Speed is its dual dynamic nature. Here too, there have been several key tweaks. Rear-wheel steering and active anti-roll bars are standard, as is a limited-slip differential. The suspension tune is 15 percent stiffer overall than the base Bentayga, and as mentioned before, silicone carbide brakes and 23-inch wheels (with Pirelli P Zero rubber) are optional. The torque vectoring system has been tuned to be far more aggressive, while the ESC system has been slackened to allow for far more slip. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight.  The results of these tweaks are easy to see, as they imbue the big Bentley with an agility never seen before. It feels remarkably light on its feet for a car of its size and weight, and more akin to its sportier VW Group counterparts – the Urus and the Cayenne. It’s far more eager to turn in, and it now has a greater affinity for oversteer. This was made even clearer on the dirt track that Bentley had laid out for us, across which the large SUV bounded gleefully like a bucking bronco, kicking its tail out at every opportunity. On a dirt track, it was eager to kick its tail out at every oppurtunity. Even on the tarmac, though, you can feel the active roll-suppression system working overtime to keep the Bentayga level, as the rear-axle steering cuts the turning radius down to hatchback size. While luxury is what most of us associate Bentley with, the Speed wants to remind you that the brand has a history of sport too. That’s not to say it doesn’t feel plush; on the contrary, its air suspension manages the difficult task of oscillating between comfort and sport, and it does it seamlessly. You do feel the 23-inch wheels over bumps, though. 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed price and verdict – 7/10 Bentayga’s new-found naughty side elevates it above the rest of the range. We’ll admit Bentley’s decision for the Bentayga Speed to forego the potent new 780hp PHEV powertrain, which its two-door Continental GT stablemate had recently received, left us a little confused. After all, the ultra-high-end performance luxury SUV, where a few 100 kilograms could easily be added or removed without anyone noticing, seems ideally suited to such a powertrain. And the Speed models have always been about excess, so why not give this Bentayga the most excessive powertrain? Foregoing the 780hp PHEV V8 gives the Speed a purer, more engaging experience. Bentley says that it wanted to go deeper into sports SUV territory, following customer feedback that cried out for a purer, more engaging experience. To that end, they’ve succeeded, and have also cleverly filled a void in the market vacated by VW Group’s own Lamborghini Urus. With the Urus having moved up into ludicrous 800hp PHEV hyper-SUV territory, Bentley’s decision not to follow it and instead fill the void might just be a masterstroke. Perhaps this should have been the new ‘Bentayga S’, which, fun fact, has been phased out by the Speed, since the two would have been too similar in proposition. While we do not have the Bentayga Speed India price just yet, expect it to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom, before options). It sounds ludicrous to think of such vehicles in terms of segments and rivals, but the Aston Martin DBX 707 does come to mind, an SUV which seems like it might be a tad more engaging, but not quite as plush and cossetting as the Bentley. Bentayga Speed India price expected to be well north of Rs 5 crore (ex-showroom). The Bentayga, and indeed Bentley as a brand, has always been about the delicate confluence of luxury and sport, and should you have forgotten its storied and spirited motorsport history in recent times, the Speed’s slightly wilder approach is here to remind you of just that.

    "description": "In Egyptian mythology, Bennu is an ancient deity associated with creation and rebirth. Depicted as a bird, it is believed that he may have been the original inspiration for the legend of the phoenix—which is exactly why the owner of this enchanting 1978 Harley-Davidson Shovelhead named it after him. Even though the donor bike was almost a half-century old, this story of rebirth has less to do with the bike’s restoration, and more to do with the man behind it. It comes from Hideki Hoshikawa, founder of the Japanese custom shop Asterisk Custom Works. And it’s the first time in six years that he and his team have attempted a build of this scale. Hoshikawa-san’s last ground-up vintage Harley was an equally majestic hardtail, nicknamed Jenny Lind, which debuted at that year’s Yokohama Hot Rod Custom Show.…",

    "description": "The moment he dropped a gear and hoisted a beautifully controlled, one-handed wheelie over the finish line at Wheels \u0026 Waves’ Punks Peak hill climb, is a memory that will live long in the mind of Sticky’s Speed Shop founder, Matt Coulter. It took some time getting there. The budget was busted and friendships strained to hit an immovable deadline—but get there he did. Matt is well-known in custom circles for building in-yer-face, four-cylinder superbikes (and the odd twin). When the opportunity to build a single landed, he partnered up with his regular collaborator, the English artist and illustrator, Ryan Roadkill, to create the concept. The commission itself came straight from Royal Enfield—and the bike on the chopping block was the Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450.…",

    "description": "Mk1 DS 3s and Mk2 Citroën C3s built from 2009-2019 have been recalled over a potentially fatal airbag fault Stellantis has told all UK owners of Mk1 DS 3s and Mk2 Citroën C3s built between 2009 and 2019 to stop driving their cars immediately. The order affects both the Citroën DS 3 and later examples of the supermini that were sold solely under the DS brand. It comes a week after a woman in Reims, France, was killed after the Takata airbag in her 2014 C3 exploded. French officials put Stellantis under pressure to take DS 3s and C3s fitted with the faulty Takata airbags off the road. The company had already recalled the affected cars, replacing airbags in just under 70% of the 690,000 examples. France's transport minister, Philippe Tabarot, said the brand’s response had “not matched the scale of the risk”, according to a report by state-owned news network Radio France Internationale. All affected C3 and DS 3 owners will be notified by letter, Stellantis said. It has urged owners to ensure their address and contact details registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) are up to date so that they can be contacted as soon as possible. Owners can check whether their car is affected by using a vehicle identification number (VIN) search on the Citroën UK website. Stellantis UK said owners of affected cars should register their vehicle for an airbag repair as soon as possible. This can be done online, by calling the company’s recall helpline on 0800 917 9285, or by calling Citroën customer care on 0800 093 9393. It added that it is “mobilising its full network of suppliers, retailers and manufacturing plants” to ensure the repairs are conducted as quickly as possible. The company also said: “Stellantis remains fully committed to acting swiftly, transparently, and responsibly in addressing this issue.” Faulty Takata airbags were the cause of the world's biggest ever vehicle recall, in 2017, when the company conceded that it had hidden issues with the systems. The potential faults were first raised in 2006, when Takata officials said some of its airbag inflators expanded with too much force, sending metal shrapnel into cars. More than 100 million cars were affected globally.",

    "description": "Starting January 2026, all new two-wheelers sold in India must be equipped with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and dealerships will be required to provide two BIS-certified helmets—one each for the rider and pillion. MoRTH mandates ABS on all new two-wheelers Effective from January 2026 Ministry of Transport mandates ABS from January 2026 Along with this, every new 2-wheeler sold should come with two helmets In a significant move aimed at enhancing road safety, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has announced that all new two-wheelers sold in India from January 2026 must come equipped with ABS, regardless of engine capacity. In addition, it will be mandatory for dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with every new vehicle—one for the rider and one for the pillion passenger. The decision is expected to address a major cause of road fatalities in the country, especially among two-wheeler users. According to government data, a large number of two-wheeler accidents involve brake-related skidding and head injuries, which the new rules aim to reduce. While the move is widely welcomed by road safety advocates, some manufacturers have raised concerns over potential cost implications for entry-level models. However, government officials believe the benefits in terms of saved lives and reduced injuries will far outweigh the price increase.  For reference, major two-wheeler manufacturers like Hero, Honda, TVS, Bajaj and Suzuki have a number of their products that fall under the 125cc mark, which will all need to be updated to meet this new rule. All of these products are priced around the Rs 1 lakh mark (ex-showroom), and they are likely to see an increase in price owing to the additional hardware necessitated by this new rule.  Perhaps the segment of the market that will be the most affected will be the entry-level 100cc motorcycles, which start from the Rs 60,000 ballpark (ex-showroom). For two-wheelers that require the addition of a front disc as well as single channel ABS, customers could be looking at a price hike of roughly Rs 6,000 - Rs 10,000.   The ministry is expected to release detailed guidelines and timelines soon to ensure a smooth rollout of the regulation.   Also see: Rajiv Bajaj to step down from KTM parent company Pierer AG’s supervisory board",

The new Sport variant is available with the same 1.5-litre engine as the rest of the range; however, it is available only with a CVT, sits above the entry-level City V CVT variant, and features cosmetic changes on the inside and outside. The launch confirms our report from last year that the City Sport edition was in the works. Honda City Sport exterior gets blacked-out elements City Sport interior features blacked-out bits with contrasting red highlights It is mechanically identical to other variants Honda City Sport price and features It costs Rs 49,000 more than the V CVT variant Honda City prices, ex-showroom, Delhi (in Rs, lakh)VariantManualCVTSV12.38-V13.1514.40Sport-14.89VX14.2115.47ZX15.4016.65 During the introductory period, the City Sport costs Rs 49,000 more than the V CVT variant. Besides the cosmetic changes listed below, the City Sport gets two additional features over the V variant: a 7-colour ambient lighting system and leatherette upholstery on the seat, steering and gear knob. The rest of the features list and safety kit is the same, with highlights including the ADAS suite, front fog lights, auto headlights, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity for the 8-inch touchscreen infotainment, keyless entry and go, and paddle shifters. The Sport misses out on features like the sunroof, rear AC vents, 4 tweeters (it makes do with just 4 speakers), the lane watch camera, the 7-inch digital instrument cluster, auto wipers, and an auto-dimming inside rear view mirror. Honda City Sport exterior changes The grille, rear spoiler, and alloy wheels get dark treatment The blacked-out bits on the City Sport include the grille, boot spoiler, the alloy wheels, ‘shark fin’ antenna, and outside rear view mirror covers. The variant also gets a Sport badge to differentiate it from the rest of the range. Honda offers this limited edition variant in three colour options: Radiant Red Metallic, Platinum White Pearl and Meteoroid Gray Metallic. Honda City Sport interior changes Leatherette upholstery is black, with red highlights On the inside, the blacked-out elements include the upholstery, the doors, the roof and the pillars, along with red highlights on the seats, door inserts and steering wheel.
