    "description": "This 1961 Ferrari 250 GTE is one of 954 Pininfarina-bodied 2+2 coupes built during three years of production and is among the last of 299 first-series examples constructed during the model’s first two years. Chassis 3075 was completed on December 14, 1961, and was delivered new in the US via Luigi Chinetti Motors in New York. By the 1980s the car appeared under ownership in Florida and was later imported to Europe, where it was sold by a Belgian dealer to its current owner in 2014. A refurbishment was subsequently performed in Modena, Italy, between 2016 and 2020 before the car participated in the 2021 and 2022 Auto e Moto D’Epoca fairs and then returned to Florida in 2023. Finished in Grigio Conchiglia, the car is powered by a 3.0-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a four-speed manual transmission with electric overdrive. Additional features include servo-assisted Dunlop four-wheel disc brakes, telescopic shock absorbers, 15” Borrani wire wheels, and red leather interior upholstery. This 250 GTE is now offered on dealer consignment in Waltham, Massachusetts, with copies of its factory build sheets, invoices from 2018 to 2022, owner's literature, and a clean Florida title.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/callum-skye-ev-edges-closer-production-interior-unveiled",
    "description": "The Skye has a target weight of just 1150kg, distributed 50:50 front to rear Former Jaguar design chief’s Ariel Nomad rival has been designed as one of the lightest EVs available Former Jaguar design boss Ian Callum's eponymous car company has unveiled the interior of its debut model, the Skye, edging it closer to production. It has been designed to help the electric sports car to hit a target weight of just 1150kg, which would make the Skye one of the lightest EVs on the market. As such, it has a minimalist look, with a spine-like centre console, leather straps in place of traditional door-pulls and a smallcentrally mounted infotainment touchscreen. Key features such as the air conditioning are controlled using a pair of rotating dials placed on the centre console, in similar fashion to the new Bugatti Tourbillon. Instrumentation, meanwhile, comes in the form of traditional printed dials with additional readouts for range, battery charge and temperature. The rest of the interior is upholstered in white leather with contrasting 'Vitamin C' orange elements, supplied by Scottish company Bridge of Weir. The car has seating for four, with two bucket seats up front and a simple bench in the rear. The Callum company said it would show another variation of the interior, said to be more rugged, next year. The Skye is expected to launch in summer 2026, and between 50 and 250 units will be produced annually, priced between £80,000-£110,000.  That lines the electric off-roader up against the similarly conceived Ariel Nomad, which entered its second generation earlier this year. The Skye is powered by two electric motors (one on each axle) with combined outputs of 247bhp and 221lb ft, as well as a 42kWh battery that yields a claimed range of 170 miles. Speaking at the car’s public debut at the Savile Row Concours earlier this year, Ian Callum told Autocar: “This is not just a pretty street car. It’s going to have real off-road capability. \"We’ve been working on this for two years so far, and now we're ready to start developing prototypes. So now is the right time to let the world see it, and we’ll be in production within two years.” He added: “I do see this as a west coast of America-inspired car. It’s an off-road car, it’s a sand car, it’s a mud car, and I think the west coast will be where a lot of our customers are based.” As such, Skye will be available in two guises: one tailored more towards off-road ability, the other for on-road dynamics. The off-road car will feature a higher ride height and up to 100mm of suspension travel - as well as a pared-back interior with less of a focus on luxury than the on-road edition.  The Skye’s bold shape, which the company says is “driven by its capabilities”, is based on a strong ‘accent loop’ surrounding the door apertures, with a horizontal body structure running through the whole car and providing mountings for the two large doors, which are glazed below the waistline as well as above it. Its chassis is a rugged steel spaceframe with plenty of ground clearance and travel for its bespoke all-independent suspension, and it sports a lightweight composite body. Underneath, most of its chassis componentry has been developed in-house, but the battery and electric motors are sourced from an unnamed supplier. Callum director of engineering Adam Donfrancesco said: “We’ll take motors from places we like and include that with a lot of powertrain electronics that have been created for us, including wiring looms. Anything more serious we’ll get from our trusted supply network.” Francesco added that the influence of rally cars was key in making it enjoyable to drive. He said: “It's not just about how fast it goes down the road, because it wants to have great steering feel, it wants to have nice suspension feel, it wants to be like a Tarmac rally car.” Before customer deliveries begin, the Skye will be taken on a testing programme around the Midlands, as well as more extreme locations, but without the traditional testing camouflage usually worn by test mules. Ian Callum said: “OEMs camouflage the cars because they want to take them out testing. And they camouflage them because the competition is out there and they don't want other people to see it.  “We don’t really have any competition. It’s quite a unique product. So we’re not averse to letting the world see what we’re doing. We’ll be out in the open testing it.” \"We want to make the car as usable as possible”, said Ian Callum. “Is ingress going to be perfect? It’s not bad. It’s easier than some sports cars. We think the inside of a classic Porsche is big enough for most people to still enjoy the car. That, in some ways, has been our dimensional benchmark.” The Callum company’s total staff now runs to more than 20 people, although Ian Callum says the firm’s intention is always to remain “small and agile”. As the first all-new Callum model, the Skye succeeds successful programmes unveiled since the company was founded in 2019, including a highly individualistic reinterpretation of the 2001 Aston Martin Vanquish (an Ian Callum original), a string of impressive forays into product design and some still-secret collaborative projects. Q\u0026A with Ian Callum, design chief, Callum Did you consider a sports car as your first own-brand product? “We did but decided it would be a bit predictable. We settled on something that would show our versatility and that we’re about all kinds of vehicles, not just one.” Will you make more bespoke Callum cars? \"That’s our intention. The Vanquish project was something we did to prepare ourselves for the phase that starts with Skye, doing our own projects. We don’t want just to be an agency for other brands. We have a way of creating simple but beautifully crafted cars with special detail design.” Would you do the next one in bigger numbers? “There’s lots to do before we get to that kind of decision, but if things go well we could imagine making our own cars in batches of up to 1000. David, Adam and I have been doing this car creation thing together for quite a few years. It’s not a mystery to us; we know our capabilities.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-%C2%A3850k-aston-martin-valhalla-land-summer-1079bhp",
    "description": "Valhalla has more torque than any Aston yet - and nearly as much power as the Valkyrie Final specifications for Aston's first plug-in hybrid revealed as it gears up to battle the Ferrari 296 in 2025 Aston Martin's long-awaited Valhalla supercar will enter production in just a few months - with a hefty power advantage over its main rivals. The firm has released full production specifications for its new mid-engined plug-in hybrid ahead of customer deliveries beginning in the second half of 2025, revealing that it has more power than first promised and the highest torque figure of any Aston Martin model yet. Early details pegged the Mercedes-sourced hybrid V8's output at 1000bhp, but with homologation now complete, Aston has bumped that figure to 1079bhp to make it more powerful than the Lamborghini Temerario, McLaren Artura and Ferrari 296 GTB. It's only very slightly outpunched by the 1139bhp output of Aston's V12 Valkyrie flagship. The 4.0-litre AMG flat-plane-crank V8 contributes some 817bhp of that total figure, supplemented by 248bhp from a trio of electric motors - two radial-flux devices on the front axle and a starter-generator in the eight-speed automatic gearbox. All up, the powertrain puts out a combined 811lb ft of torque - far more than the Valkyrie and well clear of even the likes of the V12 Vulcan track car and the new Vanquish GT. Officially, the Valhalla will get from 0-62mph in just 2.5sec and top out at an electronically limited 217mph, making it one of the quickest combustion cars on sale. Just 999 examples of the Valhalla will be built, priced from £850,000 (including VAT), although Aston expects \"a huge number\" of cars to go through its Q personalisation programme, so some will cost well in excess of that figure. Aston Martin Valhalla: everything you need to know Notably, the Valhalla – unlike the 2019 concept which preceded it – is not powered by a bespoke, Aston Martin-developed V6, as was originally planned. Instead, the Valhalla follows the Aston Martin Vantage in adopting a powertrain supplied by technical partner Mercedes-AMG – specifically the performance division's twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8, which revs to 7200rpm and drives the rear axle through an all-new bespoke eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. Like AMG's old GT Black Series, the Valhalla's V8 features a flat-plane crank and is said to be \"the most advanced, responsive and highest-performing V8 engine ever fitted to an Aston Martin\". It also breathes through a lightweight exhaust system that exits through the top of the rear deck and contains adjustable flaps that give \"an authentic Aston Martin sound character\".  Like the Ferrari SF90, the Valhalla uses only its front electric motors to drive in EV mode, which it can do for eight miles and at speeds of up to 80mph, but in normal driving situations, electric power is split across both axles as needed to supplement the V8's output. It reverses exclusively in electric mode, too, saving weight by negating the need for a conventional reverse gear in the eight-speed DCT, which has been fitted with an electronic limited-slip differential to improve traction and agility and can offer up two gears at once to allow the EV and combustion motors to operate in tandem.  Housing the all-new powertrain is a bespoke carbonfibre tub that gives \"maximum stiffness with minimum weight penalty\". A dry weight of just 1655kg gives a power-to-weight ratio of 643bhp per tonne, while aerodynamic-enhancing bodywork elements – including huge venturi channels underneath and an active front splitter and rear wing – inspired by the Valkyrie's F1-style set-up are claimed to generate 600kg of downforce at 150mph.  Pushrod suspension features at the front and a multi-link set-up at the rear, with dampers and springs mounted inboard to reduce unsprung mass, The entire set-up is stiffened and “dramatically” lowered in Track mode and can be raised at low speed to clear speed bumps.  By using more subtle bodywork elements to enhance downforce, Aston's designers were given free rein for the overall silhouette, without the need for such dramatic wings, intakes and outlets as on the Valkyrie. The design is much cleaner, more overtly road-focused and extensively altered from that of the concept.  The prominent roof scoop, forward-hinged dihedral doors, swooping rear deck and one-piece rear wing remain, but a completely new treatment for the front, rear and side bring the supercar into line with its more mainstream siblings.  A wraparound version of Aston's trademark grille features at the front, for example, below larger, rounder matrix LED headlights, while the rear diffuser has been heavily toned down for a more production-friendly set-up. There is a more angular-looking side skirt, too, sharper side vent designs and, obviously, wing mirrors, which were absent from the show car. The production-spec wheels, meanwhile, are 20in in diameter at the front and 21in at the rear and wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tyres.  Inside the Valhalla offers a “pared back cockpit design with clear, simple ergonomics unashamedly focused around the driver”, Aston said, complete with a squared steering wheel – near-identical to the Valkyrie's – and a pair of screens for the gauges and infotainment.  It's more spacious and civilised than its sibling, though, with additions such as an infotainment touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, dual-zone air conditioning, a rear-view camera and a raft of advanced driver aids strengthening its on-road credentials.  Chief creative officer Marek Reichman explained how the Valhalla’s different positioning from the Valkyrie necessitated a unique design approach: “When we created the Valhalla concept, we were keen to emphasise the design legacy of the Valkyrie, and that intent remains unchanged, but the execution has evolved considerably in order to reach production of this all-new car. \"Though the legacy of the Valkyrie is clear, the Valhalla is now a more mature, fully resolved piece of design.”",

    "description": "Picking up the M4 Competition from BMW’s press centre storage facility on the outskirts of Munich initially feels a bit like going through passport control – licence and ID check before we are finally handed the keys. Once inside, walking through the massive parking tower feels surreal; every single BMW you can imagine is here. And probably every Mini and every Rolls, too. Even better, as we walk through, there are M cars in all shapes and sizes. What a place! Finally, we get to our car. Yeah, that nose. The flared nostrils are clearly OTT and shouty, but it doesn’t look quite as odd as it did when it was first revealed. And I like those vents on the bonnet. But can this M4 Competition deliver as characterful a driving experience? Chop-chop, we’re headed to the Austrian border and then into the Alps. Good driving roads beckon. 2024 BMW M4 Competition ride and practicality I open the surprisingly light doors, squeeze in past the big seats, and settle down. BMW has brought the curved display to the M4, and this Competition version gets plenty of other driver-oriented stuff; more on that later. My first priority is getting out of this building, and while most of the drive down resembles a normal parking lot, the last bit is unique. We drive down a steel chute and then straight out into the sunshine. Voilà! Big grille is still a big talking point of the M4. The first few kilometres of city trudge are pretty uneventful. The engine doesn’t feel overeager or spiky, the 8-speed ZF torque converter gearbox is creamy-smooth, and only when I manually intervene do I get a rude burst of power. So the M4 Competition can do the office, school and outstation runs. It has a proper boot, usable back seats and isn’t too difficult to get in and out of either. In fact, driving it in the city feels so undramatic and one-dimensional that it feels bland. No sensations come through to my palms at low speed, no nice elasticity of repose from the accelerator, and certainly no beautifully balanced and confident agility in low-speed corners. It just feels rooted and relaxed. The ride over Munich roads also feels firm; it can be brittle over bad patches, and there is a fair amount of road noise over open-pore surfaces. However, with the adaptive dampers set to Comfort, there’s enough pliancy to make the M4 Competition a very competent long-distance cruiser. Seats are large and very supportive in corners; inner thigh support is not as much of an issue as it is made out to be.   2024 BMW M4 Competition powertrain So, at normal driving speeds, the M4 Competition feels very laid back. I guess I’ll have to stir the pot a bit to get to the good stuff. This should be pretty easy once we turn off to the Autobahn, where on this route, there are plenty of derestricted stretches. But first, it’s time to do a bit of a spec check. Under the hood, the twin-turbo S58 straight-six has been wound up to 530hp – check. Then there’s 650Nm from 2,750rpm to a high 5,730rpm; plenty of torque – check. Forged crank, iron coating sprayed on the internals and two mono-scroll turbos for more boost – check. Near 50:50 front-rear weight distribution – check. And although this is a four-wheel-drive car, there is a rear-wheel-drive mode for those wet, empty parking lots and drift pads. You also get a 10-stage adjustable traction control and an ‘M drift analyser’ that awards points and stars for good drifts. I have to say I like BMW’s on-screen games better than Tesla’s. The M4 Competition, however, is heavy at 1,850kg – the four-wheel-drive hardware contributing to a lot. And yes, you get staggered wheels for greater stability, 19s and 20s at the front and rear, respectively. Stonking twin-turbo engine makes a strong 530hp. Getting to the 120kph speed limit on the restricted parts of the Autobahn brings the M4 Competition somewhat out of its shell. Past 3,000rpm, it begins shedding its Clark Kent suit and flexing its muscles. Often, 120kph comes up so quickly that I get taken by surprise. And hey, BMW, can we at least have fake analogue dials? When it comes to character, BMW’s twin-turbo straight six responds more like a naturally aspirated unit than a turbocharged one. Progression up the rev band is as linear as some atmo sixes, responses are quick, and then, because it has all the extra torque, it just hauls, even from low in the powerband. A delicious combo. 2024 BMW M4 Competition performance When we finally see the grey and white cricket ball-like de-restriction sign, my right foot goes down automatically. The M4 Competition lunges at the horizon – no delay in power delivery, no slack, no lag. And that’s even though the gearbox is in a high gear in manual mode. Even more impressive, the engine keeps pulling harder and harder as the revs climb, and at around 6,000rpm, I realise we are really shifting – the scenery flying past in a blur. Wow, this thing has some real muscle, some real grunt! And like any good BMW unit, it’s thrilled to rev and spin hard. It isn’t explosive or peaky in the mid-range, and sometimes you miss that, but it is smooth, crisp and seriously potent. 200kph is almost a casual stroll up the ’box. And when I really plant my foot, the linear lunge delivers a sledgehammer blow. The claimed 0-100kph is super quick at just 3.5 seconds, which, incidentally, is faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera. Quad exhaust and low-slung roof make it look purposeful. Niggles? It doesn’t sound great, but I like that this is the honest voice of the engine with no synth added. And when you are in a hurry, you do expect a bit more urgency from the gearbox.  2024 BMW M4 Competition handling The real test of an M car, however, comes in the twisties, and here, initially, there’s a bit of disappointment. The steering, tasked with ironing out the push-pull of the four-wheel-drive system, is light and inert, and going to a sportier setting only adds weight. Lean on the M4 Competition, however, and it seems to wake up from its slumber and come alive, the relative four-wheel-drive stodginess and not-inconsiderable weight seemingly melting away. Now, the stiff chassis and aluminium suspension seem to finally limber up, stretch and attack corners with an incredible amount of verve, grip and gymnast-like balance. The harder I turn into corners, the more agile the M4 Competition feels, with the precision from the steering sharpening up superbly. It may not be the most feelsome unit, but it is super sharp, even when all four wheels are loaded up and complaining loudly. Even small movements on the wheel change your line, and that’s exactly what you want. The steering is light and not very M car-like at all. But our drive is too brief, and to really enjoy this car to the fullest, I need more time, better roads, faster corners and more opportunities. That, or a track. Sure, it is heavy; 200kg less would have made it incredible. But the weight is placed down low, and that helps. Also, I must say, the driving position is excellent, especially if you like to sit low. 2024 BMW M4 Competition price and verdict Rs 1.53 crore will buy you an M4 Competition in India. Look at this as just a much more powerful 3 Series Coupé with some go-faster hardware, and it will seem even more expensive, especially if you consider the excellent M340i xDrive at Rs 74.9 lakh. But that’s not quite right. The M4 Competition is a whole category or two up. A serious performance car that delivers a combination of supercar pace and sedan-like practicality, the M4 is the one to go for if you want many disparate cars in one. Let’s not forget it gets a back seat and boot, comes with a stonking 530hp engine, more performance than some supercars, and on the right road, delivers a driving experience that’s agile, accurate and as adjustable as some of the best sports cars around. And that makes it stand out. Also see: BMW car prices to increase from January 2025 2024 BMW M2 launched at Rs 1.03 crore, gets more power Next-gen BMW M3 to get both ICE and EV powertrains",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

Harley-Davidson Australia noticed Nigel Petrie. They called to ask him to have some fun on their dime, and that he did. Nigel is the mind behind Engineered To Slide, a custom auto and motorcycle garage from Down Under. He’s been headdown and neck-deep in projects of all sorts since 2010.

We also feature the new Dust Moto Hightail electric dirt bike and a highly creative custom Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 from India. 2025 Ducati Multistrada V2 Ducati has just pulled the covers off the latest iteration of their mid-sized adventure touring bike—the 2025 Ducati Multistrada V2. The changes are subtle and numerous, but the Borgo Panigale marque is making serious headway into dream-touring-bike territory. First up is the light massaging of the front end to improve aerodynamics—but the improvements are for rider comfort rather than speed. The shape of the adjustable windscreen has been improved, and cutouts in the side of the front fairing channel fresh air to the rider’s legs.…",

    "description": "The Mahindra Thar Roxx has been crowned the Car of the Year at the Autocar Awards 2025, while the Bajaj Freedom 125 takes home the title of the Bike of the Year. The Thar Roxx has emerged victorious from a bevy of new launches for its fantastic ride and handling balance, strong set of petrol and diesel engines, upmarket interior and absolute invincibility. In the two-wheeler category, the CNG-powered Bajaj Freedom 125 impressed our jurors for its innovation, value, usability and cost-effectiveness for its targeted audience Mahindra Thar Roxx wins Autocar Car of the Year 2025 Bajaj Freedom 125 wins Autocar Bike of the Year 2025 Mahindra takes home the award for Manufacturer of the Year 2025 Autocar Awards category winners: cars The Mahindra Thar Roxx not only won the top overall honour, but it also topped its own segment with the 4x4 of the Year title. And while SUVs continue to rule the sales charts, coupe-SUVs were a flamboyant new body style to enter the mass segments this year. The one that pleased the eyes of our jurors the most was the Citroen Basalt which took home the award for Design of the Year. The overall category winner in the coupe-SUV segment, however, was the Tata Curvv. A comprehensive update earlier this year saw the Hyundai Creta ditch its polarizing looks for a far more appealing design, and it saw a huge step up in interior appointment and features as well, thereby winning title of the Variant/Update of the Year.  There was plenty of action this year in the compact SUV segment, too, with the likes of the new Toyota Taisor, Tata Punch EV and the Kia Sonet facelift, but it was the Mahindra XUV 3XO that was crowned the Compact SUV of the Year. The rebranding not only gave the erstwhile XUV300 a new identity, but also strong new powertrains and a more upmarket interior. Meanwhile, the Maruti Suzuki Dzire, fresh form a 5-star GNCAP safety rating was crowed the Compact Car of the Year. 2025 also saw a fresh new wave of EVs come into our market, but the one that left our jurors the most impressed was the MG Windsor. With its innovative BAAS subscription, the Windsor is not only affordable to own, but is also extremely comfortable, practical and a well-equipped EV. Moving up the price ladder, the BYD Seal was adjudged as the Premium EV of the year. Into the luxury segment, the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class had a hard-fought battle, both in their long wheelbase guises now, but it’s the E-Class that emerged victorious with its all-important back seat, winning the title of Luxury Sedan of the Year. Mercedes-Benz also took home the award for the Luxury EV of the Year with the EQS SUV, thanks to its luxury quotient, space and the value it offers. Lastly, the Aston Martin Vantage was adjudged the winner of the Performance Car of the Year Award. 2025 Autocar Awards category winners: bikes In the two-wheeler category, the TVS Jupiter 110 was adjudged as the Scooter of the Year, winning over nominees like the Bajaj Chetak 3201 and the Ather 450 Apex. It’s completely reworked chassis and updated technology put it ahead of its rivals, and it is currently the second best-selling scooter in the country.   The Ather Rizta was crowned the Electric Two-Wheeler of the Year for its updated design and innovative approach towards a family friendly electric scooter. Meanwhile, the TVS Apache RR 310 took home the title of Variant/Update of the Year, thanks to its overall bump in performance with its reworked internals, design updates and new features. On to the more premium end of the market, the BMW R 1300 GS was crowned the Import Bike of the Year, topping other big bikes like the Triumph Tiger 900GT, the Honda XL750 Transalp and the Ducati Monster SP. Finally, the Performance Bike of the Year Award went to the stunning made-in-India Aprilia RS 457, beating rivals like the Yamaha R3 and the MT-03. The RS 457 thoroughly impressed our jurors with its dynamics, performance and design, in particular.    Viewer’s Choice and Industry awards The Viewer’s Choice Award for Car of the Year went to the Maruti Suzuki Dzire which is no surprise given how Maruti turned around the conversation about safety of its models. Meanwhile, the Aprilia RS 457 won the Viewer’s Choice Bike of the Year Award, thanks to its immense desirability, big bike-feels and very accessible performance. On to the industry, the 2025 Person of the Year was Masakazu Yoshimura, MD and CEO, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, while the coveted Manufacturer of the Year award went to Mahindra \u0026 Mahindra, just as it did last year.

    "description": "In the run-up to the global debut of the Kia Syros on December 19, the Korean brand has released a new teaser that shows the interior of the upcoming compact SUV. Other than confirming a few features seen in previous spy shots, the new Syros teaser also previews a number of interior details. Syros to debut a new steering wheel in India, similar to Kia's EV3 Features include terrain modes, push-button start, and a wireless charger To get 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and 1.5-litre diesel engine options Kia Syros interior teaser One of the most noticeable highlights of the Syros’ cabin is the new two-spoke steering, seen on the likes of the Kia EV3. It sports the new off-centre Kia logo and gets several buttons and switches, some of which control the infotainment system, and one that is badged as Terrain Modes. This system will likely be similar to the Traction Modes offered on the larger Seltos mid-size SUV, which uses traction control to alter the amount of grip available. The Seltos’ system gets Mud, Snow/Wet, and Sand modes. Alongside the gear knob (an automatic is seen in the teaser) are buttons for push-to-start, parking sensors, and the camera. Range-topping versions are expected to get a 360-degree camera and front parking sensors, as previous Syros spy shots have shown. A corner of the large infotainment touchscreen is also visible, likely to be a 10.25-inch unit, and a digital instrument cluster will be offered in higher trims. A panoramic sunroof and an ADAS suite will be part of the features list on range-topping variants. Other details visible in the teaser include a wireless smartphone charger, two USB-C ports in the centre console, and a layered dashboard theme. Kia Syros engine options As we reported earlier, the Syros will be available with petrol and diesel engine options. However, to differentiate it from the Sonet, with which it’ll share space in the compact SUV segment, it’ll just have the 1.0-litre turbo-petrol and the 1.5-litre diesel engine options, likely with their respective automatic gearbox options. The 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol will only be available with lower variants of the Sonet. An all-electric version of the Syros is expected to join the line-up about six months after prices for the petrol and diesel versions are announced, which is expected to happen in January at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. More details about the tall-boy SUV, which will sit between the Sonet and the Seltos in Kia India’s line-up, will be revealed in the coming days. Stay tuned.

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
