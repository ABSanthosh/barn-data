    "description": "This 1955 Chevrolet 150 two-door sedan underwent a reported 2,000-hour build circa 2015 that included installing a Wegner Motorsports 7.0-liter LS7 V8 and a Bowler 4L60E four-speed automatic. The car rides on a Roadster Shop chassis with tubular control arms up front and adjustable coilovers all around along with a four-link rear setup with a Strange axle housing 4.10:1 gears. The body is finished in metallic silver, and the staggered-diameter Forgeline wheels are mounted over hydroboosted Wilwood multi-piston four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin features a custom center console, carbon-fiber trim, Classic Instruments gauges, an Alpine receiver, JL Audio components, Vintage Air climate control, and power-adjustable front bucket seats trimmed in black leather. Acquired by the seller in 2017, this modified 150 is offered with service records and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

    "description": "Hot version of talented saloon EV is intended to be not just rapid but also engaging When the GTX badge was launched by Volkswagen in 2021, it was tipped as an electric equivalent of – and eventual successor to – the GTI line. But it has suffered by comparison: adding power and straight-line speed is easy on EVs and doesn’t make for an everyday performance hero. Three years later, with new management in Wolfsburg committed to GTI, it’s GTX that’s set to eventually be phased out.Some irony, then, that this new Volkswagen ID 7 GTX showcases exactly what the badge could stand for: a compelling take on what a warmed-up VW EV can be, with a distinct nod towards grand tourers and a different feel to GTI cars.It helps that this new model has an excellent base to work from: in entry-level Pro for the ID 7 was named Autocar's Best Saloon of 2024 and the best in a competitive class that also includes the Tesla Model 3. It's a refined, understated and well-rounded car, a better base to create a GTX model from than the earlier ID 4 and ID 5 SUVs.So is the Volkswagen ID 7 GTX a true electric performance car or, as is often the car with hot EVs, would you be better off sticking to the base model?",

    "description": "As well as an EV, Jeep's baby is now available as a modest petrol manual, an electrified petrol auto and a 4WD hybrid off-roader The Jeep Avenger is now an intriguingly multifaceted little car – so it's little wonder that Jeep's UK sales figures have been rocketing up lately.This baby crossover was initially available exclusively as an impressive urban electric car, but now it also comes as a modest manual petrol, an electrified automatic petrol and a proper four-wheel-drive off-roader.The basic 1.2-litre Avenger is available in three trim levels. Regrettably, though, even the cheapest of them is priced from £25,750 – considerably more than its admittedly less trendy Peugeot 208 and Vauxhall Corsa siblings.Adding an automatic gearbox brings with it a mild-hybrid system and raises the price by £1000.The fully electric Avenger, with its 249-mile range, starts at £29,999. That car is reviewed separately here.Then from £31,219, there's the Wrangler-imitating 4xe, which gets 4WD by way of a second electric motor on the rear axle, and a Scrappy-Doo character from its beefier bumpers, roof bars, tow hooks and underbody cladding.The model range currently tops out at £35,219 with a special edition of the 4xe created in collaboration with The North Face, a renowned maker of outdoor exploration gear.",

All in a day’s work around here, but even with just a few big pieces coming together, this project was shaping up to be more than just a ridiculous idea. That being said, all we really had was a roller with a dirt-cheap diesel engine from Amazon shoehorned into it, and it would take some real work to make the thing rideable.

    "description": "I’d be lying if I said EVs aren’t perfect for the urban grind, which is where I do pretty much all my driving. Quiet, peppy off the line, seamless progress uninterrupted by gear shifts, and the ability to ‘fill up’ while I’m sat at my desk in the office – it’s a no-brainer, really. But I’d also be remiss not to point out that they feel monotone and soulless, and yes, that matters even on my commute. So, when the Autocar India Swift rotated into my possession after a series of back-to-back EVs, it proved to be a much-needed injection of attitude on my mundane Monday morning. Petrol, manual, and wrapped in the pretty and petite package of a premium hatchback, just looking at it makes me wonder why we, as a car-buying populace, have strayed so far from the light. Cute, sporty look with sufficient space; a Swift hallmark intact on new car. I burst out of the gate on a chirrup of clutch-popped wheelspin, just because I can, though I stop myself short of pulling the handbrake as I turn out onto the main road. But that’s what the Swift does to you after just a few metres of driving. After one-note EVs and big, fat SUVs, this feels small, feisty, and ready to be wrung out. The steering may have gotten lazy lately (it pays off in traffic), but the chassis is as tight as ever. The new Z12 three-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine, which has caught mountains of flak from keyboard warriors everywhere, is nowhere as bad as it’s made out to be. At its worst, it feels sluggish at low revs, which I do have to suffer through as I crawl my way to the office, but you soon learn to drive around it. This is likely a case of conservative fuelling at low revs to give the best economy, and boy, does it deliver on that front. Even in constant traffic, it rarely dips below 13kpl! Hilariously good fuel economy, even in rushhour, start-stop traffic. Let it rev, however, and it feels nice and peppy. What it’s lost in outright smoothness compared to the old K12 four-cylinder, it’s made up for with greater potency in the mid-range. Apologies for getting all road testy for a moment there, but it’s nice to enjoy a simple, honest-to-goodness petrol engine after a long time. Where the Swift disappoints is in Maruti’s obstinate obsession with cost trimming, which has made a fun, premium hatchback feel like a budget item in places. The sticker price has certainly gone up, and leaving aside the decision to go with a cheap AMT for the auto gearbox (a decision I mercifully don’t have to suffer), it’s small things that also pinch in the long run. Like the lack of an auto-dimming mirror, low-quality fabric for the roof liner, and just one (very weak) cabin light placed up front, which in turn highlights the lack of backlighting on the switches and USB ports. No backlighting on switches, USB ports makes them hard to find in the dark. On the topic of annoyances, Maruti’s idea to show turn-by-turn navigation directions from Google Maps in the MID display is noble, but it completely overrides all other information (including that amazing fuel economy meter), and it cannot be turned off unless you end the navigation. Unlike other fleet cars that I try to keep for as long as possible, I know I’m not going to hold on to the Swift for much longer. Apart from being quietly coveted by the rest of the team for being small and relatively hassle-free to live with, it’s also a regular feature on shoots as the camera car, and with good reason. Fun as this was, it’s back to the silent treatment for me. Navigation directions in MID handy but can’t be switched off; blocks other data.

    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "description": "Tata Motors will introduce its Harrier EV on June 3. The Indian car brand has confirmed the launch date four months after showcasing the production-spec Harrier EV at the 2025 Auto Expo in January, and has since been regularly dropping teasers. New terrain modes and V2L charging to be on offer Battery capacity and e-motors' output not known yet Harrier EV price likely to range between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 30 lakh (ex-showroom) Tata Harrier EV exterior design highlights Similar overall design The Tata EV looks largely the same as the diesel Harrier facelift. Vertically stacked LED headlights remain positioned below the blade-like DRLs, which are connected by a full-width light bar. In profile, swollen wheel arches are also familiar, as well as the rising window line merging with the thick and blacked-out D pillar for a floating roof effect. The same is the case with the upcoming electric vehicle's rear section, which houses a connected light bar, and bumper-mounted vertical fog lamp housings.  EV bits A sealed-off upper grille stands out, and the front bumper has a Curvv EV-like chrome-trimmed air dam (which neatly houses the radar sensor). Tata has not specified the size range for the aero-efficient \"serrated turbine blade wheels\", however, 17-19 inch options are expected. The ‘.EV’ badge on the front doors and ‘HARRIER.EV’ lettering on the tailgate further distinguish the model, while the body cladding is finished in silver for added contrast.  Tata Harrier EV interior details Carried-over features from the Harrier facelift In March, Tata dropped a teaser video of the Harrier EV’s interior, which, unsurprisingly, had a lot in common with the standard Harrier currently on sale. For instance, a two-tone dashboard and touch-based HVAC controls have been carried over. The teaser also showed the Tata EV featuring Harrier-like floating touchscreen, digital instrument cluster and four-spoke steering wheel. The same is true of the rotary dial for terrain modes, which remains in the centre console, and the electronic parking brake activator and panoramic sunroof. The Harrier EV will also offer new terrain modes, connected car features and over-the-air updates. Tata Harrier EV platform, battery and performance Acti.ev base The soon-to-launch Harrier is not a ground-up new EV because it's built on the same Omega base as the Harrier ICE. However, this platform has been heavily modified for electrification. With chassis tweaks, a redone floor to house the battery and an electrical and electronics (E\u0026E) framework, Tata calls it Acti.ev (Gen 2) architecture. For reference, Tata follows a similar approach with the Punch ICE, whose Alfa platform has been comprehensively re-engineered for the EV version. Dual-motor arrangement; 500km range Equipping the front-wheel drive Harrier diesel with an all-wheel drive system would have meant major re-engineering and high cost, mainly to add a rear drive shaft. In the all-electric Harrier SUV, however, AWD is easier to achieve by adding an electric motor at the rear. \"Harrier EV gets a more powerful rear axle-mounted motor...With electric motors, you can do a lot more, especially for performance,\" Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, had earlier told Autocar India. The all-electric Harrier will boast a peak torque of 500Nm. Tata has not yet officially disclosed the Harrier EV's battery specs, but it will likely be bigger than the Curvv EV’s 55kWh unit. Srivatsa also confirmed an over 500km of real-world range under Tata's C75 range test cycle.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki is set to launch a new ICE SUV around the festive season, and it will most likely be called ‘Escudo’, our sister publication Autocar Professional has learned. Codenamed Y17, the upcoming Maruti car will likely be positioned above the Brezza, yet below the Grand Vitara. The Y17 SUV, earlier conceived as a three-row, seven-seater version of the Vitara, is now understood to feature two rows and five seats due to a shift in its market scope, as per sources. Maruti to sell the ‘Escudo’ via Arena showrooms To rival Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos SUVs   New Maruti SUV repositioning explained Will likely be longer than the standard Grand Vitara People in the know said that Maruti has done the repositioning to target the high-volume mid-size SUV segment, currently led by the Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos. Compared to the Grand Vitara, the upcoming SUV is expected to be more accessible in prices and features, explaining Maruti’s decision to retail it through Arena showrooms instead of its premium Nexa network. Despite not featuring a third row, it will be likely be longer than the 4,345mm-long Grand Vitara, and may offer more boot space than the latter’s maximum 373-litre capacity. Maruti SUV powertrain expectations May borrow Vitara's powertrains As reported earlier, the Y17 will sit on the same Global-C platform as the standard Grand Vitara. It’s also expected to carry forward the same 104hp-1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol and 88hp-CNG, and 116hp-1.5-litre hybrid options. The manual and automatic gearbox options, as well as the AWD system, are also likely to be carried over from the Vitara. Escudo nameplate not new Suzuki Vitara called Escudo in Japan Notably, Maruti trademarked the Escudo name in India last year. Suzuki uses the Escudo nameplate for the Vitara SUV in Japan. If retained here, the Escudo will be one of Maruti’s two SUVs scheduled for launch in 2025, the other being the all-electric e Vitara. “[More] details will be shared later,” a company spokesperson said, without confirming specific launch timelines or model names. The Maruti Y17 could target buyers looking for an SUV slightly longer than the Grand Vitara, which, for reference, sits between the Creta (4,330mm) and Seltos (4,365mm) in terms of length. An incremental output of up to 200,000 units is likely, with volumes spread between Maruti, Toyota and exports. The new SUV may also help Maruti move closer towards attaining its 5-6 percent growth target in the current financial year.
