Especially if you’ve never driven, or navigated, on its epic route that spans over 8,500 miles – which crosses some of the world’s toughest terrain... Katarina Kyvalova is no ordinary racing driver.  It was fitting that someone who made their racing debut in a 24-hour event in a pre-war Bentley should get her first taste of the Prodrive Peking to Paris in a wild, first-of-its-kind restomod from British racing and rallying legends Prodrive, based – of all things – on a 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback donor car. A regular in historic motorsports, usually seen racing a 4.5-liter Bentley, a Cooper Jaguar or a Jaguar E-Type, Katarina took a huge leap out of her comfort zone by signing up for one of the most gruelling and prestigious endurance rallies in the world before the global health pandemic of 2020.

    "description": "Convertible does 0-62mph sprint in 6.4sec... Mini completes new line-up with hottest version of its petrol hatchback Mini has completed the regeneration of its line-up with the unveiling of the new combustion-engined John Cooper Works hatchback and Convertible.  Both cars use the same twin-scroll-turbocharged 2.0-litre in-line four-cylinder engine. It produces 228bhp, which matches the output of the outgoing John Cooper Works, and 280lb ft, which is 44lb ft more than previously, and is mated to the same seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox as that in the Cooper C and Cooper S. Despite the extra torque, the new John Cooper Works hatch is no faster from 0-62mph than its predecessor, taking 6.1sec. This is most likely down to a combination of its gearing and an extra 35kg compared with its predecessor. The new model now tips the scales at 1330kg. It is also 0.2sec behind the new John Cooper Works E, whose 255bhp electric motor pushes it to 62mph in 5.9sec. The John Cooper Works Convertible is 1425kg (40kg heavier than the previous-generation car) and takes 6.4sec to hit 62mph. Both are distinguished from their Cooper C and Cooper S siblings by a two-tone black and red livery, a more aggressive front bumper with air intakes across its flanks and a more open grille. The giveaways at the rear end are a more prominent valance with a central tailpipe and a humped rear spoiler. The package is completed by 17in and 18in John Cooper Works-specific alloy wheel designs. Inside, the dashboard is upholstered in black and red cloth with a chequered-flag pattern, and a sports steering wheel, with gearchange paddles, is fitted as standard. Deliveries start early next year, with pre-registration prices starting from £31,200 for the hatch and £35,200 for the convertible.",

As you might have noticed, Audi is shaking up its naming structure so that all the odd-numbered cars have combustion engines while all the even-numbered cars have batteries and electric motors.After being known as the 80 for 25 years and the A4 for 20, Audi’s compact executive saloon/estate now prefers to be known as the A5; and as per tradition, there’s a faster version, with S for sporty.We’re focusing on the S5, because it’s the most interesting of the bunch and it’s the car I got the most representative time in on the launch, but there will be fuller tests of the normal A5 to come in future.",

    "description": "The Pulsar 125, in its Classic guise, continues to be a massive seller for Bajaj, but the company needed something fresh and youthful to address the TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R. After all, those two have carved out a new segment of about 50,000-60,000 sales per month. The N125 is Bajaj’s answer, and the interesting thing is that it has nothing to do with any other Pulsar before it. Bajaj Pulsar N125 design, colours, quality  Bajaj wanted to make a 125 that weighed 125 kilos (which is nearly 20kg less than the existing 125cc Pulsar models), and that necessitated an entirely new platform. The N125 also carries a new design language, and it’s great to see that this isn’t just another Pulsar wearing a familiar set of clothes. Plenty of floating panels all over and a rather un-Pulsar-like headlamp bring freshness to the design philosophy. But there’s also familiarity in elements like the shape of the tank extensions as well as the new take on the twin-slash brake lamps.  While so much aero-inspired bodywork on a tiny 125 is almost purely for aesthetics, the vents on the front mudguard shroud are actually functional. The story goes that the initial design did not have any vents, but the engine development team complained to the design department that their air-cooled engine wasn’t getting enough flow, which is why the vents were incorporated.  There are some unusual touches, like the body panel along the side of the subframe. We’re used to seeing this kind of bodywork at the tail section on most motorcycles, but it finds itself positioned between the rider and pillion seat on the N125. This has the effect of adding mass to the design but also keeps the tail quite slim. The fat fork shrouds do a good job of masking the skinny 30mm telescopic fork, but while they certainly give the bike more presence, some may find them to be excessively wide. Quality levels are decent, but some visible panel gaps on our bike do leave room for improvement. In all, the N125 has a striking design that will be a little polarising yet also easily identifiable, especially in the funky colour schemes Bajaj has gone with. It doesn’t have the same ‘big-bike’ look as the Hero Xtreme 125R, but it certainly stands out, and that’s a good thing. Bajaj Pulsar N125 ride and handling The seating position is more or less what you’d expect from a bike like this. At 795mm, the seat height isn’t the lowest in the class, but it’s still very manageable, and the seats are spacious and comfortable. The footpeg placement is a little sporty, which goes well with a bike like this. However, the narrow handlebar felt a bit too ‘commutery’, which slightly dilutes the special feeling a bike like this should have.  Happily, the new chassis makes up for this in its sheer lightness and behaviour. 125kg is nearly on par with the TVS Raider, and just like that bike, the N125 has a delightfully nimble, easy-going character without any nervousness. Bajaj let us experience this on a go-kart track, and the N125 was genuinely good fun, displaying an eagerness to change direction and lean over. The footpeg placement enabled plenty of cornering clearance without any scraping, and the bike never displayed any fidgety moments you might expect with a very light machine. The MRF tyres were nice and grippy in this situation as well, and the only thing I’d have liked was a bit more initial sharpness in the front brake. Bajaj Pulsar N125 engine refinement, mileage Nevertheless, the N125’s dynamics will translate into an enjoyable experience on densely packed city roads. Going nicely with this is a very light clutch effort, which they say is 50 percent less than the competition. With 12hp, the new engine is the most powerful in the segment alongside the NS125, but this bike has a much better power-to-weight ratio of nearly 100hp/tonne. More importantly, the engine is smooth and tractable, and it makes a nice sound as well. While the strong acceleration only arrives at quite high revs, the engine can also pull you along in third gear (out of 5) as low as 20kph, which is crucial in a city bike like this.  Refinement is excellent, but I noticed that the motor would stall if the revs got too low without any of the typical warning signs (like a juddering sound or feel) that come when an engine’s revs get too low. This isn’t really an issue on its own, but the problem arises in that the N125 doesn’t have a gear position indicator or even a rev counter. With its tractable nature, you will often find yourself riding around at rather low revs in heavy traffic, and that’s when these stalls can catch you out, so it’s something you’ll need to learn to work around. Bajaj claims a 0-60kph time of 6 seconds and a top speed of 97kph, although you’ll see over 110kph on the display. The bike hits about 80kph quickly, and overall performance feels up to the mark of the best in the segment. The company also claims an overall fuel efficiency of about 60kpl. Bajaj Pulsar N125 price, features and verdict One of the big success factors with bikes like the Raider and Xtreme 125R is that they offer the looks and feature set of bigger 150-200cc machines. When it comes to the latter, the Pulsar N125 isn’t quite up there with its rivals. On the one hand, it has a front disc brake and LED head/tail lamps as standard, while the top model gets Bluetooth connectivity and a silent start/start-stop system. But then it misses important things like a rev counter, gear position indicator or single-channel ABS – although Bajaj says it will introduce the latter if there’s demand. While the Pulsar N125 probably won’t sway buyers with segment-leading features, it has most of the essential fundamentals in place, the key among them being the price. At Rs 95,000 for the base model and 98,000 for the top model, it is more affordable than a similarly specced Raider and on par with the Hero Xtreme 125R. As of now, we can’t confirm whether it’s the best in its segment, but the new Pulsar N125 definitely has a fighting chance.  Also See: Bajaj Pulsar N125 video review",

    "description": "We regularly wax lyrical about the virtues of the venerable Honda Dominator, and how its rugged simplicity makes it a prime candidate for customization. Many find it charming in stock form too, thanks to its quirky early-2000s adventure bike aesthetic. But not Žiga Petek. The man behind Slovenia’s Gas\u0026Retro workshop ranks metal fabrication as his favorite aspect of custom bike building. So the amount of plastic on the iconic Honda thumper grinds his gears. With a 2002-model Honda NX650 Dominator on his bench, he set out to rid it of its stock body panels and dress it in as much metal as possible. Much to Žiga’s chagrin, the bike still wears a pair of plastic Acerbis fork protectors. A set of handmade guards would have been preferable, but the project’s scant 49-day timeline didn’t leave much wiggle room.…",

    "description": "To say the Kia Carnival was a high-risk, high-reward product would be an understatement as big as the MPV itself. At the time of its launch in February 2020, the brand had only been in India for six months, and though its first product, the Seltos, was a runaway success, Kia was yet to become a household name.  To then launch a premium diesel MPV positioned above the near-untouchable Toyota Innova Crysta, and that too with an investment in local assembly? It sounded crazy. Sure, it sold nowhere near as many units as the rest of Kia’s products (or the Innova), averaging about 3,600 units a year, but it carved a niche for itself deep enough to warrant a sequel. Perhaps not many knew that the 2020 Carnival for India was really a 2014 model globally (Gen 3: YP) that was at the end of its life; in fact, the next model (Gen 4: KA4) was simultaneously going on sale in other markets. But, the YP lived on in India until April 2023, when it succumbed to the BS6 Phase II emissions norms.  New Carnival is a generation-and-a-half leap over its predecessor. However, rather than just launching the KA4 (it was shown at the 2023 Auto Expo) immediately, Kia opted to wait until it got a facelift so India would get the latest model possible and not lag the rest of the world like last time, and that’s the car you see here. 2024 Kia Carnival colours, dimensions, exterior design History lesson over, let’s talk about the new Carnival, whose basic premise hasn’t changed much. It’s still a massive vehicle, at 5,155mm long, 1,995mm wide and 1,775mm tall, with an E-class-like 3,090mm wheelbase, which are gains of just 40mm, 10mm, 20mm and 30mm, respectively, over the previous car.  It carves a silhouette similar to the previous car, even using the exact size of wheels - 18 inches, with a set of chunky tyres. Look closely, and you’ll notice the bonnet is longer, taller and more horizontal, while the front overhang is 20mm shorter and the rear overhang 30mm longer, all of which give it slightly more SUV-like proportions.  Wheel size at 18 inches is exactly the same as the previous Carnival.  Since this design is a facelift of a generation jump, the details are far removed from the previous car and in line with the newest Kias. The ‘Tiger Nose’ grille is wide, and hovering above it are LED strips that join the tall, slim headlamps pushed out to the very sides of the nose. Lighting is via prominent ‘ice cube’ LED projector elements stacked vertically, and even the fog lamps at the base of the bumper look similar. Spot the radar element in the centre of the air dam. To break the monotony of the slabby sides is a vertical dappled brushed silver trim piece, as well as a black element between the doors. Sadly, the exposed rail over the rear wheel arch for the sliding rear door returns and is an eyesore, as is the huge gap under the floor (for the same purpose), which you’ll see when you open the door.  Horizontal strip connecting the tail lamps help accentuate the width of the MPV.  The rear, similar to the front, adopts slim vertical LEDs joined by a thin horizontal strip, highlighting the added width, while a brushed metal trim element in the bumper adds some character. The rear wiper, meanwhile, is hidden under the spoiler when not in use.  Incidentally, the powered tailgate opening is wider than before, giving even better access to the mammoth 627-litre boot – that’s with all the seats in place, by the way, thanks to a deep underfloor storage as before, and Kia says it will hold four large suitcases. Fold everything down, and you’re looking at 2,900 litres of space.  Deep underfloor helps free up some additional storage in the boot.  The 2024 Kia Carnival is available in just two colours - Fusion Black and Glacier White Pearl - as that, the brand says, made up the bulk of the previous car’s sales. A small hint at the target demographic, if you will. 2024 Kia Carnival interior space and comfort Where the previous model offered 7-, 8-, or 9-seat configurations, the new Kia Carnival only comes in top-spec Limousine+ spec, with seven seats in a 2-2-3 layout. This was by far the most popular layout in the previous model, owing to buyers primarily purchasing it for second-row use.  The pair of vast captain’s chairs slide back and forth manually, requiring some muscle to move their bulk; that’s easier done once seated. They also slide left to right, but this is actually a functional requirement rather than a cool gimmick, as it might seem. With seats in their outermost position, you have ‘access mode’, placing them closer to the doors but also creating a gap between them to access the third row – the only access available. However, in this mode, their fore-and-aft movement is limited, so to access their full potential, they have to be pushed inward to the centre. Middle row captain chairs slide back and forth as well as left to right.  With this done, you can slide it a few inches further back and a few more still if you fold the third row away. And having them in the centre means they don’t foul with the third-row armrests, so you can fully recline the backrest and extend the ottoman with sufficient space to stretch out. For still more space, there’s a ‘boss mode’ to move the front passenger seat forward.  There’s even some height adjustment on the second row, and you can vary the seat base angle to an almost comical level. These functions, along with the recline and ottoman, are now powered, but the controls are oddly located on the inner side of the squabs, making them difficult to reach when the seats are pushed together. There's lots of adjustability for the second-row, including a powered ottoman. In terms of creature comforts, the second row once again gets its own separate sunroof; the seats are heated and ventilated; there are manual window shades; and there’s a pair of USB-C chargers, unusually located in the seat backs of the first row. The cup holders, too, are between the front seats, so if you have the second row slid back, you won’t be able to reach them.  There is a third climate zone for the second and third rows, but the AC controls are once again oddly located on the right side of the roof, above the driver’s seat, and you only get four small roof-mounted AC vents. That said, cooling didn’t seem to be a problem during our drive. The third row is a three-seat bench, which feels tight for three adults but just right for two, though the placement of the seat belts might restrict you. The headroom is decent; you can recline the backrest, and with the sheer range of fore and aft sliding for the second row, legroom can be either too little or a whole lot. So, as long as the middle seats are kept upright, there can be sufficient space for all. Third-row is a three-seat bench, but best only for two adults The front seats are big and comfortable, though a little firm in the upper back area. They’re ventilated and heated, with 12-way power adjustment and memory function for the driver. 2024 Kia Carnival features and safety Much like with the exterior, the cabin design and layout feel like the biggest leap forward for the Carnival. While the previous one was well-built, decently kitted out and practical, its look was decidedly last-generation. This one elevates things in every area, with the same futuristic design as all modern Kias. Dashboard is in line with latest Kias and material quality is really good. There’s a clean and horizontal layout to the dash, accentuated by the strip of ambient lighting on the passenger side and the slim AC vents in the centre. Below these, you’ll find a context-sensitive touch panel that switches between HVAC and audio controls, which looks cool but is frustrating to use in a hurry.  Further down is a wide central console that really highlights the space between driver and passenger, and it’s put to good use with a big storage bin, wireless charging tray, USB-C ports and large cup holders. The gear lever has made way for a crystalline rotary selector that looks and feels upmarket. Switchable HVAC and audio controls are frustrating to use in a hurry. In fact, that sensation is only enhanced by excellent material quality all around and generous use of soft-touch materials, typical of a modern Kia. A particularly high-quality touch is the row of metallic toggle switches for seat heating and ventilation and a few other functions. The twin 12.3-inch curved screen array feels bang up to date with its free-standing and hood-free design, and the graphics especially make it look techy and state-of-the-art. Touch sensitivity and smoothness aren’t up there with the best in the industry and are about the same as you’ll find in a Seltos; some might expect more at this price.  12.3-inch touchscreen looks slick and techy, and packs in a lot of functionality. The 12-speaker Bose audio system fills up the large cabin nicely, while other feature highlights include ADAS with Level 2 autonomous capability, eight airbags, a heads-up display, and powered, sliding rear doors that can be operated from the handle, the driver’s seat or even the key fob. 2024 Kia Carnival mileage, ride comfort and driving impressions The changes to the mechanical makeup might seem nonexistent at first glance, but there are a few important ones. For instance, the engine might still be a 2.2-litre diesel, but it’s an all-new unit that, crucially, moves from a cast-iron block to an aluminium one. The steering, meanwhile, uses electronic power assistance rather than hydraulic, which is another big difference. 2.2-litre diesel engine now uses an aluminium block instead of a cast-iron block. Power and torque are actually lower, at 193hp and 441Nm, and while Kia didn’t quote a figure, the kerb weight will no doubt have gone up. It doesn’t appear to have affected the driving character too much, though, and the Carnival’s powertrain remains unhurried but ample; Kia quotes a 0-100kph time of 10.7 seconds.  The 8-speed torque-converter automatic, too, isn’t the most eager, and that’s just as well in a big MPV, but its reluctance to kick down a gear quickly for an overtake can be annoying when you need it in a hurry. There’s a sport mode and paddle shifters, too, but you’ll seldom find yourself using them. While the obvious benefit of the aluminium diesel engine is weight reduction, the unfortunate side effect is greater engine noise. And though not loud and clattery like that of an Innova Crysta, it is something a premium vehicle at this price point should do without. New Carnival's performance is unhurried but ample. Kia has admirably stuck to its big diesel powerplant at a time when many are switching to petrol or hybrid, and apart from strong pulling power on the highway, its other advantage in a big car is fuel economy. The Kia Carnival’s fuel economy is rated at 14.85kpl by ARAI, but even in our day of hectic driving and shooting, we managed a respectable 10.9kpl. Ride comfort is also important in a chauffeur-driven car like this, and the new Carnival largely delivers. It was a wise choice to stick to the same size of wheels and their chunky 235/60 R18 tyres, as they do provide a degree of cushioning to the ride. Overall, though, it offers a solid and stable ride at high speed, with some harshness over larger bumps. Ride quality is solid and stable, with some harshness over larger bumps. The new electric power steering (EPS) makes this big MPV very easy to manoeuvre at low speeds, and even when making lane changes on the highway, it gives a degree of confidence to the driver. That said, the previous hydraulic unit wasn’t noticeably heavy or cumbersome, particularly compared to that of an Innova Crysta. 2024 Kia Carnival price and verdict With the generation-and-a-half leap that the Kia Carnival has taken, the advances over its predecessor are clear to see. It’s most evident in the features and tech, which now feel contemporary and right up there with the best. The updated look, which is modern and even a bit rugged, also adds to the appeal.  For all the updates, however, the basic proposition remains the same: that of a luxurious MPV that pampers the chauffeur-driven owner in the middle row with vast space and the ability to stretch out while also providing space for three more in the back and lots of luggage. As such, then, its price of Rs 63.9 lakh (ex-showroom), a jump of Rs 20 lakh (it is locally assembled as before), feels excessive. The fact is that MPVs are gaining better acceptance as desirable luxury transport; Kia, as a brand, has grown in stature, and buyers are willing to spend more. And Kia has chosen to make the most of it. There’s a gap between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 1 crore (bookended by two very capable hybrid Toyotas), and while the old Carnival was positioned at the lower end of this space, it’s now moved up to the middle.   Carnival delivers in spades as a chauffeur-driven vehicle, but the price hike feels excessive. On paper, the updates might not seem to justify it, but the truth is people are willing to spend for the premium chauffeur-driven experience, as evidenced by the 3,000-plus bookings the new Carnival has received since launch, despite its price. And when it comes to delivering that experience, there’s no doubt the new Carnival has got the goods. Also See: New Kia Carnival video review",

    "description": "Hyundai Motor India (HMIL), which came out with the country’s largest initial public offering (IPO) of Rs 27,870 crore, debuted on the stock exchanges on Tuesday, listing at Rs 1,934 on the NSE. That’s 1.3 percent lower than the issue price of Rs 1,960. Hyundai diluted a 17.5 percent stake in its wholly-owned India unit It was the first IPO by a carmaker in India in over two decades The company raised around Rs 27,870 crore through the issue The share sale, which was open from October 15 to October 17, saw tepid investor interest in the first two days, but strong demand from qualified institutional buyers on the final day ensured its successful completion; it was subscribed 2.37 times. The IPO by India’s second-largest carmaker surpassed Life Insurance Corporation’s Rs 21,000-crore offering two years ago. It was also the first IPO by a carmaker in India in the two decades since Maruti Suzuki’s listing in 2003. “Today’s listing shows that HMIL is a key part of India. It demonstrates our commitment to this great nation and ensures that our shareholders and HMIL will continue to grow together,” said Hyundai Motor Group executive chair Euisun Chung while speaking at the listing ceremony. HMIL’s IPO was a pure offer for sale. None of the proceeds of the issue will come to the Indian unit. The South Korean parent company, Hyundai Motor Company, diluted a 17.5 percent stake in its wholly-owned India unit. The automaker raised Rs 8,315.28 crore from 225 anchor investors last week. It finalised the allocation of 4.2 crore equity shares to anchor investors for Rs 1,960 per share. India is the third-largest market for the South Korean company, accounting for around 14 percent of its global sales. Kotak Mahindra, Citi Group, HSBC Securities, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are the lead book-running managers for the IPO.

    "description": "Triumph has revealed the new Tiger Sport 800, which replaces the Tiger 850 Sport in the line-up. A new 798cc, 3-cylinder engine powers the Tiger Sport 800, rated at 115hp and 84Nm of torque, making it more powerful than even the updated Tiger 900 GT. Cruise control, bidirectional quickshifter are standard Three riding modes – Sport, Road and Rain Weighs 214kg, has an 18.6-litre fuel tank Triumph has reinvented its middleweight Tiger Sport model to become even more road-focused with this new 800. This bike rolls on 17-inch wheels at both ends, unlike the 19/17-inch wheels on the 850 Sport. These are shod with sticky sport-touring Michelin Road 5 tyres size 120/70-ZR17 (front) and 180/55-ZR17 (rear). The styling and tyre sizes here are very much in line with the smaller Tiger Sport 660. A 41mm USD fork and monoshock, both supplied by Showa, suspend the perimeter frame of the Tiger Sport 800. The fork can be adjusted for compression and preload, while the monoshock can be tuned for rebound and preload, with a convenient remote adjuster available for the latter.  Braking is handled by Triumph-branded, radially mounted 4-piston calipers mated to 310mm discs at the front and a single piston caliper mated to a 255mm disc at the rear. With its large 18.6-litre tank fully brimmed, the Tiger Sport 800 weighs 214kg, which should give it a decent range on a full tank.  The Tiger Sport 800 isn’t brimming with electronic rider aids, but it's got the basics covered. Three riding modes – Sport, Road, and Rain – are available, along with cruise control, a bidirectional quickshifter, traction control, and dual-channel ABS. The riding aids benefit from the presence of a six-axis IMU, for more precise and lenient intervention. All these functions on the Tiger Sport 800 are controlled via the same display as the Daytona 660 and Tiger Sport 660.    Accessories like a centre stand and colour-matched panniers are available straight from Triumph’s accessory catalogue. Four colours are offered on the Tiger Sport 800 – yellow, blue, black and grey – and the bike will be available internationally March 2025 onwards. An India launch sometime next year or in 2026 is expected, and competitors to the Tiger Sport 800 are the BMW F 900 XR, Ducati Multistrada V2 and the upcoming Kawasaki Versys 1100. The Tiger 850 Sport was priced at Rs 11.95 lakh (ex-showroom, India), so expect the new 800 to find itself in that ballpark upon launch.  Also See: Triumph Speed Twin 900 updated for 2025 Triumph Trident 660 gets more electronics, new colours for 2025",
