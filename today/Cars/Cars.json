    "description": "Need a genuine four-seater, £170,000 luxury convertible for the school run? Maserati has you covered The Maserati GranCabrio is one of the last remaining examples of the four-seat luxury convertible: one of those concepts that’s probably more appealing on paper - or in some romantic, coming-of-age road trip movie, perhaps - than in the real world.It takes about ten seconds travelling in the back of one to appreciate why. There’s seldom an abundance of space; and there’s so much wind buffeting and fluttering that you can’t really hear any conversation - or even succeed in wearing a hat for very long. Imagine travelling eight miles to visit inlaws, or for a weekend away, exclusively via a particularly draughty rollercoaster and you’ll begin to get the idea.Most luxury car manufacturers - the likes of Bentley, BMW and Mercedes-Benz - have come to tacitly admit as much by declining to offer big, four-seat convertibles anymore. Their flagship open-top cars are now almost exclusively ‘2+2’ models in which the back seats are pretty clearly there for short hops and ‘emergencies’ only.But the second-generation Maserati GranCabrio - which entered production earlier in 2024, and is now in the UK in right-hand drive form - is the exception. This is the one luxury cabriolet operator that targets genuine four-seat usability. And you don’t have to drive it everywhere with the roof down, of course; there’s a lovely motorised cloth hood to keep the wind out, when you want to.It’s available in either Trofeo (V6 ICE) or Folgore (three-motor electric) forms, and our review is opening with impressions of the former.",

    "description": "Audi’s chic supermini promises class-leading luxury and sportiness - but is it past its prime? The second-generation Audi A1 promised to introduce hitherto unseen levels of luxuriousness and sportiness to the supermini class when it launched in 2019, in spite of its more mundane, Volkswagen-based origins and underpinnings.Ingolstadt has a long history with gentrified superminis like this. What started with the Audi 50 in 1974, followed by the innovative-yet-expensive A2, then the first-generation A1 in 2010, has now become the brand's showcase for technology and quality at the bottom rung of the fiscal ladder.Indeed, this car vows to continue the trend started by its forebears, promising to set new benchmarks for perceived quality, powertrain refinement and general desirability via a completely overhauled interior, striking exterior design touches from more rarefied Audi models, a range of efficiency-focused turbocharged engines and a competitive starting price.Audi hopes this will be enough to fend off talented - and, in many cases, much newer - competition from the likes of the Mini Cooper C, Fiat 500, Skoda Fabia, and Renault Clio.How, then, does it fare in the autumn of its production run, and, even in this ever-shrinking class, has it overstayed its welcome?Audi A1 range at a glanceAudi offers the A1 in a choice of three trim levels: Sport, S Line and Black Edition. S Line and Black Edition cars typically introduce differing cosmetic tweaks over Sport cars, including larger alloy wheels, various 'S' and ‘S-Line’ badges dotted around inside and out, redesigned bumpers, and, in the case of the Black Edition, darkened trim pieces. Entry-level '25 TFSI' cars come with a 1.0-litre turbocharged triple with 69bhp, which is mated to either a five-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. One level up from this is '30 TFSI', which features the same engine tuned to 114bhp and comes with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch auto. Top-rung '35 TFSI’ cars, meanwhile, get a 1.5-litre turbocharged 'evo' four-pot, which can only be had with the seven-speed DSG. All engines are, of course, sourced from the VW Group, and no diesel powerplants are available.All cars sit on passive suspension which is both lowered and stiffened if you choose a car in S-Line-trim. Each model gets torsion beam rear suspension just like every other car on Volkswagen's MQB-A0 platform; none offers four-wheel drive. The 1498cc four-pot turbo is the only engine in the range with cylinder deactivation technology, wherein it can shut down two of its cylinders to save fuel.",

    "description": "The debate about what is considered art — and what is not considered art — has filled volumes, spawned entire branches of philosophy and has been the subject of more late-night drunken arguments than anyone can recall. It gets even murkier when delving into the world of technical drawing. Is a blueprint or schematic a piece of art? Should I be in awe of the wiring diagram in the back of my Clymer manual when I am trying to diagnose why one of my spark plugs isn’t firing? Yet there have been individuals throughout history whose ability to convey technical information transcends the utilitarian into the world of fine art. David Kimble is one such modern master, perhaps the last of his kind creating highly detailed cutaway illustrations by hand with acetate, airbrush, paint, and time.…",

    "description": "The Renault Kiger CVT has been my ride to work for a year. It replaced the Kiger Turbo MT in our fleet, which I used in the last few months of its tenure with us. Of the two, I enjoyed the CVT more, thanks to its relative effortlessness. The long-term cars that I take home are mostly hatchbacks due to tight parking spots in my locality, and the Kiger, with its sub-four-metre footprint, is one of the few SUVs I can manage. I love the high seating position and its commanding view, which makes it easy to get used to very quickly, especially if you are upgrading from a sedan or a hatchback. This also means you’re less prone to direct eye contact with the bright and misaligned LED headlamps found on many two wheelers, which can be very annoying. Front seats are comfortable for long periods of driving. For a compact SUV, its cabin is very spacious and I have had five full-size adults in the car without any hassle. There have been many airport trips and multiple intra-city drives with five passengers and I have never heard any complaints about space. I loved the three-spoke steering wheel with its backlit controls, but there was some noise coming from the steering rod in the last few days, especially when turning the wheel to more than one lock.  The 1.0-litre turbo engine with the CVT is well suited to city use, which is where our long term Kiger munched most of its kilometres. The pedals are positioned well and unlike the manual, the CVT version gets a proper dead pedal, which is a blessing on longer drives. The trip meter resets itself randomly. The digital driver’s display changes with the drive modes, and strangely, you don’t get a tachometer in Normal mode, which is the one best suited to the city. Sport mode adds the tachometer (and better responses) but the fuel economy drops quite a bit. I tried the Eco mode a few times, but it’s not something I would recommend, unless you are on a really tight fuel budget. In this mode, the engine response is horribly weak and I found the car almost undriveable. The CVT gearbox does not get any manual shifting option (it has no ‘gears’ to begin with), but all you need is just a slight tap on the accelerator to bring it into the torque band for a quick overtake. What I did not like much is the engine noise intruding in the cabin. It sounded sporty initially, but it has since gotten annoying. Swallowed four medium suitcases easily. What I also liked about the Kiger are its unique looks. You still don’t see too many of these on the road, but when you do, they are unmistakable. The wide nose with sharp-looking LED headlamps make the Kiger look much more expensive than it actually is. Many people ask me about it’s price and are stunned to learn it’s cheaper than most other mainstream rivals.  The low-placed headlamps have an excellent throw and light up corners well. The Kiger’s AC performed well, especially during the heatwave earlier this year. The cabin does take a tad longer to cool at first, but it maintains the temperature throughout your commute. The Kiger’s infotainment system did, however, give us an overheat warning quite a few times. That said, it connects swiftly and seamlessly with wireless Android Auto. Handbrake located next to the front passenger instead of the driver. Much like its sister car, the Nissan Magnite, which recently got a facelift, the Kiger is due for one soon. After driving the SUV for a considerable amount of time, here are my suggestions for the update. First up, Renault should add a sunroof, atleast on the higher variants. While not a necessity, it’s an important feel-good feature, going by current market trends. The interior upholstery or trim pieces could be lighter to brighten up the cabin, much like what was done with the Magnite. The much-loved CVT experience can be enhanced by addition of paddle shifters, at least for the higher variants. Lastly, Renault could also add cooled seats on the Kiger. In its time with me, I had passengers of all age groups, both family and friends, who experienced the Kiger, and they all had good things to say. My experience with the SUV has been good, too, and it’s a car that I would surely recommend for a buyer who wants a comfortable and spacious city commuter.  Also see: Renault Kiger long term review, 11,500km report New Renault Duster spied in India for the first time Renault Kiger, Triber, Kwid Night and Day editions launched",

    "description": "The Indian monsoon is nothing to be trifled with when it comes to waterproof gear, so a little before its onset this year, I purchased the Viaterra P300 waterproof liner. I’ve used enough Viaterra products by now to know that they work as intended, which is why I splurged on the P300. There are more affordable rain liners from Viaterra if you’re on a tight budget. Wearing a rain liner over an armoured riding jacket is cumbersome – there’s no two ways about it. But the P300 eases things to quite an extent. For example, the cuffs are nice and wide, enough so that even if I’m wearing my Grid full-gauntlet gloves, my hand can also slip through without a second thought. Then, there is the inner mesh lining, which helps with comfort as it lets the P300 slide over your jacket instead of bunching up in areas. It also makes the rain jacket easier to get on and off. But by far, the most helpful feature is the zipped vents on the front of the jacket. I’ve found that even in the heaviest of downpours, it’s best for my comfort to keep them fully open, and since there is a Velcro closure that keeps the top and bottom of the zip closed, there’s no water ingress at all. Vents allow good airflow, and the zipper is easy to use. In fact, I remember using this exact trick when I was efficiency-testing the Bajaj Freedom CNG bike at slow-moving Mumbai city speeds for nearly three hours with the P300 on in the pouring rain, and I remember being pleasantly surprised by the airflow that was allowed through to me. This is what makes it worth the extra money for me. My only gripe is that this jacket is slightly shorter at the front, which Viaterra has done to prevent the jacket from bunching and pooling water. On the one hand, Rishaad liked this feature in his P300, but I found that the bottom two inches of my riding jacket got wet in continuous heavy rain. Perhaps the next iteration can have a slight increase in the length. Another point is that the hood is removable, which is a great feature, but it would be nice if there was a pocket or some provision in the jacket to store it. At Rs 2,499, the Viaterra P300 is the most expensive of the made-in-India rain liners, but after staying dry as well as reasonably cool for this past monsoon, I can confidently say it’s well worth the investment.

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "Lamborghini is well underway with the development of a fully electric vehicle. However, the Italian marque isn’t concerned with the recent global slowdown in the EV demand and, on the contrary, sees it as an advantage. Speaking to the media and in response to a question from Autocar India, Lamborghini’s chief technical officer, Rouven Mohr, said, “It (EV slowdown) is working to our advantage and fitting perfectly to our strategy; customers are now asking for hybrids instead of electrics, and when the demand for full EVs comes, we will have our car ready.”  Indeed, with the introduction of the Revuelto, Urus SE and Temerario, Lamborghini has completely electrified (hybridised) its line-up, and its fully electric car is only due by late 2028 or early 2029. Furthermore, Mohr added that the company is being careful and not rushing to replace an existing model with an EV equivalent or even replace the powerplant with only an electric powertrain.  Lambo CTO Rouven Mohr   Hybridisation aids in handling, too Lamborghini has maintained that hybridisation has really helped elevate the driving experience, with the benefits of added power and also the instant torque boost or torque fill that electric motors provide, thus filling in nicely during an internal combustion engine’s dips in power. Mohr said there are benefits beyond these as well and cites the Revuelto as an example. “If you examine it, you will see that the two front motors are often called to duty to not just fill in power but as much for torque vectoring.” Given that an electric motor’s intervention can be far quicker and a lot more natural than a brake intervention, torque vectoring can enable sharper handling, as we experienced in our review of the car in December last year.  Mohr is also not concerned with battery material sourcing issues. “Given our small volumes and smaller material requirements with hybrids, the issue of battery materials isn’t as much of a problem for us,” he remarked. Thus, going ahead, the company is firmly focused on the hybrid route. “We want to continue with our hybridisation plans,” said Mohr.

    "description": "Goa Aces JA Racing clinched the 2024 Indian Racing League title with a 1-2 finish at the finale held at the Kari Motor Speedway. The team also secured the cars’ title, with Raoul Hyman and Sohil Shah taking top honours. Round 5 also saw Hyderabad Blackbirds’ Aqil Alibhai crowned as this year’s Indian F4 Champion. Raoul Hyman, Sohil Shah win Indian Racing League cars’ title Tijil Rao crowned LGB F4 champion Navaneeth Kumar wins Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup title Indian Racing League winner: Goa Aces JA Racing Goa Aces JA Racing’s title bid received a massive boost on Saturday after Sohil Shah secured the hat-trick – bagging pole position, the race win and the fastest lap. This handed the John Abraham-owned team the overall championship lead, with Shrachi Rarh Royal Bengal Tigers just two points behind with one last race to go. However, Shrachi Rarh Royal Bengal Tigers’ hopes were dashed early on when Ruhaan Alva lost the rear of his car and slid across the track into Akash Gowda. The Safety Car made a brief appearance before racing resumed, and Goa Aces JA Racing’s Raoul Hyman cruised to victory ahead of his teammate Gabriela Jilkova. Results Race 1 1.

Mohamed Ryan (Chennai Turbo Riders) – 27mins 29.813secs Indian F4 Championship winner: Aqil Alibhai South African racer Aqil Alibhai had always been a favourite for the Indian F4 title this year, and he further cemented this after securing his sixth win of the season on Saturday. His nearest rival, Ruhaan Alva, put on a tough fight and won both races on Sunday. But that wasn’t enough to prevent Alibhai from clinching the title. “I wanted to finish the season with a win, but it was not to be. But I have had a good season, and I am very happy to win the championship. Going forward, let’s see where this success takes me,” said Alibhai. Results Race 1 1.

Saran Vikram Mars bagged two surprise wins on Sunday, but given the mammoth lead he had in the standings, Rao decided to play it safe and avoid any unnecessary risks. After finishing second in last year’s championship, Rao was determined to win the title this year. “The main thing was working on my fitness and it has made a huge difference. But then, I am very happy with my overall season performance, after putting in seven years in racing,” he said. Navaneeth Kumar took home the Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup title after winning two races in the finale. “I think the main difference has been working on my fitness. That has made the biggest difference,” he said. Both Anish Shetty and Rohan R were tied for second place, at 36 points each. However, Rohan R triumphed since he had won two races this season, compared to Shetty’s one win. Results LGB F4 Race 1 1. Tijil Rao (Dark Don Racing) – 22mins 02.750secs 2.

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",
