    "description": "This 1974 Lamborghini Espada is one of 472 Series III examples built between 1972 and 1978, approximately 55 of which came equipped from the factory with a Chrysler TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission. The car is said to have been initially delivered to California and later spent time in Texas before being exported to Kuwait in the mid-2000s, where it reportedly remained under the care of the country's then Prime Minister through 2022, when it was brought back to the US. Finished in burgundy over tan leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 3.9-liter quad-cam V12 equipped with six Weber carburetors. Additional equipment includes 15\" Campagnolo magnesium wheels, a sunroof, a quad-exit exhaust system, power windows, air conditioning, and a Kenwood cassette player. The current owner acquired the car in 2022 and service performed since then is said to have involved overhauling the carburetors as well as replacing the fuel pump, fuel filter, and battery, though the car has a cylinder head gasket leak and requires additional service before being driven. This S3 Espada is being offered as a running project in California with manufacturer's literature and a clean Florida title.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/next-nissan-leaf-be-launched-vehicle-grid-charging-uk",
    "description": "Leaf, Qashqai and Juke successors will arrive from 2026 with a system that could help cut costs The electric successor to the Nissan Leaf will feature bi-directional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging available for use by UK customers when it is launched in 2026. Nissan says it is the first car firm to both develop a “breakthrough” on-board two-way charging system and secure the certification needed to offer the vehicle-to-grid charging service – in which energy stored in a car’s battery can be sold back to the grid – in the UK. The service will be offered on “selected electric vehicles” and use a special wallbox that has been developed in partnership with Belgian charger manufacturer Dreev to be capable of accepting electricity in two directions. Hugues Desmarchelier, Nissan’s global electrification ecosystem chief, described the technology as a “potential game-changer for how we view the car” and said the technology would feature on “almost all the new EVs that we will launch on the market after 2026”.  This means the system will be offered on the three new EVs that will serve as successors to the current Qashqai, Juke and Leaf and are set to be built as Nissan’s Sunderland plant – but not the EV successor to the Micra, which will be built by Alliance partner Renault alongside the new 5. The Renault 5 is capable of bi-directional charging but will run on a different system, which Desmarchelier hinted would be offered on the next-gen Micra.  V2G effectively allows cars to become energy storage devices when plugged into the grid, so they could be charged at times when renewable energy is prevalent and demand is low, and then at times of peak demand the electricity in them could be sold back to the grid. That is beneficial to the grid infrastructure, and Nissan estimates it could reduce annual charging costs by up to 50% – while also reducing the CO2 emissions produced by charging by 30%. According to Nissan, the new bi-directional wallbox required to feed electricity back to the grid will cost around the same as a current standard mono-directional unit. EV motors run on DC electricity, while grid electricity runs on AC. To cope with that, EVs now feature on-board converters that switch the electricity fed into a vehicle when charging from AC to DC so that it can be used to power the motor.  Nissan’s system effectively allows the car’s on-board system to reverse that process, so that it can turn stored DC energy back into AC, allowing it to be fed back to the grid through a specially developed wallbox. The new system builds on 40 V2G trial projects that Nissan has run with specially converted Leaf and Ariya EVs in multiple countries in recent years. The new wallbox and on-board unit has been tested on a specially modified Ariya in a trial using the University of Nottingham’s Creative Energy Homes project. V2G charging has been cited by the government as being key to managing future energy demand and usage in the UK, and Nissan’s announcement has been welcomed by Lilian Greenwood, the  minister for the future of roads. She said: “A greener transport network is a key priority for this government, and by working together we will boost consumer confidence and achieve our shared goal of getting more EVs on the road.” The UK will be the first country that the service will be offered in, but Nissan is aiming to expand it to other markets afterwards. The V2G service feeds into Nissan’s wider plan to achieve or exceed cost parity between EVs and combustion-engined cars by 2030, and in its goal to become fully carbon neutral by 2050.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advertising-promotions-promoted-by-audi-e-tron/audi-q6-e-tron-road-trip-exploring-electric",
    "description": "We get behind the wheel of Audi’s all-electric SUV in Germany to see how Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik ethos is shaping its electric future If you’re looking to head off on a journey of discovery to explore how Audi e-tron is changing the game for electric design, then Ingolstadt is the perfect place from which to start – and the Audi Q6 e-tron is the perfect all-electric car in which to do it. After all, the scenic city of Ingolstadt, located in the heart of Bavaria, has been Audi’s HQ since 1969, and the backdrop for many of its iconic moments of ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ progress through technology. Now, for the first time, the Ingolstadt facility is responsible for manufacturing an all-electric Audi: the new Audi Q6 e-tron. Equally, the Audi Q6 e-tron itself is a game-changer for Audi: the apex of all Audi’s impressive e-tron innovation to date, and an electrifying taste of what’s next.  Using an advanced new platform with more efficient powertrain technology that offers more range – up to 381 miles (WLTP)[1] on the Audi Q6 e-tron SUV quattro we’ll be driving – it’s also smarter and more connected than any Audi e-tron model before it, introducing a plush high-tech interior and advanced animated LED lights. So, we’ve got the two essential elements for our journey. It’s time to get behind the wheel and find out where Audi e-tron has come from, and how the Audi Q6 e-tron is shaping Audi’s all-electric future. Watch the film below or read on to find out more. Learn more about the Audi Q6 e-tron An illuminating start Our journey begins just before dawn, on the city street outside our hotel. This is a chance to experience the first of many elements that make this new Audi Q6 e-tron a beacon for future electric design. In this case, quite literally.  Audi has led the way in advanced headlight design and engineering for decades, and the Audi Q6 e-tron takes that to the next level, using second-generation OLED technology on the front and rear lights to shape active digital light signatures that both amplify the Audi Q6 e-tron’s character and enhance its safety. Up front, the Audi Q6 e-tron’s slim Matrix LED headlights[2] boast 12 segments to offer enhanced forward visibility, while the high-mounted daytime running lights boast 61 LED segments. At the rear, the Audi Q6 e-tron’s full-width OLED light strip contains a 360 individual segments. These can generate high-contrast 3D-feeling shapes and complex animations that can update as fast as 10 milliseconds.[3]  Working together, the Audi Q6 e-tron’s front and rear lights let you explore your characterful side, giving you a choice of up to eight expressive dynamic light signature animations that give you a personalised welcome greeting from your car. It adds a wonderful moment of delight to the start of every drive. On the road, the capability of the rear LED lights to craft more complex shapes can significantly enhance both your safety and that of your fellow road users – alerting other drivers to upcoming hazards or informing passing cyclists if you’re about to open your door by displaying dynamic warning symbols. Dropping our luggage in the capacious 526-litre rear, we don’t even need to consider folding down the 40:20:40 split-rear seats to open up the full 1,529 litres of luggage space or think about using the additional 64 litres of space in the front trunk. Instead, we can just open the front doors of the Audi Q6 SUV e-tron, admire the welcoming glow of the puddle light, and get set to head to the first destination of our journey. A standout first impression It’s just a short drive to the Audi Forum on the outskirts of Ingolstadt, which is home to the Audi Museum. Spurred on by seeing some of Audi’s iconic road, race and rally cars, we head back out to the Audi Q6 e-tron to reflect on how its form has been shaped by over 50 years of Vorsprung durch Technik design.  At the front, the Audi Q6 e-tron’s slim high-mounted LED daytime running lights and its inverted all-electric interpretation of Audi’s iconic single-frame grille sit on top of a bold black frame that hides the compact but powerful Matrix LED headlights. Large aerodynamic vents hint towards Audi’s race and rally heritage, but are more aimed at smoothing the path of air over the Audi Q6 e-tron for enhance efficiency and range. From the side, the Audi Q6 e-tron’s short overhangs, long wheelbase and long bonnet work with the set-back cabin to give it an impressively low-slung sporty stance. After our morning spent touring some of Audi’s iconic cars from the last 50 years, you can also start to see how the Audi Q6 e-tron’s design reinforces Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik philosophy of ‘making technology visible, and reference’s the brand’s performance-inspired heritage and DNA. First, the dynamic streamlined curves of the door panels help air flow more efficiently over the Audi Q6 e-tron’s body to further enhance its impressive all-electric range. Just as importantly, they also catch the light and draw your attention to the black ‘rocker’ door-sill inlay that reinforces where the modern heart of this Audi Q6 e-tron lies: it’s advanced all-electric battery.  At the rear, the sharp angular muscular shoulders evoke the ‘quattro’ blisters of Audi’s iconic all-wheel-drive cars, leading the eye round to the continuous edge-to-edge LED rear light strip and large sportscar-inspired diffuser. It all adds up to make the Audi Q6 e-tron feel incredibly sleek and sporty for a mid-size SUV. An interior that’s smart and stylish There’s only so much time we can spend admiring the Audi Q6 e-tron, though, So, it’s time to get back in and really experience what it’s like behind the wheel. This is where the Audi Q6 e-tron really excels, with an interior that’s as smart as it is stylish. The Audi Q6 e-tron’s dashboard is framed around a principle that Audi’s designers have nicknamed the ‘digital stage’. Its bold three-dimensional architecture creates a clear contrast between different elements – both in the materials they’re made of, and how you interact with them. It looks stunning, but also makes real sense. The curved ultra-wide panoramic gloss-black glass of the virtual cockpit and MMI touchscreen arc around you, putting the bold ultra-crisp and clear graphics for driving data, navigation, media and car settings within easy reach of your fingertips. The MMI touchscreen, in particular – with its smart electric-focused e-tron route planner with live traffic and charging data – just begs to be touched, using haptic vibration feedback to give you a clear indication which part of the screen you’ve pressed.  The high-tech screens sit on top of a bar of soft-wrap materials that extends right round the car. It provides a pleasingly warm and homely contrast to the cool glass, adding a fresh new sense of premium feel to this new-style e-tron interior. Finally, wrapping round the windscreen is the most illuminating part of the Audi Q6 e-tron’s digital stage: the dynamic LED light strip.[4] It glows to provide information or alerts: pulsing yellow when you flick the indicator, pulsing red to warn you of traffic in your blind spot, or slowly filling green to show your battery level while charging. As smart as it is connected Underpinning the Audi Q6 e-tron’s digital stage is a connected ecosystem that provides new and different ways for you and your passengers to communicate with your car. As you’d expect, it starts with the MyAudi smartphone app to interact with your car and pre-plan your journey remotely, before syncing it with the smart always-online electric-focused sat-nav in the car.[5] The real innovation in the Audi Q6 e-tron’s interior, though, is the optional passenger display[6], which lets your fellow traveller assist you by finding your next destination, or helping you pick the right tunes for your journey. Using an active privacy mode (which masks the passenger display when the Audi Q6 e-tron is moving) the passenger can even enjoy their own media without distracting the driver. The final smart way to interact with your car is Audi’s intuitive ‘Audi Assistant’ voice control, which is now smarter than ever. It understands up to 800 commands, and can even let you construct highly complex contextual sentences.[5] For example, if you say: “I have cold feet” it will direct the air conditioning. Or, if you say: “Head to Nuremberg, and find a charger on the way” it will plan both elements of the trip.  To make it even easier to ensure your Audi Q6 e-tron is understanding what you’re saying, your words appear on the digital dashboard: essentially letting you see what you speak. So, with the command issued: “Take me to the Audi Charging Hub in Nuremberg” – and with our feet suitably chilled – we head onto the road for the next chapter of the story of how Audi is changing electric. Relaxing to drive in the city Through the city streets of Ingolstadt, the Audi Q6 e-tron is wonderfully silent and relaxing to drive. The optional head-up display4 puts key information directly in your eyeline, stacking and shuffling directions and speed sign recognition so you always know where you are, where you’re going, and what’s coming next.  The headrest-mounted speakers of the Audi Q6 e-tron’s optional Bang \u0026 Olufsen Premium Sound System[4] also play navigation directly to you rather than the whole car, giving you a clearer sense of direction and less distraction for your passengers. The Audi Q6 e-tron’s comprehensive suite of advanced driving aids also include a few new features focused on urban driving – in addition to the adaptive cruise control and lane assist that are so valuable on autobahns and motorways.  Cross Traffic Assist feature spots traffic when pulling out of junctions, while the Rear Cross Traffic Assist warns you of passing cars and pedestrians when reversing out of parking spaces. Equally, the Exit Warning uses the dynamic dashboard-mounted light strip to warn you of passing cars and cyclists when you’re opening your door. Refined on the open autobahn Once out of Ingolstadt, the Audi Q6 e-tron instantly proves capable and refined at autobahn speeds. It’s based on an all-new chassis design called Premium Platform Electric that will underpin the next wave of Audi e-tron models: delivering greater range, faster charging and more agile driving character. At its heart is an advanced 100kWh lithium-ion battery that is more energy dense and more thermally efficient, meaning it’s lighter and more compact while ultimately delivering more range. The Audi Q6 e-tron’s enhanced motors – an asynchronous motor on the front axle, and a permanent-magnet asynchronous motor on the rear axle – are also more compact, lighter and more efficient in terms of power delivery. The result: you can enjoy up to 388PS of confidence-inspiring quattro all-wheel drive power, while still getting up to 381 miles (WLTP)[1] from one charge on our Audi Q6 e-tron SUV quattro. It’s perfect for keeping pace with autobahn traffic, while also giving us more than enough range to reach the next destination on our journey. Fun in the twisty bits Autobahn cruising is all well and good, but it’s time to test another crucial strand of the Audi Q6 e-tron’s core Audi DNA: its driving character. Using the passenger display, we find a twisty road in the heart of the hilly Swabian Alps and head onto the road less travelled. Because the Audi Q6 e-tron’s batteries are mounted low in the chassis and lengthen the wheelbase, it gives the car a confidence-inspiring balance. Enhanced steering delivers more engaging feel, while the Adaptive Air Suspension – which comes as standard on the Audi SQ6 Edition 1 e-tron – offers the perfect customisable balance between taut handling and cosseting comfort. The Audi Q6 e-tron can even lower itself by up to 20mm for a more efficient and slippery profile, or raise the ride height by 28mm if you want to head off-road. Equally, the Audi Q6 e-tron’s regenerative braking – which uses the electric motors to provide up to 220kW of energy-recapturing force in roughly 95% of everyday deceleration – is designed to feel more natural and intuitive. Using the steering wheel paddles, you can pick between two stages of braking force, with near ‘one-pedal’ feel in the most extreme mode. Underpinning it all is Audi’s new all-electric e-tron interpretation of quattro all-wheel drive. It’s biased to focus primarily on rear-wheel drive for a more engaging driving experience and enhanced efficiency, but the front motor cuts in when needed for confidence-inspiring grip when needed. As we glide and flow from corner to corner in near silence, it feels simply effortless. A quick glance at the in-car battery display shows we’ve still got plenty of range left. But there’s another reason why we’ve come to Audi’s home in Germany to see how the Audi Q6 e-tron changes electric driving. It’s all about the charging. A new way to charge As we head into the suburbs of Nuremberg, we pull off at one of the new Audi Charging Hubs which Audi is trialling across Europe. Because Audi hasn’t only thought about how its cars can deliver more range. It’s also re-imagining how quickly – and conveniently – you can top that range up.  First, the Audi Q6 e-tron boasts an advanced 800V electric architecture that offers ultra-rapid charging speeds up to 270kW.[7] On a compatible charger it lets you boost your range by up to 158 miles in as little as 10 minutes or do a more comprehensive top-up from 10 percent to 80 percent in as little as 21 minutes.[8] Part of this is down to how the Audi Q6 e-tron prepares itself for charging. Using sophisticated predictive software that blends its live route-planning and live charging data from the always-online in-car navigation, it can pre-cool or pre-heat the battery so it’s at the optimum temperature to reduce the time needed to charge. All of this is the perfect fit for Audi’s Charging Hubs. Designed to bring ultra-rapid charging to urban areas[9] – meeting the demand of apartment-dwelling electric drivers who don’t have charging at their homes – they can offer charging speeds up to 300kW and capacity for up to 80 cars a day.  Because of their modular design, they can be quickly and easily built to fit their environment. City-centre Audi Charging Hubs can be smaller, letting drivers enjoy the convenience of local cafes and restaurants while charging. In the case of this Audi Charging Hub on the outskirts of Nuremberg, which is located a bit further out in the suburbs, it boasts a first-floor lounge and veranda where you can relax, grab a coffee or a cold drink, plug-in a laptop and use the wi-fi to catch up on your emails.  So, with our Audi Q6 e-tron plugged in, we head upstairs to watch its charging progress in comfort on the large interior screen. It gives us a last chance to reflect on the journey we’ve taken with Audi: both through our time in the Audi Q6 e-tron, and over the last 50 years of Vorsprung durch Technik progress through technology. Blending iconic head-turning style, ultra-efficient powertrains, spine-tingling performance and driving character, and the very latest smart connected tech, if Audi e-tron is the future of electric, bring it on…  Learn more about the Audi Q6 e-tron [1] Range dependent on trim and optional equipment.

    "description": "Renault takes centre stage at the next edition of France's big show – here’s what to look out for The biennial Paris motor show returns on Monday 14 October, and it’s shaping up to have been worth the wait. The show floor will be dominated by the Renault Group, which is revealing no fewer than six new cars. They will range from the next evolution of Alpine’s hydrogen-combustion supercar to Dacia’s Ford Kuga killer and the reborn Renault 4. Stellantis will be out in greater force than in 2022, with Citroën set to unveil the facelifted C4 and an update to the Ami.  The likes of Alfa Romeo, Kia and Mini will also be in Paris, although they’ve yet to announce the extent of their presence. As with the 2022 Paris show, Chinese brands including BYD, GAC and Xpeng will be out in full force too. Welcome to our guide to this year’s Paris show, covering everything new to keep an eye out for. Alfa Romeo Junior Ibrida The hybrid version of Alfa Romeo’s new crossover will make its public debut at the Paris show. Named the Junior Ibrida, it’s fitted with the same 134bhp mild-hybrid powertrain as the related Fiat 600 and Jeep Avenger. Read our Alfa Romeo Junior review Alfa Romeo Tonale Alfa Romeo will unveil the 2025-model-year Tonale at the Paris motor show. The company has yet to detail the changes it has made to the Tonale, but the car is most likely to receive a software upgrade, potentially updating the infotainment system and extracting extra range from the plug-in hybrid powertrain. Read our Alfa Romeo Tonale review Alpine A390 Beta The Alpine A390 Beta concept will provide a tantalising first look at the French brand’s upcoming Porsche Macan Electric rival, an electric SUV with a rakish, coupé-like silhouette. As with the previous A290 Beta and Alpine A290, it’s set to very closely resemble the road-going car, due next year, but could feature a twist such as a novel interior layout or futuristic on-board technologies.  Alpine to unveil electric Porsche Macan rival on 11 October Alpine Alpenglow Hy6 Alpine’s testbed for hydrogen combustion engines will undergo its next evolution at this year’s Paris show. It was first unveiled at the 2022 show and hit the track for the first time earlier this year using a modified Oreca four-cylinder engine, but it’s now making the switch to a bespoke V6. Alpine has prioritising improved efficiency (it reckoned the four-pot could drive 62 miles between fill-ups at racing pace), but it’s likely to boost power beyond the existing unit’s 335bhp too. Alpine's hydrogen V6 hypercar could make production BYD Sea Lion 07 Chinese giant BYD will show the European version of its Sea Lion 07 coupé SUV at Paris. It's expected to sit above the Seal saloon in its line-up, majoring on its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and range figures well above 300 miles. Citroën Ami update “We are going to extend the Ami line-up and do many changes”, Citroën CEO Thierry Koskas recently told Autocar. He wouldn’t be drawn on what those changes would be, but it’s possible that he meant new variants in the vein of the Ami Buggy or technical upgrades to boost its appeal. “We will reveal everything in the Paris motor show,” concluded Koskas. Citroën C4 facelift Asked about the future of the Citroën C4, Koskas replied: “We will update the design; you will have to come to the Paris motor show.” Images of new C4 prototypes spotted testing reveal it will get front and rear lighting signatures inspired by the Citroën Oli concept, and the interior is expected to receive an upgraded infotainment system to boot. Citroën concept Citroën will unveil a concept car “in a major segment”. It’s thought to preview either the next C4 or C5 Aircross, with the latter car set to arrive next year. It will doubtless take inspiration from the Oli concept that the brand revealed two years ago, but could evolve it a step further. Citroen to unveil radical new concept car at Paris motor show Dacia Bigster Dacia has unveiled the Bigster as its largest, most expensive model yet. A rival for the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq and Ford Kuga, it's based on the same underpinnings as the Dacia Duster, albeit stretched to create extra interior space. It'll be making its public debut at the Paris show ahead of its arrival in the UK early next year. Prices are set to start at around £29,000. Dacia Bigster is brand's largest, most expensive model to date Leapmotor B10 Chinese Dacia rival Leapmotor has just landed in the UK with its C10 SUV and T03 city car, which the firm claims to be the best-value EVs in their respective segments. It's already adding to that line-up with the new B10 SUV, which will be revealed at the Paris show. It's expected to be a smaller foil to the C10, rivalling the likes of the Kia EV3 and Volkswagen ID 3. Leapmotor T03 launched as UK’s second-cheapest electric car Mini John Cooper Works Mini's go-faster divison, John Cooper Works, will reveal its first electric cars at the Paris motor show. Details published by the Chinese government reveal that the Aceman crossover and Cooper hatchback have been fitted with a more potent 255bhp motor, which should bring a decent boost in performance for both models. They also get more aggressive-looking styling, with blacked-out grilles, more prominent skirting and bigger alloy wheels. Electric Mini John Cooper Works gets 255bhp motor, sportier styling Mobilize Duo Renault has unwrapped the successor to the Twizy EV. Called the Mobilize Duo, it's a city-focused EV with – in range-topping specification – a top speed of 50mph and a range of 100 miles. Prices will start from around £10,000 when it arrives in the UK next year. Mobilize Duo is reborn Renault Twizy with 100-mile range Peugeot E-3008 Long Range and Peugeot E-5008 Long Range Peugeot will launch Long Range variants of its new e-3008 and new e-5008 at the Paris motor show, with the SUVs offering ranges of 435 miles and 415 miles, respectively.  That's thanks to a new 96.9kWh battery pack – 23.9kWh bigger than the existing 73kWh one, which yields 327 miles of range in the E-3008 and 315 miles in the E-5008. Read our Peugeot E-3008 and E-5008 reviews Peugeot E-408 Peugeot will complete its electric car line-up with the unveiling of the new E-408. It's expected to use the same 54kWh battery and 148bhp motor as the smaller E-308 and could get subtle design tweaks such as a blanked-off front grille. Peugeot E-408 to be unveiled at Paris motor show Renault 4 Having been shown in 4Ever concept form at the previous Paris show, the reborn Renault 4 is now ready to make its debut. The EV is expected to share much of its technical make-up with the smaller Renault 5 but sit higher and wider, in a bid to capture the ever-popular compact crossover market.  Reborn Renault 4 shows off boxy look ahead of October debut Renault 17 Electric Restomod x Ora Ito Bemused by the Ford Capri’s metamorphosis from bold coupé to conformist SUV? This Renault 17 might just be the answer, bringing the Capri’s contemporary rival up to date with a 270bhp electric motor and a carbonfibre chassis. Penned in collaboration with French designer Ora Ito, it’s slightly wider and lower than the original 17 but retains its cabin, door, windows, glass and underbody. Renault 17 reborn with 270bhp, RWD and carbonfibre chassis Renault Embleme This coupé SUV is Renault’s idea of how hydrogen-fuel-cell power could offer long-range transport while slicing carbon emissions by 90% compared with today’s petrol Captur. Its exterior will be shown at Paris, but we’ll have to wait until later this month to see the Embleme in full. Renault Embleme revealed as hydrogen coupé-SUV for 2030 Renault Twingo Renault’s next retro revival after the 4 is the cute new Twingo, which is scheduled to go on sale in 2026. The Paris show will mark its public debut. Renault Twingo to return in 2026 as sub-£17,000 EV THK LSR-05 We'll forgive you if you've never heard of Japanese parts supplier THK, but its latest concept is well worth paying attention to. Penned by Nissan GT-R designer Shiro Nakamura, it is a showcase of the company's latest technological developments, including in-wheel motors and wireless car charging. It'll be making its European debut at Paris. Japanese firm shows high-tech SUV penned by Nissan GT-R designer",

    "title": "Used Ford Ranger 2011-2022 review",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/ranger-2011-2022",
    "description": "The Ford Ranger neatly blends ruggedness with car-like refinement and usability - but is it still a sensible purchase second hand? Pick-up truck drivers are a particularly tough crowd to please, so the fact that Ford’s Ranger has for years now been the best-selling such vehicle in the UK is no small reassurance that it’s the pick of the bunch.Pick-ups have always been popular with farmers and builders in the UK, but it wasn’t until the early 2010s that they became a more widely popular choice thanks to the attractive benefit-in-kind rules regarding light commercial vehicles (LCVs).Many company car drivers were taken by the idea of riding about in a well-equipped, leather-trimmed truck while paying much less tax.And the P375-generation Ranger’s promised combination of a robust, utilitarian appearance, sophisticated on-road manners and a truly habitable, car-like interior sent it to the top of their shortlists.This Ranger had an unusually long shelf life: it arrived in 2011, was given a major facelift in 2015, then had a less dramatic one in 2019. It arrived with a choice of turbo diesel engines – two 2.2-litre four-cylinders and a 3.2-litre five-cylinder – all badged TDCi. With 197bhp, the last of those is our pick, as the lesser versions are pretty ponderous.This was dropped in 2019 in favour of a 2.0-litre twin-turbo diesel four with 210bhp (badged EcoBlue). Mated to a 10-speed automatic gearbox, it was fitted to the wild Ranger Raptor, a more hardcore model that featured uprated suspension and bigger wheels shod with chunkier tyres.This 210bhp engine failed to match the performance billing of the Raptor, however, while the new ’box felt as if it had one too many ratios to handle. Furthermore, it could tow only 2500kg, because it didn’t qualify as an LCV.But while the Raptor was a bit of a confused concoction, the 2.0 EcoBlue worked just fine as a workhorse in regular Ranger variants. It was more efficient than its predecessor and had enough poke for towing. It could have been more refined under hard acceleration, though.The Ranger was initially able to tow up to 3350kg, and a few tweaks to its set-up in 2013 increased its braked towing capacity to 3500kg, matching the Nissan Navara of the same period and outdoing the then new Toyota Hilux by a whole 550kg.Where the Ranger truly excels, though, is in its blending of rugged, go-anywhere dependability with car-like refinement and usability – a quality best exhibited by our favoured trim level, Wildtrak.This range-topper got all the bells and whistles. Post-facelift models received Ford’s Sync 2 touchscreen infotainment system (the same as in the Mondeo), a reversing camera, adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance, as well as bigger alloy wheels, sat-nav and leather seats.No wonder that it claimed 80% of UK Ranger sales.The line-up covered a broad spectrum, though, with variants to cater to all use cases, from single-cab (two-door, two-seat) to double-cab and super-cab (four-door, five-seat).The trim hierarchy started with the conservatively specced XL. This was the only one offered with the single cab and featured 16in steel wheels, hard-wearing cloth seats and black plastic trim.Buyers could add body-coloured bumpers, but nobody likes a show-off… XLT and Limited were fancier, but Wildtrak is the go-to trim for most used buyers – just like the Ranger should be your go-to used pick-up.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/when-i-met-ratan-tata-remembering-quiet-giant-car-world",
    "description": "\"Mr Tata was utterly unique; a quiet and soft-spoken man who sought no glory\" Ratan Tata's trust and passion put JLR on the path to glory – and his towering legacy will be felt for years The death of Ratan Tata, the man whose bravery and vision did more than anyone else to build JLR into the world-class car manufacturer it has become today, will be met by honest, unaffected sadness all around the world.  Mr Tata was unique; a quiet and soft-spoken man who sought no glory, yet whose pre-eminence was recognised and admired wherever he went because of what high ideals had helped him achieve. In a world where 'goodness' is an outmoded concept, Ratan Tata showed us how to put it to work. In my very first meeting with Mr Tata I saw goodness well and truly harnessed for business. As part of a baying group of hacks at the Geneva motor show, desperate to grab any exclusive fact-fragment about his global conglomerate’s impending takeover of Jaguar and Land Rover, I asked how he intended to cope with a bloody-minded Midlands workforce who in time past had eaten managements like his for breakfast.  His gaze was steady. He was entirely unfazed. At a 17-year distance I can’t remember Mr Tata’s exact words but they went something like this: “Our group has achieved success in many fields by making it possible for managements and staff to do their best work – and then trusting them to do it. That’s what we will do this time.”   It sounded naive, but of course it worked wonderfully well. And went on working. JLR proceeded to do things that were (and are) the envy of the world.  Those of us who had a chance to know Mr Tata will feel forever lucky: at my first one-on-one, when my rather desperate focus was again on teasing Jaguar headlines out of our conversation, Mr Tata preferred to talk about a pile of motoring magazines beside his bed at home, containing stuff I had written and he had read. How amazing is that? When we did talk Jaguar – not long before the acquisition deal was actually cemented – he displayed his credentials as a design expert and a lifelong car enthusiast by talking in great detail of the great Jags from history.  When I asked him whether (as was widely rumoured) he intended to commission a new Jaguar sports car, an F-Type, he was the soul of respect for the Jag vendor, denying that he had the authority to do such a thing. But he “looked forward to a day when it might be possible”. I feel especially sorry today for two past JLR stalwarts – former CEO Dr Ralf Speth and retired driving dynamics guru Mike Cross. Both drew inspiration from Ratan Tata’s presence, company and advice. Speth especially admired Mr Tata for his ideals in business. Cross enjoyed the chairman’s delight in a great car, well driven; every couple of months the pair would grab a car and go, just driving.  It’s fashionable to say that many a great man’s legacy will live long after his death. Sometimes it’s even true. But in British motoring, Ratan Tata’s contribution will be something else. Quite simply, it will be indelible.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/long-term-reviews/skoda-kamiq-2024-long-term-test",
    "description": "Right-sized SUV joins the fleet without an electric motor in sight Why we’re running it: To help us assess whether this B-segment SUV can make a case for petrol-only powerplants in the automotive near-future Month 1 - Specs Life with a Skoda Kamiq: Month 1 Welcoming the Kamiq to the fleet In just over a decade's time, pure-petrol cars will be exclusive to the used market. Actually, that point could come even sooner. The new Labour administration is discussing plans to bring back the original 2030 ban on new internal-combustion-engined car sales (it was pushed back five years by the Conservatives last year) and some automotive timelines are prioritising electrified vehicles by the time we enter the 2030s. This all means that cars such as our new Skoda Kamiq, with its 1.5-litre four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine (that's right: no hybrid assistance here), are a dying breed. So we're here to find out, over the coming months, if such powertrains will be missed. To introduce you, the Kamiq is Skoda's smallest 'big' car, sitting below the Karoq, Kodiaq and electric Enyaq. It was launched in 2019 and refreshed last year (it's not conventionally pretty, giving off Star Wars Stormtrooper vibes), and it's positioned as a raised and slightly roomier alternative to the Scala. Its target market is smaller families shopping in the highly populated B-SUV segment. Being a Skoda, the Kamiq is priced very competitively, from just £24,040 (which gets you a 94bhp 1.0-litre turbo petrol triple and five-speed manual). That positioning has pushed it to become one of the Czech brand's best-sellers in the UK, matching the stalwart Octavia with some 16,000 sales since the start of last year. Our car is the top-rung Monte Carlo Kamiq. Sounds sporty, right? Well, think less Toyota GR Yaris and more Yaris GR Sport: this is style over substance. So while nothing changes underneath, inside you get squidgy, bucket-like sports seats, a panoramic glass roof, dual-zone climate controls and a 10.25in digital driver's display. And it rolls along on smart 18in alloys. At £31,580, which includes optional £660 Moon White paint (I was surprised to find this wasn’t a standard colour), it’s still a bit of a bargain. But don’t expect a luxury model: this Kamiq is a workhorse at heart, given away by its manually adjustable seats and mostly plastic interior. Now that you’ve met, let’s talk about first impressions. The Kamiq is no-frills wonderful. No, we’re not EV haters here at Autocar: far from it, as they’re becoming more and more brilliant by the day. But one thing that electric powertrains remove (ignoring the interesting transmission work currently being done by Toyota/Lexus) is the need for conventional gearing and therefore a gearbox. And for car lovers, the analogue, hands-on experience that a stick-shifter offers really can’t be matched. So to have a six-speed manual transmission in the Kamiq is a real delight: the clutch pedal has a lovely weight and spring to it and the lever offers a pleasing feel. However, the gating feels a tad closer than that in rivals such as the Kia Stonic, so I’ve already found myself in third when I’m hunting for first. That’s something to keep an eye on over the coming months. The Kamiq also drives really well. In our short time together so far, it has proved to be both a solid motorway hauler and a nippy around-town runabout. That’s thanks in part to its pedigree: it may be relatively new, but as it sits on the Volkswagen Group’s  incredibly versatile MQB platform, it shares the same underpinnings as cars ranging from the Audi A1 to the Volkswagen T-Cross. It’s a deceptively big car, too. At 4241mm long, 1793mm wide and 1562mm tall, it’s no bigger than the Nissan Juke but offers 400 litres of seats-up boot space – enough to fit, as I’ve already discovered, a lot of sports gear and a cockapoo. Plus you get generous rear leg room and practical touches such as bag hooks, deep storage bins and an actual bin. That practical approach manifests in the Kamiq’s usability, too, with a host of physical buttons and switches for key controls such as cabin temperature. A proper volume switch, rather than a non-haptic touchpoint on the 9.2in infotainment screen, feels an oversight. There is, though, a roller on the steering wheel. Additional plus points come from wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which means no more cable faffing. A divisive quirk is the seating position: compared with similarly sized rivals, you sit low to the floor, giving it more of a hatchback feel on the move. I really like that, but my partner, who drives a crossover, isn’t a fan. You can pump up the seat, but the layout doesn’t suit it. One positive is that it promotes quite an enjoyable driving experience, especially from what I’ve found so far on back roads. This is aided by the light, smooth steering and enhanced by its short (2651mm) wheelbase. An added bonus is incredibly easy manoeuvrability in tight car parks. Add in that the 148bhp 1.5-litre turbo engine is already returning close to 50mpg and this is starting to look like a bona fide bargain. It will be interesting to see if anything begins to grate once our honeymoon period fades away and whether it will be the Kamiq’s practicality or its economical powerplant that becomes the star of the show. Road trips are already planned, including a cross-continent expedition, and I can’t wait. Second Opinion By the time the Kamiq arrived, crossover fatigue had fully set in, so I never really appreciated its strengths. But with decent space and a compact footprint, there’s a lot to recommend it. It’s also a reminder that manual gearboxes should have a future in more than just performance cars.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-cadwell-park-unsung-racetrack-hero",
    "description": "Narrow, flowing, fast, undulating: our road test editor explains why Cadwell is quite unlike any other track in the UK Cadwell Park, in Lincolnshire, might be the most atmospheric race circuit in the world. For a while, it was known as the UK’s ‘mini Nürburgring’ – but that’s a bit like calling the late Verne Troyer a mini Vin Diesel. Disrespectful? Absolutely. They may have comparable relative proportions, but surely – and you can call me pedantic if you like – what makes the Nordschleife utterly unique and therefore profoundly different from any other circuit in the world is the fact that it’s 13 miles long. Cadwell is mostly known as a venue for motorbike racing, and for good reason. It’s narrow, flowing, fast, undulating and quite unlike any other track in the UK. It’s also one of the motorsport world’s finest examples of a natural amphitheatre. Sit in the pint-sized grandstand at the top of The Mountain – the circuit’s infamous jump – and you can follow bikes around four corners as they course towards you, take to the air right in front of you and then disappear through the shady, often treacherously slippery Hall Bends. Seconds later, they blast back down the pit straight 50 yards farther below you and then through the devilishly quick bends at Coppice and Charlies. You feel like you can watch about half the lap from one seat, with visibility of two separate sections of track, a little bit like you can these days from the Becketts grandstand at Silverstone – except that, at Cadwell, one of them includes a whacking great jump. Ah yes, The Mountain. I’ve never tackled it on a bike but have in a few cars – typically failing to get more than a couple of wheels off the ground because of the limited entry speed you can carry (a very good job they don’t run it in reverse!). It must be utterly terrifying on two wheels, and the biking fraternity’s penchant for jump shots of their heroes taken here, often getting so much air that there’s no asphalt in the frame at all, seems to confirm as much. Check out Josh Brookes on YouTube to see the finest exponent of the art. I used to watch a fair bit of bike racing, following my brother-in-law on his old Suzuki GSXR600, and if I could only watch the sport once more in my life, it would be from here. The sense of excitement and jeopardy is heart-stopping, and the bravery of the race marshals, whose only option when someone falls off is to stand right in the middle of the track with two yellow flags waving like lightsabers, is almost as incredible. I dearly hope they get danger money. You have to be in the right kind of machine to make Cadwell as good in a car. The narrowness of the circuit makes it a bit unsuited for wheel-to-wheel racing, but for sprinting or testing, I’d say it’s superb: winding and technical, with nerve-jangling quick bends and unforgiving – and very steep – downhill braking areas. Which is why I’m delighted that Autocar is heading back there this year for its annual Britain’s Best Driver’s Car shootout. Let’s hope Lincolnshire’s weather isn’t too wet in October.",

The former (which can be driven in the EU without a full driving licence) is limited to the same 28mph as the Ami, whereas the latter can do 50mph. The Duo is powered by the 48V motor used in the Renault Austral mild hybrid. Renault has yet to disclose a power figure for the unit, but claimed it provides “strong acceleration” up to town speeds. L6e quadricycles are legally limited to 8bhp, while their L7e counterparts can be boosted up to 21bhp. The L7e Microlino's single motor puts out 17bhp, for reference. It packs a 10.3kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery, which yields a range of up to 100 miles on the WMTC (World Motorcycle Test Cycle) regimen used for quadricycles. Renault said this should translate to a real-world range of around 62 miles in winter. The company did not detail maximum charging rates but said it takes 3hr 50min to go from 20-80% on an AC connection and 3hr 25min on DC, suggesting the Duo peaks at around 3kW. Despite measuring just 2.43m long and 1.3m wide, it has seating for two, using the same tandem interior layout as the Twizy. That helps to give the Duo a turning circle of 6.80m – tighter than a London cab's. Unlike on the Twizy, the Duo’s doors – which open Lamborghini-style – feature conventional windows for weather protection. The Duo has been designed to minimise its impact on the environment: some 40% of its weight comprises recycled materials and it's claimed to be 95% recyclable at the end of its life. The front and the rear bumpers are the same panel and one indicator piece is used around its exterior. The Duo uses five times fewer parts than a conventional car, Renault said. It will be built alongside the Dacia Sandero and Dacia Jogger at the Renault Group’s plant in Tangier, Morocco, which takes 90% of its energy from renewable sources. The sum of these efforts is that the Duo emits a third of the greenhouse gas emissions of an A-segment city car over its lifetime, according to Renault. In similar fashion to a Tesla, the Duo doesn't come with a physical key. It instead uses a bespoke MyDuo app, compatible with Apple and Android phones, for locking and unlocking. Prices for the L6 version will start at €9990 (excluding incentives) in France, indicating that it will cost from around £10,000 in the UK. The L7 version is priced from €11,600 in France, with Evo trim adding Bluetooth, a heated seat and orange accents for €900. UK deliveries of the Duo and its cargo van sibling, the Mobilize Bento, are set to begin in late spring 2025. The Bento trades the Duo’s second seat for a load bay with a capacity of 649 litres.  It's available only in L7 guise and its range is slightly reduced from the Duo's, at 93 miles. It’s priced at €10,900 in France (excluding VAT).",

    "description": "I-Pace steers superbly, marshalling its 2.3-tonne kerbweight This pioneering electric SUV has been axed after only six years on sale – was it taken too soon? When Jaguar launched the I-Pace back in 2018, with lots of hoopla at a launch event at the then healthy Geneva motor show, the British nation’s collective chest swelled with pride. However, it was a controlled kind of chest swelling, not quite on the level of the Rule Britannia, front-page excitement that greeted the BMC Mini back in 1959, the Jaguar XJ in 1968 or the original Range Rover in 1970. By 2018, in many people’s view, premium cars had already been evil for decades. Still, this was Britain’s first significant electric car, it was a Jaguar and best of all it was a rare example of us beating the top German makers to the punch – something the I-Pace’s two biggest advocates, Sir Ralf Speth (JLR’s ex-BMW CEO, a consummate engineer) and Sir Ratan Tata (the long-time Jaguar-loving head of JLR’s Indian owner, Tata) valued enormously. Better yet, the I-Pace went down really well with everyone else who counted: the car testing community loved the way it looked and drove, owners enjoyed seeing their brand doing something progressive and corporate/financial denizens saw this as a plausible route for Jaguar to take towards a profitable future. Profits had been elusive for the Leaping Cat since founder Sir William Lyons led the company – and he departed the top job in 1972. Despite the I-Pace’s unhelpful height, short nose and cab-forward design (all very foreign proportions in Jaguar history), design chief Ian Callum and his team brilliantly adapted Jaguar’s bumps, curves and an extreme windscreen rake to the new proportions and created a car that seemed (and still seems) almost too sleek to be called an SUV/crossover, although its spacious cabin and boot clearly showed that it did indeed belong to that generic group. The I-Pace immediately set about collecting global awards – 62 in all, including Car of the Year – like they were going out of fashion, and the company did a lot of initial boasting about them. The presumption was that the basic I-Pace, helped with judicious updates as battery tech advanced, would last a couple of generations, like other new cars: 12 to 14 years for the major underbits with a pause halfway for a reskin and mid-cycle refreshes to punctuate progress every three years or so. When in 2021 new JLR CEO Thierry Bolloré launched his all-bets-are-off Reimagine plan to rebuild Jaguar as an all-EV company by 2025, the I-Pace was slated as a survivor, a model to build a bridge between the old and new.  Yet here it is in 2024, gone already. At first the demise was a bit of a shock, although perhaps not too huge a bombshell, because upheaval and rapid mind-changing have been an integral to British car-making as far back as you care to look. Yet with the kill-it-now decision went pangs of regret that made us want to drive a few more enjoyable I-Pace miles, at least for the purpose of this story. Helpfully, Jaguar still had prime examples on its test fleet. We decided on an enjoyable 10-day reverie. On reflection, the I-Pace’s demise should have been easier to predict than we made it. When Bolloré suddenly walked away from the CEO job, the fact that they drafted in the finance director, Adrian Mardell, to lead the company suggested pretty clearly that earning power at Jaguar was the problem. The I-Pace and its small SUV sibling, the E-Pace, were both being built in Austria by versatile but pricey contract constructor Magna Steyr, with the former using a battery pack that had to be imported from Poland and powered by own-design Jaguar motors that may have been technically brilliant but were far from the cheapest available. What’s more, despite the I-Pace’s high reputation, sales have never taken off. In the best years (2019 and 2020), combined American and European deals amounted to around 15,000 annually, and in more recent years volume has fallen below a third of that, not only affected by the malaise in general EV demand but by other matters too. The high entry price was a factor, as were regular software glitches, the fact that realistic battery range originally quoted at 292 miles was more like 70% of that (the US’s EPA even cut the officially quoted range figure) and increasingly stiff and low-priced competition from the Chinese, Germans and Koreans. It’s usually deemed to be an advantage to be first into a new market, but in the I-Pace’s case it made things hard. So hard, in fact, that Jaguar has chosen to kill the car now and go through 2025 with only the dregs of Magna Steyr production in the pipeline to sell as dealers await 2026 production of the first of three forthcoming models, a four-door GT in the Porsche Taycan mould. And yet… When our I-Pace test car arrived, it was a really nice surprise. I hadn’t been in one for a few years, since running a mid-range version as a long-term test car for several months back in 2019. Despite its bulk and height, the car still looked stylish and special, with full, curvaceous surfacing and faint but obvious hints of the D-Type’s lines in its handsome haunches. The interior, making generous use of the Alcantara, was plush and comfortable. Best of all, there was none of the anonymous blackness that blights many Germanic interiors. The materials in this car were light enough to make their quality obvious. The rear compartment (for all the fastback styling) was spacious and offered lots of head room. The boot was very long as well as very deep. There are clear missteps, though. Visually, the cab-forward design denies the car an imposingly long nose – something Jaguar traditionalists have long seen as de rigueur. Same for a low boot deck. Fascinatingly, this is a feature the latest, post-Callum and Julian Thomson design regime at Jaguar, led by renowned Land Rover guru Gerry McGovern, is understood to be bringing back to the 2026 range. The I-Pace, spoken of in its early life as a ‘sports crossover’, also has an unashamedly high seating position (blame six inches of battery-pack thickness under the floor), plus a front door pillar that compromises leg and foot access more than it would in a low-slung saloon. Third, there’s no view of bonnet bulges to stir the enthusiast’s soul. Try denying that sight to the owner of an E-Type, or even a relatively recent XJ, and see how you get on. Still, when you’re settled in the superbly shaped driver’s seat, such criticisms float away. You can see very well from the elevated driving position (despite windscreen pillars like tree trunks) and the controls are universally pleasing to the touch. This HSE-trim car is one of those premium models that sets you wondering why anyone could want anything plusher. And some of its controls, notably the circular PRND twist selector that we criticised early on, have become so ubiquitous in many models that we’ve grown used to them and now accept their practicality. The promise of the I-Pace’s power and torque seemed massive in 2018 and they remain potent today: 394bhp and 516lb ft from two permanent magnet synchronous motors in a hefty 2300kg package yield easy-to-deploy 4.8sec 0-62mph acceleration, plus a less impressive 125mph top speed. But on longer journeys, you soon learn that the most modern I-Pace still can’t duck its range issues: our late-spec test car was really only comfortable delivering a bit over 200 miles. Rivals do much better. Quite unusual to the Jaguar experience, for regulars, is the effect this car’s proportions have on the driving. Higher than combustion-engined equivalents and 4.7 metres long, the I-Pace sits on a 2.9-metre wheelbase, which means that while it’s only a whisker longer than the XE compact saloon, its front and rear axles are a full 30mm farther apart of those of the bulky XF saloon. Which is another way of saying the front and rear overhangs are short and the major masses, set low in the car, are well centralised. Chuck in four-wheel drive and you can see why this is a car that’s never going to drift anywhere this side of a skating rink. That said, when you’re ambling, the rear 197bhp motor does most of the driving and the front 197bhp motor (converted for the purpose to a generator) does most of the regenerative braking. Neutrality, understandably, is the I-Pace’s main cornering characteristic and it’s delivered with very little body roll. Disconnecting the stability control is a fatuous exercise. Far better to enjoy the car’s steering precision – still much better than most EVs at any price. It lets you place the car accurately and enjoy the I-Pace’s easy ability to change direction. Grip is great. Modest throttle steering is still available (easing the power lessens the front slip angles), but it’s far from dramatic. In early testing, we weren’t especially nice about the I-Pace’s ride quality, noticing a tendency of its heavy body to heave against the usually decent damping on quick, high-amplitude surfaces like the Fosse Way. Then others came along to show how difficult it is to control 2.3-tonne EVs on such roads, doing it far worse. As a result, we find that the six-year-old I-Pace is still one of the best EVs you can buy, dynamically speaking, and owners confirm that. On such grounds, it’s a shame that the I-Pace is dying. At least my own several recent sojourns to Jaguar dealer used car line-ups confirm that good warranted I-Paces are available at what seem very affordable prices. What has the I-Pace achieved? It could be that if the next Jaguar generation is successful (and given McGovern’s magic touch with the Range Rover, that’s a strong possibility), the first-ever electric Leaping Cat may come to be seen as a blind alley, a car whose proportions sent it down the wrong road. Having said that, nobody at Jaguar regrets the I-Pace experience or is ever likely to. As managing director Rawdon Glover told Autocar in a recent interview, the I-Pace was needed to put Jaguar on its current path. Let’s hope, for the sake of a wonderful marque, that it’s now the right one.  How they built the I-Pace The ending of I-Pace production at Magna Steyr in Graz ends a fascinating episode in Jaguar manufacturing history. The Austrian operation is a 90-year-old car production offshoot of Canadian car components giant Magna International, which has 400 outposts in 29 countries. Car making accounts for just 10% of its $40 billion annual turnover.  The Graz business is well known for its flexibility with high levels of quality: the I-Pace first had its all-aluminium body made in a highly mechanised body-in-white plant – featuring 87 robots and 84 rivet guns – and then shared a similarly robotised final assembly line with the E-Pace SUV. Observed several years ago by Autocar, this was surely the one and only time in Jaguar history when an £80k, all-aluminium dual-motor EV shared a production track with a £50k, steel-bodied, ICE-powered SUV. When we visited and remarked on the fact, Magna Steyr bosses viewed it as nothing special. In a successful year, they build as many as 200,000 cars of up to half a dozen models. They’d had five different models on one line, they told us. “It’s not so special,” the foreman said. “It’s what we do. The challenge is getting the quality right.” How important is a nose job? Since it was revealed several months ago that, rather than continuing with a short-nose, cab-forward look, the new Jaguars of 2026 will have longer, more prominent nose treatments, Jaguar aficionados have been encouraged by the idea. Jaguar MD Rawdon Glover seemed to confirm the fact in a recent interview, suggesting that cab-forward design was a characteristic that was being adopted by “practically everyone” and some of the current generic crop looked “as if they’d spent too long in a wind tunnel”. Sir William Lyons, who as well as founding the Jaguar company and managing it through its formative years had much to do with the styling of its greatest cars, always laid great stress on frontal styling and was acknowledged to be “better at fronts than backs”. It seems that while striving famously to be “a copy of nothing”, Gerry McGovern’s team may have been influenced, at least in general terms, by Lyons and his team.  It’s even possible that a cab-forward theme, as well as leading the I-Pace to an early grave, might have done the same for the 2020 XJ EV that was killed by Bolloré and co. Perhaps we will never know. But various Jaguar high-ups have suggested that the limo “didn’t go the way we’ve now chosen”. Perhaps proportions were a major reason.",

    "description": "Ratan Tata was outspoken about his passion for Jaguar and Land Rover Tata Nano mastermind and passionate car enthusiast is credited with mobilising India and saving JLR Indian businessman Ratan Tata, former chairman of Jaguar Land Rover owner the Tata Group, has died at the age of 86.  The company confirmed his death in an official statement this evening (9 October), which read: \"It is with deep sadness and with a heavy heart that we inform you of the demise of our beloved chairman, Ratan N Tata, a legend of our times who passed away on 9 October 2024. \"While we will miss his physical presence, he will always live in our hearts and minds. We rededicate ourselves to carrying forward his legacy and that of the founders, which is rooted in India's civilisational values and strives for the welfare of all.\" Described as a \"titan\" of industry and recognised by Tata as a \"truly uncommon leader\", Ratan Tata led the huge multinational company from 1990 to 2012, a transformative period of globalisation during which time it took ownership of Jaguar Land Rover for £1.15bn.  In a 2008 interview with Autocar, shortly before Tata's purchase of JLR was made official, Ratan Tata spoke of his passion for the brands, which are still owned today by his company.  \"What attracted us was the fact that these are two iconic brands, global in nature and highly respected for their products,\" he said.  \"We believe it is the duty of whoever owns them to nurture the image, to retain their touch and feel, and not to tinker with them. They are British brands, and they should remain British. Who actually owns them should not be very important in the way they work.\" Tata was vocally committed to keeping the Jaguar and Land Rover marques distinct, and to supporting their respective product strategies and expansion plans. JLR, still under Tata ownership 16 years later, has exited a sustained period of financial uncertainty to achieve its highest profit in years, and is about to embark on a radical overhaul of all its product lines and brand positioning. The company's current CEO, Adrian Mardell, paid tribute to Ratan Tata in an official statement: \"The entire JLR family is profoundly saddened by the death of Mr Ratan Tata. His personal achievements and legacy are unequalled in society, and the mark he leaves on our business and brands is greater than that of any other individual. \"It was thanks to his singular vision that Tata acquired JLR in 2008, and we owe everything we have become since then to his unwavering support and dedication. Mr Tata led us on an extraordinary journey. He inspired incredible new chapters in our history. Under his generous and trusting guidance, we have felt deeply proud to be part of the Tata story. \"On behalf of everyone at JLR, I would like to offer our sincerest thanks for his remarkable leadership.\" Tata is also known as the mastermind behind the Tata Nano, an affordable microcar that is widely credited with popularising the private car in India at a launch price of less than £2000 in its home market in 2008. The larger Tata Indica, which was launched in 1998, remained in production for two decades and became one of India's best-selling cars. Outside of his business exploits, Ratan Tata was an avid car enthusiast, known for visiting JLR's UK headquarters every few weeks and spending a good portion of his visit on the firm's Gaydon test track with then chief tester Mike Cross. \"I try to spend a couple of hours on the track with Mike,\" Tata told Autocar in 2012, \"but we often run out of time because we've started driving competitors' cars as well as our own.\" He was also an advocate of freer and more flexible working practices at JLR, and hailed the efforts of designers Ian Callum and Gerry McGovern in particular as instrumental in driving that change – an ethos that continues to underpin the firm's dramatic transformation throughout this decade.  \"The younger generation in JLR is very supportive of change, and I believe overall the culture is changing. But I still wish it could be more open and flexible. Right now we want to get more products into the marketplace as fast as possible, so flexibility really matters,\" said Tata. Crucial models launched or developed by JLR during his tenure as Tata chairman include the Range Rover Evoque, Land Rover Discovery Sport and every Jaguar sold in the past decade, including the F-Type, F-Pace and I-Pace EV.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ac-ace-returns-%C2%A3175k-roadster-ford-focus-st-power",
    "description": "Bristol Classic (left) references earlier Aces while Ace Classic (right) draws on later examples Precursor to the Cobra is revived for 21st century with four-cylinder turbo engine making more than 300bhp AC Cars has revived the Ace, the precursor to the V8-powered Cobra roadster. The new model is visually inspired by the original Ace of 1953 but underpinned by all-new mechanicals. It's based on a new steel tubular frame chassis shod with carbonfibre bodywork, which the company will manufacture itself in the UK. That helps to contribute to a kerb weight of 1100kg – not far off the 989kg of the Ace road tested by Autocar in November 1958. Whereas the original Ace was powered by a range of naturally aspirated straight sixes (first a 2.0-litre unit of AC’s design, then a Bristol 2.0 and finally a modified Ford Zephyr 2.6), the new car uses the turbocharged four-cylinder 2.3 from the Ford Focus ST. It’s fitted with a new exhaust, fuel injectors and engine management system, taking its power output from 276bhp in the hot Focus to more than 300bhp. Mated to a six-speed manual gearbox, it enables the Ace to dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in a claimed 4.6sec. For reference, AC claims 3.4sec for the new Cobra GT Roadster. Two versions of the reborn Ace will be offered: the Ace Classic, taking visual inspiration from the late Zephyr-engined Aces, made until 1963; and the Ace Bristol Classic, drawing on the earlier, Bristol-engined car. Prices start at £175,000 and deliveries are scheduled to begin in summer 2025. Every new Ace will be granted a chassis number “denoting it as a true AC” and reflecting its forebears, the Donington-based company said.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-keep-investing-separate-ice-and-ev-platforms",
    "description": "Electric G-Class sets the tone for Mercedes' future in ditching the EQ badge Firm will phase out its EQ sub-brand as it continues investing in both combustion and electric models Mercedes-Benz is prepared to invest in and develop different architectures for combustion and electric models for as long as there is demand for both, CEO Ola Källenius has confirmed. Speaking to Autocar, Källenius said that Mercedes must offer models “without compromise” on equipment levels, space, technology or performance - and the only way to do this is to offer bespoke architectures. He pointed to the next S-Class, due in late 2028, as an example of this, saying it would be impossible to ensure the right performance levels and interior space in converting an ICE model to an EV or vice versa. \"If you don't believe that the market is 100% electric at that point, you have to have the choice for both,\" he said. \"You need to offer the electric and the high-tech electrified ICE version without compromise. \"The only solution that we think is viable in that scenario is that you have two platforms. \"The packaging advantages on the electric one are so obvious. If you put a combustion engine car into an electric car, you sacrifice space that you wouldn't want to. \"Then, we've worked for 100 years plus in perfecting the combustion car. \"If you take a luxury saloon like the S-Class, it's the best packaged car in the world. How you sit in the back seat, it is the benchmark, full stop. And we don't think the customers would accept going backwards on that. \"The customer comes first in this equation, and he or she is the true winner here. It's going to be the best of times for Mercedes customers in the next 10 years.\" Källenius admitted that \"investing in two versions puts some burden on your investment\" but \"if you do it in an intelligent way, the marginal additional investment can be kept on a manageable level, and that's what we're trying to do\". To that end, anything that isn't related to the powertrain, its packaging and the electronic architecture to support it will be made as common as possible between the two models. Indeed, the physical traditional hardware architecture is no longer the biggest investment in a car; instead it's the electronic architecture and software.  The convergence of Mercedes's EV and ICE model lines has “already started”, said Källenius, with the new electric G-Class being called the G580 rather than the EQG, and this will continue in the future as the EQ sub-brand is phased out. Källenius said that this wasn't a rowing back on a commitment to EVs but in fact quite the opposite. Mercedes' commitment to go all-electric was always qualified with a \"where market conditions allow\" clause, and those conditions aren't there yet and won't be for the foreseeable future. Källenius admitted that he has been surprised by the slow level of uptake of EVs. Projections five years ago, at the start of Mercedes' EV roll-out, were that it would have around a quarter of its sales as EVs by now, but the market is less than half that. Mercedes has already invested in all-new generations of all its combustion engine ranges, to ready them for the Euro 7 emissions regulations and hybridise them. This plus its investments in EVs puts Mercedes in \"a very strong position and perhaps one of the strongest positions of the established manufacturers\" to respond to however the market evolves, claimed Källenius. \"If we now think that by 2030 the market is not going to be absolutely dominant electric, it would not make any economic sense to walk away from a large part of the market. \"If it's 50:50 [ICE and EV], you're not going to walk away from half of your business. Then you need to make sure that you extend your ICE strategy beyond the point that you had originally thought.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-volkswagen-tayron-seven-seat-tiguan-diesel-options",
    "description": "Tayron is 231mm longer than the closely related Tiguan Replacement for Tiguan Allspace gets a range of engine options, including a 62-plus-mile plug-in hybrid Volkswagen has unveiled the new Tayron as the replacement for the Tiguan Allspace, with extra practicality and more on-board technologies. It's effectively a new-generation Tiguan that has been stretched by 231mm, bringing the option of a third row of seats and an extra 198 litres of boot space. The Tayron will be offered with four engines: a mild-hybrid petrol, a pure petrol, a petrol plug-in hybrid and a diesel – with various power outputs. The line-up opens with the 1.5-litre turbo mild-hybrid, which sends 148bhp through the front wheels. It’s followed by a 2.0-litre turbo petrol with 201bhp or 261bhp and front- or four-wheel drive. The 2.0-litre turbo diesel can be had 148bhp or 190bhp, the former with FWD and the latter with 4WD. Each of these units is mated to seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The range-topper is the PHEV, combining a 2.0-litre turbo four with a single electric motor and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The system sends either 201bhp or 268bhp through the front wheels, and Volkswagen claims an electric-only range of more than 62 miles for both versions. The PHEV can't be had with seven seats, however, due to the placement of the 19.7kWh battery under the boot floor. It also loses 18 litres of boot capacity compared with a regular five-seat Tayron’s 885 litres. Inside, the Tayron gets a 10.25in digital instrument panel and a 12.9in infotainment touchscreen, and a 15.0in head-up display is available as an optional extra.  UK deliveries will begin in March, with pricing expected to represent a small premium over the Tiguan, which starts at £34,075.",

    "description": "Defender (pictured) and Discovery are built at JLR's plant in Nitra, Slovakia Prospect of China raising tariffs on EU-built Land Rovers could hurt firm's business in critical market JLR has called for “continued dialogue between the European Union and China” after the UK carmaker was dragged into the tariff war with the threat of increased duties on its EU-built Land Rover Defender sold in China. Chinese officials said this week the government was investigating raising tariffs on large combustion-engined cars imported from the EU. The potential retaliation, sparked by the EU’s vote to apply 'anti-dumping' tariffs to Chinese-built EVs, would affect JLR’s second biggest-selling vehicle in China, the Land Rover Defender, as well as the Land Rover Discovery. Both are built in the EU state of Slovakia. “China is studying measures such as raising tariffs on imported large-engined fuel vehicles,” a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said on Tuesday. “JLR advocates for free and fair trade. Anything which limits trade results in additional costs to manufacturers and ultimately customers,” the British company said in a statement to Autocar. “JLR encourages continued dialogue between the EU and China so as to avoid punitive actions by either side.” The Chinese government gave no details about the possible tariff increase, but earlier this year an official with the government-linked China Automotive Technology \u0026 Research Center recommended raising tariffs on cars with engines greater than 2.5 litres in capacity from the current 15% to 25%. Any such move would affect JLR's Defender 110 and Defender 130 models, which use a 3.0-litre engine, while leaving the entry-level Defender 90 with its 2.0-litre engine unaffected. The Defender was the third best-selling EU-built vehicle in China in the first eight months of the year, with 12,152 sales, according to figures from data aggregator Bestsellingcarsblog.com. First was the Porsche Cayenne and second was the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Other prominent models affected by any tariff increase include the Porsche Panamera, BMW 4 Series and Audi Q7. JLR’s fortunes have revived in recent years, partly on the back of strong sales of its most profitable vehicles in China. Its average sales price in China was the equivalent to £87,000, compared with a global average of just above £70,000, the company said at its investor day in June. Premium brands have already been feeling the pressure in China in recent months as economic pressures hurt consumers and local rivals gained strength amid a punishing price war that has expanded beyond the volume segment. “We are paying close attention to China,” JLR CFO Richard Molyneux told analysts on the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “There are certainly signals that demand is not at the level that we would like to see it going forward.” German brands have been the most vocal in opposing the EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, partly due to the threat of retaliatory tariffs on their lucrative luxury exports to China. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse condemned this week’s vote to make the tariffs permanent as \"a fatal signal for the European automotive industry\" and said the European Commission and China should reach a quick settlement “to prevent a trade conflict from which no one gains.\" China has already imposed higher tariffs on French brandy. One approach JLR could take to avoid the tariffs would be to ship the Defender 110 and Defender 130 models with the 2.0-litre engine as an alternative to the 3.0-litre engine if 2.5 litres is indeed the threshold of higher rates.  The company is unlikely to localise production of the Defender at its Chinese facility, which will shift to making new Freelander-badged models built on an EV platform supplied by joint-venture partner Chery. JLR has so far not suffered from the same drop in demand experienced by other premium brands in China. In fact, it grew there by 30% to 17,145 in the three months ending September, according to its own figures.  China overtook Europe and the UK to become JLR’s third-biggest market in the quarter after North America and ‘overseas’, the term JLR uses to round up sales in all other markets. Globally the Defender remained the firm's biggest seller in the quarter, with 28,277 sales, down 5.5%. China’s threat to increase tariffs on imports of large ICE cars sends a warning signal to the UK as it investigates whether to follow the EU and raise higher barriers to Chinese EV sales here.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/dacia-bigster-brands-largest-most-expensive-model-date",
    "description": "Family-sized 4x4 will land in the UK next year in full-hybrid and mild-hybrid guises The Bigster is Dacia’s largest model yet and kick-starts the Romanian brand’s ambitious plans to expand into the ultra-competitive C-segment market. Claimed by Dacia to make the “C-SUV more affordable”, the long-awaited Bigster will sit above the technically-related Duster crossover and is set to arrive next year at a sub-£30,000 price that will undercut key rivals such as the Skoda Kodiaq, Peugeot 5008 and Ford Kuga. Positioned as a cut-price alternative to the Land Rover Defender, the Bigster comes with four-wheel drive, “genuine off-road capabilities” and a rugged exterior design that remains largely faithful to the concept first shown in 2021. Protruding wheel arches, sharp-looking LED headlights and large, 19in alloy wheels endow the Bigster with a brawny appearance that’s similar in vein to the recently overhauled Duster. The Bigster sits on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi CMF-B platform, which is shared with the Duster, Sandero, Jogger and Clio. As a result, it is being launched with a mix of electrified powertrains. The flagship model is the Hybrid 155, which pairs a 107bhp four-cylinder petrol engine with two electric motors (a 50bhp motor and a high-voltage starter-generator) and a 1.4kWh battery. The Bigster is the first Renault Group car to be fitted with this set-up. Outputting 153bhp via a six-speed automatic gearbox, it is the most powerful Dacia model to date. The firm also claims it can be driven in pure-EV mode 80% of the time. Customers can also opt for the TCe 140, which combines a 138bhp 1.2-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine with a 48V mild-hybrid system. At the foot of the range is the TCe 130, which is also used by the smaller Duster but features four-wheel drive. Both are available with a six-speed manual gearbox only. Inside, the Bigster majors on “space, ergonomics and comfort”, according to Dacia. New features – such as thicker glass, improved acoustic padding, adjustable seats and dual-zone climate control – have been added to “meet the expectations of customers” looking for a C-segment SUV. The high-mounted dash is dominated by a 10.1in central touchscreen, which gets smartphone mirroring as standard. A huge 667 litres of seats-up boot space puts it on a par with the similarly sized Kodiaq and 5008. Commenting on the launch of the Bigster, Dacia design boss David Duran said: \"For the C-segment, you need a car that stands out, so its good to be a bit different by coming with a tough-looking car that is spacious, but also that has functionality to appeal to buyers. And it goes well with our affordable positioning, too. \" \"A rugged design makes sense for us becuase we want our cars to be used as a tool. I have an old Land Rover Series II and for me this is the perfect example of a rugged, reliable tool that you can use everywhere. This is the type of design that I love and I try to apply to our cars becuase we want people to feel proud in our cars, and you don't always need to have a super expensive car to look good,\" he added. The Bigster will arrive in the UK priced from around £29,000 and top out at close to £35,000, making it Dacia’s most expensive model to date.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-autonomous-vehicles/what-investors-will-be-watching-out-tesla%E2%80%99s-robotaxi-day",
    "description": "From the automated people carrier itself to the long-mooted 'Model 2', here's what to keep an eye on “One for the history books” is how Tesla CEO Elon Musk has described the rescheduled Robotaxi reveal day on Thursday 10 October. Dubbed ‘We, Robot’, in apparent reference to the 2004 sci-fi film starring Will Smith and the Isaac Asimov book that inspired it, the event is going to be staged at the Warner Bros studio lot in Hollywood, California. Investors, however, will be hoping that the technology displayed will transcend its fictional backdrop and appear tangible enough to give a clear vision of both short- and medium-term cash-generating reality. “The bar is very high,” Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu wrote in a note, warning of the consequences if it doesn’t impress. “We could envision a ‘sell the news’ type of market reaction.” A credible robotaxi Anyone can design a plausible-looking robotaxi and indeed most car companies have already done so, most recently Rimac with its Verne venture. Clearly Tesla also has the capability to program a car to drive by itself trouble-free round a movie lot. The trick therefore will be to convince attendees that the technology is very close to escaping its confines and offer a credible alternative to robotaxis already operated by Google’s Waymo in US cities. Expect the hand-picked (and therefore less sceptical) attendees to be offered driverless rides in the push to get the message across. A business case Ever-generous with its bold promises, Tesla could pitch itself as a rival to Uber to offer both passenger rides and food delivery from its fleet of robotaxis. McDonald’s recently posted cryptically that “Chat's about to pop off 10.10” with a picture of bagged-up take-out, suggesting Tesla might have lured the fast-food company to become a trial partner in the same way it did with Pepsi in the early days of the Tesla Semi truck. Taking to the air One of Tesla’s biggest cheerleaders - Adam Jonas from the bank Morgan Stanley – has recently floated a theory to his clients that the overarching Tesla autonomous fleet will include drones. Flying cars have lost some of their sparkle when it comes to boosting the stock prices of tech-forward EV companies, but Tesla could more credibly tie its AI-driven autonomous message to an airborne fleet of delivery drones. The affordable EV at last Musk has hinted at a second vehicle to be shown on 10.10 and many analysts are wondering if/hoping that it’ll be an affordable EV that he’s previously said will be on sale early next year. With the Model 2 reportedly dead, this is likely to be a variant of the Model 3 “enabling Tesla to unlock a lower price segment”, said Yu. With the current line-up essentially just two vehicles (only 26,128 of the 469,796 cars Tesla built in the second quarter were Model S, Model X and Cybertruck), a third model is crucial to keeping Tesla’s sales growth on track. Robo people carrier The other possibility is the same autonomous technology applied to a third vehicle, what Deepwater Asset Management has predictively dubbed Robotaxi XL. The company pointed to a slide from the March investor day that showed a draped van-like vehicle in its ‘global electric fleet’ line-up.  A business case for humanoid robots Tesla’s Optimus prototype might well make an appearance, given I, Robot was about humanoid robots serving humanity, even if it did all go horribly wrong. So far we’ve yet to hear a convincing case for Optimus, given repetitive tasks are better carried out by specialist machines that don’t require a complete facsimile of the human form. Evidence the technology works Tesla’s conviction in the abilities of its Full Self-Driving suite of technology applied to existing cars hasn’t yet been matched by its performance. Indeed it is still classed as level two, requiring driver supervision to operate, and is seemingly years away from making the leap to level four or five autonomy needed to operate driverless cars. Musk tweeted confidently recently that FSD will “soon exceed 10,000 miles between critical interventions”, the level required for robotaxis. However, Tesla doesn’t actually release the disengagement figure (miles covered before a driver needs to intervene), with posted video footage showing the actual figure to be around 16 miles at best. A shift to lidar sensor technology to act as back-up to Tesla’s beloved camera system would be a step in the right direction. Credible timeline Tesla recently won a court case against investors claiming that Musk hadn’t delivered on any of his recent promises of autonomy by using the defence that the company couldn’t be held liable for ‘corporate puffery’ – ie Musk can make any outlandish claims he likes under the protection of ‘safe harbour’ rules. Many will therefore be on guard for fantastical timelines, given his record so far. Deepwater pointed out that the Model Y was the only vehicle with a normal gap between unveil and production at 10 months, with the Cybertruck taking 48 months and still no sign of the Roadster after 79 months. “Recent history… should remind investors that patience is a virtue,” wrote the company.",

    "description": "Building a café racer with an older motorcycle usually involves two phases; getting the bike running, and customizing it. And if the bike is really beaten up, the first phase can be the hardest—especially if the engine is too far gone. Marshall Hewitt had a novel approach to this particular challenge. This ex-police 1991 BMW K100 was a true basket case when he found it, with a seized engine among the myriad issues that needed attention. So Marshall side-stepped the problem entirely, by simply yanking the engine out and replacing it with a modern electric powertrain. An automation engineer by trade, Marshall has been building café racers as a hobby for a few years now. He normally works on bikes with internal combustion engines, but he’s not averse to trying new things.…",

It was a roller coaster of a month with the most fearsome outlaws that the American blacktop had ever seen, and the photos they produced are a fantastic documentation of these mid-century gunslingers. Though Ray and Bride risked life and limb embedding themselves with the lawless outcasts, the story was never published. However, the photos have been floating in and out of the motorcycling community’s collective consciousness since surfacing and have cast their spell on Greg Hebard of Regatta Garage in Salt Lake City, Utah. Inspired by Bill Ray’s photos, Greg wanted to create a modern version of an early club-style motorcycle.…",

Batman and his myriad motorcycles have captured our imaginations since; just think of how many times you’ve heard the phrase “That looks like something Batman would ride.” That exact phrase was the inspiration behind this brooding custom BMW R nineT. But this isn’t a replica of any one particular Batman motorcycle. Rather, it’s a homage to the aesthetics of The Dark Knight’s vehicles, masterfully executed by Smoked Garage in Jakarta, Indonesia. “A client walked into Smoked Garage with a childhood dream,” says the shop’s founder, Nicko Eigert. “As a boy, he had always been fascinated by the sleek, futuristic bikes of Batman—and now, he sought to bring his fantasy to life in a modern café racer.”…",

We also throw the spotlight on a Suzuki DRZ400 supermoto, the new Kawasaki W230 modern classic, and a fully original Yamaha BW350 that just sold for a cheeky amount of money. Triumph Bobber by Motocrew The story of this slick-looking custom Triumph Bobber began with a call from a good friend of the German custom bike workshop, Motocrew. He had just finished customizing his Porsche 911, and it looked lonely in the garage. The hunt for a stablemate was on—and that’s where Motocrew came in. The bike needed to be long, low, and lithe, just like the Porsche, so Motocrew’s Chris Scholtka chose a 2019-model Triumph Bobber as a donor.…",

    "description": "In 1986 and 1987 Honda built the TR200, better known as the “Fat Cat” for the U.S. market. This half dirt bike, half ATV hermaphrodite wasn’t agile, had lackluster performance and was generally deemed dangerous before Honda pulled the plug in 1988. Honda Fat Cat’s are relatively collectible now and clean versions can bring upwards of $8,000 USD. Finding one, however, is a bit tricky. So Mike Lilge of Appleton, Wisconsin, decided to build his own. While he was at it, he made a few, shall we say, upgrades? The frame is borrowed from a 1984 Honda 200S ATV, modified and fitted with a custom swing arm and Honda 250R ATV lower tree. The front end lends a little more motorcycle ingenuity, stealing forks from a Suzuki GS450 mated to a custom-fabricated upper tree.…",

Since then, we’ve been wondering when its sibling, the Husqvarna Vitpilen 801, would drop, and what it would look like. Well, it’s here now—and we are decidedly underwhelmed. The new Vitpilen 801 might have knocked our socks off if Husqvarna had released it before the Svartpilen 801. But they’ve made us wait six months for a look at what is essentially a lightly fettled version of the Svartpilen. And that’s left us very little to sink our teeth into. When Husqvarna first released their neo-reto street bike range six years ago, the differences between the Svart- and Vitpilen variants were far more pronounced. The Svartpilen 401 and 701 were clearly styled after flat track bikes, while the Vitpilen 401 and 701 were committed to café racer style, clip-on handlebars and all.…",

Approaching turn 15, the brakes began overheating, sending his König 500 careening off the track. Fighting for control, Newcombe was determined to stay in the race as he approached Stowe Corner at uncontrollable speed… Five years earlier, Kim Newcombe, a marine engine mechanic with a penchant for boat and dirt bike racing, teamed up with renowned German outboard motor designer and specialist, Dieter König. Newcombe took over the development of a defunct motorcycle project built around a boat engine Dieter had conceived. The heart of the resulting machine was a powerful 500cc four-cylinder, two-stroke boxer engine cradled in a custom frame design.…",

It’s been a rocky road for Alex Mazan, Arseniy Chekar, and Vlad Zaki, but they’re too excited about the future to focus on the past.

    "description": "Four years down the road, the Triumph Tiger 900 gets a significant midlife update that aims to fix most of the existing 900’s issues. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: engine, performance, refinement The main improvements are within the 888cc three-cylinder engine, and multiple changes have resulted in not just more power and torque but also the promise of more efficiency. The previous Tiger 900 was far from slow, but the jump from 95hp/87Nm to 108hp/90Nm makes the bike feel even more potent and reactive. It looks familiar, but the side panels have been redesigned. But it’s not just about speed because this engine is also really lovely to ride at a relaxed pace. It’s torquey and very flexible with the gears, so you can ride over speed breakers in third and use sixth as low as 40kph. The fuelling is also beautifully smooth, and you can open the accelerator at very low revs without any signs of protest. This means less clutch use – both off the road and in heavy city traffic, and that’s always nice, even though this clutch isn’t particularly heavy to operate. I’m also a fan of the sound and feel of this engine with its deep, raspy growl. That said, while it’s characterful, it’s also far from perfect. The big complaint with the 900 engine was its high-rpm vibration, and Triumph has tried to improve that. Heavier bar-end weights and rubber-damped handlebar mounts have made some very clear improvements, but this is still not the smoothest engine in its class at high speeds. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: comfort, ride \u0026 handling Wind protection is usually based on your height and helmet, but I find that this height-adjustable windscreen results in some uncomfortable helmet buffeting at high speeds. Thankfully, the rest of the ergos are beautiful. Despite having gone up by 10mm, the 820-840mm seat height is very low for an ADV of this size and capability, and even tall riders will be comfy here. The seat is also new, and the comfort is fantastic. Seat and suspension comfort are both superb. The highly impressive chassis remains unchanged, and some fantastic suspension allows this bike to tear effortlessly through any form of terrible road. Like before, there’s a 45mm USD fork with 180mm of travel and a monoshock with 170mm of travel. The suspension is adjustable, but not fully – compression and rebound at the front and preload and rebound at the rear. The stock settings are good enough, but with a remote rear preload adjuster, you can easily make any changes you need. Even though the GT is the road-biased bike in the line-up, it’s fun to ride off-road and will easily get you through one of those Ladakh adventures. But you must remember that it’s running road tyres on alloy wheels and has no crash protection; Triumph has even removed the earlier GT’s plastic sump guard. For most casual ADV riders, this will be more than capable enough off-road, and I’d only recommend going for the Rally if you really want that hardcore capability or taller seat. Despite being the road-biased 900, it’s still surprisingly capable off-road. Road handling is neutral and easy but not particularly sporty, and you won’t have to work too hard to scrape its footpegs. It’s definitely no Multistrada V2 in the corners, but it’s still good enough that you’ll have fun. The impressive braking hardware is the same, but there’s a new linked-braking system that adds in some rear brake when you use the front. It feels quite natural while bringing some more stability to the braking. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: verdict, price, service cost As for features, the biggest change is the new 7-inch TFT from the Tiger 1200. This one has a great layout and, thankfully, gets rid of those weird layouts from the old Tiger 900. But, like in the Tiger 1200, it takes an eternity to boot up and feels laggy to operate. Triumph really should have fixed this. New TFT looks great, but very slow to boot up. But what’s most frustrating is that Triumph still expects you to pay an additional Rs 43,531 if you want a quickshifter. It’s a feature I really missed, and not getting one in this day and age on a Rs 14 lakh motorcycle is quite annoying. Thankfully, you get most of the essentials you’d want on a big ADV, such as two power outlets, cruise control and heated grips; you can even opt for heated seats. The Tiger 900 has always been the sweet spot in the big ADV segment in India, and this latest update only sweetens that package, especially since it costs just Rs 20,000 more than before. Tigers have also built a great reputation for reliability over the years, and they run fine on regular petrol. However, there are some cost concerns. The first is that the Tiger 900 GT is a CBU, so the on-road price gets very high in certain states that heavily tax CBUs – it’s nearly Rs 18 lakh in Mumbai. The other disappointment is that spares and service costs for the big bikes actually went up instead of down and are now about 20-30 percent more expensive than before since Bajaj took over Triumph’s operations in India. Nevertheless, the Triumph Tiger 900 GT is a fantastic all-round motorcycle, and it continues to be my go-to recommendation for the casual adventure rider looking for a premium midsize ADV.

    "description": "The monsoon is a tough time for any motorcycle helmet. Even the best lids in the world eventually succumb to the odour buildup that comes from having wet interiors for prolonged periods of time. Fogging is another issue, and it can happen even in a hot city like Mumbai if the visor is closed in heavy rain and you’re stuck in a traffic jam. This is the ideal time to try out some helmet-specific care products, and Big Bad Bikes sells a little kit from Muc-Off for just that purpose. Helpfully named the Helmet Care Kit, you get three products and two fancy microfibre cleaning cloths. The products include an anti-fog spray, a foam cleaner and another small spray bottle for cleaning your helmet, goggles and visor. Let’s start with the foam cleaner, which shoots out a thick blast of foam that you are supposed to fill your helmet (or gloves/boots) with. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe away the excess before leaving the helmet to dry. The foam does a really good job of getting rid of the odours and giving the helmet a fresh feel, and it’s something I’ll make sure to have around every monsoon. The anti-fog spray also worked a treat, and the effect lasts for quite a few days as long as you don’t touch or wipe down the surface. It’s also claimed to help water bead away if you spray it onto the outside of your visor, but this effect wasn’t as impressive as I’d like. My go-to product for that hydrophobic coating on a visor remains the Motosolutions Rain Coat cream that we reviewed a few years ago. As for the little bottle of helmet and visor cleaner, it works as advertised and is helpful at getting stubborn stains or dead bugs off. Then again, I usually get the same job done with a mild soap solution, and while the Muc-Off cleaner takes a little less effort, it’s not a game-changer. Muc-Off makes some really interesting products, and many of them are biodegradable, which is always a nice thing. On the other hand, its products are also expensive, and this kit will cost you just over Rs 2,700. Happily, you don’t need to buy the whole kit, and if you’d like just one or two products in particular, they’re all also sold separately by Big Bad Bikes.

    "description": "BMW’s CE 02 is an electric two-wheeler that straddles the line between an electric scooter and a motorcycle. It's aimed at urban riders looking for a more stylish way to get around town and unlike the recently launched CE 04, this one is made in India at TVS’ Hosur plant. We got to spend a short time in Delhi’s traffic with this EV and this is our first impression. A full review will come later. BMW CE 02 design and features The BMW CE 02 breaks from traditional scooter and motorcycle design, offering a minimalistic yet futuristic look. The CE 02 we rode was equipped with the Highline Pack, which included bits like a gold anodised USD fork, teal stickering, tri-coloured seat, heated grips and a smartphone holder. The overall design features minimal bodywork, sharp angles, a single-sided swingarm and fat tyres that give it a unique look. The clean, flat surfaces combined with a simple-looking frame create a distinctive aesthetic that BMW hopes will appeal to younger riders. The CE 02 has a friendly face, with LED elements on the headlight, indicators and DRL creating a unique light signature. Our test bike also came with a unique teal-tinted visor sold as an optional  extra. During our short stint, the CE 02 stood out on our streets and looks like a concept bike. While the rest of the design feels quite cohesive, the front footpegs and their mount do look like a bit of an afterthought. BMW, though, says it's designed this way to accommodate a snow/skateboard. While some may find its playful design too polarising, I found it unique and funky. The CE 02 is equipped with a 3.5-inch TFT screen that may seem small on paper, but it does a pretty good job and has a crisp and clear layout. Additionally, BMW also allows you to mount your phone onto the bike and connect it via BMW’s app, giving you control of features on the app using the switchgear – your smartphone screen becomes an extension of the infotainment. What seemed odd to me was the heated grips, which seemed rather unnecessary in India. I would have preferred the windscreen or comfort seats instead. Speaking of which, with a seat height of 745mm, the CE 02 is quite friendly for shorter riders. However, the standard seat is narrow and will accommodate skinny passengers at best. In the real world, the CE 02 seems better suited for just a rider but a pillion would be a snug fit. As of now, BMW is offering the CE 02 in standard trim and the Highline Package with just one colour option. As part of the Highline Package, BMW will offer a 1.5kW fast charger that will fully charge the CE 02 in under 3.5 hours. BMW CE 02 performance The CE 02 is powered by two 1.96kWh batteries that have a combined capacity of 3.92kWh. The motors have a peak output of 11kW (15hp) and 55Nm. BMW claims the CE 02 is positioned as an electric alternative to a 200cc motorcycle, but its numbers put it more on pace with a sporty 160cc bike. While 15hp may not seem like a lot, the CE 02 picks up pace rather quickly and can effortlessly climb to its 95kph claimed top speed. There are three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. The latter is only available as part of the Highline package and all three modes tweak the throttle response and regen levels. Flow has mild regen, Surf turns off regen entirely whereas Flash puts regen and throttle response on max giving you the most engaging experience. However, all three modes felt quite similar with the difference feeling rather negligible in the real world. BMW also claims that the CE 02 has a range of about 108km, which should make it an effective city commuter. However, we’d need more time with the CE 02 before we can verify those claims. BMW CE 02 ride and handling The CE 02 shines when it comes to ease of handling and urban practicality. Despite weighing a hefty 142kg, it feels rather light and darting through traffic is quite effortless. The thick Michelin City Grip tyres provide great grip and the brakes provide ample stopping power. The lack of rear ABS may seem daunting to newer riders as it’s rather easy to lock up the rear wheel, which may be cause for concern. Another issue I have is the suspension setup, which allows you to feel every imperfection in the road and may not feel as plush as one would come to expect from a thoroughbred city commuter like the CE 02. BMW’s most affordable electric two-wheeler loves to attack corners and it’s not hard to get it to scrap its pegs. BMW says riders can alternate between a more relaxed or a more engaging riding position based on what footpegs they use. While both felt comfortable, I preferred the forward-set position for most part of my journey. BMW CE 02 verdict Priced at Rs 4.50 lakh, it's one of the most expensive electric two-wheelers on sale, second only to its older sibling. However, the CE 02 still remains a niche EV for premium buyers that care more about brand image and futuristic design. While our time with it was short, the CE 02 has made a positive impression with all its credentials. We look forward to bringing you a more detailed review of this electric two-wheeler and testing it over a longer period in the future. Until then, stick around for further updates.",

    "description": "When we rode the TVS Apache RTR 310 in Thailand last year, we had some complaints, which the company has now addressed via its ‘Carecraft’ service camp. Much to my chagrin, we did not experience the updated RTR 310 on dry, well-paved Thai roads. Instead, the setting was Mumbai during the peak of monsoon, which is when the roads start to go the way of the Dodo. To be fair, a bike tackling such roads in torrential rain is one of the best litmus tests there is, so let’s dive in.    Our main complaints last year were excessive vibration, an erratic quickshifter and an uncomfortable climate-controlled seat, and TVS now has fixes for all these issues. In a bid to quell the RTR 310’s buzz, the bike has been given larger bar-end weights and a revised tank mounting. The cooled seat’s padding has been changed to improve comfort. Finally, a revised throttle map and new routing for the quickshifter’s wiring eliminate random cut-offs. 5-inch TFT display is well laid out and has a myriad of customisations. But before we get down to brass tacks, let me refresh your memory about this handsome yellow bike. TVS has pulled out all the stops when it comes to features. Even the base variant comes standard with a TFT display, four riding modes (Track, Sport, Urban and Rain), an automatic LED headlight (which is very bright), traction control, switchable dual-channel ABS and cruise control, too! Bright LED headlight has good throw; adaptive function is standard. Further, TVS’ accessory catalogue brings in a bidirectional quickshifter, climate-controlled seat, fully adjustable suspension, brass-coated chain, and more. The RTR 310 we tested missed out only on adjustable suspension and the brass-coated chain, so it was pretty well-specced.  Switchgear feels tactile, but the left-hand cube is a little busy.   So, have the changes made by TVS ironed out the chinks in the RTR 310’s armour? The short answer is yes (mostly). The vibrations are now better contained, and while the bike still isn’t ultra-smooth, the buzz is no longer a deal-breaker. The one area which still feels vibey is the grey rubber piece on the pillion seat, which gets buzzy at various rpms and sends a tingle up your back. The RTR 310’s quickshifter was already a pretty slick unit, and now it works seamlessly at all rpms. Cooled seat has more padding, but still not comfy for long periods. The one issue that persists is the climate-controlled seat’s comfort. As innovative as it is, in under an hour, you’ll start to feel discomfort due to its stiffness. I respect TVS for trying something ingenious like this, but I have to recommend going with the standard seat. We also encountered a few stray instances of the bike stalling while taking off from a stop with gentle throttle inputs, which can get a little tiresome in big-city traffic. Michelin Road 5 tyres are superb and inspire loads of confidence. Beyond that, the Apache RTR 310 remains an engaging yet reasonably comfortable bike to ride. A special mention must go to the excellent Michelin Road 5 rubber, which inspired loads of confidence in every scenario. The non-adjustable suspension struck a good balance between comfort and sportiness, and you don’t need the adjustable suspension, although it will help you fine-tune the setup to your liking.   The RTR 310 is the only model among the five TVS-BMW products on sale that makes 35.6hp and 28.7Nm of torque, compared to the other models’ 34hp/28Nm. TVS has also dramatically shortened the gearing on the RTR 310 compared to the RR, adding four more teeth to the rear sprocket. Strong performance and better refinement, but engine still buzzy. The result? Punchy acceleration and a 0-100kph time that was narrowly quicker than the 40hp Triumph Speed 400’s. If you find yourself on a long enough stretch of road, you’ll see a speedo-indicated 160kph, maybe more if you’re lighter than me (I weigh 80kg without gear). Suspension strikes a good balance between comfort and sportiness. While Sport and Track modes give you the full juice, Rain and Urban temper down peak output to 27.1hp/27.3Nm, with gentler power delivery and more cautious intervention from the riding aids. The Rain and Urban settings should come in handy for newer riders or if you’re riding in inclement weather. Brakes are progressive and feelsome, have enough power. Thankfully, if you ever have to ride in less-than-ideal conditions, the brakes are strong and feedback-rich. The RTR 310 has one of the shortest stopping distances in this category (the superb Road 5s helping here, too). They have a gentle initial bite, but once you give the lever a firm tug, the bike slows down quickly. What’s pleasantly surprising is that the shorter gearing hasn’t impacted fuel economy much, and you can realistically get 300km on a tankful.   Thanks to the updates, the Apache RTR 310 now has noticeable improvements that make it more appealing. However, the top variant with all the bells and whistles is priced too close to the feisty KTM 390 Duke, so the RTR continues to feel a little out of its depth. That’s exactly why the Apache RTR 310 is one of the few motorcycles where the version we recommend is the base variant. The RTR is an agile handler with enough power to entertain. At Rs 2.50 lakh, the base (but still feature-rich) RTR 310 is now a very strong alternative to the likes of the Triumph Speed 400, KTM 250 Duke and Honda CB300R because you get much stronger performance along with fantastic style and more features at a comparable price.",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-review-less-is-more-433016#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The new Speed T4 has some significant mechanical changes from the Speed 400 and it's rare to see something so different come out just a year after the birth of a new platform. As it turns out, this was one of the iterations in the development stage of the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform and that’s why Bajaj was able to bring it out so soon. At its core, this is the same 399cc single cylinder unit, but power has seen a big drop from 40hp to 31hp. There’s also a small 1.5Nm reduction in torque, but it’s still a healthy 36Nm that is now produced 1,500rpm lower at 5,000rpm. These changes have been executed through a new airbox, a smaller throttle body (no ride-by-wire here) and new camshafts. More significantly, crank inertia has increased by a sizeable 31 percent. The idea behind all these changes is to create a more Indian-city-friendly riding experience and the Speed T4 scores well here. Ride it back to back with a Speed 400 and you’ll notice that the T4’s throttle response is smoother and more mellow. The torque now feels more widely spread and easily accessible – you can hold third gear as low as 20kph without complaint. The engine isn’t as rev-happy, and as a result, it’s a motor that doesn’t want to be revved as much as the Speed 400, which means vibrations are even less of an issue here. Within the city, the T4 feels more enjoyable than the Speed 400, but it does sacrifice some of the latter’s outright performance. The T4 doesn’t feel slow by any means and I suspect it will clock a sub-8-second 0-100kph time, but it lacks the same energetic high-rpm acceleration as its bigger brother. On the highway, a 100kph cruise feels fairly relaxed at around 5,500rpm and the bike has enough in reserve to surge up to 120kph. Progress above that is slow and you should see a top speed between 140kph and 150kph on the speedometer. There are quite a few changes with the chassis as well, the most obvious being the move to a telescopic front fork. The front brakes now use an axial caliper with organic brake pads and the T4 gets the same MRF bias ply tyres as the Pulsar NS400Z. Naturally, none of this sounds very appealing, but I found the tyres, brakes and suspension to be more than adequate for the generally calm way this bike enjoys being ridden. Nevertheless, perhaps sticking with the USD fork would have been wise because the new suspension setup makes the T4 easy to spot as the ‘budget option’ and it also makes an already skinny bike look even more so. The taller tires have also raised the seat height from 790mm to 804mm and this is something that folks shorter than 5’7” will notice. Other cost-saving measures can be seen in the move from aluminium to steel for things like the handlebar, foot levers and headlamp mounts. The T4 also misses out on adjustable levers, traction control and engine immobiliser. All this results in a lower price of Rs 2.17 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which is Rs 23,000 less than the 2025 Speed 400. On the one hand, that price highlights how the Speed 400 is still phenomenal value, but on the other, it also brings the T4 right into the space occupied by the popular 350cc Royal Enfields as well as the new Jawa 42FJ. Within a Triumph showroom, the Speed 400 will surely seem more appealing for ‘just’ Rs 23,000 extra. But the new T4 has a rather endearing riding experience to offer that I found more fitting in a bike like this – it will certainly appeal more strongly to the hordes of 350cc RE buyers that Triumph is trying to tempt away. If, like many others, you find yourself a bit underwhelmed by what this bike looks like on paper, give it a test ride. It might just surprise you.

    "description": "At one point, it seemed unlikely that the Yamaha Aerox would come to India – it has the liquid-cooled engine from the R15, which makes it expensive, and a big spine section that makes it impractical. But Yamaha was brave enough to launch it here in 2021, and at that point, we at Autocar India praised it quite highly. But, we also questioned if the Indian market was ready for such a scooter. A few years down the line, it’s safe to say that the Aerox has been a success, and has done even better than Yamaha initially expected, to the point where the Japanese brand has now rolled out an update to try and sweeten the deal, and make it a little more India-friendly. Yamaha Aerox Version S: changes to standard model You now get a top-spec variant called Version S, which comes with a keyless system. The international Aerox has had this feature for a while now – it was removed as a cost-cutting measure when the scooter first came to India, but is now being offered if you’re willing to pay for it. The Aerox was already a fairly convenient scooter – it had a combination keyslot, which you still get on the other variants, and a fuel-filler conveniently placed in front of you. Now, it’s even more convenient – you can open the seat and the fuel filler, lock and unlock the handlebar and operate the scooter, all without the key fob leaving your pocket. New keyless system adds convenience. The other change here is suspension – Yamaha says it has tweaked the suspension to make it a little better suited to our roads. This is important, because one of the biggest drawbacks of the Aerox when we first rode it was its very stiff and unforgiving ride quality. Has this new setup improved things? Possibly. Marginally. In some situations. We’d really have to ride both versions back to back to be sure, because that’s how small the differences are. But is this now suddenly a plush and comfortable scooter? No. The ride still feels rather firm and stiff, and this is not the scooter you would want to be on over poor stretches of road. The final change here is the addition of a traction control system, which is unlikely to come into play often, but still a good safety net to have.  Revised shocks still feel quite firm. Yamaha Aerox Version S: price and verdict   Considering the subtleness of these changes, it’s unsurprising that the essence of the Aerox has remained largely unchanged. At the heart of the experience is a quick and entertaining engine that outclasses anything else in this price range. Backing it up is a capable and rewarding handling package that really allows you to have some fun. It’s still very much an enthusiast’s offering, and isn’t the most practical or comfortable scooter around, especially if you’re on the taller side. But the market has shown that there are enough takers for this flavour of scooter. We still continue to like the Aerox for what it is, and we hope Yamaha and other manufacturers draw encouragement from this.

    "description": "There are many, many similarities between the two motorcycles that we have here today. For example, they both wear very old British badges but are actually thoroughly modern, made-in-India machines. Both produce exactly 40 horsepower from their liquid-cooled single-cylinder engines, and both have a starting price of under Rs 2.4 lakh. Having ridden them intensively for a few days, I can tell you that there’s no simple answer as to which is better because both have many appealing pros as well as a few significant cons. The first impression Starting with the pros, design is a big one on the Triumph, and it has the best attention to detail of any made-in-India motorcycle, including the new-age Royal Enfield seen here. There’s only one downside that becomes apparent when parked next to most other 350-400cc bikes – it doesn’t really have that much presence. The Speed 400 is not a small bike, and even tall riders will fit on it well, but it does look and feel a little too slender. The Enfield has a more quirky design in comparison, which will be more polarising, but there’s no doubt that it has more presence with its fat tyres, Himalayan-style rear panels and wider-looking fuel tank. That last element is ironic given that it actually has a smaller fuel capacity of 11 litres compared to 13 on the Speed. The Guerrilla’s rear with that fat exposed tyre looks nicer than the rather practical rear of the Triumph, but the trade-off is that it flings more road muck onto the rider in wet conditions. At 185kg, the RE is heavier than the Triumph (176kg), but its 780mm tall seat is the lowest in the segment, while the Speed 400’s is just 10mm higher. On the move Both have comfy riding positions, but the Guerrilla’s feels a little more engaged with a wider, higher handlebar and higher-set footpegs. I find the Guerrilla’s position to be nicer, but the Triumph’s seat is more comfortable over longer durations. Both also take different approaches to comfort in their suspension setups. The Guerrilla is noticeably stiffer, but thankfully, it isn’t harsh like the Hunter. It actually deals with bad roads quite well. It always feels firm but never uncomfortable, and it absorbs bumps without pitching you out of the seat. The Speed is softer, and this is nice at slower speeds and on smooth surfaces. However, when compared with the Guerrilla, it quickly  gets bouncy over less-than-ideal surfaces. Guerrilla’s telescopic fork works well. The Guerrilla’s suspension and general chassis setup are designed to be fun on a winding road. Despite carrying nine extra kilos, it feels lighter-steering, more agile and far more enthusiastic about diving into a set of corners. The Speed is very competent, but while it comes across as being able to do it, the Guerrilla was built to enjoy doing it. The same goes for the brakes, with the Triumph’s being strong and reassuring, but the RE’s are better, both in terms of feel and performance. Change of pace The tides turn when it comes to the engine. On paper, both make 40hp and the Enfield – with its 54cc advantage – produces a little more torque at slightly lower revs. In reality, both perform quite differently, and in many ways, the Triumph’s engine is better. For one, it’s more tractable in the city, and you can hold a gear higher than the RE without protest. It also has a lighter clutch and, coupled with its slim proportions, it is the nicer city bike. The Speed is also smoother on the highway, and while the vibrations do build up from 120kph, you’ll start to feel them from 100kph on the Guerrilla. Looks good, but rev counter a bit hard to read. Then there’s the fact that it’s also a little more fuel efficient than the Royal Enfield, both in the city and out on the highway, and it’ll have better highway range thanks to the larger fuel tank. As for actual performance, the tested numbers are almost identical, with the Enfield a little faster in acceleration, while the Triumph had a tiny advantage in roll-on test figures. It was very close, but the Guerrilla was tested in damp conditions, which could make a small difference. Where the Enfield motor claws back some points is in sound and character. The Sherpa 450 engine is the more flawed motor here but also the more engaging one. It produces a nicer intake sound and has a more revvy, fun-to-ride feeling. In fact, its response can be surprisingly eager, especially when you shift from first to second gear and cross the 3,000rpm mark. For the few folks who won’t like this, there’s the option of changing to Eco mode, which significantly dumbs down the performance. What you get Before we wrap up, let’s just talk about features, and once again, there’s a bit of give and take. The Speed 400 gets a simpler analogue-digital display, but you do get the USD fork, traction control and an engine immobiliser. The Enfield gives you a simpler telescopic fork, but you get a centre stand, two engine power modes and the option of the TFT display from the Himalayan. Classy TFT screen on top two Guerrilla variants. As for quality, some Triumph owners have complained about rusty bolts in a few areas and heavy condensation in the indicators – both were visible on our bike. Our bike also sometimes took up to five cranks to start up. The Guerrilla is based on the Himalayan platform, which has its fair share of issues as well, the most infamous being the chassis failure, which Royal Enfield says was due to incorrectly installed aftermarket crash guards. It also has the same fiddly toggle button that has recently completely failed on our long-term Himalayan. Clearly, both manufacturers need to iron out some issues in these brand-new platforms. USD fork adds to the Speed’s visual appeal. At the end of it all, I don’t think there is a clear winner here. It boils down to which plus points are more important to you and which negatives you are more willing to live with. For example, the Triumph is the more grown-up and sophisticated motorcycle here, and it has the more desirable badge on its fuel tank. It also has a smoother engine and is the nicer bike to commute on. The RE counters with a higher fun factor and better suspension comfort, and it looks and feels like a more comprehensive motorcycle. I’d like both bikes to have been better in certain areas, but I find myself slightly inclined towards the Guerrilla. I like my motorcycles to look and feel special, and they have to be special in the way they ride. The Guerrilla ticks what are the most important boxes for me, but that doesn’t have to be the case with you. Also See: RE Guerrilla 450 vs Triumph Speed 400 comparison video",

    "description": "With the introduction of this CNG version, the Tata Nexon becomes the first car in India to be offered with four fuel options – petrol, diesel, CNG and electric. It’s also the first CNG to use a turbocharged engine and come with a 6-speed manual ’box. Here’s what it’s like to drive. Tata Nexon CNG: exterior and interior Cosmetically, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the Nexon CNG apart from the rest of the ICE range. The only tell is the ‘i-CNG’ badge on the bootlid and the CNG stickers in the front and rear windshield. Other than that, it retains the standard Nexon’s edgy styling with the same alloy wheel design and LED lighting elements. The Creative Ocean and white dual-tone paint scheme you see here also makes it stand out. Save for the iCNG badge, its exterior is identical to the rest of the ICE Nexon range. Inside, too, the changes are minimal but there are some noticeable ones. For starters, this variant – Persona in Tata speak – gets all-black upholstery with blue stitching on the seats.The trim piece on the dash is also slightly different. There’s a CNG button on the centre console that lets you switch between fuels on the fly, there are CNG-specific graphics in the digital instrument cluster that show you the usage split between petrol and CNG modes, and a CNG-only trip meter. The rotary knob for the drive modes – just behind the gear lever – has also been done away with and it’s replaced by a small cubby that can hold small items like the key fob. Perhaps, Tata could have used this opportunity to give the Nexon at least one proper cup holder; it continues to get them inside the glove box. The front seats are sufficiently large and supportive, and it’s easy to find an ideal driving position. At the back, there’s enough room to sit three passengers in relative comfort and it’s nice to see that the panoramic sunroof hasn’t eaten into the headroom. Boot space is down by 21 litres compared to the petrol Nexon, at 321 litres. The Nexon uses Tata’s innovative twin cylinder tech, which means that you don’t lose out on proper usable boot space or a spare wheel. The two CNG tanks, which have a capacity of 60 litres, are placed below the boot floor while the spare wheel is mounted under the car. Boot space has reduced by 61 litres over the standard Nexon to 321 litres (measured from floor to roof), but you can still fit in a couple of suitcases and soft bags. The space saver spare wheel, meanwhile, can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor and it's a relatively fuss-free affair. Tata Nexon CNG features and safety Tata was the first manufacturer to offer a CNG even on top-end variants of the Tiago and Tigor, and the Nexon is no different. The Nexon CNG is available in four trim levels, so buyers can opt for the lower running costs of the CNG without having to compromise on features.  The Fearless + PS DT variant you see here is loaded with equipment,with the headlining feature, quite literally, being the panoramic sunroof.This has debuted on the CNG and we expect it to trickle down to the petrol and diesel versions soon. Other features include leatherette upholstery,ventilated front seats (not electrically adjustable), two 10.25-inch screens for the infotainment and instrument cluster, auto climate control, auto headlamps and wipers, a wireless phone charger, and a superb-sounding JBL audio system. But there are some glitches with the screens that need to be ironed out. Rear seat is spacious and it's nice that the panoramic sunroof hasn't compromised headroom. Safety kit like six airbags and ESP are standard on all variants, with the top-spec variant getting a crisp and high-res 360-degree camera, a tyre pressure monitor, front parking sensors and an auto-dimming IRVM. It also received a 5-star safety rating from Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. There are some CNG-specific safety features that are a part of the package, too: a fire extinguisher, the engine won’t start if the fuel filler flap is open, and it’ll also cut-off CNG supply and release the gas into the atmosphere if it detects a leak in the system. Spare is mounted under the car and can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor. Tata Nexon CNG engine and gearbox Powering the Nexon CNG is the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbocharged engine as the petrol Nexon, but it makes 100hp and 170Nm –while the torque is the same, it is 20hp down over the petrol version.However,the torque band is less – it is only available for 1000rpm, unlike the petrol’s 2,500rpm. It comes only with a 6-speed manual gearbox, but Tata could offer an AMT variant later. Thanks to the single ECU that this employs, it can be started up directly in CNG mode, which helps conserve that little extra bit of petrol at startup. There is some noticeable noise and vibration from the engine at idle, but it does smoothen out on the move. Rev it hard though, and the noise does get intrusive inside. Response off the line is good, both in petrol and CNG, and it’s quite eager to respond to part throttle inputs, too. The engine revs freely, but there are some inconsistencies in the power band. Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm. 1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm. There is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect. The CNG doesn’t make it feel breathless or strained, which means you’ll be happy to let it run in that mode most of the time. the ability to switch between petrol and CNG on the fly makes the entire experience seamless, butthere are no drive modes. The 6-speed manual gearbox has well-defined gates, but the throws are long and the shift action isn’t the most pleasing. What also doesn’t help matters is the snappy nature of the clutch, so you’ll have to get used to its modulation for a smoother drive.  It gets two fuel guages and CNG-specific graphics in the instrument cluster. Tata Nexon CNG performance and fuel efficiency What’s impressive though is the performance, as can be seen in the numbers. In petrol mode, it does the 0-100kph sprint in 13.97s, which is less than a second quicker than the CNG mode. What’s interesting, though, is that it's quicker to 60kph in CNG. There’s a prominent gap in the in-gear acceleration, though, with it being quicker in petrol in both the 20-80kph and 40-100kph runs.

While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations. Tata Nexon CNG ride and handling The CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight. However, there’s not a lot of difference to the way this rides or handles compared to the standard Nexon, and as such, it remains one of this SUV’s strengths. Despite the additional weight, ride and handling remains a strength.  To account for the additional weight of the tanks at the rear, it does feel a bit softer, and though there’s slightly more vertical movement at the rear, it isn’t uncomfortable. Bump absorption remains impressive and the Nexon CNG comes across as a composed SUV. The steering is light at low speeds, enabling you to manoeuvre easily in traffic, and it weighs up nicely as you pick up pace. Tata Nexon CNG price and verdict  Prices for the Nexon CNG range from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and buyers will appreciate that it is offered from the base to the top variant. In comparison, its main rival, the Maruti Brezza CNG, is priced from Rs 9.29 lakh to 12.10 lakh (ex-showroom). What’s also nice is the 3 year/ 1,00,000km standard warranty it comes with. Nexon CNG is available in four trims, priced from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh. With the CNG, the Nexon now has the widest powertrain choice in our market, and given the multiple trims and variants on offer, there’s a Nexon for everyone in the range. The top variant is pricey, the refinement isn’t the best and it continues to suffer from ergonomic issues like the standard Nexon. However, with the CNG, you get the benefits of lower running costs.It also delivers in terms of its drivability and performance, so much so that you can use it in CNG mode only. That, coupled with the fact that you don’t miss out on a boot and a spare tyre, sweetens the deal further.

    "description": "It is almost impossible to get hold of our long-term Skoda Slavia’s key, which Shapur has been clinging onto ever since it arrived in the Autocar India fleet. It isn’t hard to see why, though – the combination of 150hp turbo petrol and dual-clutch transmission, along with the very European driving dynamics, make it a hoot to drive. Luckily for me, his packed schedule with back-to-back travel for all the special stories for our (previous) 300th issue and (this) anniversary issue resulted in the Slavia being left uncommissioned in one of the corners of our office parking lot. And with a full tank of fuel, too! Good: Excellent SUV-like 179mm ground clearance. Straight up, finding an ideal driving position is a breeze thanks to the electric driver’s seat controls and multiple steering adjustments. And I can’t applaud the 10-inch touchscreen’s seamless connectivity enough, especially with wireless Android Auto. Also, while the sound system isn’t branded, the quality is impressive, with clear vocals and strong bass.  Bad: Poor camera quality and low-res display need improvement. Enough has been said by Shapur about its strong 150hp 1.5 TSI turbo-petrol engine. So I won’t repeat it. It is quick, and the mid-range pull is strong, but because of its linear nature, I miss the drama of yesteryear’s turbo-petrol mills, wherein turbo lag was followed by manic boost; those had a charm of their own. Also, at high revs, the 1.5 TSI sounds quite boomy.  Good: Impressive sound quality with clear vocals and strong bass from the subwoofer that's mounted inside the spare tyre.  The seven-speed dual-clutch isn’t very smooth in stop-go traffic either. It makes the car lurch ahead while rolling off from a standstill. While decelerating, the downshifts occasionally feel jerky. The overenthusiastic auto stop-start system kicks in even before the car comes to a full halt, which gets very annoying at crawling speeds. Finally, enthusiasts who want to unlock more out of this engine will be disappointed as most tuners haven’t been able to crack its ECU. City fuel efficiency is usually in single digits. This, however, is the best I've managed One evening, I drove the Slavia at my docile best and tried to induce its cylinder deactivation technology as often as possible. It was a smooth-flowing 22-minute journey from office to home, with the usual traffic signals and auto stop-start feature doing its thing, and the best I managed to achieve was 13kpl as per the instrument cluster display, which is quite accurate. But bring in bumper-to-bumper traffic and high ambient temperatures into the mix, and after just a few minutes of idling, like any other turbo-petrol car, fuel efficiency nosedives to single digits – which is what we’ve been averaging to date. Bad: Stop-start feature turns off the engine even before the car halts. After spending a couple of weeks with the Slavia, I revisited our road test and can relate to every little detail mentioned, especially this statement, which summarises my experience perfectly: “The Slavia is so good, it is one of the most rounded offerings in the segment, and with its practical yet fun-to-drive nature, this sedan has got serious potential to sway SUV buyers in its direction.” Also see:  Skoda Slavia DSG long term review, 5,700km report 2022 Skoda Slavia review, road test",

    "description": "Replace the fetching new Sakhir Gold paint shade for a more conventional black, white or silver, and you’d be hard pressed to identify this Audi Q8 as the 2024 Audi Q8. Fact is, the list of changes on Audi’s glamorous big SUV isn’t a long one. Yet, it’s a model you can’t help but be charmed by.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift exterior design  For starters, the way it looks. To me, the Q8 is the best looking of the German SUV-coupes. The balanced proportions and in particular, the flow of the C-pillar and exaggerated haunches that link to Audi's hero rally cars of the 80s give the Q8 standout appeal. It's not a shape I'd tinker with much, to be honest.  The exaggerated haunches link the Q8 to Audi's hero rally cars of the 80s.  As for what’s changed, the headlights are familiar in shape but have been upgraded to HD Matrix LED units with powerful laser lights for high beam. What's also cool is the option to toggle between four DRL light signatures. The bold octagonal grille gets a facelift of its own with the incorporation of chrome teardrop detailing that adds in a bit of bling. Also, the Q8 makes the move to Audi's new 2D logo. The front bumper has been revised with a new intake design and chin spoiler.  At the sides, it's the new 21-inch rims finished in graphite grey and red brake calipers that are your only cues to this being the 2024 Q8. Frameless windows remain a detail that'll leave an impression at the hotel lobby. At the back, the latest Q8 carries forward the full-width LED lighting, with a redone scuff plate completing this mildest of makeovers.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift interior and features Even less has changed inside. It’s a high quality space but there’s a feeling of familiarity thanks to a three screen layout. The 10.1-inch touchscreen on the upper portion of the dash is very slick but still misses on wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The lower 8.8-inch touchscreen for the climate control system is more contentious. While you do get used to it over time and haptic feedback helps, for anything but the basic temperature controls you’ll need to take your eyes off the road. The third screen is for the digital dials. While informative, they lack the vibrancy that we've seen in the screens on the latest lot of BMWs and Mercs. Still misses out on wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Features-wise the Q8 packs in soft close for the doors, a sweet-sounding Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, four-zone climate control and a panoramic sunroof. There's ambient lighting too, park assist, and a 360-degree camera with maneuver assist that'll apply the brakes if the system senses an impending collision when you're parking your vehicle. However, a full suite of ADAS features is missed, which is something you'd expect on a car of this price. Also, there's no seat ventilation and even steering adjust is manual. Individuals just under 6 feet can manage with reasonable headroom.  Rear seat passengers have it good with lots of legroom and (not a speciality on SUV-coupes) too. There's also the option to drop the rear seat backrest by a few degrees for added comfort and you also get powered sunshades. Luggage space remains unchanged at 605 litres. Folding down the rear seats takes that figure to 1755 litres. 2024 Audi Q8 facelift powertrain There are no changes under the hood. We get the Q8 in 55 TFSI form, which means power comes courtesy a 3.0-litre V6 turbo-petrol engine. The engine makes 340hp and 500Nm and power is channeled to all four wheels via Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system. V6 turbo-petrol only show its full might when you really provoke it. It's a familiar experience behind the wheel, but also a very likeable one. This is not the kind of engine that makes a song and dance of the power that it has. Power delivery is smooth throughout and you have this feeling of a reserve of power that you can always tap into. The engine will only show its full might when you really provoke it. 0-100 kph takes a claimed 5.6 seconds and top speed is limited to 250 kph.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift ride and handling  Thing is, the Q8 is the kind of car that has a calming effect on you, which is also a function of its excellent refinement. Refinement is really good, you won't hear much from the engine bay at average city speeds and even road and wind noise are really well contained. There is one notable change under the skin though. The Q8 is now only available with steel springs, you don't get an option of air suspension as you did before. Does that mean ride comfort is a compromise? Absolutely not. It rounds off the bumps really well, it doesn't feel as stiff-kneed as some of the other European luxury rivals and mind you that it's doing all that it does on large 21-inch rims. The Q8 prioritises comfort over driver engagement and there's really nothing wrong with that approach. Even with steel springs, it rounds off the bumps really well. The Q8 comes across as a smooth operator in the corners as well, it's not the most dynamic SUV even with its steering and suspension set to their sportiest, but for something so large and so heavy, you still will have quite a bit of fun in the corners. Body control is good and so are grip levels, helped in no small measure by Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system. For max driver thrills, you'll have to wait for the updated version of the fire-breathing RS Q8 that should come to India early next year. 2024 Audi Q8 facelift price and verdict So that, in a nutshell, is the 2024 Audi Q8. Priced at 1.17 crore rupees ex-showroom, it slots in between the outgoing Q8 and Q8 Celebration variant. Also, with the BMW X6 currently not on sale in India and the Mercedes GLE Coupe only sold in AMG form at a much higher price point, the Q8 sits in a sweet spot in the luxury SUV market. The right way to look at a Q8 would be as a fashionable alternative to a BMW X5 or Mercedes GLE. Yes, the update should have filled in the blanks with added features, but the rest of the package remains likeable as ever. So, just as before, for an SUV that's all about size and glamour, the Q8 still offers much to win you over. Also see:   Audi Q8 facelift launched at Rs 1.17 crore",

    "description": "12Cilindri or “doe-dee-chee-chill-in-dree” translates to 12 cylinders in Italian. That’s also the name of the latest Ferrari. Now you might think that’s quite an unimaginative name (though it sounds so much nicer pronounced in Italian) but it’s actually a celebration of 12 cylinders in their purest form. This 6.5-litre V12, carried over from the 812 Competizione, the 12 Cilindri’s predecessor, is the last of a breed. It has no turbos, no hybrid tech, just pure natural aspiration, and it still manages to crank out 830hp at a screaming 9,250rpm. For Ferrari, the V12 is iconic and deeply rooted in its history. The legendary Italian brand has always had a 12-cylinder in its portfolio since 1947 and Enzo Ferrari has always believed that the V12 engine is the only one that can give a car a soul. The 12Cilindri is the last of its breed in a long line of iconic Ferrari GTs.  But not even in his wildest dreams could Enzo ever have foreseen that the V12 would be under threat, on the verge of becoming extinct. In today’s world of electrons, volts and lithium-ion, the naturally-aspirated V12 is a rarity and, fittingly, it is Ferrari that remains as the last big sportscar maker in the world to offer one uncorrupted by turbos or e-motors. The lineage of the 12Cilindri goes back to the 550 Maranello which was followed by the 575, 599, F12 and 812 Superfast. Each of these models was faster and more aggressive than its predecessor with the 812 being particularly extreme. But now there’s been a shift in the positioning of Ferrari’s V12 flagship. The company says the 12Cilindri has a different goal. It’s not to be the fastest or most powerful Ferrari (that mantle has been given to the SF90) but to be the most complete GT or Grand Touring car. That means it’s no more a knife edge (like the 812) but a more rounded car with a wider range of talents. And it’s a car that harks back to tradition, to a bygone era of great design of the 1970s. Ferrarri 12Cilindri: exterior design  The styling is clearly inspired by the 365 GTB/4, the original Ferrari Daytona. The black band across the nose (you can’t have it in body colour) and the set-back headlights pay homage to the original Daytona’s smooth and almost faceless nose. The clean and relatively uncluttered surfaces, the incredibly long bonnet with voluptuous fenders wrapping themselves around massive 21-inch wheels and a cabin that looks like its perched on the rear axle are also strong Daytona influences. Dark front strip and hidden lights hark back to the first Daytona. Modern touches are abundant in the 12Cilindri like the flush door handles, a sharp front lip that protrudes far forward (a worry on Indian roads) and subtle aero bits. The delta-wing roof motif – an innovative design element that combines a part glass roof with a sleek hardtop – looks quite radical, especially from the rear, and may split opinion. The small rear screen does look a touch odd and the large surrounds for the rectangular exhausts looks out of proportion.  Two discreet winglets on either side of the rear deploy between 60 and 300kph, generating up to 50kg of downforce. If you’re wondering why Ferrari didn’t opt for a large rear wing, it’s because that would have compromised the 270-litre boot space – surprisingly generous for a 830hp super coupé. After all, you’ll need room for your designer luggage on those long-distance drives. Two winglets at the outer edges pop up between 50kph and 300kph. The front-hinged clamshell bonnet is an impressive single piece of aluminum that integrates both the front wings and the engine cover. It’s a remarkable engineering feat, designed to fit tightly around the 21-inch front wheels. Lifting this massive bonnet nicely exposes the chunky 275/35 front tyres and also reveals how far behind the front axle the V12 sits – like it’s buried under the windscreen. The 12Cilindri is effectively a ‘front mid-engined car with a near perfect 48.5:51.5 weight distribution biased marginally to the rear. Speaking of weight, the 12Cilindri uses a mix of lightweight materials, largely aluminium and some carbon fibre, to tip the scales at a relatively lightweight 1,560kg dry.  The delta-wing roof motif looks quite radical, and may split opinion.   Ferrari 12Cilindri: interior and features  The 12Cilindri’s cabin uses the same design theme as its front engine siblings, the Roma and Purosangue. There are two distinct ‘zones’ – one for the driver and the passenger. A 15.6-inch digital instrument cluster greets the driver, whilst the passenger gets an 8.8-inch screen which displays the kind of data you’d want to see like speed, revs and g-forces. What’s new is a central 10.2-inch screen which now houses the aircon and seat functions. It sits low down and blends with the dashboard when its off, so it doesn’t distract you, but you have to take your eyes off the road to operate it. Also, the nose lift function is assigned to the central screen. In the Indian context that’s a function that should ideally be on the steering wheel so you can quickly raise the nose when a monstrous speed breaker springs up at you. Dual-zone cockpit looks distinctive; central screen placed low down to avoid distractions.  All other major controls and functions like the turn indicators, wipers, lights and the ‘Mannetino’ drive modes are all housed on the steering wheel. The haptic touch pads, which are common features on modern Ferraris, are fiddly to use even with indents designed to let you ‘feel’ the controls without having to take your eyes off the road. You have all the connectivity features, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (which is wired) as well as a whole suite of ADAS features. Again, like in all newer Ferraris, there’s no in-built navigation system in the 12Cilindri because Ferrari assumes that most owners will plot their route using Google Maps off their phones. 15.6-inch digital instrument cluster has superb clarity. The cabin of the 12Cilindri is impeccably crafted, with premium materials that exude true luxury, without being deliberately minimal in the name of weight saving. The electrically adjustable ‘Goldrake’ seats fitted in this test car are supremely comfortable and a far more practical option than the sportier ‘Daytona’ racing buckets. The transmission ‘gate’ again harks back to a Ferrari tradition, but of course it’s not a manual but operates a new eight-speed DCT gearbox and the launch control function. Transmission 'gate' design a nod to Ferraris of old Sadly, tradition isn’t carried over to the first point of contact with the V12. Instead of a solid, tactile starter button, a haptic touch pad on the steering wheel fires up the engine, which I have to say takes the thrill out of the ignition sequence. Ferrari 12Cilindri: powertrain, performance  Press the haptic button on the steering wheel and the V12 bursts in into life but quickly settles down to a subdued idle. The first thing you notice is that this is not a very loud engine, like it was in the 812. At low revs, it’s certainly softer, with more mechanical and induction sound than a loud exhaust bellow. To hear the 12-cylinder symphony in all its glory, you have to rev the engine all the way to the 9,500rpm redline. V12 placed far behind front axle line for optimal weight distribution. The challenge on the narrow public roads of rural Luxembourg’s test route is finding a stretch where you can safely (and legally) hit the rev limiter beyond the first two gears. However, the shorter ratios of the eight-speed DCT make it easier to redline the engine. Though this smooth and refined V12 loves headbutting the limiter, it’s not something you can do all the time. Most owners will be driving at relaxed revs and that’s where the engine impresses too with its remarkable flexibility. It pulls cleanly and forcefully from as low as 2,000rpm, with power building like a giant wave all the way to the redline. Revving it to 9,500rpm unleashes a spine-tingling crescendo, creating a sensation of endless acceleration. The engine sounds epic when you floor the throttle, its pitch climbing to a high-pitched shriek at max revs. A lot of work has gone into redesigning the exhaust system to make it as sweet sounding as possible. However, some owners might find the aural drama not quite loud enough for their liking. It’s likely that aftermarket exhausts will become a popular upgrade for this car. Driving position is spot on, with all controls at your finger tips. The 12Cilindri is nothing short of shockingly fast too, as the claimed 0-100kph time of 2.9 seconds and a 340kph top speed would suggest. On country roads in Luxembourg, the ferocious pace is amplified and it turns any stretch of tarmac into a blur. The eight-speed DCT is possibly the best twin-clutch auto transmission on the market. It is lightning quick with upshifts that are 30 percent faster than the previous seven-speed DCT. It works quite well in Auto mode too for expressway ‘grand touring’ and, for a gearbox that’s mated to a high strung engine, is remarkably smooth. But then who wants to drive a Ferrari like an automatic? The 12Cilindri is a nicely rounded grand tourer.   Ferrari 12Cilindri: ride and handling  On single-lane country roads, the 12Cilindri feels big, especially with that long bonnet stretching out in front of you. I can imagine this 4.73-metre long and 2.0-metre wide car testing your judgement (and nerves) in the motley mix of Mumbai traffic. The large turning circle doesn’t help whilst parking and its essential to spec the car with the camera system. The steering, geared with under two turns lock-to-lock, is very quick off centre. Maybe too quick, with zero slack, and it takes some getting used to. This is an incredibly agile car that’s brilliantly balanced and is best driven with small and precise steering inputs. The rear-wheel steering makes the 12Cilindri super sensitive to direction changes and it feels like it’s pivoting around the driver, and unlike its mid-engine siblings, it doesn’t feel nervous or edgy. It feels incredibly agile for its size. Ride quality on some of the rare and mildly bumpy roads in Luxembourg was impressive but the true test will be on Indian roads. However, having driven quite a few Ferraris in both kinds of conditions, you can expect the 12Cilindri to soak up mild imperfections without a protest. The magic formula is the  magnetorheological, semi-active dampers which have a ‘bumpy road’ setting and can be activated by merely giving the Manettino dial a simple push. The brake-by-wire system has good bite and a short-travel pedal, which instils huge confidence when you’re driving quickly and something darts in your way. Ferrari 12Cilindri: verdict The 12 Cilindri is surprisingly easy to drive for a car that can otherwise be overwhelming. It’s unquestionably fast and refined at the same time. It’s a bold mix of cutting edge tech and heritage design, which some may find a bit too radical, but it’s undeniably Ferrari’s best GT car, a car that can thrill on both road and track. It’s coming to India next year, and with a price tag of around Rs 7.5 crore, you might want to start saving now. Also See: Ferrari 12 Cilindri video review",

    "description": "The Mini Cooper was one of the first cars to introduce the concept of an affordable, fun-to-drive small car. As time passed, affordability reduced as the new Mini models climbed up into the premium end. But, of course, the fun element remained. In a similar vein, albeit at the other end of the spectrum, is the Maruti Swift. The first generation Swift was fun, and in keeping with Maruti’s ethos, affordable too. However, since the launch of the fourth-generation Swift, there has been a lot of talk about the smaller three-cylinder engine – lacking in power and grunt – and the price climbing higher, reaching levels of its elder sibling, the Baleno. Yes, the price has climbed higher for sure, but as for performance, it hasn’t been an issue for me at all. I say this after using the new Swift as my daily driver for around a month now.  A full-fledged dead-pedal adds to comfort, especially in stop-go traffic. The shape and size are just right for the city, the seats are soft and comfy, and the engine – well, it’s efficient. And that’s always a higher priority when I’m paying fuel bills. Since I got the Swift, I’ve clocked over 1,000km and the average efficiency has always been above 14kpl. And no, I do not drive it with a light foot. To be fair, on many occasions, I can’t. In peak-hour traffic, the engine is more than adequate, but as soon as a few overtakes are on the cards, it needs to be wrung hard. The linear power delivery just doesn’t cut it, and the only quick fix is downshifting. Speaking of which, I had hoped for an automatic after driving the manual Exter for over three months, but the Swift is yet another manual. I would have sulked if it were any other car, but on the Swift, having a manual gearbox is fun. The clutch is superlight and absolutely effortless, the gears slot in well, and you almost forget about the lack of pep from the engine. The seating position is also bang on, and there is a dedicated dead pedal for added comfort. Rear camera quality is average and worsens in the dark. Guidelines not dynamic. What’s a bit of an annoyance is the auto start/stop, which helps save fuel, but in stop-go traffic, the constant shutting off and on will add to the suffering. Thankfully, it just takes a press of a button to turn it off. The other negative is the camera quality. Given the price at which the new Swift has been launched, you would expect a decent parking camera. However, the resolution is poor on the new Swift, and even basics like dynamic guidelines are missing. In the dark, and while it is raining, you cannot rely too much on it. Speaking of darkness, there is no rear cabin light, which I’m guessing helps save some costs, but it is essential. I end up storing shopping bags or small items in the back seat and in case they roll off or I can’t find them, I have to use the phone flashlight. A lamp at the rear would have helped. With an average efficiency of over 14kpl, there’s no range or financial anxiety. The rest of the car, though, has been perfect in the city. The steering is light enough to allow zipping through narrow streets and parking in tight spaces, especially in and around the crowded suburb of Bandra. The boot is more than adequate for a weekend out of the city, the rear seats get dedicated USB-A and type-C charging ports as well as AC vents. LED lights work well in the dark, the ground clearance is plenty, and there is nothing to complain about the ride comfort from the 15-inch wheels. Honestly, the more I drive it, the more I like it. No cabin light in the rear makes it difficult to look for items in the back at night. As an introduction, it has been very positive, and most apprehensions about the dull engine performance fade away. However, once this anniversary issue closes, I’ve planned a getaway out of town, which will involve a whole lot more overtaking and triple-digit speeds. How the engine fares there is what the next report will be on. Also see: 2024 Maruti Swift road test, review Maruti Swift vs Baleno comparison video Maruti Swift CNG launched at Rs 8.20 lakh",

    "description": "Mahindra has been introducing new mass-market SUVs every few months, giving customers a lot of choices. But, this also leads to the piling up of unsold units of outgoing models. Case in point, the XUV 3XO replaced the XUV300 earlier this year and has been doing quite well in terms of sales. However, some dealers we spoke to have a few leftover units of the XUV300. Similarly, unsold stocks from model year 2023 or early 2024 of some other models such as the Bolero, Bolero Neo, XUV700, and the Scorpio N are also being sold with huge discounts this festive season. Mahindra XUV300 Save up to Rs 1.8 lakh The XUV300 has been a decent rival to the Brezza and the Nexon; however, it was marred by its dated looks and lack of cargo space. It came with an acceptable feature list, a refined 1.5-litre diesel engine, and two turbo petrol options. The SUV was not manufactured in MY2024 and was replaced by the XUV 3XO. Unsold XUV300 units are being sold at discounts of up to Rs 1.8 lakh at some outlets that have inventory. There aren’t many units left, which means customers won’t have much choice in selecting their color, variant, or engine option. Mahindra XUV400 Save up to Rs 4.4 lakh The slow-selling XUV400 EV has been available with discounts of over Rs 2 lakh for almost a year now. There are still some units left, most likely from the MY2023 production batches, which are being offered with discounts of up to a whopping Rs 4.4 lakh. Mahindra XUV700 Save up to Rs 1.8 lakh The XUV700 has seen multiple price cuts and feature rejigs this year. While most MY2023 models have been sold, some unsold units are still available with discounts of up to Rs 1.8 lakh, depending on inventory. The comparatively newer MY2024 stock is being offered with discounts of around Rs 40,000. Mahindra Bolero, Bolero Neo Save up to Rs 1.35 lakh The original Bolero has been a steady seller for the brand and is now available at discounts of around Rs 1 lakh on unsold MY2023 stock. The newer MY2024 inventory gets around 35,000 off. The Bolero Neo, on the other hand, is available with discounts of around Rs 1.35 lakh on unsold MY2023 stock. Mahindra Scorpio Classic Save up to Rs 1.2 lakh The Scorpio Classic has its own fan base. Heavily updated after the launch of the Scorpio N, it even comes with 4WD in some variants. Discounts in the range of Rs 1.2 lakh are being offered on older stock, mostly on the MY2023 units of the capable Mahindra SUV. Mahindra Scorpio N Save up to Rs 1 lakh Sales of the popular Scorpio N have plateaued at the moment, and some buyers are now opting for the new Thar Roxx instead. The Scorpio N ticks the boxes for refined engine options, manual and automatic transmission choices, multiple seating configurations, and 4WD hardware in some variants. Discounts of around Rs 1 lakh are available on the SUV this Diwali.

Before the introduction of the LX 700h, the LX SUV was the only Lexus model sans an electrified version. The LX 700h packs a new parallel hybrid tech that combines an electric motor with a twin-turbo, 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine mated to a 10-speed automatic gearbox. The same V6 petrol-hybrid engine will also power the soon-to-be-updated Toyota Land Cruiser 300. Like other LX SUVs, the 700h also has four-wheel drive. Lexus’ preliminary prototype figures put the combined power output at 463hp and 790Nm. As for the updates to the LX line-up, the SUV now has a revamped 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and faster wireless charging pads. Its VIP and Executive variants even boast massage programmes, including full-body and targeted options with varying intensity levels. Lexus has also introduced an off-road-focused “Overtrail” edition for the LX; this edition is also available with a few other Lexus models, including the new Land Cruiser Prado-based Lexus GX. The LX Overtrail sports unique alloy wheels with all-terrain tyres, an exclusive Moon Desert paint, blacked-out grille and other accents, which add to its rugged persona. Its cabin is draped in a low-saturation monolith upholstery with ash burl black accents.  The Overtrail package includes front and rear differential locks, along with the central differential lock, which is standard on all LX trims.

Here’s how much you can save on these models this festive season. Tata Punch EV gets a cash discount worth Rs 20,000 Mid-spec Tiago EV variants get up to Rs 56,000 off Tata Punch EV Save up to Rs 26,000 Tata Motors dealers are offering a Rs 20,000 cash discount, along with corporate discounts of up to Rs 6,000, on the Citroen eC3 rival.

    "description": "Volkswagen has unveiled the new Tayron, which replaces the Tiguan Allspace, offering extra practicality, more onboard tech, and four engine options. This model is essentially the three-row version of the Tayron that was revealed earlier this year at the Beijing Motor Show, where it was named the 'Tiguan L Pro.' Gets four engine options, with 2WD and 4WD PHEV capable of 100km EV-only running Will rival Skoda Kodiaq, Jeep Meridian Volkswagen Tayron: dimensions, interior, features The new Volkswagen Tayron is effectively a new-generation Tiguan that has been stretched by 231mm to bring the option of a third row of seats and an extra 198 litres of boot space. However, the PHEV can't be had with seven seats due to the placement of the 19.7kWh battery under the boot floor. It also loses 18 litres of boot capacity compared to the regular five-seater Tayron’s 885 litres. Inside, the Volkswagen Tayron gets a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. A 15-inch head-up display is available as an optional extra. It also packs in ADAS features such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, Autonomous Emergency Braking, and more. Volkswagen Tayron: powertrain options The new Volkswagen Tayron is being offered with four engine options: a mild-hybrid petrol, a pure petrol, a petrol plug-in hybrid and a diesel – with various power outputs. The line-up opens with the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol mild-hybrid, which sends 150hp through the front wheels. It’s followed by a 2.0-litre turbo petrol with 204hp or 265hp and front- or four-wheel drive. The 2.0-litre turbo diesel can be had in 150hp or 193hp guises – the former with front-wheel drive and the latter with VW’s 4Motion 4WD. Each of these versions is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox as standard. The range-topper is the PHEV, combining a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol, four-cylinder engine with a single electric motor and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The system sends either 204hp or 272hp through the front wheels, and Volkswagen claims an electric-only range of more than 100km for both versions. The 19.7kWh battery can be charged with speeds of up to 50kW DC. Volkswagen Tayron: India launch timeline Deliveries of the new Tayron in the UK will begin in March 2025, with pricing expected to represent a small premium over the Tiguan AllSpace. For India, the new Tayron will be assembled via CKD kits when it’s expected to arrive later in 2025, and will rival the Jeep Meridian and the Skoda Kodiaq, among other similarly priced SUVs.

    "description": "A leaked design patent has revealed that Tata Motors is working on introducing terrain modes for its SUVs. The patent shows a rotary knob with seven different modes, likely to include Snow, Sand and Gravel, or even a Custom mode. The leak suggests that future Tata SUVs, starting with the upcoming Harrier EV, will get an all-wheel-drive (AWD) or even a 4x4 configuration. Future Tata SUVs to get AWD/4x4 Terrain modes include Snow, Gravel, Sand, and more Tata Motors currently retails four front-wheel-drive internal combustion engine (ICE) SUVs: the Nexon, Harrier, Safari and Curvv. At the launch of the Curvv, the company revealed that its new ATLAS (Adaptive Tech Forward Lifestyle Architecture) platform, which underpins the coupe-SUV, can accommodate 4x4, albeit with some changes. While the next-gen Nexon will also be based on ATLAS, the limited demand for 4X4 or AWD SUVs in this segment means that the new terrain modes will likely be omitted in the compact SUV. Another SUV based on the same architecture, the upcoming Sierra, and the Harrier EV will be offered with AWD. It is yet to be seen if an AWD system will make its way to Tata’s ICE SUVs. Do note that terrain modes are different from drive modes (Eco, City, Sport) offered in the Nexon, Curvv, Harrier and Safari. The Harrier and Safari also have traction modes, such as Normal, Rough and Wet. Meanwhile, rivals to the Harrier and Safari, including the Mahindra XUV700, Scorpio N and Jeep Compass, are the only ones in the segment to offer either an AWD or a 4x4 configuration, at least as an option.

    "description": "Yamaha has taken the wraps off its updated 2025 R3 overseas, and while this isn't an entirely new bike, it does carry some significant changes.  Same engine, underpinnings as older bike Now gets a slip and assist clutch, optional quickshifter New LCD brings in Bluetooth connectivity The most obvious change is the new appearance that follows the latest R design philosophy, also seen in the new Yamaha R9. This includes sleek LED DRLs flanking a single projector headlamp housed within a MotoGP-style central air intake, much like the Yamaha R15 V4. The side fairing panels have also been revised to go with the new theme, and Yamaha says they’ve reworked the tail section as well. The mechanical changes are much smaller, with the same high-revving 321cc parallel-twin engine and no significant changes to the chassis either. While Yamaha doesn’t confirm whether the power figures have changed, they do state that the bike now features a slip-assist clutch. This will help improve high-speed riding on the racetrack, but should also result in a lighter clutch lever in the city. Yamaha also offers a quickshifter as an optional extra, although it only works for upshifts since the R3 still uses a cable throttle. Also See: Yamaha R3 review: Capable, simple \u0026 sweet The bike continues with its KYB USD fork and monoshock, and there are no major changes to the riding position. However, Yamaha has made the front section of the rider seat narrower and used slimmer side panels under the seat. The company says that this will help shorter riders get their feet down more easily. That said, the R3 has always been a very friendly bike for short riders, and this change will only improve that.  The final change comes in a new LCD dash. While the R3 continues to miss out on a colour TFT, something that every other rival now offers, this LCD is now Bluetooth compatible. The new Yamaha R3 is available in three colours, two of them being the familiar Team Yamaha Blue and Matt Stealth Black, and the third is a striking new Lunar White/Nebula Blue.  There has been no mention of this bike’s availability in India yet, but a launch sometime next year is reasonable to expect. The Yamaha R3 is currently sold in India as a CBU import and is priced at a rather high Rs 4.65 lakh (ex-showroom, India).   Also See: Aprilia RS 457 vs Yamaha R3 comparison",

    "description": "After receiving a show cause notice from the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) following nearly ten thousand customer complaints, Bhavish Aggarwal-led Ola Electric is now under the scanner of the Ministry of Heavy Industries, which has sought comments from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI).    The ARAI is the testing agency for government initiatives aimed at promoting the use of electric vehicles, and it also issues eligibility certificates under these schemes, namely the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid \u0026) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) and PM E-Drive, which recently replaced FAME-II. Ola Electric is a beneficiary of the PM E-Drive scheme, which provides demand subsidies on the purchase of electric two-wheelers. Its electric scooters – S1 Pro, S1 Air, and S1 X – are eligible for subsidies.   “As per FAME II and PM E-Drive scheme, each OEM is required to maintain service centres to attend to customer issues. Further, a warranty is also provided under these two schemes by all OEMs, including Ola Electric,” the ministry said in a letter to the ARAI. Our sister publication, Autocar Professional, has seen the letter. On Monday, the CCPA issued the show cause notice to Ola Electric, giving it 15 days to respond to charges of violating consumer rights, engaging in unfair trade practices and issuing misleading advertisements.   According to the National Consumer Helpline portal, of the nearly 10,000 complaints received, the most common issues raised by consumers were about service and repair delays, totalling 3,664. There are approximately 1,899 complaints about delays in new vehicle deliveries and 1,459 complaints about promised services that were not delivered.    Also see: Opinion: Ola Electric and the uncomfortable facts",

    "description": "After months of rumours and whispers in the motorcycling community, Yamaha has finally taken the covers off the R9 supersport. The new Yamaha R9 is essentially a sportbike that utilises the MT-09’s feisty triple-cylinder motor and (sort of) replaces the R6 in the line-up.  Same engine as MT-09, makes 119hp and 93Nm of torque New frame, fully adjustable suspension and Brembo brakes Full suite of electronics controlled via 5-inch TFT dash Powering the Yamaha R9 is the much-loved 890cc, 3-cyl motor that makes the same 119hp and 93Nm of torque as its naked counterpart. This engine is largely unchanged, and the only noteworthy difference is in the final drive gearing. That’s where the similarities between the MT-09 and the R9 end, at least from a mechanical standpoint. Housing this engine is a brand-new aluminium Deltabox frame, which weighs just 9.7kg and is claimed by Yamaha to be the lightest on any of its supersport models. Suspension duties are handled by a 43mm KYB USD fork and monoshock (with a handy remote preload adjuster), both of which are fully adjustable and were developed side-by-side with the 2025 R1, claims the Iwata-based company. Braking is handled by a radial Brembo master cylinder and twin Stylema calipers, mated to 320mm front discs and a single-piston caliper paired to a 220mm rear disc.    The R9 uses a 14-litre fuel tank (the same capacity as the MT-09), and when filled up to the brim, it weighs 195kg. This makes it just 2kg heavier than the standard MT-09. As is the case with most supersport bikes today, Yamaha has given the R9 winglets, which do help with downforce at high speeds, but the company hasn’t released any concrete numbers for the same. In typical supersport fashion, the R9 has an aggressive seating position, with a tall seat and clip-ons placed below the top yoke.  Dual-channel ABS is standard, as is a laundry list of other electronic aids. To list them all, the Yamaha R9 has three preset riding modes – Sport, Street, and Rain – accompanied by two fully customisable modes and four Track modes. A six-axis IMU enables cornering functionality for traction control, ABS, slide control, and brake control. Furthermore, it includes lift control, power modes, engine braking modes, and back slip regulator. A bidirectional quickshifter and cruise control are also part of the electronic aids.    All the functions and features of the Yamaha R9 are controlled via a 5-inch colour TFT dash. The display can be connected to a smartphone via Yamaha's MyRide app, allowing the display of phone calls, messages, and other information on the dash. The R9 can be had in three colours – blue, black, and red/white.  Currently, the R9 is offered in only one variant, but it's not out of the realm of possibility that a higher-spec M or SP variant could debut down the line. Yamaha also equipped its Y-AMT gearbox on the MT-09 so that there is a possibility for the R9. Yamaha India has been saying for a long time now that some of its big bikes will come to our country soon, but as of now, nothing has materialised. It remains to be seen if and when the R9 will come here.  Also See: Yamaha MT-09 review: Standard, SP, Y-AMT ridden",

Showing only 176.0 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO II example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example to be the 2nd lowest mileage one in the world, as we are aware of a lower mileage car located inside the borders of Russia. The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II was born out of Mercedes' ambition to dominate the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), Germany’s premier touring car championship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As DTM regulations required manufacturers to base their race cars on production models, Mercedes developed the EVO II as a homologation special, producing only 502 units for road use. Furthermore, the EVO II introduced significant upgrades over the EVO I, primarily in aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling. Its bold, wind tunnel-tested body kit featured a larger rear wing and front splitter for improved downforce and high-speed stability. The 2.5-liter engine was also more powerful, delivering 235 horsepower compared to the EVO I’s 204 hp. The EVO II’s adjustable suspension, larger 17-inch wheels, and enhanced chassis provided sharper handling and a more responsive driving experience, making it better suited for both the track and the road. These refinements solidified its dominance in DTM racing. Continue...",

Country of original delivery: Belgium Chassis/VIN: 13309 Mileage: 6,560 km (4,076 miles) Colour: Rosso Original color of delivery: Marrone Metallizzato 106-M-73 Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, represented the epitome of front-mounted V12 Ferraris from 1968 to 1996. Launched in 1968, it marked the only front-mounted V12, 2-seater Ferrari for almost 30 years. The car featured a 4.4L, 352-horsepower V12 Colombo engine (the penultimate model to utilize this engine), clear-lensed headlights, and circular rear lights. This car, born in stunning Marrone Metallizzato paint (on black interior), benefitted from very special treatment from Ferrari, as it was once owned by a relative of Didier Pirroni (Formula 1 driver for Ferrari in the early 80's), who directly commissioned his employer to perform a nut-and-bolt restoration on this Daytona. This resulted in what is arguably one of the earliest known restoration projects undergone by Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona initially featured fixed headlights behind a plexiglass cover (Plexi) for a sleek, streamlined front-end design. However, in 1971, regulatory changes (particularly in the U.S.) required Ferrari to replace these with pop-up headlights to meet new safety standards, as the Plexi setup was deemed less durable. The change created a subtle design shift, with the Plexi version now considered more desirable among collectors due to its rarity and, arguably cleaner, more distinctive look. Continue...",

    "description": "The first two days of Historic Festival 42 at Lime Rock Park were a thrilling display of racing, showcasing a diverse range of cars from the 1910s to the 2000s, divided into nine distinct categories. Attendees were treated to the rasp and howl of war-era machines like the 1931 Bugatti Type 37 alongside the thunderous roars of the big-bore class. Lime Rock Park, in the Connecticut hills Sunday in The Park, on the other hand, was a captivating event allowing you to savor a moment of peace, quiet, and beauty away from the rowdy days of intense racing. The weather perfectly complemented the day's events, beginning with a cool, overcast morning that evolved into bright, sunny skies by midday. Set against the picturesque backdrop of Lime Rock Park in the Connecticut hills, the event featured an array of classic and vintage automobiles from the likes of motorsport legends such as the BMW E36 M3 3.0 Lightweight and timeless treasures like the 1950 Ferrari Vignale T.51 Deluxe.

    "title": "Want to drive a historic race car on the Goodwood track? You can!",
    "link": "",
    "description": "So you’ve been to Goodwood Revival, or lapped up the TV coverage, and of course you’ve loved it. And if you were there in period dress, you’ve truly been part of it already. But how about really living the experience? How about trying a few of the cars on track? Well that’s now possible, with Goodwood offering corporate track experiences in a variety of historic race cars. Participants on one of these new Goodwood Revival Experience days get to try several (typically eight) very different cars, with instructors sat alongside. This seems quite an opportunity, and we were keen to try it out. The days are run by Goodwood’s Ultimate Driving chief instructor David Brise, not only a driver of some repute, but of the same family that gave us Formula 1 star Tony Brise (sadly killed in the same plane crash that ended Graham Hill’s life), and Tony’s father John Brise, multiple World Stock Car Championship winner. David is keen to point out that these are not out-and-out race cars, but in many cases they’re only one step away, and most have a strong race history. ‘We cater for everyone here, for those who’ve never been on a track to experienced racers. Some of the latter might think “I don’t remember a Mk2 understeering that much”, but these cars still provide a fantastic experience that you won’t get anywhere else.’ Crucially, all have full rollcages and harnesses, and all but the Jaguar Mk2 are on race rubber, Avon CR6ZZs. Mostly, the engines have simply been detuned a little for improved longevity and driveability. As much fun as it sounds to be revving a 1960s engine to 8000rpm, that would result in little or no power below 5000rpm, and an engine life of just a few of these corporate days. To further ensure longevity, the engines are fitted with electronic revlimiters, set 1000rpm below the ideal redline for each car. That means that even if someone changes down too soon, which the revlimiter can’t protect against, it’s still unlikely that the mistake will result in mechanical catastrophe. The downside is that most of these engines hit their limiters at a relatively low 5000rpm, but it’s a fair price to pay for the privilege of driving such valuable machinery, and higher gearing is being investigated for some of the cars. There’s a further twist too, that only Goodwood could get away with: breakfast, briefings, tea breaks, lunch and afternoon tea are all interrupted by ‘Viv the spiv’ and the Goodwood road-mending crew, adding a bit of lighthearted period comedy to an occasion that anywhere else would be rather serious. There’s nothing like a few truly terrible jokes or a pair of ‘workmen’ tripping over a tape measure to dispel pre-track nerves. And if that doesn’t work for you, there are also the ever-smiling Glamour Cabs girls… The price for these corporate sessions start at £12,400 for a half day with a group of 12, up to £20,000 for a full day with a group of 20. Understandably pricey, given that every car has its own dedicated instructor, and every car is valuable and requires meticulous maintenance and preparation. So, onto the fleet – or if you want to find out more, see the Goodwood website 1969 Alfa Romeo Giulia 105 Coupé This is the 2-litre version; it’s on race cams and an open diff! explains David. ‘And it sounds lovely!’ He’s not wrong. It sounds sweet even as we sit in the pitlane awaiting the first session. It’s a gorgeous day, the track is dry and the Alfa feels ready and willing, though in typical Italian style it’s a bit of a stretch to the steering wheel even with the seat set slightly too close for leg comfort. A feeling accentuated by being held in tight by the race harness. The gearstick is long, the shift equally so, but the controls are light, and the engine is tractable enough to make a sharp exit onto the circuit a cinch. There’s no-one else on track yet, so straight over to the left side of the track and then into the first corner, Madgwick, with its double apex. Generally it’s best not to bother getting too close to the first apex but concentrate on getting the second apex correct for a fast exit towards Fordwater. My instructor calmly points out braking points, doesn’t cringe when I miss third gear. The change is not just long but a bit rubbery, and it takes some getting used to. And suggests a gentle lift for the usually flat-out Fordwater while the tyres are still cold. Then it’s into St Mary’s, which is so satisfying when tackled correctly, but in this case I’m still battling the gearchange, and down to Lavant for a long smooth turn out onto the Lavant Straight. The Alfa’s steering is light, and although there’s a little bit of play (as is typical of these Alfas) it still feels precise, aided and abetted by wonderfully taut suspension. Down Madgwick straight, a long stretch to persuade the stick into fifth (I heard someone comment later that fifth was ‘virtually between the instructor’s legs!’) and we probably hit 90-100mph before the revlimiter and the rapidly approaching trickiness of Woodcote end the fun. Brake hard, because Woodcote’s double-apex is harder than it looks, a quick squirt up to the chicane, brake hard again, right-left through the chicane, and past the pits for another lap. After a few more laps, confidence is up, I’m finally mastering the gearchange, and my respect for the Alfa has increased significantly. It’s an absolute pleasure to drive on the track, predictable yet exciting, and despite the race cams it pulls cleanly, loudly singing its Latin song. Fantastico! 1969 MGB Roadster ‘People look at this and think “Oh it’s just an MG” but by the end of the day it’s often the car that they all want another go in,’ says David as he shows us round this understated B Roadster, proudly wearing its works-style glassfibre hardtop. This car shows its race credentials not just in a few light battle scars but in the flimsiness of the lightweight doors and plastic windows, and the rorty exhaust note as the engine fires up. As David goes on to confirm, these seemingly basic FIA-spec MGBs are always much-underrated. And yet it’s a model with Le Mans history and current competiveness in all manner of prestigious international historic motorsport. Of all the cars here, it turns out, it’s the MGB that feels the sportiest just to sit in, because you’re seated low in the cockpit, legs stretched out straight ahead. David jokes that the gearshift requires ‘muscle memory’ because the first-second plane is so close to reverse to the left and to third-fourth to the right. And as with any MGB, the minimal movement from side to side contrasts oddly with the relatively long fore-and-aft of the shift. But it snicks in neatly all the same. The B-series engine is tuned enough to rid it of the unwillingness to rev that defines the standard road car. As a consequence it’s not got a lot of torque low down, but the gear ratios are well-spaced enough for that not to be a problem, and third and fourth are fine for all but the chicane, which needs a quick snick down to second gear. In fact, it couldn’t be easier, even when the rear starts to lose grip a little on Madgwick, because the B’s behaviour is so predictable (in a good way). If there’s any downside to it, it’s that the steering is very heavy, which is a typical MGB trait. It’s mostly due to the unusually high castor angles designed into the MGB’s front suspension. And initially it makes it feel as though the steering is completely dead. Until you re-attune to it – and build some forearm muscle. With more time spent in the MGB, it could feasibly become the car I’d be most comfortable in. And perhaps even quickest in, despite the competition. Never under-estimate an MGB. 1965 Lotus Cortina MkI You might be relieved to hear that this isn’t a genuine Lotus Cortina. But a decent replica, built using the conventional rear axle of later MkIs rather than the slightly fragile A-frame system of the first cars. ‘It’s got the 1600 Lotus Twin Cam engine, all the right suspension, all the bits and bobs,’ confirms David, ‘and it’s really stiff, it feels great to drive.’ Do we agree? Certainly first impressions are good, sat in that airy cabin, its thin pillars making for superb visibility. The white-painted dashboard adds to the light, bright feel, and who wouldn’t appreciate those four gauge pods spread across the centre of the fascia? This is an iconic machine, or a damned good replica of one at least. The gearshift is typical rear-wheel-drive Ford. Short, precise, wonderfully mechanical without feeling overly notchy. Slot it into first, thumbs up from the pitlane marshals, and we’re off. Immediately it feels completely natural to drive. All the controls matched in weight, all perfectly placed, and within half a lap this feels like The One. At every turn it does exactly what you’d expect it to do, its stiff suspension keeping everything in line. You know it will bounce a little and slide when pushed hard but there’s never a nasty surprise here. The engine revs freely, sounding wonderful as its twin sidedraughts gobble in air, but the revelation is the steering, which is lighter and more precise than any 1960s steering box has a right to be. Downsides? The gearing. It’s so low, which would work fine if it was running a race engine, capable of revving to 7-8000rpm (and needing a rebuild every few races). But with the limiter knocking back the power at 5000, the four-speed Cortina is best kept in top for much of the circuit. David is considering raising the gearing, though the downside might be to lose some of that sweetness of response. In fact, low gearing is a small price to pay for the chance to experience a Lotus Cortina on track, replica or not. What a superb machine. 1968 Porsche 912 ‘We’ve only just got this one,’ says David. ‘It’s a 912, so has the four-cylinder engine, not the 911’s six-cylinder – a lot of people claim it’s a Beetle engine, but having had this one apart, and seen the parts prices, I can assure you it’s all Porsche!’ Early short-wheelbase 911s are hugely soughtafter for historic racing and rallying, and of course hugely expensive to match. The 912s look identical, and the smaller, lighter four-cylinder engine makes for much better weight distribution and safer handling, at the cost of losing that six-cylinder wail. This one is currently built to quite a basic specification, and I’ll admit it feels tame compared with most of the others. But the chance to drive an early Porsche round a circuit is not to be sniffed at. And the experience is significantly different from the rest. It starts from the driving position. Cab-forward, feet offset to the centre, accelerator pedal hinged from its base, the long gearlever protruding from a near-flat floor. And sporting a dogleg-first shift pattern, meaning that second is where first would normally be, third where second would be, etc. Oh, and the engine fires up with an air-cooled thrum that could only be Porsche. Or Volkswagen… The gearshift movement is long and rubbery, but it’s never a problem to find the right gear. The accelerator action feels heavy and initially a little awkward, but the clutch, brake and steering are delightfully light and feelsome. In fact, that steering could easily be the best here; on track, it feeds back every undulation, every camber change, in a way that only an early Porsche can. We’re making decent progress, circulating the track smoothly and undramatically, with everything working exactly as it should. The handling feels predictable, none of the famous tail-waywardness showing through at these speeds – and in fact, the 912 is far less prone to that – and the grip through corners is tenacious as long as the car is powered through, keeping weight over the rear. The engine feels strong, unburstable, but undramatic, even when revving hard. And it’s this aural effect, along with the sheer competence of the 912, that makes it perhaps the least exciting of all the cars here – but with more time to explore its abilities, I feel that might change. 1968 Mini Cooper MkII And now for something completely different… Though just how different the Mini would feel is astonishing. ‘A Mini Cooper is really the pinnacle of the St Mary’s Trophy,’ says David, ‘and you’ll see them in fantastic David and Goliath battles with Ford Falcons and Mk2 Jaguars. The front tyres do everything, the rears don’t do anything. You could leave them on for 25 years and they wouldn’t wear out.’ This sounds odd in the extreme. Time to find out. Another airy cabin, this one admittedly rather smaller than the Cortina’s, though the speedometer still feels far, far away in the centre of the dash. The steering wheel, famously, is closer to the horizontal than the vertical plane; since (Mini) time began, the position has been compared with that of a London bus. Still, all else is fine, and everything feels perfectly normal as we pull away down the pitlane and buzz onto the circuit, the little A-series – this one bored out to 1310cc – already revving hard. Mindful of David’s advice, I keep steering movements to the minimum to turn into Madgwick, and yet – whoah! – the little car still turns in far more sharply than expecting, seeming to pivot around the engine as if there’s nothing behind it at all. Disconcerting, because I’m behind it… I have to correct the steering to avoid turning into the kerb, which prompts another larger than expected move across the track. Remember when you first tried a driving game console, and watched your virtual car swing from side to side as your thumb/brain struggled to master the required subtlety of movement? Well that’s how this feels. A few corners in, and it becomes clear. There’s no movement in the suspension, just none at all, and the car’s wheelbase is a mere two metres, and so even the tiniest steering input produces a marked change of direction. Back off the power mid-corner and the rear tyres unload and let go, so the technique is to brake lightly, use the tiniest movement of the steering wheel to turn in, then power through the corner. Seasoned Mini racers will set the car sideways on the entry to the corner and half slide, half bounce through, usually nipping past several cars in the process. However you do it, you can’t fail to have fun. That A-series engine may be basic but it keeps revving away as you tear round the circuit, breathless and giddy from the mix of excitement and hilarity of the Mini driving experience. If you’ve never driven a race-spec Mini on a track before, add it to your bucket list now. Right now. 1960 Jaguar Mk2 3.4 From the sublime… to the Mk2, which it would be tempting to say is as far from the Mini as it’s possible to get, except that the huge Ford Falcon looms large in the distance. Still, the Mk2 provides a remarkable contrast with the Mini, particularly with its opulent interior still intact. ‘It’s the oldest car here,’ says David. ‘In the 1960s, these cars turned up to circuits still with all the leather and walnut. By the mid-1960s, the racers had realised how much was to be gained by losing weight, and they started stripping them out. ‘This Mk2 is really heavy, and you’ll notice that the steering feels a little vague, but the engine is like a little Swiss watch.’ Turns out, he’s almost doing the Mk2 an injustice. It’s another of those cars, like the Lotus Cortina, that feels perfectly natural to drive – it’s just in the Mk2, it has to be driven into the corners at lower speeds… What’s most apparent, though, is how smooth everything about the Mk2 feels. The way it rides, the quality of the controls, the seamless revving of that wonderful engine, and even the steering. The Mk2 has had little more than the rollcage fitment in terms of track preparation, and yet it sails around the circuit as if it were made for it. Boy does it need some steering input though, especially after the twitchy Mini. The weight of the Mk2 and comparatively soft suspension pushes it into inevitable understeer, and in the tighter turns it’s a challenge to twirl the steering wheel enough to persuade the car through. The Vredestein tyres (this is the only car not on the grippier Avons, in deference to its wire wheels) squeal in protest but it makes it every time, and just hunkers down again out of the corner to power along the straights on its long-legged gearing. No top speed frustrations with this one. So, different from the rest but good fun regardless. And every time I think of it, I’m reminded of that remarkable engine, so wonderfully, effortlessly smooth. 1964 Ford Falcon Well if the Jaguar was ridiculous after the sublime Mini, how about a 5-litre Yank Tank? David explains that ‘it’s set up like a race car except one thing – it came with an automatic gearbox on a Hurst [aftermarket] shifter, and we’ve left it in.’ He also mentions that ‘the brakes feels like pressing concrete’ and ‘if it starts to slide, it takes a lot to get it back!’. Hmm… Ever used a Hurst shifter? It’s a wonderful thing. Despite the length of the shifter in the Falcon, each gear selects with a short, precise movement, clicking into place, so it would be perfectly feasible to shift between first, second and third. But today, why not make it a bit easier… from Park to Reverse (click) to Neutral (click) and into Drive (click). The V8’s idle drops slightly, the transmission strains to be let off the leash. We’re waved onto the track, and the big Falcon picks up immediately, shifting quickly into second as it powers towards Madgwick. A shove on the brakes (and they really do need a big shove) and a tentative turn into the corner, ready for a rolling, rollicking experience. But no, the Falcon turns in more precisely, and with way less roll than any car weighing one and a half tonnes should ever achieve. In fact, that huge expanse of near-flat bonnet stretching out ahead remains, well, near-flat through the corners, only showing any significant lean through the chicane. Of course, the weight is always apparent, never more so than at Lavant, when an earlier turn-in is needed than for the smaller saloons, and even then the Falcon pushes wide, threatening to run over the kerbing until it powers out the other side, its 302cu-in V8 thundering as it revs out in second gear. And the auto ‘box? Remarkable really. David says that a lot of customers find it a relief to be able to concentrate on the track. And on steering the car, rather than worrying about gears, and it’s very easy to see their point. All you need to remember is that the three-speed Borg-Warner won’t shift up if your foot is flat on the accelerator due to the kickdown function (just lift momentarily and it will quickly change up a gear). Sure it would be more fun with a manual, but if hustling a car the size of a small house around a tight English circuit isn’t fun, I’m not sure what is. 1965 BMW 1800 TI/SA There was just one disappointment of the day, and that was that we didn’t get to drive the BMW. Fear not, this was only because our day was cut short for the interviews. And photoshoot necessary to bring you this very feature, so you’ll get more time. All the same, it’s worth knowing about this car, because it’s a bit special. In the mid-1960s. BMW built homologation specials for touring car racing based around the 1800TI, called the 1800 TI/SA. It had 20bhp extra, thanks to twin Weber carburettors, larger inlet valves, hot camshaft and a higher compression ratio. It was also fitted with a five-speed ZF gearbox in place of the standard car’s four-speeder, uprated suspension and brakes. And a sportier interior. In the hands of Hubert Hahne and Rauno Aaltonen in particular, the TI/SA achieved notable successes. This car isn’t a genuine SA but a replica, good enough to have FIA papers. And accurate right down to having the interior painted a different colour (red) from the exterior, just as the works cars were. ‘When it came to us it was fitted with a full race engine,’ says David. ‘It would rev up to 8500 but there was nothing below 4500. We’ve had to detune it to make it more suitable for our purposes, but it’s still really exciting to drive – and so noisy!’ The Goodwood Revival Experience Wistfully watching the BMW circulate the track as time ticked by, it was clear that it was making swift progress. And all who drove it said how well it performed, though even with the correct dogleg-first ZF gearbox. The low overall gearing meant that it was hitting the revlimiter on the Lavant Straight. If you’re lucky enough to sample the Goodwood Revival Experience. Be sure not to overlook the apparently humble BMW. It may well surprise you.

    "description": "You can't overstate the importance of the Mini to a certain generation of British drivers. Most often, there was a Mini in the family. It was the car you learned to drive in. Then another – likely more battered – example would have been your first car. That emotional thread runs through your automotive psychology like the stitching in a pair of jeans. Car of the 20th Century: Mini A Mini is ordinary. For the owner of this car, Will Yearsley – and for me come to that – it's the most ordinary vehicle of our youth. Except of course it isn't. It's anything but ordinary. The Mini got itself voted, in more than one authoritative poll, the “Car of the 20th Century”.   With justification. Because of the Coopers, the Monte Carlo Rally wins, and its ability to beat much more powerful cars in track racing. Because of its place in London's swinging ’60s scene. And also for the vastly significant engineering innovations that make it a piece of packaging genius, and – now as then – a particular kind of joy to drive.  So Yearsley has acquired some Minis. Not a barn full of quasi-random examples, but a perfectly curated capsule collection.   It starts with a ‘proper’ 1969 1275cc Cooper S, in almond green with an old english white roof. That was the heyday of the ADO15 Mini's four-decade production span. During the 1980s the Mini frankly became a bit of a laughing stock as a new car: full-featured modern superminis had displaced it in the general public's eyes.  It got a new lease of life during the 1990s as Rover, Mini's owner, saw its potential as a left-field curio and moved it out of the mainstream market. John Cooper returned to add some sparkle. So Yearsley also has one of those, one that actually once belonged to the Cooper family.  He's also got the maddest of the BMW Minis, a John Cooper Works GP3, the wide-arched one with 306HP and a 164mph top speed. But then he wanted a Mini that was truly his own. So he commissioned his fourth, a Mini Remastered by David Brown Automotive. These are ground-up restomods, building an original identity into an entirely new car. (Oh, the name… David Brown is a British industrialist but no relation to David Brown, the late British Industrialist who once owned Aston Martin.)  Yearsley's is registered and chassis-plated as a 1989 Sprite, one of Rover's more feeble limited editions. Its origin is wholly irrelevant to our story, except that the 1989 identity allows it to swerve some bothersome new-car legislative constraints. That time-slipping has also enabled DBA to sell several of its Remastered cars to the Americas. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "1967: it was the summer of love. And a busy time for the Ferrari 330 P4, arguably the sexiest race car ever designed. The world of motorsport is filled with legendary vehicles, but few can match the allure and mystique of the 1967 Ferrari 330 P4. And more specifically chassis 0856, the only one (among the three built) that never got any damage or modification. In short, the current chassis 0856 is pretty much the same that it was in 1967. One Sexy Beast \"One Sexy Beast\", as we claimed when we created our film about chassis 0856, a few years ago at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Canada. Revered as one of the greatest racing cars ever built, this specific P4 not only represents a pinnacle of engineering excellence but also carries a rich history that includes an array of noteworthy owners. Its story is a testament to Ferrari's ingenuity, competitive spirit, and timeless appeal. But what has happened to this specific unit? In this feature story, we are trying to keep up with Miss Universe 1967. [embed]https://youtu.be/awArTC8iQ3Q?si=XEFCOD6_X6OvFw9j[/embed] Origins of the Ferrari 330 P4 But first, some context. The mid-1960s marked a period of intense rivalry in the world of endurance racing. Ferrari, with its illustrious history and competitive edge, was locked in a fierce battle with Ford, whose GT40 had been making significant strides on the racing circuit. To reclaim its dominance, Ferrari developed the 330 P4, a car designed to be the ultimate racing machine. This vehicle would become one of the most iconic sports prototypes ever created. A Design Masterpiece The Ferrari 330 P4 was an evolution of the 330 P3, with substantial improvements aimed at enhancing performance, handling, and aerodynamics. The body was designed by Pininfarina, featuring an elegant yet aggressive profile. With its sleek lines, low-slung stance, and distinctively wide rear, the P4 exuded an aura of speed even when standing still. Underneath its stunning exterior, the 330 P4 housed a 4.0-liter V12 engine. This engine was a marvel of engineering, producing around 450 horsepower. It incorporated advanced features such as a double overhead camshaft (DOHC), Lucas fuel injection, and a 12:1 compression ratio. Paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, this powertrain enabled the P4 to achieve blistering speeds and impressive agility on the track. Cutting-Edge Aerodynamics and Engineering The chassis of the 330 P4 was crafted from tubular steel, with fiberglass body panels providing a lightweight yet robust frame. The car's suspension system featured independent suspension with wishbones and coil springs, ensuring optimal handling and responsiveness. Ventilated disc brakes offered superior stopping power, a crucial factor in the demanding world of endurance racing. Aerodynamics played a pivotal role in the P4's design. Every curve and contour was meticulously shaped to minimize drag and maximize downforce. The car's streamlined nose, curved windshield, and strategically placed air intakes contributed to its exceptional aerodynamic efficiency, allowing it to glide through the air with minimal resistance. The Glory of Chassis 0856 Among the three Ferrari 330 P4s produced (plus the P3 converted to P4 specs), chassis 0856 is the most celebrated, having played a crucial role in Ferrari's racing triumphs during the 1967 season. Like we mentioned above, its current condition is pristine and to its original specifications. The 1967 season was a critical year for Ferrari. The team aimed to reclaim their status as the undisputed leaders in endurance racing, and the 330 P4 was at the forefront of this mission. Chassis 0856 was a key player in this endeavor, contributing significantly to Ferrari's success. Continue...",

She and Gabriel Perez have won this race before. Now, they are trying to win it again. However, racing 2,000 miles in seven days is tough, with their 1954 Studebaker Commander. Furthermore, mechanical problems might steal their podium, but a team with passion never gives up.

All these conspire to make the Carrera Panamericana seven-day endurance event wild and grueling. The Carrera Panamericana is a Mexican motorsport challenge like no other. It remains the most challenging open road race in the world. Drivers from across the globe come to race through Mexico’s rugged mountains and beautiful cites.

    "link": "",
    "description": "What does the collector car community need more than anything else? Young technicians, of course. There is a severe lack of youths finding themselves in automotive restoration positions. Without the hands needed to repair, maintain, and preserve classic vehicles, car culture has a real employment crisis on its hands. Yet paradoxically, there are more than enough young. And passionate car enthusiasts considering a career with classic cars. So, what’s the problem? Why aren’t these young people ending up in exciting car careers? Unfortunately, overcoming the hurdles required in order to make it as a budding technician is extremely challenging. Not to mention leaving no practical means to enter the trade. This is where the Piston Foundation enters the chat. [avatar user=\"Piston Foundation\" size=\"120\" align=\"left\"  link=\"https://pistonfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\"][/avatar] Visit the Piston Foundation website The solution The Piston Foundation was founded in 2021 to solve the workforce shortage plaguing the collector car community. We’re creating a career pathway that will support aspiring technicians from the classroom to the car shop floor. Here’s how we aim to do it: The Piston Scholarship provides financial aid to those enrolled in a 2- to 4-year auto tech or restoration program. Technical education is expensive and those tuition costs can pose a real barrier to entry into the world of cars. Students who apply and are accepted for a scholarship may receive up to $5,000 to help fund their automotive education. To date, we’ve granted scholarships to 33 promising students and are looking forward to announcing our 2024 class of scholars later this summer. The Piston Academy Apprenticeship takes hands-on training to the next level by taking qualified restoration graduates and placing them in a full-time job at a Piston-partnered shop. Even graduates from the best restoration programs won’t have gained all the necessary hands-on experience to land a full-time, billable job. As such, the biggest barrier new apprentices face is the disparity between what they can be paid in an entry level role and the cost of living needed to reside in their city of work. The Piston Academy’s apprenticeship program provides a training grant so apprentices can gain the necessary work experience and shops can afford to invest in a new wave of talent. The apprenticeship is currently in a trial stage with a widespread model potentially slated for 2025. [embed]https://youtu.be/XLJkpbIr0Go?si=jc1HHLmiUpk8Vgrz[/embed] How does the Piston Foundation measure the success and impact of its programs and initiatives? Asking the question to Piston Foundation President and COO Jeff Mason: \"The Piston career initiative supports aspiring technicians with both education and job networking. This way, they can learn the skills that earn them a job in the collector car industry. We measure our success by the number of scholarship applications we receive, the number of returning Piston Scholars,  the school-year completion rate of our scholars, and the number of graduated Piston scholars working in the industry. Since our career program began in 2022, Piston has awarded 53 scholarships totaling $197,500 to auto restoration students at schools in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and our applicants have come from 37 states. In 2024, Piston received its highest number of scholarship applications yet, indicating a strong interest in these careers. Nine of this year’s 20 scholars have earned an award more than once, with one three-time recipient. The completion rate of Piston Scholars since 2022 is 98% and all nine of our scholars who have graduated from their school programs are now working in the industry. The Piston career initiative is making the impact our donors want to see by creating a pipeline of talent who will help the car community continue to thrive.\" Continue...",

    "title": "Jaguar XJR-15 LM: The most radical supercar you've never heard of",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Jaguar XJR-15 LM was a marvel of engineering that embodies the spirit of Jaguar's racing heritage. Its exclusivity, performance capabilities, and unique design made it a legendary vehicle among automotive aficionados and a true icon of its era. But it was (and still is) so rare than it's almost impossible to find documentation or even photos about this supercar. To tell the story of the Jaguar XJR-15 LM, we need to travel back to the 1980s, a decade when car design was radically taking off. While Japan was innovating with sports car, or in the US which was perfecting boring economy cars, let's focus in on Great Britain. Where the story starts: the 80s and Le Mans The 1980s Le Mans races were a full-on war. Porsche was dominating with the 1985, 1986, and 1987 Le Mans wins under their belt. But slowly, under the surface, you could see Porsche slipping, desperate to stay at the top. In ‘85, Porsche finished first through fifth, all winners running the legendary 962C. Just two short years later, at the 1987 Le Mans, Porsche had lost two spots out of the top five to Cougar and their C20, and Jaguar with their XJR-8. The pivotal moment came in the 1988 race. Jaguar stunned everyone by snatching first place from the infamous king Porsche, with their XJR-9 LM. Tom Walkinshaw racing (TWR) was the team that ran Jaguar’s cars in motorsport, and the road cars under the Jaguar Sport brand, a joint venture between TWR and Jaguar. They were the ones running the XJR-9 LM and so, with the newly gained fame from toppling the Germans from their throne, TWR set out to create a supercar that the XJ220 dreamed of being. Here comes the XJR-15 This led to the development of the XJR-15. The story goes that wealthy enthusiasts approached TWR wanting a road legal XJR-9, which certainly wasn’t a thing. So TWR reused the old engine the XJ220 was supposed to use, a 6.0 liter V12, and stuffed it into the chassis that the XJR-9 used, creating a 490 HP beast. They brought Peter Stevens on board to help design the outside of this raging beast, the same Peter Stevens who designed the holy McLaren F1 later on, and he was given a blank slate to use his magic on. [embed]https://youtu.be/FKbVQEBuemQ?si=02ilW7cRaxQs3QqY[/embed] Well, that's the XJR-15, albeit heavily summarized. Interestingly, it came with a communication system with headsets and a microphone which both the driver and passenger wear to communicate, as that massive screaming V12 behind you isn't the conducive to small talk. Now, let's talk XJR-15 LM. Information regarding this car is scarce online, which is personally makes it so interesting. This is, I feel, the most complete record of the car on the internet, creating a definitive guide. Continue...",

And racing something no one has ever seen at La Carrera, the world-famous Le Mans car, the GT40. It’s a big risk, but if the car survives and the fans like it, it will all be worth it. A they made a film about the whole adventure in Mexico: GT40 Panamericano We are launching our new series \"Classic Racing\" with this first film produced by our partners at Driving La Carrera. This is the first segment of many more to come in this series. And what better way to start that the a legendary car, the Ford GT40, at a legendary event, La Carrera Panamericana. The Classic Racing series is dedicated to the beauty of race vehicles of all ages, and the emotional connection we this still have with them. Only one condition: regardless of their age, those cars and bikes still have to race, no excuse!

La Carrera Panamericana Revival The Carrera Panamericana was revived in 1988 with increased safety requirements. Mandated equipment and clothing rivals that used in Formula One and Indy. Today it is run as a stage race, similar to the original, but with a combination of “speed” stages and “transit” stages. Speed stages are timed, closed-road races that require entrants to get from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time. This requires driving flat out along winding mountain roads that pass through small villages, along cliffs, and through wooded sections of forest. There is a reason the roll-cages used are thicker than in other races - the 500-foot drop offs have something to do with it. Transit stages are run as a time-speed distance (TSD) rally, with driver and navigator attempting to finish a stage at a specific time. The combination of scoring in both types of stages determines the overall winner. More reading about La Carrera Panamericana No Race On Earth Is Like La Carrera Panamericana Continue...",

    "title": "Top 10 Motorsport Films",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Motorsport films captivate audiences by combining high-speed action with dramatic storytelling, offering a thrilling glimpse into the world of racing. Classics like \"Le Mans\" (1971) with Steve McQueen, and \"Grand Prix\" (1966), deliver realistic portrayals of legendary races and drivers. Hits like \"Rush\" (2013) highlight intense rivalries and historical battles in motorsport. Motorsport films such as \"Senna\" (2010) provide an intimate look at the lives of iconic racers. While motorsport films like \"Days of Thunder\" (1990) emphasize the excitement and danger of racing culture. Together, these motorsport films celebrate the passion, competition, and human stories that define the thrilling world of motorsport. 10. Days of Thunder Days of Thunder may have assembled the old band back together. But even with the director, producers and leading man Tom Cruise carrying over, Top Gun did not seamlessly transfer to terre ferme. But in its favour, the NASCAR adrenaline hit is an easy-to-watch Hollywood thriller. It’s by no measure a masterclass in subtlety as young and raw talent Cole Trickle tries to make it on America’s ovals. But with that said, the cast ensemble is impressive and the movie’s pacing spot on. As an appreciation of the USA’s biggest motorsport, it’s a far better production that Talladega Nights. PetroFact: The film lent its name to the short-lived Days of Thunder ASCAR series that raced around Rockingham Motor Speedway in the mid-2000s. 9. McLaren Opening onto the McLaren M8D Can-Am racer and listening to its rumbling Chevrolet V8 is a lesson in how to engage an audience. With plenty of footage and audio to celebrate the life and legacy of company founder Bruce McLaren, the film tracks humble origins through to F1 and Can-Am success. Former mechanics of the company are drafted in to explain what made the man so great and why they had such undivided loyalty to him. The recreation of some scenes is jarring at times but to say this is nitpicking is testament to how good the film is. PetroFact: Footage is used from the classic American Western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 8. Truth in 24 (I and II) In the same year Death Race was released, Jason Statham was back to narrate 2008’s Truth in 24. Another attempt as honing in on what makes the 24 Hours of Le Mans so special. The movie follows Audi Sport in its attempt to take the spoils of glory for a fifth consecutive year despite the threat of newly established rival Team Peugeot. Director Keith Crossrow is open that he was not a racing fan when he took on the role. And it shows, but all for the better as it appeases audiences regardless of their interests. PetroFact: Statham was an Audi brand ambassador following the release of Transporter 3 in which he pilots an A8. 7. 1 1 celebrates F1’s safety crusade. You watch the opening laps of the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as Martin Brundle’s Jordan is launched into the air before coming to a rest upside down. Able to clamber out of the wreckage and run back to the pit-lane. He hops in the spare car to take the race restart. From there, audiences are taken back in time and guided through the landmark fatalities and safety step changes that helped make 200mph crashes survivable. It’s a perfectly judged tone but what makes the film stand out are the interviews. Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley and Sid Watkins all star. PetroFact: 1 is narrated by Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender 6. Ford v Ferrari Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a riveting biographical drama that chronicles the intense rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari, culminating in the historic 1966 Le Mans race. Directed by James Mangold, the film stars Matt Damon as visionary automotive designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as fearless driver Ken Miles, capturing their collaboration to create a revolutionary race car, the Ford GT40. The movie excels in its dynamic portrayal of high-speed racing and the personal struggles of its protagonists, though some critics argue it simplifies complex historical events for dramatic effect. Overall, Ford v Ferrari delivers a thrilling and heartfelt exploration of friendship, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence in the face of corporate and personal adversity. PetroFact: To authentically recreate the high-speed action of the Le Mans race, the production team used a mix of practical effects and CGI. However, the actors often found themselves in real cars, racing at significant speeds on the tracks. 5. Ferrari For us, Michael Mann's Ferrari is an instant classic. Released at the end of 2023, this biographical drama delves into the tumultuous life of Enzo Ferrari, during the pivotal summer of 1957. Starring Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari, Penélope Cruz as Laura Ferrari, and Shailene Woodley as Lina Lardi, the film explores Ferrari's personal and professional challenges, including his strained marriage, financial struggles, and the high-stakes world of auto racing. The narrative is set against the backdrop of the Mille Miglia, that becomes a symbol of both Ferrari's ambition and the tragic consequences of his relentless pursuit of success. Mann's direction captures the high-octane energy and the nuanced emotional landscapes of the characters. Critics have praised the performances, particularly Driver's portrayal of Ferrari, for capturing the complexity of a man driven by passion and haunted by loss. \"Ferrari\" offers a visually stunning and compelling glimpse into the world of racing and the man behind the brand, making it a must-watch for car enthusiasts and fans of historical dramas. The only problem we had with the film is that it was too short - we wanted more! PetroFact: During the filming of \"Ferrari\", Michael Mann sought authenticity and realism, especially in the depiction of the famous Mille Miglia race scenes. To achieve this, Mann shot everything in Italy and collaborated with Ferrari enthusiasts and owners who owned vintage Ferraris from the era depicted in the film.

Senna It’s thanks to Senna that many motorsport films have followed in its wake in recent times. Capturing the ill-fated career of one of motorsport’s greatest icons reignited the hunger for delving into racing’s past. It’s not perfect, however. The need to cast a villain in every film results in a scathing and misleading portrayal of Senna’s closest rival Alain Prost. And to those not well-versed in Senna’s driving talents, perhaps the politics he faced outweighs the screen time given to him driving on the limit. Nevertheless, it’s worthy of its place on this list and was received with huge critical and commercial success. PetroFact: The film raked in £375,000 on its opening weekend, a UK box office record for a documentary. 3. Rush Retelling the story of the inimitable 1976 Formula 1 season, Rush follows the championship rivalry between McLaren’s James Hunt and Ferrari driver Niki Lauda. The story of a flawed playboy versus Lauda’s recovery from a near-fatal crash at the Nürburgring and of taking title glory down to the wire was always going to make for a great script. Directed by Ron Howard, of Happy Days and Apollo 13 fame, it’s aimed squarely at the motorsport apathetic. It’s exciting and visually stimulating but takes Hollywood-style liberties in recounting the past. Perhaps it’s not a purist’s favourite, but Rush is undeniably entertaining. PetroFact: Many of the cars featured were prepared and driven by historic racing specialist Hall and Hall. It’s based in the small town of Bourne, home to 1962 F1 constructors champions BRM. 2. Le Mans He may have relinquished a starring role in Grand Prix due to conflicts with the crew, but five years later Steve McQueen starred in the motorsport film he had always wanted to make. There’s a certain pleasure to be derived in knowing that the main star was a true motoring enthusiast. And that shows throughout the movie as Le Mans captures the scale, emotions and danger of the world’s greatest race. McQueen is as close to perfect in the role as is his co-starring Porsche 917. But like many on this list, it’s definitely a harder sell to mainstream cinema-goers. PetroFact: All the Ferraris featured had to be privately sourced as the marque wouldn’t lend its cars to the film depicting a Porsche victory. 1. Grand Prix It’s far too long and is interspersed with a contrived love story, but nevertheless, Grand Prix is a class act. Its main asset is that it’s the cars and circuits that star, not the actors. Although it was released in 1966, the film still feels remarkably fresh and that’s mostly down to the stunning picture quality and visceral engine notes. There’s fun to be had spotting the cameo appearances from various 1960s grand prix drivers, and there’s plenty of time to get it right with a near three-hour running time. PetroFact: Steve McQueen withdrew his interest from the lead role, which ended up going to James Garner, his next door neighbour. Continue...",
