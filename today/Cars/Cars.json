    "description": "The Indian monsoon is nothing to be trifled with when it comes to waterproof gear, so a little before its onset this year, I purchased the Viaterra P300 waterproof liner. I’ve used enough Viaterra products by now to know that they work as intended, which is why I splurged on the P300. There are more affordable rain liners from Viaterra if you’re on a tight budget. Wearing a rain liner over an armoured riding jacket is cumbersome – there’s no two ways about it. But the P300 eases things to quite an extent. For example, the cuffs are nice and wide, enough so that even if I’m wearing my Grid full-gauntlet gloves, my hand can also slip through without a second thought. Then, there is the inner mesh lining, which helps with comfort as it lets the P300 slide over your jacket instead of bunching up in areas. It also makes the rain jacket easier to get on and off. But by far, the most helpful feature is the zipped vents on the front of the jacket. I’ve found that even in the heaviest of downpours, it’s best for my comfort to keep them fully open, and since there is a Velcro closure that keeps the top and bottom of the zip closed, there’s no water ingress at all. Vents allow good airflow, and the zipper is easy to use. In fact, I remember using this exact trick when I was efficiency-testing the Bajaj Freedom CNG bike at slow-moving Mumbai city speeds for nearly three hours with the P300 on in the pouring rain, and I remember being pleasantly surprised by the airflow that was allowed through to me. This is what makes it worth the extra money for me. My only gripe is that this jacket is slightly shorter at the front, which Viaterra has done to prevent the jacket from bunching and pooling water. On the one hand, Rishaad liked this feature in his P300, but I found that the bottom two inches of my riding jacket got wet in continuous heavy rain. Perhaps the next iteration can have a slight increase in the length. Another point is that the hood is removable, which is a great feature, but it would be nice if there was a pocket or some provision in the jacket to store it. At Rs 2,499, the Viaterra P300 is the most expensive of the made-in-India rain liners, but after staying dry as well as reasonably cool for this past monsoon, I can confidently say it’s well worth the investment.

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "The Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ is a hybrid sports sedan that packs in supercar-rivalling performance for a price of Rs 1.95 crore (ex-showroom). Yes, Mercedes is asking for double the price of an AMG C 43, but is the C 63 twice the car? To find the answer and get a taste of its track capabilities, we experience it on the Buddh International Circuit. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ performance What gave the previous editions of the C 63 an almost legendary status were their manic V8 petrol engines. In this iteration, though, Mercedes has plonked in a 2-litre turbo-petrol unit. But it isn’t a run-of-the-mill engine – its M139L is the most powerful four-cylinder in the world. It carries forward the F1 tech from the C 43 sedan, such as the electric exhaust gas turbocharger, wherein a small electric motor spins up the turbo even before the exhaust gases gush in, thereby eliminating turbo lag. But it gets a larger turbo, which takes the max output to 476hp/545Nm, an increase of 68hp/45Nm over the C 43. The M139L is the most powerful four-cylinder engine in the world. The talking point of this car, however, is its plug-in hybrid technology, which comprises a rapidly charging/discharging 6.1kWh battery and an electric motor on the rear axle that develops a peak output of 204hp/320Nm under full boost. Interestingly, the electric motor is mated to a 2-speed gearbox – one gear for acceleration up to speeds of 140kph and the other capable of supporting the engine up to 280kph. The C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+, being a plug-in hybrid, has a charging provision on the left side, which can support slow charging of up to 3.5kW. Mercedes claims an EV-only range of 13km. With 680hp and 1020Nm, acceleration is savage. Sure, the C 63’s plug-in hybrid tech has added over 300 kilos to its weight. However, with the petrol engine and electric powertrain working in conjunction with each other, the C 63 produces an output of 680hp and 1020Nm. And at full throttle, acceleration feels savage. With a sledgehammer-like thrust, not only does it leap forward like a scalded cat, but it also sustains its performance at the top end, with revs maxing out at 7000rpm. Speeds upwards of 200kph on the race track felt rather effortless to achieve. The 9-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox complements, and at least on the race track while being driven with verve, it feels perfectly calibrated with this powertrain. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ ride and handling Equally astonishing is its cornering prowess. The C 63 gets a wider front track, a 10mm longer wheelbase and additional body stiffening compared to the C 43. Further, its 50:50 weight distribution, rear-axle steering and AMG’s 4MATIC+ system do a stellar job of masking its 2.1-tonne kerb weight. It dives into corners willingly, and with a quick ratio steering, it feels sharp and eager to change direction. What’s also impressive is the way its brakes shed speed, and its pedal only adds to the confidence. However, under heavy braking, there’s no getting away from the car’s sheer mass. There’s also a drift mode to speak of, wherein all the torque is sent to the rear wheels, making it rather easy to slide around. There are eight drive modes, three brake energy regeneration settings, three damper stiffness settings and a plethora of adjustability. Unfortunately, though, due to our limited time with the car, we didn’t get a chance to try out all these, and for the track drive, we left the car in its maximum setting (Race mode) only. Handles with surprising agility despite its 2.1-tonne kerb weight. Like the C 43, this C 63 has mics in the exhaust system, which pick up the sounds and play them through the vehicle’s speakers in real time for a sporty aural experience. For a four-cylinder, it does sound quite nice, especially in Race mode, and you’ll also hear the occasional pops and crackles from the exhaust, which adds to the drama. However, AMG loyalists and enthusiasts will be sore with the transition from a V8 to a four-cylinder; the latter simply cannot match the V8’s theatrics. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ design The press cars have been brought to our shores in an exclusive F1 edition, and while this edition isn’t available for sale, Mercedes is offering the C 63 with a laundry list of configurations for buyers to customise their car as per their tastes and preferences. What’s common, though, is its Panamericana AMG front grille and a front bumper with huge intakes. 20-inch alloys are standard with the C 63; these wheels are exclusive to the F1 edition. Incidentally, its bonnet features a functional air scoop designed to dissipate heat from the engine bay. The fenders, on the other hand, feature fake air inlets and ‘Turbo E-Performance’ badging. As part of the F1 package, our test car sported 20-inch wheels, along with additional fins on the rear bumper. Quad exhaust tips, a boot lip spoiler and the C 63 badge outlined in red are other stunning details. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ interiors Ventilated front seats are standard. These are the optional 'Sport' seats. On the inside, the C 63 feels largely identical to its half-priced sibling, the C 43, with a stunning dashboard, high-quality materials and a tasteful use of ambient lighting. Our F1 edition press car sported a generous use of red carbon fibre panels, optional sports seats and a panoramic sunroof. What’s nice is that the seats are comfortable, storage areas are plenty, and its rear seat area is spacious. Since the hybrid’s battery is placed beneath the boot floor, its 280 litres of luggage space is small. For context, the A45 hatchback gets a 370-litre boot. Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ verdict Quad exhaust tips, diffuser and rear spoiler add to its aggression. There’s not an iota of doubt that the Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ is the quickest and most potent iteration of this sports sedan to date. But where the C 63 editions of yore were brimming with emotional appeal, this one feels rather clinical and overly tech-driven in its approach. Its interiors don’t feel too different from the C 43, and while it certainly drives better than its lesser sibling, it doesn’t feel twice as good to justify its asking price. Still, if you’re in the market for a sports sedan with mind-bending performance, this new C 63 has you covered. But be prepared to cough up an eye-watering Rs 1.95 crore (ex-showroom) to get your hands on one. Also See: Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E-Performance 4MATIC+ video review",

    "description": "Cox Automotive expects a 3.6% rise over 2024 in a challenging year for the UK market The UK market will hit 2.04 million car sales in 2025, a 3.6% increase on 2024 but 11.6% less than the 2000-2019 average, a leading industry analyst has forecast. Cox Automotive described those figures – its baseline prediction – as “an indication of future sector challenges”. It also produced an ‘upside’ 2025 forecast of 2.3m units and a ‘downside’ of 1.74m. The baseline predictions suggested quarters one and four would be the hardest of 2025, with respective year-on-year drops of 1% to 540,091 units and 2% to 449,616. Quarters two and three were tipped to be the strongest, with increases of 1.1% and 6.9% to 466,464 and 542,485 units. Cox anticipated a 26% market share for battery-electric vehicles next year, which would leave them 2% short of the ZEV mandate’s current 28% target for 2025. Market share for pure petrols and petrol mild hybrids was projected to be 45%, with plug-in and regular hybrids at 24% and pure diesels and diesel mild hybrids at 5%. “With inflation and interest rates only slowly receding, household costs remain high, putting a strain on consumer spending,” said Cox insight director Philip Nothard. “Despite these challenges, a gradual lift in consumer confidence is anticipated, with fleet sales continuing to sustain demand. “Global vehicle production levels remain robust, but there is a growing mismatch between high production rates and the UK's ambitious ZEV targets. This disparity raises questions about OEMs’ commitment to meeting UK mandates, particularly as the ZEV rules pressure manufacturers to increase BEV shares.” The company also produced basic new car sales forecasts for 2026 and 2027, predicting a rise of 2% for both years to 2.15m and 2.16m units respectively. Its 2024-2027 forecast expects registrations to rise by 23% (equivalent to 1.54m units) compared with 2020-2023. Over the same period, registrations of pure diesels and diesel mild hybrids were tipped to fall by 57% or 483,383 units and petrol equivalents by 11% or 427,880 units. Plug-in and regular hybrids were expected to increase by 89% or 982,104 units and battery-electric vehicles by 167% or 1,468,400 units. “The financial implications of this transition for OEMs, dealerships, fleet operators and associated asset holders remain significant but uncertain,” added Nothard. “Many traditional OEMs are reconsidering their regional focus and market mix to enhance profitability, sometimes prioritising regions where they hold greater market share or more favourable margins. “For the UK, this could mean fewer choices in vehicle makes and models if some OEMs opt to reduce their UK exposure, or minimise the vehicle mix on offer.”",

    "description": "Petrol hatchback enters its fourth generation and promises driver fun at a competitive price With all the hubbub around the new electric Mini Cooper, it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that there is still a normal, petrol-powered one that’s being built in Oxford as before.At a glance, you will struggle to tell it apart from the electric Mini Cooper E and Mini Cooper SE, even though underneath they're completely different cars.While the EVs sit on a brand-new, electric-only platform, the petrol cars are a thorough revamp of the old F56 Mini hatch, using the same UKL architecture that’s shared with the BMW 1 Series.But it does look remarkably similar; it doesn’t even have a visible exhaust. The easiest way to know you’re not looking at the EV is that it retains the black plastic wheel-arch trims. It also keeps the more traditional door handles and clamshell bonnet.For this latest generation of Mini, it's not just the hatch that's being built in Oxford: the Convertible is coming home. For the first time in nine years, the drop-top will be manufactured in the UK as well, a fitting move given the somewhat irrational British love for such machines. It also reflects the close relation between the two: the Convertible is avaiable in the same C, S and John Cooper Works variants as the petrol hatch.",

    "description": "Jaguar, which is reinventing itself as an EV-only brand, has revealed its new logo as well as additional elements that will make up its new corporate identity. Jaguar Device Mark The Jaguar lettering is now presented in a new font, which is rounder and more open. The company calls the Jaguar lettering the Device Mark, and it uses a mix of upper and lower case characters. Jaguar Artist Mark Next is the Artist Mark, which is a monogram consisting of the ‘j’ and ‘r’ letters from the new font and held within a circle. Thanks to the font’s design, the Artist Mark appears right-side-up even when turned upside down. Jaguar Strikethrough Also new is what the company calls the ‘Strikethrough’, a series of horizontal lines that could appear on their own but also with other elements upon them as presented in two iterations so far: one in which a single line breaks open to carry the new lettering and the other with the ‘leaper’, the famed leaping cat logo. Jaguar Makers Mark    The Strikethrough carrying the leaping cat logo is the Makers Mark, and the leaper appears to be the only carryover from the company’s previous brand identity.   New Jaguar brand identity details Besides the aforementioned elements, the company said it will use vibrant and exuberant colours as “a cornerstone of Jaguar’s new brand identity” and “always presented with texture or movement”. While details as to how and where these new design elements will appear are sparse at the moment, the company said the Makers Mark will be “used as a flourish or finishing touch”, thus indicating that the famed leaping cat may not adorn the cars’ bonnet or face. Also missing in the new designs is the Roaring Jaguar monogram, which carried a roaring Jaguar’s face and the lettering above it, and the 3D leaper emblem that used to adorn the bonnets of older models. On the decision to do away with much of the past designs, Rawdon Glover, managing director of Jaguar, said, “We can’t present a bold new Jaguar by only looking to the past, but at the same time, we understand and value our provenance, and that’s why, along with the many exciting new designs, you will still see the leaper but presented in a new fashion.” More will be known about the company’s new brand identity on December 2 at the Miami Art Week, where it will unveil a new concept that will serve as a vision of what its new electric car would look like. The production version of that model already began testing on public roads last week.

    "description": "The Delhi Transport Corporation has impounded 2,234 old vehicles between October 1 and November 15, as part of an ongoing drive to tackle the worsening air quality in Delhi, PTI reports. As per official data, the seized vehicles include 260 diesel four wheelers that are over 10 years old, along with 1,156 two-wheelers, and 818 petrol three- and four-wheelers, which are older than 15 years. The campaign, slated to continue through December, is part of a larger narrative to enforce environmental regulations and curb emissions. In tandem with the crackdown, the Transport Department has rolled out an online portal to facilitate scrapping, retrieval or sale of seized vehicles. The platform is designed to streamline the process, offering owners with a clear SOP for managing vehicles. With air quality worsening in the national capital, the odd-even scheme is another measure that is expected to return. First instituted back in 2016, and nearly every year since, the scheme limits the number of privately owned cars by allowing vehicles with license plates ending in an odd digit to ply on odd dates, and those ending with an even digit to ply on even dates. However, exemptions were made for CNG and electric vehicles. In addition, the Delhi government has already announced a ban on commercial and private vehicles that are BS3 petrol and BS4 diesel certified. These measures should help curb the rising air pollution in the National Capital Region.

    "description": "Some custom motorcycle builders are drawn to the simplicity of vintage machines, while others favor the performance and reliability of modern motorcycles. The 2005-model Harley Softail Deuce sits somewhere in the middle. Officially named the Harley-Davidson Softail FXSTD, the mid-naughties Deuce featured Harley’s new (at the time) Twin Cam V-twin engine and disc brakes, but hadn’t yet adopted fuel injection or a pesky CAN bus system. That, combined with its relatively minimalist build, made it the perfect candidate for Wojciech Aleksiejuk’s latest custom build. Based in Warsaw, Poland, Wojciech worked at a Harley specialist shop for a few years before branching out independently, under the banner of Demiurge Cycles. Building custom bikes had been a hobby up until this point—but now that Wojciech had turned it into a full-time gig, he wanted to create something that could showcase his abilities.…",

    "description": "The debate about what is considered art — and what is not considered art — has filled volumes, spawned entire branches of philosophy and has been the subject of more late-night drunken arguments than anyone can recall. It gets even murkier when delving into the world of technical drawing. Is a blueprint or schematic a piece of art? Should I be in awe of the wiring diagram in the back of my Clymer manual when I am trying to diagnose why one of my spark plugs isn’t firing? Yet there have been individuals throughout history whose ability to convey technical information transcends the utilitarian into the world of fine art. David Kimble is one such modern master, perhaps the last of his kind creating highly detailed cutaway illustrations by hand with acetate, airbrush, paint, and time.…",

    "link": "",
    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",
