    "description": "The Rynox Air GT gloves have been a compelling choice for urban riders seeking a balance between comfort, protection and affordability. Rynox has now updated them with some flexible rubber protection that covers the carpal bones for better abrasion resistance. While they remain the same overall, this new addition has driven up their price by Rs 700.  These gloves are crafted from perforated, soft, full-grain leather with additional leather panels in high-abrasion zones. They are designed to offer both durability and ventilation, making them pretty usable in our tropical climate. Flexible armour doesn’t compromise overall comfort. While Rynox says the fingers are pre-curved and don’t require any wear-in, these gloves felt a bit too rigid initially, and I found that they do require a bit of breaking in. After this, they feel quite comfortable, thanks partly to the accordion stretch panels, allowing for easier hand movements. The built-in touchscreen-compatible fingertips work well enough but don’t allow for very precise inputs due to the rounded edges on the fingertips, although this holds true for most gloves. Despite the leather construction these gloves have decent ventilation. The cuff has a small elastic panel that allows for easier ingress and egress of your hand. This, paired with the adjuster on the wrist, ensures a tight yet comfortable fit. In terms of protection, these gloves are CE certified to the EN 13594:2015 standard and offer TPU protectors with HD foam backing on the knuckles, HD foam inserts on the fingertips and joints and the newly added protection for the carpus bones.  The only change is the added protection on the palm. Despite our summer heat, these gloves feel decently ventilated and don’t add any discomfort to my commutes or rides. However, it’s worth noting that they are not waterproof, making them less ideal for the monsoons. While these gloves may not cater to high-speed touring or track days, they excel in city environments and short weekend getaways. Available in four colours, the Air GT are a solid pair for any beginner rider looking for nice gloves without breaking the bank.

    "description": "As India’s off-road riding community grows, so does the need for purpose-built but cost-effective machines. KTM’s 390 Enduro R and Kawasaki’s KLX230 offer two vastly different interpretations of what an accessible, dirt-focused bike should be. While there’s a huge gap in their performance, their price tag is where they are quite close. Both claim to be proper off-roaders, but which one truly fits the brief? KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Design and features Both motorcycles are designed to go off-road but take a different approach The 390 Enduro R may appear like a stripped-down 390 Adventure at first glance, but look closer, and you can appreciate KTM’s effort to keep its design unique. Based on the 390 Adventure platform, it gets a larger 18-inch rear wheel, a smaller 9-litre fuel tank, less bodywork, and off-road oriented tyres. The plastic tank and black panels look a tad budget and don’t seem like they’d age too well. The 4.2-inch TFT on the KTM is packed with information but doesn't get a fuel gauge While the dirty white panels give this motorcycle a proper “enduro” aesthetic, the premature discolouration is a bit concerning. That said, the rest of the motorcycle feels solidly built. The switchgear quality is good and feels tactile. The tiny TFT display looks premium, and it shows most of what you’d want to see, except for a fuel gauge, which would’ve been handy while exploring remote trails. The KLX230's monotone LCD is quite basic and misses out on a gear position indicator. In contrast, the Kawasaki KLX230 feels solid and has durable plastics and a no-nonsense design. Discolouration seems to be a common theme, and the KLX230’s dual-tone seat gets dirty fairly easily. It gets an LCD with basic information and a simple layout. While it includes a fuel gauge, it skips a rev counter and gear position indicator – features you will miss but can learn to live without. The switchgear feels budget and a tad rudimentary. It’s also worth mentioning that parts like the mirrors, indicators and levers, which are likely to get damaged off-road, cost significantly more for the KLX as it is a CKD import. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Ergonomics Both bikes are ergonomically compromised in their own way. At 860mm, the KTM’s seat height is tall but not extreme, and riders around 5’7” should be able to get the balls of their feet down. The Enduro R has a nicer seat and is the better option if you ever need to ferry a pillion. Standing up on the Enduro R feels more natural, and over time, you’ll prefer riding it on your feet. The Enduro R also offers decent mounting points for luggage, and it will definitely be the better option if you intend to cover bigger distances to get to interesting locations. A noticeable flaw is the engine guard that will bump your knees, nudging you to stand. The KTM is better suited for standing up and riding. The KLX230 has a similarly upright posture, but its ergonomics feel a bit too forward-set while standing, especially for taller riders who will want a higher handlebar. On paper, it has a taller 880mm perch, but once seated on it, the suspension sags enough that even riders around 5’7” can touch down easier than the KTM. However, the narrow and firm standard seat quickly becomes uncomfortable on the road. The 390 Enduo R also has better seating ergonomics The more unusual challenge is getting the KLX230 off its stand – a task that needs to be done with the suspension unloaded, as the rear shock doesn’t allow the side-stand to retract when loaded. There are no built-in mounting points for luggage, but Kawasaki sells an accessory carrier. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Performance and efficiency The 390 Enduro R outclases the KLX230 by a long shot in terms of performance This is where the two bikes couldn’t be more different. The Enduro R borrows its 399cc liquid-cooled engine from the other 390s and puts out the same 46hp and 39Nm – more than double the KLX’s peak output. However, on technical trails, this performance can be a bit much. Its motor doesn’t have much of a bottom end and then easily spins up the rear when the revs build. That said, the engine is decently tractable and rides well on the road with the same highway cruising performance as its Adventure siblings. Despite the tame nature, the 390 Enduro R is still a hoot on dirt. The engine may feel slightly tame for seasoned riders used to KTM’s raw nature, but that makes it surprisingly beginner-friendly. The Enduro R can cruise at triple-digit speeds all day and doesn’t feel out of place in traffic either. With its 9-litre tank, the KTM can achieve about 200km on a full tank in the real world. What makes the KTM even more manageable are its electronics – switchable ABS, a very effective off-road traction control, two riding modes, and a bi-directional quickshifter, all make life easier. Given the huge difference on paper, you’d expect the KLX230 to struggle, but it keeps up remarkably well off-road. It uses a simpler, smaller engine and there’s no sudden surge, but it has great bottom and mid-range. In fact, we definitely preferred this engine for off-road riding. Naturally, on road, the KTM easily leaves the Kawasaki behind, and anything above 90kph feels laboured; you also need to plan your overtakes. The lack of power allows the KLX230 to feel more stable and predictable off-road. Surprisingly, when ridden at higher speeds on- and off-road, there was only a 4kpl difference between the Kawasaki and the KTM. This is largely due to the KLX’s smaller engine that needs to work harder, and we often found that it needed filling sooner than the KTM. The KLX has no electronic aids apart from switchable ABS, but truth be told, it doesn’t need any. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Ride and handling The KLX230 has much better off-road handling than the 390 Enduro R. The KTM gets adjustable suspension, but the India-spec bike gets reduced suspension travel compared to the export model, and we also found that the damping control can be improved. Ridden over the same rocky trails, the KTM is more bouncy and fights the same surfaces that the KLX glides over, which makes it tougher to manage. Reducing the compression damping to make it more compliant only results in a tendency to bottom out over jumps, so we elected to deal with the bounciness instead. The 390 Enduro R strikes a much better balance between road and off-road handling In tighter off-road sections, its 37kg weight disadvantage over the KLX also becomes noticeable and demands more from the rider. While the suspension lacks the plushness of the Kawasaki off-road, it shines on the tarmac. The Enduro R resists diving under braking, doesn’t squat under acceleration, and can be hustled in corners like a road bike despite its dual-purpose tyres. Thanks to the light weight, the KLX230 loves big jumps The KLX230’s suspension componentry is more basic, but despite that, it is far more capable off-road and soaks up imperfections with ease, giving riders more confidence to explore. It boasts 265mm of ground clearance, but that drops considerably with rider weight. The KLX is also more forgiving of rider mistakes, but push it, and it begins to show its limits, which is a reminder that neither of these bikes can be used for a very high level of off-road riding. On the road, the KLX’s dirt orientation is evident in the excessive front-end dive under braking. Yet, in our braking tests, the KLX was nearly on par with the KTM, thanks to its significantly lighter weight. The KLX230 isn't at home around corners and can feel too soft. The KLX changes direction easily, and it feels very light and nimble. However, its on-road handling is a bit vague and takes some getting used to. The MRF tyres are not bad, but the Mitas E-07s on the KTM are noticeably better. KTM 390 Enduro R vs Kawasaki KLX230: Verdict The KTM offers great value for just an additional Rs 6,000 At Rs 3.30 lakh, the simpler KLX’s value proposition feels a bit lopsided. It lacks features, and its highway manners aren’t comparable to the KTM’s. Kawasaki is reportedly working on a localised version, which could improve the price equation significantly, but that’s still some time away. Given the minimal price delta between the two, the 390 Enduro R makesa great case for itself. Still, the KLX230 is a charming little trail bike, and we enjoyed riding it off-road a lot more than the KTM. It’s unintimidating, lightweight, and promises to be reliable – the kind of machine that lets you explore and make mistakes without punishing you. As a second or third bike, it’s an excellent option. But as a one-bike solution? Only if you’re a true off-road maniac. For an additional Rs 7,000 over the KLX230, the 390 Enduro R offers higher performance, sophisticated electronics, and versatility. It’s more physically demanding off-road, but with enough skill and commitment, it will go where the KLX can while simultaneously being a more accomplished road bike. Its biggest shortcoming is its suspension, but KTM will bring in the international-spec longer-travel variant soon, albeit at a higher cost. For the small price delta between the two bikes, KTM’s 390 Enduro R makes a much stronger case for itself and is the better contender for a single-bike garage.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/alpine-confirms-v6-powered-ferrari-sf90-rival-2028",
    "description": "French firm says combustion still makes sense for sporting flagships as mainstream models go EV Alpine will launch a supercar in 2028 with a turbocharged V6 hybrid powertrain pumping out more than 1000bhp, the head of the Renault Group’s premium brand has said. The new supercar was previewed by the firm’s Alpenglow concept, which also featured a V6. However, Alpine has opted to add twin electric motors on the front axle to create an all-wheel-drive layout and beef up the output. Alpine had been moving in the direction of an all-electric line-up, with production of its A110 combustion-engined sports car ending early next year. However, the brand has decided it needs a combustion engine for its new supercar and hasn’t ruled out additional hybrid models in the future. “We are not selling electric cars. We are selling sporty cars, passion cars, exclusive cars,” said Alpine CEO Philippe Krief at the launch of the A390 EV crossover. The supercar, including its V6 engine and high-powered electric motors, will be developed by the Renault Group’s racing and performance-focused Hypertech Alpine R\u0026D division, located at the Viry-Châtillon Formula 1 engine facility to the south of Paris, said Krief. The target weight of the car is below 1600kg. Krief worked in R\u0026D at Ferrari when the company developed the plug-in hybrid SF90 Stradale, which is likely to be a key benchmark for the new car. However, the layout of the new Alpine supercar is closer to that of the Lamborghini Revuelto V12 plug-in hybrid, which also uses twin electric motors on the front axle, sourced from UK-based Yasa. The Alpine supercar won’t use Yasa’s slimline axial-flux hybrid motors - also found on the SF90 - but instead more conventional radial-flux motors of Hypertech’s own design. “Axial flux is perfect between the engine and a gearbox. But on the front axle, if you have a big diameter, it doesn’t matter,” said Krief. Alpine is targeting incredibly high power density from its new electric motors – enough to achieve 1000bhp in total with the V6. Fitting twin motors on the front axle also allows Alpine to control the power of each wheel separately, to the benefit of overall handling. The Alpenglow V6 concept theoretically ran on hydrogen, which would give Alpine a potential way of extending the life of the supercar when it eventually falls foul of 2035 emissions regulations that call for the end of tailpipe CO2 emissions. The supercar will cost more than €200,000 (£168,000) to ensure the limited-run project is profitable.”If we’re able to sell €155,000 Renault 5 Turbo, you think there could be room for Alpine above that,” said Krief. The supercar will showcase the work of the Hypertech division, which is being used to more aggressively find overlaps between the world of motorsports and road cars, something car companies have long struggled to achieve. ”We are going to create a lot more links than traditionally,” said Krief.  The division will “tap into excellence in motorsports to turbocharge Alpine and Renault Group,” said Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo at the same A390 launch.

    "description": "Skoda designer Ljudmil Slavov reveals new take on the 1980s hatchback – without overtly retro cues Skoda has reimagined the Favorit as a modern electric car, melding the original’s Bertone-penned lines with the brand’s new Modern Solid design language. Conceived by designer Ljudmil Slavov in some 120 hours of his own time, the project was intended to retain the feel of the 1987 hatchback without leaning on overtly retro cues, such as with the new Renault 5. “I wanted to update the original idea for today, when various SUVs are popular,” said Slavov, adding that “a higher body structure allows for better battery placement in the floor”. Slavov didn't introduce the Modern Solid design language’s most prominent design cue, the gloss-black Tech Deck face (as worn by the new Elroq and Enyaq). He instead decided to “evolve and elevate” the “already minimalistic” features of the Favorit, which “was very challenging”. “I sketched many versions, searched for the ideal shape of the grille and headlights, tried different perspectives and consulted a lot with colleagues,” Slavov said. Among the clearest references to the original Favorit are the shape of the front and rear lights, comprising LED running lights and covers hiding the main-beam lamps. The caron accents in the Skoda wordmarks front and rear are also lit. The simple shape of the wheel inners, meanwhile, references the placeholders used by Skoda’s designers when wheels aren't the focal point of a proposal. There are no detailed images of the interior, but the seats’ headrests reference the open-centred items on the original Favorit and the brown leather upholstery references the fashion of the late 1980s. In addition to a passenger version, Slavov penned a rally version inspired by the Favorit that found success in the World Rally Championship’s F2 class during the early 1990s. This has a lower, wider stance and unpainted plastic bumpers, plus a white, green and red livery inspired by that on the WRC Favorit 136 L/A in Skoda’s heritage collection. The new Favorit EV is the latest in a sporadic series of reimaginings by Skoda’s designers. In 2021, it showed new takes on the 1203 van, Voiturette A, Felica Cabriolet, 130RS and Popular Monte Carlo – of which the last was penned by Slavov.",

    "description": "There’s no denying the popularity of the classic BMW boxer—but it does have its idiosyncrasies. Perhaps the most infamous of these is the way its fuel tank leans one way, while its substantial engine block leans another. This visual disharmony didn’t sit well with Earth Motorcycles. Faced with a 1987 BMW R80RT and a client who wanted a slick café racer, the Slovakian custom shop resolved to massage the old boxer’s individual parts into alignment. “Typically, this imbalance forces builders to angle the rear of the seat upwards, giving the bike a more aggressive, dramatic posture,” says Earth’s founder, Vlado Dinga. “Like many others, Earth has gone that route before. But this time, we chose to challenge the geometry instead of accepting it.”…",

But once in a while, a workshop builds a custom Breakout that’s impossible to ignore. This vivid Breakout blipped on our radar, when it took silver in the Modified Harley-Davidson class at Winston Yeh’s Speed and Crafts show. Slathered in kinetic bodywork and modern accouterments, it’s the work of the Taiwanese Harley-Davidson parts specialist Fangster. Parts are Fangster’s bread and butter, but the workshop makes it their business to build a one-off special each year too.

    "description": "Tata Motors has had a busy few years with a slew of EV launches and revitalised SUVs, but if there’s one model that seemed left behind it’s the Altroz. Sure, it received a new dual-clutch gearbox, a (now-discontinued) turbo-petrol engine and a CNG variant in the time since its launch in 2020, but the basic package itself has largely been untouched. Things change with the Altroz facelift you see here. Fresher styling, a redone interior and a massive feature upgrade bring the likeable Tata premium hatchback to the present. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift exterior design and engineering - 9/10 The facelift adds new-age glam to a very appealing design. The updated Altroz conforms to Tata’s sharper new style sheet, and the effect is great. Making the biggest impact up front is the new bumper that sports more pronounced cuts and creases at the side vents and fog lamp enclosures. The fog lamps are smaller, sit lower down and have been upgraded to LEDs on top-spec versions. A slimmer grille with a textured finish is part of the updates too and flows slickly into the swept-back headlamps. While the headlamps are familiar in shape, the internals have been redone with new LED DRLs and, on top-spec versions, full-LED lighting. Headlamp shape remains similar, but internals are new; LED fog lamps on top trim. New alloy wheels (with EV-like aero streaks) are part of the updates but aren’t the only changes at the sides. Tata Motors has gone the distance with new doors with softer lines as well as a slimmer iteration of the black band that underlines the windows. It’s a cleaner look but the updated Altroz has lost some of the original’s sporty tipped-forward stance. Flush-fitting front door handles are new but aren’t the easiest to use, requiring a firm press to get the lever out. As before, the rear door handles are mounted on the C-pillar and, again, take some getting used to. Altroz facelift has sheet metal changes in the form of new doors with softer lines. Styling at the back has been revamped, although at first glance, you might think just the rear bumper is new. However, while the tail-lamp housing is unchanged, lighting is from slim LEDs inside. Top models also get a light bar that up the wow factor. Just wish Tata gave the Altroz chunkier rubber. The 185-section tyres take away a bit from the stance. Notably, 195-section tyres were dropped over the Altroz’s life perhaps in the interest of upping economy. Slim 185-section tyres take away from the stance of the hatchback. The Altroz is built on Tata Motors' ALFA architecture. Side protection has been beefed up with this update to meet the more stringent requirements for a 5-star crash test rating in today’s Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP protocols. The original Altroz was a 5-star Global NCAP rated car and Tata will sure be gunning for full marks for the 2025 model. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift interior space and comfort - 8/10 Lots of shared elements with other Tata models, but it's premium and modern Light colours and new textures lend the cabin a premium feel. Where the Altroz takes a big step forwards is on the inside. Sure, there are a lot of elements common to other Tata models but the combined effect is that of an up-to-date and premium interior. The digital instruments, 10.25-inch touchscreen, a two-spoke steering with an illuminated logo and new centre console go a long way to enhance the look of things inside. The dashboard has also been spruced up with lighter colours and new textures, and there’s nice use of ambient lighting, too. Fit and finish is good, but keeping the light upholstery clean will require some commitment on your part. Also, the gloss black panel for the climate control system is easy to scratch, so it could lose its sheen soon. Gloss black HVAC panel could be prone to losing its sheen over time. Tata Motors has enhanced the seats with greater thigh support, and this does aid comfort over long drives. Drivers will miss steering reach adjust (it still adjusts for angle only) and will also find that the thick A-pillar hampers visibility at crossroads. Doors that open 90 degrees (a feature on ALFA architecture cars) make getting in and out easy, but it’s quite a reach to shut the door when fully open. Rear seat space is satisfactory (a Hyundai i20 is roomier) for average-sized adults, but taller occupants will find headroom just about adequate. Also, the rear seat is a touch upright. Front seats now have better thigh support, enhancing comfort over long drives.  The Altroz does well to offer enough storage spaces inside the cabin, including a handily large glovebox. 345 litres of boot space is a class-best stat and what’s particularly impressive is that even the CNG versions offer a very usable 210 litres of room, made possible by Tata’s clever use of two slim CNG tanks, in place of a larger single tank. Rear seat space is satisfactory for average-sized adults   2025 Tata Altroz facelift features and safety - 8/10 Few niceties missing, but overall it's a techy and feature-packed hatchback The Tata Altroz is available in four trims (or personas as Tata calls them), namely Pure, Smart, Creative and Accomplished S, with the last three further available with ‘+’ add-on packs. However, only the Altroz DCA can be had in fully loaded Accomplished S+ form, which makes it the only one with features like 10.25-inch digital dials (integrated with a map view and blind view monitor), connected tech and an onboard air purifier. 10.25-inch touchscreen is slick and responsive.  Our Accomplished S trim test cars did not disappoint on kit, though. The 10.25-inch touchscreen is responsive and quick, and worked without glitch. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included and the 360-degree camera’s resolution is good too. Wireless charging is a part of the package and there are also 65W type-C chargers at the front and rear that can power a laptop. Ambient lighting adds some colour to the dash and you can further brighten proceedings with a sunroof (offered as an option on the Smart and Creative trims). Of the other things, the part-digital instruments with a 7-inch MID are informative as well. Leatherette upholstery is no longer offered on the Altroz and a bigger miss is the exclusion of front seat ventilation that was only recently rolled out on the Altroz Racer. Ambient lighting has been put to good use to spruce up the dashboard. Standard safety kit includes 6 airbags, electronic stability control, Isofix child seat mounts and 3-point seat belts for all seats. Irritatingly, the rear seats lack load sensors and the seat belt reminder buzzes even if the seats are not occupied. Higher-spec models add in auto lights and wipers, tyre pressure monitors and height adjustable rear headrests.  2025 Tata Altroz facelift performance and refinement - 7/10 CNG variant is only best for urban use; highway duties are handled better by the diesel With the update, Tata Motors has made some changes to the engine and gearbox options on offer. The turbo-petrol engine-powered Altroz Racer has been dropped (at least for now) and there’s a new AMT option on the 1.2-litre petrol engine. To put the powertrain matrix in words, the 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, petrol engine (88hp and 115Nm) can be had with a 5-speed manual gearbox, a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic and a new 5-speed AMT. The Altroz CNG uses the same 1.2 engine as its base (power drops to 73.5hp and 103Nm in CNG mode) and it can be had with a 5-speed manual; a 5-speed AMT comes soon. And finally, there’s a 90hp and 200Nm, 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel that can only be had with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Featured here are the CNG and diesel versions of the Altroz. Altroz CNG performance not particular peppy, but it's better than the numbers suggest. Drivers will appreciate the option to start the Altroz in CNG mode and you’ll realise performance is better on the go than the power numbers will have you believe. Sure, it’s not particularly peppy, but keeping up with the flow of traffic and general city driving is well taken care of. It’s an unexciting engine, but that’s unlikely to be a deterrent for a CNG buyer who is primarily interested in the low running costs. A light clutch helps the experience in town. The Altroz CNG does feel out of its comfort zone on expressways, where the lack of ready power becomes evident. You do have the option to switch to petrol mode when you need more from the engine, but high-speed performance remains humdrum. Revving the engine hard will have the noise levels rise sharply with an audible whine from under the engine bay. Altroz CNG feels out of its comfort zone on expressways.  The Altroz diesel is better suited for those with lots of highway running. The engine delivers a wide spread of power and the 200Nm of torque sure comes handy when you want to make your way past traffic. Thing is, the diesel engine is loud. You can hear a clatter at idle, and it remains quite noisy throughout the rev band. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift efficiency/range - 7/10 Tata hasn’t released official fuel economy numbers for the 2025 Altroz. We did test the Altroz CNG earlier this year and got real-world figures of 20.56km/kg in city driving and 29.65km/kg on the highway. The Altroz petrol and diesel feature a fairly small 37-litre fuel tank. The CNG’s twin cylinders have 60 litres of gas capacity.   2025 Tata Altroz facelift ride comfort and handling - 9/10 Ride and handling balance is best in class; highway manners are confident  Ride and handling have been highlights on the Altroz since day one and the story is no different even today. There is a slight firmness that comes through from the suspension and tyres at low speeds, but when the surface deteriorates, the Altroz shines. It gobbles potholes with ease and there’s a toughness from the package that you don’t get in any other hatchback. There's a feel of robustness in the way the Altroz rides. High-speed manners are also polished and confident, and what adds to the experience is the handling. You get a great sense of connect from the steering, with the Altroz changing direction with grace. The steering requires little effort to twirl at low speeds too. What is a downer is the insufficient noise insulation. Over high speed cruises, there’s quite a bit of road noise as well as wind noise emanating in the region of the wing mirrors.    2025 Tata Altroz facelift price and verdict - 8/10 Up-to-date and more premium, but few shortcomings still  Tata has launched the Altroz at Rs 6.89 lakh (ex-showroom) with the range-topping version priced at Rs 11.49 lakh. Pricing is in the same ballpark as comparable engine-gearbox versions of rivals like the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and Hyundai i20. The comprehensive updates with the facelift lend the Altroz a more upmarket vibe.  Buyers with lots of running or diesel fans will find a good fit in the Altroz diesel, while the CNG makes great sense for city dwellers looking to keep running costs in check without compromising on creature comforts. The petrol engine isn’t up there with Suzuki’s K12 unit but is fine for city use. AMT and dual-clutch auto options also promise added convenience. What’s a pity is that Altroz buyers don’t have the option of a sporty turbo-petrol engine that would really complement the slick handling.  While refinement could be better, the comprehensive update addresses some of the Altroz’s more glaring shortcomings like features. There’s a more upmarket vibe to the package now making the Altroz more compelling than ever before. Also See: Tata Altroz facelift video review",

    "description": "Mumbai’s outskirts transformed into a high-octane playground as Venomotorsportz hosted Dirt Blazers 2025. The latest edition of the autocross event, held at Venom Moto Park, featured everything from rally-bred sedans to hardcore SUVs. Driving a Volkswagen Polo GT TSI, Kartik Konchady set the fastest time of the day, along with taking victory in the 1651 to 2000cc class. Also in attendance as a special guest was Sanjay Takale, who made history earlier this year as the first Indian driver to complete the Dakar Rally. Jhanvi Bhavsar wins in Ladies Open class Fahad Kutty wins in SUV Open class Dirt Blazers 2025 results Rather than an outright race to the chequered flag, the autocross format requires participants to navigate through a predetermined obstacle course and complete it in the fastest possible time. Events like these play a crucial role in increasing accessibility to motorsport, and Dirt Blazers is a testament to India’s growing off-road racing culture. The competition featured eight classes, each designed to test different calibres of cars and drivers. Ladies Open winner: Jhanvi Bhavsar The Ladies Open class took centre stage first. Jhanvi Bhavsar (also driving a Polo GT TSI) lit up the track with a rapid run of 2 minutes and 36.281 seconds, setting the fastest time in the class. Close on her heels were Ashrafi Gaikwad and Natasha Duggal, all with clean, penalty-free laps. SUV Open winner: Fahad Kutty One of the most talked-about sights of the day was the wave of modified Maruti Jimnys – lifted and trail-tuned, they dominated the SUV Open class with flair. Fahad Kutty topped in this category with a blistering time of 2 minutes and 36.143 seconds, outpacing veterans like Shanawaz Khader and Mihir Dharkar in a hotly contested session. 800 to 1100cc winner: Nitish Chaudhari The 800cc to 1100cc class saw Nitish Chaudhari steal the show with a flying lap time of 2 minutes and 27.256 seconds. Kaustubh Pitale was second, followed by Devang Kenia. 1101 to 1400cc winner: Kushal Chaudhari The 1101 to 1400cc class was a playground for precision. Kushal Chaudhari was the undisputed maestro here, carving out a winning time of 2 minutes and 20.815 seconds behind the wheel of a Maruti Suzuki Swift. He was followed closely by Fahad Kutty, who proved his versatility across categories. 1401 to 1650cc winner: Devang Kenia Only two participants competed in this class. Devang Kenia won with a clean run of 3 minutes and 11.372 seconds, followed by Amit Chavan. 1651 to 2000 cc winner: Kartik Konchady Konchady was the man to beat in the 1651 to 2000cc class, clocking a time of 2 minutes and 18.401 seconds – not just the fastest in his class but across all classes. Pitale was second, followed by Chavan. Amateur Open winner: Raj Kadam In the Amateur Open class, the spirit of grassroots racing burned bright. Raj Kadam delivered a composed lap of 2 minutes and 27.342 seconds to take victory ahead of Virendra Mestry and Priyesh Jaiswal. Unrestricted Open winners: Mihir Dharkar, Kushal Chaudhari Unrestricted Open class, Mihir Dharkar stormed to the top in the 4-wheeler segment with a time of 2 minutes and 35.464 seconds. Adding to his victory tally, Chaudhari was fastest in the 2-wheeler class as well, with a blistering run of 2 minutes and 23.551 seconds. He just about edged out Konchady (2 minutes and 23.980 seconds) and Kutty (2 minutes and 25.354 seconds) in a nail-biting finish. Also see: J A Motorsport builds India’s first cross car",

    "description": "BMW has taken the wraps off the new M2 CS at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este 2025. The CS – typical of what it suggests in BMW’s parlance – is a lighter, more performance-focused version of the M2 Coupe. Notably, this could be the final version of the brand’s junior sports car to feature a pure combustion engine. New M2 CS will be produced in limited numbers Is powered by a 530hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo petrol engine Has a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.8 seconds 2025 BMW M2 CS engine, specs  Power and torque up by 50hp and 100Nm over regular M2 The M2 CS continues with the same 3.0-litre, inline 6-cylinder twin-turbo petrol engine as the regular M2, but the output has now been bumped up to 530hp and 650Nm – that’s 50hp and 100Nm more. In this car, the engine comes exclusively mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. There’s no manual gearbox because BMW says the 6-speed MT offered with the regular M2 isn’t engineered to handle the higher torque figure. BMW also says it hasn’t seen much demand for the manual, which further supported its decision to offer only the automatic gearbox. As for acceleration, the M2 CS sprints from 0 to 100kph in a claimed 3.8 seconds. 2025 BMW M2 CS chassis upgrades Weighs about 30kg less than the regular M2 More grunt aside, weight-saving measures are also part of the CS package, and to that end, it gets a carbon-fibre roof and boot lid. So, the 1,700kg kerb weight of the CS is about 30kg lower than the regular M2. The M2 CS also gets stiffer engine mounts and bespoke spring and damper tuning. The steering, brakes and differentials, too, have been upgraded. BMW also offers the CS with an optional lightweight titanium M Performance exhaust, which has been specifically designed for this model, and it provides a “more aggressive soundscape”, says the brand. The retuned suspension has resulted in an 8mm lower ride height. 2025 BMW M2 CS exterior and interior   Light weight alloys and ducktail spoiler are the most distinctive elements It will take a keen eye to make out the differences between the face of the M2 CS and the regular M2, but this version has a slightly reworked grille and air vents on the bumper to allow the engine to breathe better. The car’s side profile features new lightweight alloy wheels exclusively finished in gold – again, a typical CS design element. The CS comes in four paint shades – Black Sapphire, Portimao Blue, Brooklyn Grey and Velvet Blue. The most distinctive detail on the new M2 CS is a ducktail spoiler, which should help improve stability at high speeds. The car also gets a more blown-out rear diffuser. Inside, the M2 CS has much sportier carbon bucket seats trimmed in M performance colours, lots of carbon fibre flourishes, and new CS logos on the seats and door sills; there’s a new M-spec Alcantara steering wheel, too. Despite its hardcore positioning, the CS still features creature comforts like a heated steering wheel, 3-zone climate control, a head-up display and a Harman Kardon sound system.

    "description": "It constantly seems like the V8 might be dying. Stellantis is slowly killing the Hemi, though like a horror-movie villain, it never quite dies. Electrification and technological advances involving internal-combustion engines with fewer cylinders are both factors that make us think the V8 will be relegated to only niche sports cars and a few trucks. Yet GM made news this morning that has us pausing.",
