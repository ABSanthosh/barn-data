    "description": "The Himalayan has now completed a year with us, and it’s time for the bike to be returned to Royal Enfield. Over the past year, the bike has gone on a couple of long rides out of the city, but most of the 6,648km on the Odo have been clocked within the metropolis. During this time, the bike has made my 70km round-trip commute far more enjoyable than it has any right to be. I’ve spoken about this before, but the Himalayan’s size, seating comfort, and superb suspension have won me over. With the engine, it’s not quite so straightforward, and I find myself wishing for more character after a few days of continuous commuting. However, the moment I take a break from the bike (which happens far more often than I’d like with the travel schedule), I get back on it and find myself enjoying the mid-range punch. That being said, RE still has work to do when it comes to damping out the handlebar vibrations at highway cruising speeds. Seating and suspension comfort are both outstanding. That I have enjoyed riding the Himalayan 450 is without doubt, but the experience has not been free of flaws. First, there was the issue of the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released. This took ages and multiple visits to the showroom to be sorted, and I was given to understand that it came down to correctly torquing some of the bolts that connect the engine to the frame. 17-litre tank is top-heavy, but it also makes the bike feel big. We also had the toggle switch on the left-hand switchgear fail, and it was replaced under warranty. But even when it works, I find the switch fiddly enough that I avoid using it altogether. This means that even though there is quite a bit of tech within all the menus on that pretty circular TFT display, I never bother with it. Thankfully, this has had no negative effect on the riding experience. The joystick switch is fiddly to use and needs redesigning. Finally, there’s the infamous cone-set issue. It first started to get loose at about 5,000km, which I reported on in the previous report. I was told by the folks at the service centre that it was tightened, as the bearing didn’t need to be replaced. However, less than 1,000km later, it has gotten loose again and is now considerably worse than it was the first time. For something that was such a well-known issue with the old Himalayan 411, it’s surprising to see it continue in the all-new model. It’s also been disappointing that the service centre has not reset the service warning after two separate services, and it shows up every time I start the bike. The steering cone set bearing keeps getting loose. But as I write this, I’m reminded that while there have been niggles, there have never been any serious breakdowns (or letdowns). The bike has always started when I’ve asked, and every ride has been enjoyable. Whenever I conclude a long-term review of a motorcycle, I always ask myself if I’d buy one. Usually, the answer is no, but here, I could see it being a yes because this bike fits my particular needs for a large, quick and super comfy bike that can steamroll through the mess of our local road system. The Himalayan has truly excelled at that role.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/meet-man-who-buys-ferraris-you-really-shouldnt",
    "description": "Chivers’ collection of cars is insured for £500,000 Serial Ferrari owner Scott Chivers buys the Ferraris you really never should, such as a car he’s dubbed Ratarossa It’s Stig of the Dump meets Don Johnson - a chop-top Ferrari Testarossa crudely stiffened and finished in primer; the antidote to all those gleaming Rosso Corsa Ferraris piloted once a year by meticulously groomed squillionaires, dressed to impress in prancing horse regalia. It belongs to Scott Chivers, a man with interesting views on Ferraris and owning them... “I have red Ferraris but it’s not my favourite colour and I don’t drive the cars to be seen,” he says. “My daily driver is a black 360 Challenge Stradale. I’ve owned it for eight years and done 50,000 miles in it. I go to the shops and take my kids to school in it. I love the fact it’s used – and looks it.” His Testarossa, or Ratarossa as he calls it (a name inspired by the term ‘rat’, short for ‘recycled automotive transport’ exemplified by superficially rusty split-screen Type 2 Volkswagens), is the ultimate expression of Scott’s Ferrari philosophy. Its grey body is rough and rippled, the engine cover is barely secure, the slender metal stiffening beams are visible between the sills and seats, the door cards flap around and the leather trim around the A-posts and behind the seats is as neat as my gift wrapping... Does it look low to you? That’s because it sits on lowering springs. The weight of the strengthening beams forced the car down at the back. Scott says he ripped out the old suspension and ordered three sets of front springs of different specs so he could play around with the ride height to equalise front and rear. Next thing, he’ll be saying there’s an old Vauxhall four-pot under that rear cover. Not a chance: Scott props it open with a piece of 4x2 to reveal the car’s original, and suitably grimy, flat-12 engine. Somewhere in there is the original five-speed manual transmission, too, as evidenced by the dull alloy transmission gate downstream in the cabin. Scott bought the car from a bloke in California. At the time, he was looking for an engine cover for his 1990 Testarossa coupe, a left-hand-drive car he’d bought from the Netherlands. (Seven of his Ferraris are left-hookers.) There he was, surfing the web, when up pops this four-year-old ad for an unfinished Testarossa spider project car. “I was intrigued and called the seller on the off-chance it was still available,” says Scott. “Incredibly, it was. He’d bought it intending to restore it but it just sat in his garage gathering dust. The owner said he wasn’t interested in selling it to anyone who would just break it for spares. I told him I would take on the project and get the car roadworthy. We agreed a deal and I shipped the car here to the UK. All in – the car, shipping, taxes – it cost me £16,000.” Ferrari made only one Testarossa Spider, commissioned by company boss Gianni Agnelli in 1986. It was sold by his children in 2016 for £1.2 million. Naturally, it was a proper job, unlike the dozen or so copycats, including Scott’s, that followed from body shops. At some point, Scott’s car was owned by a US kit car company that used it as the basis for its replica Testarossas. Then one day, perhaps following a crash, they cut the roof off, at which point, says Scott, Ferrari stepped in to protect its copyright... “When I received the car and the two crates of bits that came with it, my intention was to rebuild it,” says Scott. “I had my other Testarossa coupeÃ that had also just arrived so I used that as a blueprint to work out where the bits from the crates should go and as a wiring guide. I was able to swap parts between the two cars so I was able to cheaply and quickly verify if things worked or not.” But as Scott’s giant Ferrari puzzle came together, the more he loved its raw and unfinished appearance. No bad thing, either, since to bring it to factory standard would have cost a bomb and, in any case, without a roof, it could never be a purist’s Ferrari and his investment would never be recouped. He decided just to enjoy the build, make the car mechanically perfect – and stick with the rat look. “For me, the rat look is where the car is perfect under the skin but looks like it’s been sat around, untouched and never restored,” says Scott. “Bits I’ve since acquired or refitted were finished in red so I’ve left them because they add a touch of colour.” To describe Scott as a Ferrari nut is something of an understatement. His passion for the marque began as a boy when he saw a competition on the back page of Reader’s Digest to win a 308. At the time, his dad never stopped going on about the 246 Dino he dreamed of owning, and then Out Run, the Sega game, came out, featuring a Testarossa Spider. “When, eventually, I could afford to, I bought my first Ferrari – a 348 Spider,” he says. At this point, I should point out that Scott, a down-to-earth chap of 42, appears to be comfortably off but by no means loaded. He’s freshly divorced and is taking a year out of his job as an IT bod to consider his future. He has recently moved into a small estate somewhere in the Berkshire commuter belt; nice houses but with driveways too small for more than two cars. It’s why I have no trouble finding his place, since out on the road in front of it is part of his Ferrari collection: the Ratarossa and an F355 Spider; on the driveway, a 355 F1 Spider; and in the double garage, where the Ratty lives when it’s raining or Scott’s working on it, a 308. In all, Scott has eight Ferraris: two 355s, three 308s and the Ratarossa, all left-hand drive, and the 360 Challenge Stradale and a 456 GTA, both right-hand drive. In addition, he has a 1969 Porsche 911 T Coupe and a Volkswagen Golf GTI Mk1. Some are here and the rest are with friends and family. They’re insured for £500,000 and his annual premium is £3000. How has he done it? “I’m the guy who buys the Ferrari you shouldn’t: the one with uncertain history, in the wrong colour or the unfinished project. They’re relatively cheap to buy and I make a profit selling them on when I’ve sorted them out. I plough the money back into the collection.” But not all of his purchases are ‘orphans’. “My 430 Scuderia was immaculate,” he says. “I owned it for three months and then sold it, making £25,000. I added £3000 and straight away bought a left-hand-drive F355.” Over time, Scott has become a whizz with the spanners. He’s self-taught but little, short of dropping an engine for a timing belt change, is beyond him. He’s constantly on the internet, seeking out deals, parts and technical advice. Next on Scott’s Ratty to-do list is to refurbish the car’s steering and front suspension, give the engine a thorough service and tidy up the cabin. He’ll fit a sports exhaust too. It’ll all be done properly using genuine parts. As a final flourish, he’ll detail the engine so it looks like new. Is there one Ferrari Scott would sell his collection for? “Yes: an F40. It would be the only one that would be driven every day. I did once suggest to my ex that we extend the mortgage to buy one.” No need to ask why it’s just him and eight Fezzas these days.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/seven-heaven-chasing-f-16s-%C2%A380k-caterham-csr-twenty",
    "description": "The Mach Loop, named after nearby Machynlleth, is where the British military train new flyers We go plane spotting in Caterham's £80,000 one-of-20 CSR Twenty special editions I don’t have accurate statistics because none will exist, but bear with. I think anecdotally it’s acknowledged that more than a few pilots subsequently become Caterham drivers, and/or that flying is something many Caterham owners turn to. There’s something that unites the activities: mechanical interaction, guiding something analogue, feeling the elements, managing mild perils. The Seven club magazine is even called Lowflying. Where better, then, to take a new Caterham than to what has sort of become the glamorous home of low flying in the UK: a set of valleys in Wales colloquially known as the Mach Loop, named after the nearby town of Machynlleth, where British military flyers and their friends practise screeching between the hills. If this sounds to you like an excuse for machine-mad photographer Jack Harrison and me to stand on a windswept mountainside in the hope of seeing an F-22 scream just a few hundred feet past us then, well… rumbled, I suppose. But what better Caterham to get there in than this one? It’s a CSR, which was a new dawn for the Kent firm when it first appeared 20 years ago. Wider than a standard Seven, it was a bigger, smoother-riding, more capable and plusher Seven, with a marginally more comfortable interior. Faster and yet at the same time more relaxed. Better for zooming through the valleys than the harsher-riding Caterhams of old. I can’t remember the last time I saw one. And if you’re a Caterham fetishist like me, you’ll know one if you see it. A standard Caterham Seven, by which I mean one from the regular range (not the kei car-compliant 170), is 3180mm long by 1470mm wide. You can optionally ‘large-chassis’ a regular Seven for more room, which takes it out to the size of this CSR, 3360mm long by 1700mm wide, but the CSR has details that make it look different again. It’s Caterham-esque but somehow not quite so. It has more aerodynamic (these things are relative) front wings and there are more holes in it to let air in and out. And where are the front springs? They’re inboard, driven by pushrods, and next to those wings (carbonfibre on this test car) are aerodynamically profiled front wishbones.Trying to enhance the aero of a Seven is like fitting secondary glazing to one part of Blenheim Palace and hoping it will reduce the heating bills, but I suppose it all helps a little. There’s more. At the back, although you can’t see it, it has fully independent double-wishbone suspension rather than the trad Seven’s de Dion rear end. The advantage this suspension gives ride quality is marked, and it helps improve grip and traction too. Not that even this will be able to do much about Wales in winter, given the CSR is on Toyo Proxes R888R tyres – hardly renowned for their performance in such conditions. Ultimately, though – and this is why you so rarely spot a CSR – British Caterham buyers preferred their Sevens in the more traditional and basic ‘Series 3’ form, without the posher insides and funky outsides. The CSR has continued to be available in mainland Europe because it passes regulations other Sevens never could, but has long since been dropped from the range here. Until now, just as its time is up. The CSR is going off sale completely and, to mark the demise, Caterham is building a 20-off CSR Twenty edition, for sale in the UK only. When the CSR first arrived, power came from a 260bhp 2.3-litre Ford engine breathed on by Cosworth. Owing to more limited engine availability today, it houses a 210bhp and 150lb ft 2.0-litre Ford Duratec unit, which drives through a five-speed Mazda MX-5 gearbox. A limited-slip differential is optional but not fitted to our test car because it tends to whine a bit, and because Caterham sees this as a (slightly) more rounded proposition, it went with the quieter option. The CSR comes factory-built only, by the way – with no self-build alternative. The CSR was always one of the more expensive Sevens but these final-edition CSRs cost – wait for it – from £79,995, more than twice the CSR’s price when it was first launched. I do wonder if this is Caterham testing the water of what it can do with the range. Over the past few years, it hasn’t been a given that the company makes profits and, with a 170 available from £29,490 (self-build), perhaps Caterham has been thinking some models are too affordable. Plus this is a bit of history. Caterham makes noises about the plushness of the CSR Twenty’s interior – it has some new materials, more artfully applied, but like the aerodynamics these things are relative. It is still a Seven interior, which means snug and basic. The seats are pleasingly softly finished, there are carpets and the centre console has a cushiony soft leather finish, with Alcantara highlights around and a numbered plaque. There’s a satin-finish carbon dashboard too. I find it easy to get comfortable in any Seven but this big-bodied version exists to accommodate the larger driver. If you’re tall or wide, it’s the variant for you. In fact, there’s so much room in the pedal box that with my size-eight feet and small trainers, the pedals are too far apart for easy heel-and-toeing. The steering wheel is a non-adjustable leather Momo thing, the gearshift throw is perhaps the shortest in production, and the simple dials and toggle switches are pifflingly easy to acquaint yourself with. There’s a heater and a 12V socket, and even though the suspension design takes up more room than older systems, there’s still a boot, mohair-lined. Plus a roof. I don’t imagine anybody will think that the hood itself is plush. Magazines were complaining about the popper fastenings when I was a kid and the Seven still uses them now. Today, a Seven’s hood pulls tighter than ones of old and keeps you mercifully dry too, but it’s a bind to put up and down. Note also that the mirrors are attached to the doors and you can’t adjust them when you’re inside the car. Four-point harnesses are standard, with all the safety but faffing they entail. Still, there’s a heated windscreen to keep misting at bay and you can reach all of the other windows with a cloth to demist those, so it’s not an unpleasant drive from Caterham’s lovely new factory at Dartford towards my overnight halt in mid-west England, even on a rainy winter’s evening. But because you sit so low, you’ll swear that anything taller than a Nissan Qashqai has its main beams on, given how dazzling headlights are in the mirrors. By the time I reach my overnight base, I’ve decided I’d fit tinted film over them if the car were mine. The morning is bright and, because days like this are my favourite reason to get out of bed, so is my mood. There’s no guarantee of seeing aircraft in the Mach Loop. You just turn up at a lay-by on the A487, walk up a hill, and hope. I don’t mind either way. The drive over is pretty much all good back roads. This CSR’s 2.0-litre engine tune is the same as the 420 model’s and is a combo that hasn’t been offered in the CSR chassis before. Continental CSRs were previously running with the 485 model’s higher-revving 225bhp engine. But if you think that having only 210bhp (at 7600rpm) or 150lb ft (at 6300rpm) is a downgrade, remember this is a car that still weighs only 620kg and it has one of the slickest, sharpest manual gearshifts in production. Those power and torque figures arrive at high revs, so you need to work the gears, whereupon it’s amazingly urgent. At low revs it’s still responsive and linear, but at one point I leave it in fourth to overtake a truck and a few seconds later realise I should have picked third. But even with a clear sky (and the roof down), the road isn’t going to dry today and, in these conditions, it doesn’t pay to be too liberal with the throttle because the Seven can and will break traction. We were extremely complimentary about the ride of the CSR when it first arrived in the mid-2000s and age hasn’t wearied it. It rolls with an absorbance denied other Sevens, though I think the gap is closer than it used to be. The compliance doesn’t bring with it a paucity of body control. The CSR is bigger than a regular Seven but the sprung masses are still light, so easily controlled. And while it’s bigger and arguably less pure than the smaller Sevens, the Caterham character is still very much intact. If you’d never driven a Seven, you’d be blown away by the lightness and immediacy of a CSR. How much does an F-15 weigh? The internet says 14,300kg, quite a lot more than a Seven, though it seems to impact its manoeuvrability and speed very little. Jack and I haven’t even finished climbing the muddy, slippery slope when one enters from left of stage. So close, barely higher than us, vortices trailing from the wingtips. In a moment it has passed, heading down towards Llyn Mwyngil (Tal-y-llyn Lake), before spearing left and out of view. A road almost follows the route out of the valley, so after watching for a while (a prop-driven Texan T1 trainer and a Phenom T1 jet pass: we are having a good day), we decide to take it too. Small trainers on, teacup stowed in walking boots, I’m no more than half a mile down the road when an A400M cargo plane appears directly overhead, seen before heard, and arcs its way gently into the distance. I’m not pretending a Seven is anything like real low flying. But as a cosplay alternative, for kidding yourself there’s an affinity, these are the roads, and this is the car, to do it.",

    "description": "Sometimes, timing is everything. Just when I need a compact but quick-ish car to get from one end of the city to the other, in walks the Toyota Urban Cruiser Taisor Neo-drive – Toyota’s version of the Maruti Fronx but with a name that does its best to confuse the hell out of you. Still, semantics and onomastics apart, what makes my eyes light up is that the Taisor Turbo is a relatively light car with a nice 1.0 turbo engine and a sufficient amount of boost. So, while the crossover-like profile may help it look bulky, the Taisor with a Boosterjet engine and a 5-speed manual weighs in at just over one tonne: 1,030kg, to be precise. And it isn’t just the 100hp; it also has 147.6Nm of torque that the engine puts out between 2,000rpm and 4,500rpm. The presence of a turbo, along with extra power and torque, makes this a fun crossover. This is primarily why it’s a happy camper in the city. Driving across town in start-stop traffic, what impresses is the relative lack of turbo lag. Sure, there is a zone where engine responses are relatively slow – around 1,200rpm – but responses are better by 1,500rpm, and power keeps getting stronger. This is primarily because this is a direct-injection engine (the only one in the Maruti range) that makes peak torque relatively early. The small turbo can be spooled up quickly due to the lower resistance it offers, and the engine even gets a small amount of e-boost from the mild-hybrid system. Light, easy and precise, the manual gearbox is good to use. Needs a sixth gear, though. This is why the 1.0 turbo is quite friendly to drive even in start-stop traffic, and unlike most turbos, I don’t mind letting it off the boil. In addition, the relatively responsive bottom end is also a reason why this engine delivers some good economy numbers, especially if you can resist squeezing down on the throttle. The dead pedal sometimes comes in the way when I press the clutch. Not nice. However, the latter is something I find difficult to resist, and that’s because, after 2,000rpm, the Taisor ramps up its power delivery in a linear push that gets stronger and stronger as you wind up the powerband. Sure, Suzuki’s Boosterjet could have had 10-15hp more, and power delivery doesn’t have that spike of boost that makes turbocharged cars so much fun. Still, the additional performance and light weight make this one of the most fun compact cars around, the ramp up in performance carrying on till around 6,000rpm. And that means my early morning drives from one end of Mumbai’s new inner-city highway – the Coastal Road – to the other en route for our Modern Classic Rally in Kalina are especially fun. The sweeping elevated sections and light traffic allow me to wind through the gears, and what’s nicer is that there is a real tachometer, a real dial and a real needle to follow. It helps that you can see all around, but the resolution needs to be better to see obstacles. While the 5-speed gearbox is slick enough, and you can heel and toe easily, the clutch is placed too close to the dead pedal and often comes in the way when I am trying to depress the clutch fully. Also, don’t much care for the plastic quality on the dash or quality levels in general. The seats are a bit too soft, and the cabin lacks a secure place to put my phone. The Toyota-Maruti screen, however, is much improved and has been relatively glitch-free, as is the voice quality on the carphone. What also makes this car quite practical is that it has a decent-sized boot, good ground clearance, and it’s easy to park with its 360-degree camera. The resolution, though, could have been better. And though it isn’t uncomfortable per se, the ride could have been more comfortable. Still, the Taisor is one of the most characterful, practical and enjoyable cars to drive in its class. The cherry on the top – the Taisor looks more balanced and interesting, especially with those headlights and the two-tone bodywork.

    "description": "We’ve had the Skoda Kodiaq in India before, but never the sporty RS version. That, however, is set to change with the arrival of the second-generation model. The regular Kodiaq will launch here in the April quarter, and the RS version will likely arrive by October, but unlike the regular Kodiaq, the RS will come in as a CBU import, meaning it will be pricey. Skoda Kodiaq RS exterior design and engineering (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq is less SUV-like than before, but you won’t mistake it for an estate. Segmented grille DRL is exclusive to the RS version. The Skoda Kodiaq – named after the Kodiak bear – was first unveiled in 2016, with the second generation coming in late 2023. It’s built on the Volkswagen Group’s MQB Evo platform, a derivative of the previous car’s MQB platform. The new car has grown 60mm longer but is about 10mm lower, giving it a more elongated stance. But while it is less SUV-like than before, you won’t mistake it for an estate. The RS version stands out with a blacked-out grille, lower bumper air intakes and a cool-looking segmented DRL that runs between the grille’s slats and extends into the headlight daytime running lamps (DRLs). Like the standard car, the headlamps are split LED Matrix units. Kodiaq RS comes with exclusive 20-inch alloy wheels Alloys are designed with aero efficiency in mind. Exclusive to the RS are two 20-inch alloy wheel designs with red brake calipers, black cladding around the wheels, and black accents on the lower sill, wing mirrors and the B, C and D pillars. At the rear, the tail-lights have a cool split and mirrored look, the lower half extending into a reflector bar across the boot lid, with Skoda’s lettermark replacing the logo. The rear windshield is topped by a deep spoiler and flanked by fins that are finished in black. Skoda says these aid airflow around the car, helping reduce the drag coefficient of the new-gen Kodiaq from 0.31 to 0.28. Skoda Kodiaq RS interior space and comfort (rating 8.5/10) Interior space is plenty and its comfortable too inside the Skoda Kodiaq RS There’s loads of space all around; the rear legroom and headroom are impressive. The inside is an all-black affair, from the headliner to the carpets. You can choose between suede or leather trim on the sports seats, dashboard, door pads and centre armrest, but only in one colour – black. And what really sets it off is the lively contrast from the red stitching all around the cabin. The 3-spoke steering wheel wrapped in perforated leather looks neat, with RS badging at the bottom. It’s nice to hold and has the familiar and easy-to-use scroll wheels. Skoda has put the extra length to good use. There’s ample headroom at the front and rear, and even with the front seats set rearward for taller passengers, second-row occupants will have plenty of legroom. This can be adjusted further, given that the second row slides and reclines. Like the previous car, the new Kodiaq can also be had as a 7-seater, with the third row stowing away neatly in the boot floor. Our car was the 5-seat variant, so we’ll reserve judgement on the third row, but the boot space is enormous. Without the third row, boot space is a massive 910 litres, and even with it in place, there’s 340 litres. There’s also a spare tyre and a space for the cargo cover beneath the floor. Most of my time was spent driving, but having inspected the second row, it seemed comfy enough despite the 40:20:40 split, which sometimes tends to make the individual seats too small. The front sports seats on the RS are really nice, and the bolstering held me nicely in place during some spirited driving in the hills. Skoda Kodiaq RS performance and refinement (rating 7.5/10) The Kodiaq RS is not firecracker quick but it’s just enough to justify an RS badge 2.0 TSI is a happy cruiser and can deliver strong acceleration, but you can feel it working hard. The Kodiaq RS packs the VW Group’s familiar 2.0-litre TSI engine. This unit also powers the regular Kodiaq, but under the hood of the RS, the output is bumped up to 265hp and 400Nm. Incidentally, the power is identical to the Octavia RS, which has the same engine, but the torque is 30Nm more here. The output is enough to propel the Kodiaq RS’ 1.8-tonne mass from 0-100kph in 6.3 seconds, which is plenty quick for what is also a genuine family SUV. Drive it sedately, and the Kodiaq RS is happy to cruise steadily all day with the engine nicely relaxed. And, should you need a quick overtake, mashing the throttle will drop a few gears, giving you momentum quickly enough. The 7-speed DSG gearbox did trip up occasionally while trundling through some low-speed traffic. In Sport mode, the shifts are quick, and the engine is kept nicely on the boil, so overtaking at any point is very quick and easy. Engine is aurally enhanced with artificial soundtrack The engine note does sound nice, but it’s enhanced with what Skoda calls Dynamic Sound Boost, which augments the car’s real exhaust note with an artificial soundtrack. Skoda Kodiaq RS mileage (rating 6/10) The Skoda Kodiaq RS fuel efficiency will not be very high, expect a single digit range only. We didn’t get to test the mileage of the Kodiaq RS in Croatia but given the engine’s output, the car's 1.8-tonne weight, and the fact that you can feel and even hear the engine working hard, don’t expect fuel efficiency to be impressive at all. Skoda Kodiaq RS ride comfort and handling (rating 7.5/10) In comfort mode, there is some float, but in all other areas ride and handling is good in the Kodiaq RS The body does roll in corners, but Sport mode tidies that up nicely. Putting down the RS’ power is an 4x4 driveline with impressive grip. We had some snowy weather, and driving to a mountain ski resort over wet roads, I always felt confident and was able to maintain a good pace. The RS has adaptive dampers, and in Sport mode, they do a good job of keeping body roll in check. What’s nice is that the ride does not get lumpy. In fact, I found myself using the firmer damper setting even on highway stretches, as in Comfort mode, there’s some body float over undulating surfaces and lean in corners. There’s a variable-rack steering, which adjusts the ratio for less steering input around bends. These systems often corrupt the feel, but that’s not the case here, with Kodiaq RS’ steering providing enough weight and precision. Skoda Kodiaq RS features and safety (rating 8.5/10) You can expect the Kodiaq RS to be well-equipped The all-black interior looks sporty, and vibrant red stitching is plenty but not overdone. The touchscreen is a new 13-inch unit that’s slick to use. Equipment-wise, there are all the expected bits, including 3-zone climate control, a 10-inch Virtual Cockpit instrument panel and a free-standing 10-inch infotainment screen or an optional 13-inch unit like we had on our test car. India-spec model should come with sunroof What was not on our test car was a sunroof, but given the popularity here, expect the India model to get one. Being a Skoda, the Kodiaq packs in a lot of ‘Simply Clever’ bits, like specific storage spots for the key fob and phones and even a handy little duster to wipe the touchscreen clean. You can expect the India-spec car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. Skoda Kodiaq RS price and verdict (rating 7/10) The Kodiaq RS isn’t a wild child, it’s a family SUV with a nice sporty side to it. If everything goes according to plan, Skoda says we can expect the Kodiaq RS in India by October, and, importantly, local manufacturing is a possibility later on. So, while its everyday sibling could be competitively priced, the RS will most definitely not be, as it will come in as a CBU for now. Expect an asking price of around Rs 60 lakh, which is wading into traditional luxury-brand territory, and for some, that would seem like a lot of money for a Skoda. But the Kodiaq RS does a lot to entice you to look past all that. There’s a massive amount of space all around and the option of three rows of seats. It’s comfortable and rides well, and you can expect the India car to be well-equipped with all the expected safety bits, too. So, it’s got ‘family SUV’ off pat. But what about the sporty side that the RS badge promises? It’s not light and nimble for sure, but it’s plenty quick in a straight line, and the 4x4 drivetrain gives you ample grip in corners. Plus, the engine sounds fun. So, for that money, then, there really is nothing quite like it.

    "description": "The Skoda Kylaq is off to a good start, with the company recording sales of over 5,000 units last month, thereby giving Skoda its highest-ever monthly sales figure in India: 7,422 units in March 2025. Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, Skoda Auto India Brand director Petr Janeba confirmed, “The waiting time currently ranges between 2 and 5 months.” Seeing the positive response, Skoda India recently also extended the introductory price period of the compact SUV until the end of this month.  Kylaq is powered by a 115hp, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine Has secured a 5-star crash safety rating from Bharat NCAP Available in four trims: Classic, Signature, Signature+, Prestige Skoda Kylaq waiting period explained Base Classic trim has the longest waiting period The maximum waiting period of up to 5 months is for the base Classic trim, which is only available with a manual gearbox. This, however, is not surprising, given that Skoda has earmarked a majority of production for the high-spec variants. Consequently, the mid-spec Signature and Signature+ trims have a waiting period of about 3 months, while the top Prestige trim has a waiting period of 2 months. Skoda is targeting 8,000 monthly Kylaq sales Skoda is likewise expanding its touchpoints With the Kylaq, Janeba expects to hit 8,000 monthly sales by the end of 2025. This is expected to help the company achieve its target of selling 1,00,000 vehicles annually in India from 2026. “In March, we reached 280 touchpoints, which is slower than we’d like. But by August, we’ll ramp up to 350 touchpoints, allowing us to operate at full network capacity. So, by the end of the year, touching 8,000 Kylaqs is not a problem. Sustaining momentum will depend on the expanded network, a more robust IT system, and hiring more front-facing staff,” said Janeba. But while the Kylaq is certainly bringing in much-needed volumes for the Czech brand, it is worth pointing out that the Kylaq is also inevitably cannibalising Kushaq’s sales. Prior to the Kylaq’s arrival, the Kushaq sold about 1,500-2,000 units a month, which has since dropped below 1,000. Skoda sold only 897 units of the Kushaq last month, the lowest since its launch in 2021. Given the overlap in features and powertrain options, it is no surprise that buyers are seeing greater value in the sub-4-metre Kylaq. Skoda Kylaq engine details and features The Kylaq gets a sole 1.0-litre, three-cylinder, turbo-petrol engine, which produces 115hp and 178Nm of peak torque. It comes mated to either a 6-speed manual gearbox with an ARAI-claimed fuel efficiency of 19.05kpl or a 6-speed torque converter with a claimed efficiency of 19.68kpl. The Kylaq gets six airbags as standard, and in terms of features, the top-spec gets a 10-inch infotainment screen, an 8-inch digital instrument cluster, powered and ventilated front seats, a sunroof, ambient lighting, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Recently, the Kylaq also secured a 5-star safety rating from Bharat NCAP.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz has revealed the ‘G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s’, a limited-run version of the off-roader that serves as a throwback to the 1979 original. To that end, the new G-Class special edition gets a bevy of vintage-inspired styling flourishes inside and out, new paint finishes, an expanded features list, and more. G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s gets two new colours and classic-style exterior fitments Inside, it has bespoke lettering, Dove Grey upholstery for the seats, and more It can be had with either petrol or diesel straight-6 engine and 9-speed auto gearbox Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s exterior design Night Black accents and two classic-style colours Most of the design elements of the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s have been carried over from the one-off anniversary edition of the G-Class that celebrated 5,00,000 units produced. Up front, notable changes include orange indicators (the standard model has darkened/clear units), a classic Mercedes-Benz emblem on the bonnet, headlight cages, and a blacked-out finish for the fascia and bumper. Over to the side, the SUV gets new 5-spoke silver alloy wheels, and the B-pillar sports a 1980s-style ‘Schöckl Proved’ badge. All G-Class vehicles since 1979 get the Schöckl Proved badge to signify that they have passed rigorous testing on the Schöckl mountain in Austria. There’s also a large roof rack on top. At the rear, the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s prominently features classic-style Mercedes-Benz lettering on the tailgate, an exclusive soft cover for the spare wheel and a ladder. Much like the original, the special edition G-Class can be had with either an Agave Green or a Colorado Beige paint finish to contrast the Night Black Magno accents sprinkled across the bodywork. Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s interior and features Dove Grey cloth upholstery and exclusive lettering The G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s has an all-black cabin, and the centre portions of the seats have chequered cloth upholstery finished in Dove Grey fabric, which was highly popular then. The large grab handle for the front passenger has “Stronger than the 1980s” embossed on it, and the centre console has “1 of 460” lettering right behind the trackpad, referring to the model’s exclusivity. The list of features comprises a duo of 12.3-inch screens for the infotainment system and instrument cluster, a sunroof, a Burmester 3D surround sound system, and more. Interestingly, the puddle lights in the rearview mirrors project “Stronger than Time” onto the ground upon opening either of the front doors. Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s powertrain and performance Available in petrol and diesel guises; no AMG version Under the hood, the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s is the same as the G450d and G500 models sold in overseas markets, both of which are powered by mild-hybrid straight-6 engines mated to 9-speed automatic transmissions: the G450d has a 2.9-litre turbo-diesel mill developing 367hp and 750Nm, and the G500 gets a 3.0-litre turbo-petrol unit good for 449hp and 560Nm. The 1980s-inspired edition cannot be had in the range-topping V8-powered Mercedes-AMG G 63. The G450d can dispatch the 0-100kph run in 5.8 seconds, while the G500 is slightly faster at 5.4 seconds. Top speed is limited to 210kph for both models. Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s launch details Bookings open in global markets Mercedes-Benz will build only 460 units of the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s edition, with order books now open in international markets. It is currently unconfirmed if any of those units will make it to India.
