    "description": "Explosive performance at an accessible price – these words instantly bring a certain orange machine to mind. Since 2013, the KTM 390 Duke has dominated its class, and every single rival that has gone up against the Duke has retreated with its tail tucked between its legs. But today, the Duke will have to deal with its toughest challenge yet posed by the Aprilia Tuono 457. KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 design and ergonomics Both have sharp designs and can feel tight for taller folks With some bikes, just a glance is enough to tell you what they are meant to do, and the designs of these two machines are true to their function. Neither is classically good-looking, and both are aggressively styled, although in its latest avatar, the 390 might be too aggressive for some.  The rider’s triangle is the first difference you’ll notice, and while both are reasonably comfortable, on the Aprilia, there is a bit of a forward reach to the handlebar, whereas you’re almost bolt upright on the KTM. Over bad roads, this will be felt in the lower back. With their 800mm perches, these bikes will be welcoming for shorter riders but feel cramped for taller ones.  Both bikes are a little tight for larger and heavier riders. At 5’11”, I just about fit on both these machines, but taller riders should look elsewhere. The Duke can be had with an accessory tall seat, raising its perch to 820mm, which will liberate some knee room for taller riders. The optional comfort seat on the Tuono keeps the same height as the stock unit. Neither is geared toward all-out comfort, and that’s par for the course.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 quality and features Duke has larger number of useful features and better quality all across Modern-day KTMs have made huge strides when it comes to the quality front, and that is clearly visible here. The Tuono 457, with its aluminium chassis, looks great, but crucial areas, such as the cheap-feeling key, the more basic levers and an ugly misaligned panel on the headlight surround, just feel like a step down from the KTM. Fun fact: the adjustable brake lever on the Tuono is a Rs 5,500 accessory (!) and appears to be the exact same unit as the one on the Gen 2 390 Duke that sells for under Rs 1,000. The 390 Duke now also gets cruise control. Another facet where the Duke is ahead of the Tuono is the features (and bragging rights) department. Its suspension has damping adjustability, the bidirectional quickshifter is standard, it comes with a cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control (TC), and the latest model even has cruise control. The Tuono, with its three riding modes, switchable ABS and TC and preload-adjustable front suspension, has a good level of kit, unlike the contender from the tuning fork brand. As for the Aprilia’s bidirectional quickshifter? A cool Rs 20,000 for that.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 handling Both are superb handlers and will put a big smile on your face However, you don’t ride a bike’s build quality or features, so I’ll stop rambling about that and start raving about how these things behave on the road. Both take very different approaches to their chassis – the KTM uses a steel trellis, while the Aprilia has an aluminium perimeter frame (the only one in this class to do so). Predictably, their behaviour on the side of the tyre is markedly different, but both are almost equally fast in the real world.  Both machines are fast, but they go about their business quite differently. It might sound cliché, but the Duke feels a lot like a supermoto, and the Tuono feels a lot like a sportbike with a taller handlebar in the corners. They handle with a different feeling: the Duke prioritises lightness and reactivity, while the Aprilia feels agile but also beautifully composed. That said, both handle very well, and you’ll have a great time on either machine, whether on road or track.  Key specificationsAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeKerb Weight175kg168.3kgSeat height800mm800mmGround clearance 150mm170mmFuel tank capacity12.7 litres15 litresWheelbase1360mm1357mm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 ride comfort Duke's suspension more pliant; Tuono's brake fade issue an annoyance While chasing twisty ribbons of tarmac is what owners will dream of doing with these bikes, the reality is they will be used for commuting more often. Mumbai’s lumpy roads are a proper test of a bike’s suspension, and here, the Duke’s sophisticated setup will be worth its weight in gold. The bike feels a lot more absorptive while going over bumps, without sacrificing poise when you turn up the wick.   Both have taut suspension setups but KTM feels much more pliant than the Aprilia. In comparison, the Tuono’s suspension system, carried over unchanged from the RS 457, feels much stiffer, and you will feel more of the bumps. The brake-fade issue under repeated hard use on the 457s is another sore point, and while it isn’t a very difficult fix, Aprilia should’ve ironed it out by now. Especially since customers have shared that certain dealerships say warranties will be cancelled when brake master cylinders are upgraded.  EngineAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeEngine457cc, twin-cyl, liquid-cooled399cc, single-cyl, liquid-cooledPower47.6hp at 9,400rpm46hp at 8,500rpmPower-to-weight ratio272hp/tonne273.33hp/tonneTorque43.5Nm at 6,400rpm39Nm at 6,400rpm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 engine and performance Aprilia's engine is the star of the show, KTM is quick but not as characterful So far, it’s neck and neck, but one area where the Tuono scores a massive victory is the engine. The twin-cylinder mill is smooth, brimming with character, and makes all the right sounds. Its strong low-end and mid-range also mean you needn’t frantically work the gearbox, and it also pops nice power wheelies. In outright performance, the Tuono is quicker in the 0-100kph sprint by just 0.3 seconds, but its engine’s effortless grunt is more apparent in the roll-on acceleration tests.  The Tuono’s engine is a peach. Hopping onto the KTM after the Aprilia will make you realise you need to work the gearbox more and give the engine revs to make quick progress. You’ll also feel a more pronounced buzz, especially in the handlebar. However, the Duke’s refinement levels are respectable for a single-cylinder engine of this size with this level of performance. That said, the excitable hooligan nature of the KTM is great fun, if that’s the riding experience you’re after.  PerformanceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeAcceleration 0-60kph2.17s2.21s0-100kph4.88s5.21sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph1.73s1.87s30-70kph2.83s3.19s50-80kph2.68s3.22sBraking60-0kph (in metres)16.3516.52 KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict Tuono is an impressive machine let down by pressing issues PriceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 3.95 lakhRs 2.97 lakh All that back and forth now means I need to tell you which bike is the winner. The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke. There are buyers out there for whom the extra Rs 1.5 lakh will be justified because the Tuono feels like a scaled-down big bike, which is a very special feeling.  Brake-fade issue continues on Aprilia 457s. However, in the last couple of months, several customers have reported varied and significant engine reliability issues. Aprilia India recently attributed these issues to unauthorised modifications and/or irregular service and says that it has addressed the few genuine cases. Whether the issues are fully addressed is something only time can tell.  Beyond that, there is no escaping the fact that the 390 Duke has a much more accessible price, more features and better ride comfort, and it can be nearly as fast as the Tuono. There were some isolated engine incidents at the beginning, but Bajaj swiftly addressed them, and the bike has been around for long enough that there are no significant reliability concerns. All this is why the KTM 390 Duke will continue to reign in this segment. Also See: KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 comparison video",

    "description": "Some motorcycles have a tendency to slip under the average buyer’s radar, and the Suzuki GSX-8R is a fine example. It probably won’t be the first pick when you ask someone to think of a middleweight sportbike, and that’s fair because this bike packs a parallel-twin engine in a segment with more powerful inline-3 and 4-cylinder motors. But unassuming things can often surprise you with how good they can be, and that’s exactly what the 8R did at our annual track day a couple of months back. Not only did it set the quickest lap time (to be fair, it was also the most powerful bike there), but it also proved to be surprisingly sweet and engaging to ride. Suzuki GSX8R engine sound and performance - 8/10 Twin-cyl motor is torquey and smooth but isn't the most exciting nor the best sounding in its class As it turns out, this character translates beautifully to the street as well. While the 776cc parallel twin produces the least power in this segment, the torque figure is actually the highest. Its 78Nm is, in fact, much closer to the Triumph Street Triple 765 RS than it is to the Daytona 660, which is this bike’s immediate rival. That results in a wonderfully strong pull from as low as 3,000rpm, and effortless performance is the name of the game.   The 776cc parallel twin is a good engine, but it lacks the sound and top-end excitement you’ll find with rivals that have 3- or 4-cylinder motors. Switching between the three riding modes lets you experience a very mellow throttle response in C mode or a sharp, quick-throttle feel in A mode, where the torque hit arrives with a solid kick. I found that B mode offers a nice middle ground between the two, but regardless of which you choose, the 8R will propel you to triple-digit speeds with complete ease and no need for dramatic high revs.  That’s not to say that this is a slow motorcycle, and with 82hp, it will blast past 150kph the way most quick Indian bikes would get to 100. But there’s also no discounting the fact that it has sacrificed some of the exciting, zingy top-end performance of its multi-cylinder rivals in exchange for the low-end usability. However, the bigger loss for many enthusiasts will be the sound or relative lack of it. It doesn't sound as nice nor has the same top-end rush as its multi-cylindered rivals. This is a 270-degree parallel twin, and it does have that typically deep and rumbling sound, but it’s also quite muted and not very exciting. For reference, Aprilia’s new 457 parallel twin sounds a lot louder and more thrilling, as we discovered when the Suzuki and the Tuono 457 were parked side by side on our track day. If you’re someone who wants a loud and flashy sportbike, this won’t be for you. EngineSuzuki GSX-8REngine776cc, twin-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower82hp at 8500rpm Torque78Nm at 6800rpmGearbox 6-speed Suzuki GSX8R ride and handling - 8/10  It is poised when going through a corner yet comfortable over broken roads But a subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one because this bike is surprisingly good fun to ride. On the track, it proved to be easy, unintimidating and thoroughly well-behaved, responding obediently to your every request. This clearly isn’t a bike made for the racetrack, but it performed there far better than most would expect. The only limiting factors for Rajini when he was pushing for a fast lap were that the footpegs were scraping and that the ABS was too intrusive. Comfort is aided by a wide and accommodating rider seat. On the street, neither of those ended up being an issue, but the bike retained that sweet and friendly feel. At 205kg, the 8R is in the ballpark for the segment, and you will feel the weight if you plan to go attacking some very tight and twisty interior roads. But give the bike some breathing room on a wider road, and you’ll discover a rewarding handler that settles into a wonderful flow with the road.  Tall clip-on bars result in a reasonably comfy riding position. The 8R feels settled on its suspension and encourages you to push to quite a high pace. Part of this deep-seated sense of confidence comes through the tubular steel chassis and the non-adjustable but well-set Showa suspension. It’s not excessively plush like the Daytona 660, which means it isn’t as comfy on badly made concrete roads (although it really isn’t bad and is far from punishing), but you reap the rewards when the pace is raised on a good stretch of tarmac.  Key SpecsSuzuki GSX-8RKerb Weight205kgSeat Height810mmFuel Capacity14 litresGround Clearance145mmWheelbase1465mm Suzuki GSX8R comfort, build quality and features - 8/10 Well-built, comfortable and has everything you need, can drink fuel quite quickly if you ride it hard   On the other hand, the riding position is committed enough to remind you that you’re on a fair, sporty motorcycle but also relatively kind on the wrists, hips and knees. It’s a similar story with the brakes. The initial bite is almost disappointing, but once you start using them for a while, you realise there’s sufficient power and feel, and it matches the nature of the bike. Brakes feel dull at first but work well. I also like how Suzuki has given its 5-inch TFT display a simple, easy-to-use layout. You almost never have to enter any menus. All the functions you’d need, like changing the ride modes, the TC levels (four, including off), or just switching between trip information, can be done from the main home screen display. Overall quality levels are also very nice, and like most imported Japanese bikes, everything feels solid and has a pleasing, built-to-last feel. TFT display has a clean layout and is very easy to use. There aren’t many outright negatives, and the few complaints are that the bike gets quite hot in heavy traffic – there are no nasty hot air blasts, but there is quite a bit of radiated heat that you need to deal with. What I found to be more of an issue was that it seems to empty its 14-litre tank quite quickly, and you won’t go much further than 150-170km on a tankful if you have a throttle-happy right wrist.   A subtle nature doesn’t mean an unimpressive one, and the 8R is surprisingly good fun. Suzuki GSX8R price and verdict - 8/10 It is the most affordable and least flashy machine in its class At Rs 9.25 lakh, ex-showroom, the GSX-8R costs about Rs 50,000 less than the Daytona and Rs 75,000 less than Honda’s revered CBR650R. The price savings are nice but not big enough to be a reason to pick this bike over those two. For that, I’d say that this is the thinking person’s middleweight sportbike – the bike for someone who likes flying under the radar.  The 8R is a lovely but understated machine, which won't make it stand out in its class. And with that in mind, Suzuki may have a bit of a tough time on their hands. That’s because this is the segment where someone is typically buying their first sportbike, and subtlety is usually not at the top of the wish list. But for those who want that more understated experience, the GSX-8R is a great choice.  Also See: Suzuki GSX8R video review",

    "description": "Don’t let the ‘Sport’ in its name mislead you; what makes this Range Rover quick is the little SV badge instead, though that also needs some clarification. You see, per JLR, SV cars in the JLR-verse are the ‘exquisite interpretations by Special Vehicle Operations’. So, while on the Range Rover, SV denotes ‘even more luxury’, on the Range Rover Sport, it signals ‘the fastest Range Rover of all time’. SV on the Range Rover Sport signals the fastest Range Rover of all time.  Indeed, powered by JLR’s BMW-sourced 4.4-litre twin-turbo petrol V8, tuned here to 635hp, this Range Rover Sport SV does the 0 to 100kph dash in a claimed 3.8 seconds and tops out at an impressive 290kph. So, while it’s got some off-road chops, it’s quite a different take from its regular off-roading siblings, and we got a day to experience it in the UK. Range Rover Sport SV Performance and Refinement: 8/10 The breadth of the powertrain’s character transformation is impressive Engage SV mode via the illuminated button positioned towards the base of the steering wheel, and the Sport SV preps the entire car, chassis, engine and all for a performance level beyond the regular Dynamic mode. Ride height drops by another 15mm, and torque bumps up 50Nm to 800Nm with the Dynamic launch mode. Range Rover Sport SV specsEngine Mild-hybrid, twin-turbo V8Displacement 4395ccPower635hpTorque 750Nm (800Nm with dynamic launch mode)Gearbox8-speed AT Drive layout All-wheel drive 0-100kph (claimed)3.8 seconds Top-speed (claimed) 290kph And boy, it is quick. I floor it in manual mode first and hit the redline in first and second gears before I can tug at the paddle. Cog swaps need to be supercar-style quick, and after telling my brain that, I get the full-bore launch – what a rush that is. Power delivery is thick and fast, and it revs freely past 7,000rpm; the acceleration feels nice and raw with sharp and quick gearshifts, quite uncharacteristically for a planetary torque converter autobox and quite a transformation from the unit’s daily driver abilities that it does just fine, too. Sport SV's straight-line speed and the engine’s flexible character are a delight.  What’s nice is there’s a neat soundtrack as well; perhaps some of the engine note is piped in through the speakers. But I’m not complaining; the gurgle from the exhausts is something we may soon not hear at all. Dynamic mode dials things down from wild to energetic. And left in Auto mode, the Sport SV is quite the relaxed town cruiser. Range Rover Sport SV Ride Comfort and Handling: 7/10 Can hold its own around corners but isn’t what you could call agile With all that propulsion, keeping a two-and-a-half-tonne SUV on the road is tricky business, so JLR has thrown a lot in terms of chassis systems. There’s all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering, torque vectoring by braking, an active rear locking differential and a setup that the company calls 6D Dynamics, a system that combines hydraulically linked dampers and height-adjustable air springs. Not light on its feet but hydraulically linked dampers help keep things sane around corners.  The semi-active 6D system does away with the need for anti-roll bars, and instead, the hydraulically linked dampers pump fluid between each other to keep roll and pitch in check. It does work to an extent; cornering around some twisty British B and C roads, the Sport SV feels composed, but it’s never agile or light on its feet like a Porsche Cayenne, for instance. Ride quality is firm, and you can easily feel every rut and crack from the road surface. Move out of SV mode, and things improve, but even at its most plush setting, there is a sharp edge to the ride. 23-inch carbon-fibre wheels look neat but lend a firm edge to ride quality. No doubt the 23-inch carbon fibre rims with the slim Michelin Pilot Sport All Season tyres do no favours. The steering weight is fine and changes with the drive mode, but it lacks an incisive feel to it. Braking performance is just fine, and the optional carbon-ceramic disc did a good job hauling this massive brute down from high speeds. Range Rover Sport SV Mileage: 6/10 The combined WLTP fuel efficiency rating for the Sport SV is 8kpl It might have mild hybrid tech, but with its weight and performance tuning, don’t expect the SV’s kilometre per litre figure to be in two digits. The official WLTP rating for the Range Rover Sport SV’s fuel efficiency is 8kpl. Range Rover Sport SV Exterior Design and Engineering: 8/10 The SV does not shout sport in your face but has enough presence to draw attention Range Rover Sport SV dimensionsLength 4970mm Width2209mm Height 1814mm Wheelbase 2998mm Kerb weight 2560kg Tyres (F, R)285/40 R23, 305/35 R23 Now in its third generation, the Sport moves to a new platform: JLR’s MLA-Flex, which gives it multiple powertrain options, including full electric due later. The exterior, though, features familiar styling cues as its predecessor; it’s just a bit sleeker and meaner – for instance, the grille, the headlights and the glasshouse area are slimmer, giving the car a sportier look. SV variant gets a healthy splash of carbon fibre trim all around.  The SV version, which is dialled up further, has broader air intakes at the bumper’s edges, reprofiled lower sides and functional quad-exit tailpipes. And, of course, there’s plenty of carbon fibre: from the aforementioned 23-inch rims to trim bits around the tailpipes, as well as for the front bumper slats, grille, and hood and side vents. There’s also the option of a carbon-fibre hood. Then there are vivid colours for the body and brake calipers, too, that you can also spec. All in all, to these eyes at least, the SV does the sport look just right, not too much but not too little either. Range Rover Sport SV Space and Comfort: 7/10 Spacious insides are more luxurious than outright sporty The insides look luxurious with a minimalistic styling theme, though it’s almost to the point of being quite bland, especially so for those who like things blinged-up. The dashboard is presented as a large, clean surface upon which a 13.1-inch touchscreen is placed. The central console, too, has its cubbies closed off and just a small stubby gear lever sticking out. Being the SV, there are some sporty bits like illuminated SV logos on the backrests and edge-illuminated paddle shifters, but on the whole, the interior does not scream sport. The cabin is classy, but some will find the minimalistic style bland. The SV also debuts JLR’s new ‘body and soul seats’ (BASS), which, as the acronym suggests, generate audio vibrations corresponding to the media played on the 29-speaker Meridian sound system. Available on the front seats only, there are also six different soundscapes – designed in collaboration with the National Transport Design Centre at Coventry University and the School of Media and Performing Arts – that combine sound and vibrations to relax or energise you. It’s hard to accurately describe the feeling, but it’s somewhere between a massage and a vibrating seat. Speaking of the seats, I found the lumbar a touch extra, but seating space both at the front and rear is ample enough. Range Rover Sport SV Features and Safety: 8/10 The Sport SV Edition Two trim comes well equipped The car we had in the UK was the ‘Edition Two’ spec, which meant it was well-equipped with bits like digital LED headlights, illuminated metal treadplates, 4-zone climate control, a 13.1-inch touchscreen, Meridian signature sound, 3D surround cameras, remote park assist, HUD, and heated ventilated and reclining seats at the front and rear. As for safety equipment, it has six airbags and a full ADAS suite, which works just fine on UK roads. Range Rover Sport SV Price and Verdict: 8/10 The Sport SV is certainly the most capable all-rounder in the JLR fleet Super SUVs of today are remarkable feats of engineering that have to deliver on diverse fronts: they have to be large and spacious like family SUVs, comfy like luxury sedans and quick like sports cars. So, they come at a price; in this one’s case, that’s Rs 2.95 crore ex-showroom, India. It’s a lot, but no more – in fact, exactly the same – as the Audi RS Q8 Performance, and in that aspect, it’s a fair ask. It’s the Sport SV’s breadth of talents that is truly impressive. It’s wanting in some places for sure. Like around corners, it’s not very agile, and ride quality, too, is not as pliant as some rivals. But while it cedes ground on dynamics, it gains in many areas. The interior, for example, is spacious and comfy, with a luxurious and classy feel. Outside, the styling is sleek and sporty, with a nice, elegant flair to it, and then, given its family lineage, the Range Rover Sport SV also has some off-roading chops baked into its DNA – 23-inch rims notwithstanding – and, in the end, that’s where its appeal lies. It’s the most capable all-rounder in the JLR portfolio and, against rivals, has a truly wide set of talents.

    "description": "Dear reader, I’m overjoyed to announce I’ve recently become a dad. Life has changed in so many ways (I’ve never valued a power nap as much as I do now!), and to an extent, so has the way I look at cars. I have become ever more mindful of the smallest of things that could make my little one’s car rides comfier. ISOFIX child seat anchors are a bit tough to find underneath the seat cushioning. Of course, step one was to get the child seat in order. The Hyundai Creta N Line I’ve been using gets ISOFIX child seat anchors to lock the seat firmly in place, but they’re tucked behind the cushioning and need a bit of poking around to locate. This is not a biggie for an average user who’d keep the seat in place for months at a stretch, but I have to keep removing and re-attaching the seat whenever there’s a new car I have to test. Thankfully, my daughter has taken well to the car seat and, as my wife reports from the back seat, enjoys her drives. Option to pre-cool the Creta using the phone app put to full use over the summer. We’ve had a baking summer in Mumbai, and my kiddo, understandably, hates being strapped onto her seat in a hot car. The solution has come in the form of remote pre-cooling. To be honest, I’d never used connected car features beyond a review evaluation, but today, setting up the car in advance with the tap of a few buttons on my phone screen is part of my SOP. The option to remotely start the vehicle and have the air conditioning run has been an absolute boon. Hyundai’s BlueLink app is easy to use, and I’ve not had challenges with the network, which is known to be an issue with many eSIM-based connected services. Our kiddo loves looking through the panoramic sunroof. Of course, we’ve had our share of crying spells on the go. Bumper-to-bumper traffic with an irate baby is not fun, I can tell you that. On one such drive, retracting the cover for the panoramic sunroof proved to be an Eureka moment. The newfound view of the world above immediately distracted my daughter, making the remainder of the journey a lot, well, calmer. Something tells me kids will love the Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e’s trippy, colour-changing roof lighting. The Creta N Line, in general, has proved to be good transport for the family, but I do wish there was more luggage room. I never realised a stroller occupied so much space! Fuel economy figure firmly in the single digits in chock-a-block city driving. More efficiency would be welcome, too. Fuel economy has been in the 7-8kpl range, but to be fair, my bumper-to-bumper slog never gives cars a chance to breathe free. Of the other things, there’s an irritating plasticky creak from the centre console every time a driver’s leg presses against it. This is something we experienced on our Creta IVT, too. Centre console lets out creaks whenever the driver’s leg rests on it. I have ambitious plans for a road trip over the monsoons. It’ll be a full house with my wife, baby, doggo and myself in the car. Time to dig deeper into the Creta’s box of tricks!

    "description": "Say hello to the Mercedes-AMG GT XX – the first full-electric concept from Mercedes’ storied performance division. The four-door GT XX concept previews what will be the first series-production model from Mercedes-AMG. The headlining figures? A peak power output of 1360hp, a top-speed of over 360kph and a range top-up of about 400km in just five minutes. The production version of the GT XX concept will be the first model to be underpinned by Mercedes’ AMG.EA skateboard architecture. This serves as a technology demonstrator for what will become a successor to the GT 4‑Door Coupé and the most powerful AMG yet. Powered by three axial flux motors producing a combined 1360hp Gets new battery technology with direct cooling for individual cells Has a top-speed of over 360kph and a drag coefficient of 0.198 Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept electric motors Co-developed with British electric motor specialist YASA In Mercedes’ own words, “the heart of an AMG is always the motor,” so let’s begin with what’s powering this radical-looking concept. Under the skin are three axial flux motors (two on the rear axle and one on the front axle), which Mercedes says, are significantly more compact and lighter than conventional e-motors (radial flux motors). It is also said to be three times more energy dense, allowing for improved continuous power and repeatability of performance, something that’s not usually the strength of high-performance EV. GT XX concept gets two electric motors at the rear and one at the front.  So far, axial flux motors have typically been seen on high-performance hybrid cars (Lamborghini Temerario, Ferrari SF90 Stradale), but this is the first application in an all-electric vehicle. The two electric motors at the rear are oil-cooled and packaged in one unit with a planetary gearset and an inverter, and along with front electric motor, produce a total of 1360hp. This also give the GT XX an all-wheel drive layout. However, under most conditions, it is rear-wheel driven, with the front motor only kicking in during hard acceleration, energy recuperation or when additional traction is needed. Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept battery and cooling Operating at more than 800V, it can theoretically supports DC charging at up to 850kW Arguably the most notable technological innovations on the GT XX concept are in the battery which builds on learnings from the AMG One hypercar and Mercedes’ Formula 1 racing division. With DC fast charging at up to 850kW, it can top up about 400km in five minutes.  The GT XX concept uses an 114kWh battery with NMC (nickle/manganese/cobalt) chemistry and particularly tall and slim cylindrical cells. Mercedes says the small radius from the cell core to its casing enables faster discharge of energy, while also helping in effective cooling. The cells also get an aluminium casing instead of the usual steel, the former being better for electrical and heat conductivity. What’s also notable is that the cells are packaged into plastic modules with direct cooling for each individual cell. A high-tech coolant flows through channels in the modules to ensure equal cooling for all cells. The battery has an 800V architecture and also gets an all-new battery management system developed in-house by AMG. It can theoretically supports DC charging at up to 850kW.  Claimed drag coefficient is 0.198 for the GT XX concept. In effect, the electric motors, the clever battery cooling tech and the high voltage architecture are all meant to ensure a sustained peak power output and efficient thermal management of the battery. The benefits of direct cooling also lend itself to charging, whereby the battery can be topped up with about 400km of range in just five minutes. Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept exterior design Develops on elements first seen on the Vision AMG of 2022 The design of the GT XX is reminiscent of the Mercedes C111 series of concepts from the 1960s and 1970s, especially in this shade of sunset beam orange. With a fastback roofline, low-slung bonnet and sharply raked windscreen it looks to have combined the design cues of a sportscar and a grand tourer. This new design language was first hinted at by the Vision AMG of 2022.  Panamericana grille features 10 vertical slats and is more concave than before. AMG’s signature Panamericana grille has been retained, now framed by a light band and more concave than before. There are new rectangular auxiliary lights at the edges of the grille (again drawing from C111), while the main vertical headlamps are housed on power bulges over the wheel arches. The headlights even come with integrated external speakers that use the housing as a loudspeaker cavity, warning pedestrians about the car's movements. Yet another striking detail are the two-part air outlets on the bonnet, each with two fins, that help dissipate warm air. Meanwhile, the front splitter features an integrated air curtain that reaches up to the wheel arches. The profile is defined by a low-slung stance and a pronounced shoulder line, but what’s really cool is the ‘MBUX Fluid Light Paint’ applied on the sills of the car. It features luminescent paint segments that not only glow in the dark, but even can be used to communicate charging status. Also notable are the patented, electronically controlled aero-wheels with moving aero-blades. The 21-inch wheels comprise five moving blades which open or close depending on brake cooling requirements or aerodynamic efficiency. 'MBUX Fluid Light Panel' at the rear comprises over 700 configuarble RGB LEDs. At the rear, the GT XX gets a six circular tail lamps and a wide diffuser finished is exposed carbon fibre, its form reminiscent of the AMG ONE. The biggest talking point, however, is what Mercedes is calling the ‘MBUX Fluid Light Panel’. This panel comprises more than 700 freely programmable RGB LEDs, which not only gives a 3D-pixel look, but can also be used to communicate specific messages, in text or animation. At the rear, one can also notice an integrated active airbrake and the absence of a rear windshield. Mercedes has optimised the underbody of the car for aerodynamic efficiency, which along with the diffuser, helps generate the so-called Venturi effect. It has a claimed drag coefficient of 0.198. Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept interior and features Cabin mixes luxury car cues with GT3 race car elements The all-black interior with silver and orange accents look really snug and race-inspired, with chequered flag graphics peppered on the door pads and the floor. A particularly distinctive design feature are the exposed structural extrusions, seen with the dashboard panel and centre console. Meanwhile, the backlit, vertical struts on the dashboard and orange piping on the centre console are inspired by high-voltage cables, says Mercedes. Interior draws influences from AMG One hypercar.  Ahead of the driver are two large floating screens – a 10.25-inch instrument cluster and a 14-inch infotainment display – and a yoke-like steering wheel with the usual AMG-spec switchgear. The screens run the latest version of the MB.OS operating system with a bespoke UI/UX. The steering wheel also gets paddle shifters to control energy recuperation. Another stand-out feature is the design element in the centre console, which takes the form of the AMG coat of arms. The carbon fibre bucket seats at the rear are completely integrated into the car’s rear bulkhead. There’s also no headliner, which helps save wight and exposes the carbon-fibre structure. Swathes of experimental materials adorn the interior, with biotech leather alternatives made from recycled GT3 tyres and protein‑derived bio‑silk interior door handles Mercedes says they have achieved the same finish and quality with this material as natural leather. Even the floor uses recycled materials. The fastening points on the doors are clad with small buttons with the AMG coat of arms. The GT XX’s production model will be joined by a closely related SUV, both of which are expected to go into production sometime by late 2026. This unveiling comes as several performance car makers scale back their electric model plans. Ferrari has reportedly delayed its second electric model until at least 2028 due to weaker than expected orders, although it still plans to unveil its first purely electric model in October. Lamborghini, Porsche and Maserati have also postponed forthcoming electric models. Also See: Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge launched at Rs 9.5 crore Audi reverses 2033 ICE phase out plan",

    "description": "Tata Motors may consider adding hybrid powertrains to its portfolio if market dynamics demand it, according to Shailesh Chandra, managing director of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility. “We will be hoping to use the technology to deliver value to the customer, and obviously, it [hybrids] would be under consideration for different products at different points in time,” he said. This could signal a shift in the company’s stance amid a policy environment increasingly supportive of hybrid vehicles in certain Indian states. Bringing hybrids could be prompted by emissions and performance Tata considers hybrids part of its future petrol portfolio State-level hybrid incentives have slowed EV adoption in those states Tata’s reasons for considering hybrid powertrains Tata’s internal powertrain forecast: 30 percent EVs, 27 percent CNG, 6-10 percent diesel, 63-67 percent petrol and hybrid “From a powertrain mix perspective, we’ve kept it [hybrids] in the category of petrol,” Chandra said. “If competitiveness requires us in certain segments to bring hybrid, we’ll bring it. It might not be just because of emission reasons but performance reasons also,” he added. Chandra noted that the company’s internal powertrain forecast sees 30 percent of its mix coming from electric vehicles, 27 percent from CNG and about 6-10 percent from diesel, with the remaining volume accounted for by petrol, which includes hybrids. “We will be hoping to use the [hybrid] technology to meet the value we would be hoping to deliver to the customer. We exist in a market to compete; we’re not against a technology; we’re against the use of incentives in benefit of a technology which is self-viable,” he added, underscoring that any adoption would be segment-specific and time-dependent. “Our focus is EVs. We believe this is the destination technology, and we need to double down on this, and we’re doing that,” Chandra affirmed. “Hybrids we consider as one of the technologies for improving competitiveness on the ICE side. If market demand comes, we can respond to that.” Hybrid incentives counter EV adoption, says Tata UP offers registration fee waiver on hybrids; Karnataka mulling the same Shailesh Chandra, MD, Tata Motors.  The remarks come at a time when states like Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are offering or contemplating tax benefits for hybrid vehicles, bringing them closer to electric vehicles in terms of fiscal incentives. Uttar Pradesh has already waived registration tax on hybrids, while Karnataka is reportedly mulling similar concessions. But Chandra also voiced concerns that extending incentives to hybrids – technologies he believes are already commercially viable – could derail India’s broader EV ambitions. He argued that tax breaks for hybrids are distorting the market and slowing down the adoption of EVs, especially in states where these benefits have been introduced. “In one state that offered hybrid subsidies, EV penetration remained stagnant at 1.5 percent, compared to the national average, which has nearly doubled from 2.5 percent to 4 percent in the same period. Some state governments have done it, and it has come at the cost of suppressing penetration growth of EVs. That’s what happens when you subsidise a technology that has no barriers, which has natural adoption, and you artificially improve the competitiveness significantly. It has suppressed the pace at which electrification would have grown,” Chandra said. He noted that this period has seen the launch of six to seven new EV models, and under normal circumstances, that should have spurred a more dramatic uptick in EV adoption. Instead, the unexpected growth has come from hybrids, which have gone from less than 1 percent to around 2.5 percent in market share largely, he argues, due to tax incentives. “Whereas on the hybrid side, there are hardly any models, and just because of this benefit, it has enhanced penetration,” Chandra added. However, his concern lies with what he calls “extraordinary benefits” for hybrids that risk diluting the policy momentum built around EVs. “The issue for us is on the incentive side or any extraordinary benefit being given to hybrids, like taxation rates,” Chandra noted. “Then the question is open for many technologies on the ICE side. Why digress the focus from destination technologies where you have barriers which have to be overcome? If there’s money to be put by the government, that should be on the destination technology,” he said.

    "description": "While the automotive industry is gearing up to pivot toward “software-defined vehicles,” there hasn’t been a surplus of clear explanations on what exactly that will entail. Oversimplified, it just means that manufacturers want to start building automobiles where all functions are controlled via software, rather than being determined exclusively upon the mechanical hardware they came with — and I have a sinking feeling they are going to be just awful.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mega-power-taycan-rival-shows-radical-future-mercedes-amg",
    "description": "Radical saloon packs huge power, dramatic cockpit and can charge at up to 850kW Mercedes-AMG has previewed its future electric flagship with the Concept GT XX, a 1341bhp technical tour de force showcasing a radical design, an advanced new technical layout and a motorsport-inspired cockpit. This fully operational four‑door machine features a new 1341bhp tri‑motor electric drivetrain and an oil‑cooled 114kWh cell‑to‑pack battery capable of charging at up to 850kW. As with the Mercedes‑Benz Vision EQXX, the precursor to the third‑generation CLA that was unveiled in 2022, the GT XX serves as a technology demonstrator for what will become the heavily anticipated successor to the GT 4‑Door Coupé and the most powerful AMG yet. Given its billing, AMG plans to undertake various record attempts with the prototype ahead of a planned launch next year. Mercedes’ chief technical officer, Markus Schäfer, said the upcoming production model will target a 0–62mph time of less than 2.5sec and a potential top speed of 224mph. “With the EQXX, we pushed limits on efficiency, range and charging – and it led directly to the new CLA,” added Schäfer. “With the GT XX, the aim is to do the same on the performance side: test the edge, then bring that innovation into production.” The GT XX is the first model built on the new AMG.EA electric car platform. Its battery pack is integrated into the chassis to boost torsional rigidity and crash protection. The body is constructed from a mix of aluminium, steel and carbonfibre composites. DESIGN The radically styled Concept GT XX introduces a completely new look for AMG. While at first previewing the upcoming successor to the GT 4‑Door Coupé, it also shows what is to come in the performance arm’s electric future. It includes elements first seen on the Vision AMG of 2022, such as the long bonnet, cab‑back profile and tapering rear end. “Some might see it as a sports car, others as a grand tourer,” said Schäfer. “It merges both worlds. But the most important thing is it must evoke desire.” Its most striking design element can be found up front, where AMG’s Panamericana grille has been reshaped into a more concave, oval form with 10 vertical strakes. This is flanked by recessed headlights and a deep splitter.  Elsewhere, the bonnet features functional vents to extract heat, the windscreen is steeply raked for improved aerodynamics and the roof receives a defined central channel. Along the flanks, frameless doors with flush handles and compact aero mirrors reduce drag, while the side sills are sculpted for airflow management. At the back, notably, the concept is missing a rear window. Below, six small round tail‑lights are joined by a 730‑LED light panel that can display an array of messages. An airbrake spoiler deploys under heavy braking or at high speed, working in tandem with a large carbonfibre diffuser. Aerodynamic efficiency extends to the 21in alloys, which feature active blade sections – five per wheel – that open to aid brake cooling and close at speed to reduce drag. All this combines for a drag coefficient of 0.19, which, if carried over, would make the production model one of the slipperiest cars on sale. The 0.19 figure is not as low as the EQXX’s record‑breaking 0.17, but Schäfer said the brief for the GT XX was to give precedence to downforce and cooling over outright drag reduction. To compensate, a complex underfloor aerodynamic package is designed to generate a venturi effect, contributing to what AMG describes as “exceptional aerodynamic balance”. At 5204mm long, 2130mm wide and 1317mm tall, the GT XX is 150mm longer, 61mm wider and 130mm lower than the existing internal-combustion-engined GT 4‑Door Coupé launched in 2018. These dimensions are expected to carry over into the production car, which will be built at Mercedes‑Benz’s Sindelfingen manufacturing facility in Germany. By way of comparison, the Porsche Taycan is 4963mm long, 2144mm wide and 1379mm high. The vivid Sunset Beam orange paint is a nod to past Mercedes research prototypes and concepts including 1970’s C111 and the more recent One‑Eleven. POWERTRAIN The heart of the GT XX is its tri‑motor drivetrain: two axial‑flux motors at the rear, with a third up front that can decouple under light loads to reduce mechanical drag. Combined output is 1341bhp, which is sent to all four wheels via a fully variable 4Matic+ system. These motors, created by Mercedes-owned UK manufacturer Yasa, which also supplies Ferrari and Lamborghini, will be used by all electric AMGs and the most powerful Mercedes-Benz models. Electricity is drawn from the 114kWh oil‑cooled cylindrical‑cell battery, which has been developed in partnership with AMG’s Formula 1 powertrain division in Brixworth, Northamptonshire. According to AMG, oil immersion offers greater surface area and more efficient heat transfer under sustained load than conventional liquid cooling. Operating at “more than” 800V, the battery theoretically supports DC charging at up to 850kW, although no public chargers currently offer such capacity. AMG has not yet quoted a WLTP range, but it says the GT XX can recover around 249 miles of range in five minutes. “Three years ago, 300kW charging on the road was unthinkable,” said Schäfer. “Now it’s reality. We’re already seeing 480kW stations in China. 1000kW parks will come.” The GT XX uses a double‑wishbone front and multi‑link rear suspension set‑up, combined with adaptive air springs. It also features the active roll control and rear‑wheel steering systems set to be adopted by its production sibling. AMG claims a 50:50 weight distribution. SOUNDTRACK AMG claims to have gone to great lengths to retain the emotional appeal that remains a draw of today’s V8-powered models. For example, an eight‑speaker exterior sound system – mounted in the headlight housings – mimics acceleration sounds. “AMG is about more than just performance,” said Schäfer. “It’s about emotion – how a car sounds. We believe an electric AMG can still deliver that experience.” Inside, the cabin mixes luxury saloon cues with GT3 race car elements. Dual digital displays (10.25in and 14in) dominate the dash, while the steering wheel is inspired by the AMG One. Illuminated orange piping echoes the car’s high‑voltage cabling, and seats feature 3D‑printed ergonomic inserts. Swathes of experimental materials adorn the interior, with biotech leather alternatives made from recycled GT3 tyres, protein‑derived bio‑silk door pulls and a visible-from-the-inside carbonfibre roof with no headliner. Even the floor uses recycled material, here printed in a chequered‑flag pattern. The GT XX’s production model will be joined by a closely related SUV, scheduled for UK launch in 2027 and conceived to take on the upcoming electric Porsche Cayenne. Nevertheless, its unveiling comes as several performance car makers scale back their electric model plans. Ferrari has reportedly delayed its second electric model until at least 2028 due to weaker than expected orders, although it still plans to unveil its first purely electric model in October. Lamborghini, Porsche and Maserati have also postponed or cancelled forthcoming electric models.",
