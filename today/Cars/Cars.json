    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/uk-battery-start-begin-cell-production-year",
    "description": "Volklec's cylindrical cells will be built under license from Chinese firm Far East Battery Coventry-based Volklec aims to supply cells for the “underserved” market with help from China British battery start-up Volklec will begin producing cells in Coventry later this year. It has licensed two lithium ion designs from Chinese firm Far East Battery, each measuring 21mm in diameter and 70mm in length. The first to enter production will be a cell for e-bikes and suchlike, using nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry, followed by a new and more powerful unit aimed at automotive and aerospace companies. The intent, according to executive director Phil Popham, is to produce batteries for “underserved” firms, such as Britain's vast network of niche sports car makers. “We’re not looking at attracting the volume OEMs or volume customers,” said the former Lotus CEO. Both the cells will be manufactured at the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC), a development hub backed by the semi-governmental Advanced Propulsion Centre, the University of Warwick and the West Midlands’ local authorities.  Volklec will initially build some 0.1GWh worth of batteries at the UKBIC annually. Once Far East Battery has readied its more powerful cell design, it will look to add another 1GWh production line at the site, dedicated to the newer cell.  The company has already received help from Far East Battery experts, drafted in from China to help it navigate the hurdles involved with getting a new factory running. “Their manufacturing and process engineers will be with us and will stay with us until we get up to the levels of yield and quality that they get in China,” said Popham. Popham expects demand from the “underserved” market to outstrip the prospective 1.1GWh supply, saying: “The market is already bigger than that, and that's only going to grow in the future.\" Volklec plans to eventually build its own battery factory in the UK, which could yield as much as 10GWh. This would put it on a par with the new Envision AESC development at the Nissan factory in Sunderland. Popham suggested it could become even larger: “We anticipate that's going to be 10GWh, but it could be different to that because the market is going to grow, and it's going to grow significantly.” Volklec could also produce batteries of its own design, or even those from another manufacturer, because it isn't locked into an exclusive deal with Far East Battery. Nonetheless, Popham urged caution, citing a “pragmatic” approach to growing the business. He explained: “I saw some of the attempts that have failed in the UK and thought: ‘what model will actually work?’ It was clear that a more pragmatic approach was required, a derisk approach.  “What I mean by derisk is getting to market quicker and having modest investments, rather than massive investment over a long period of time [before beginning production]. \"That led us to include that we needed partnerships in there – manufacturing partnerships and technical partnerships. And that's what we've been working on.” Popham said this approach “gives confidence to investors”, hinting at the sour mood felt by many after the 2024 collapse of UK battery start-up Britishvolt. He explained: “The initial energy cell production is already funded by the founders, so we will be going out with a funding round to support the unique line for the power cell. \"Obviously we will need external funding when we springboard into our own factory, but with that, progressive proof of delivery is appropriate as well for raising investment.” He also cited the benefit of the collaboration with Far East Battery: “We get economies of scale because we've got their access to their economies of scale. From day one, we'll be buying material through them, and as we ramp up production, then we will embark upon a localisation program, localising in the UK/Europe. \"We will do that for the cell that has been produced already. We will have that in production by the end of the year. “The agreement also allows us to import cells from [Far East Battery] as well, identical cells, so we can get them into customers now for testing, engineering programs or for use in end products immediately – and we can supplement that volume as we ramp up our own production, if customers need more cells. “We will repeat that whole process again with the [more powerful] cell in a year’s time.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/electric-cars/used-evs-becoming-cheaper-equivalent-ice-cars",
    "description": "Average price of a two-to-four-year-old EV sold by Manheim Auctions fell by £1000 year-on-year Battery-electric used cars now significantly cheaper than diesels and narrowing the gap to petrols Used electric cars are representing better value to second-hand buyers, as their prices undercut some combustion-engined equivalents.  Cox Automotive, which owns Manheim Auctions, has reported a “stabilisation” in used vehicle prices, especially for EVs, which are now typically cheaper to buy than equivalent diesels and free of the economic volatility that dogged them earlier in the decade.  The average price of a two-to-four-year-old EV sold by Manheim Auctions was £15,142 as of this week, up 1.1% (£162) from January but down 6.5% (£1,061) year on year.  That was 23% (£3477) cheaper than an equivalent diesel car, the average price of which was £18,619 in February – down 0.8% (£148) month on month but up 6.9% (£1208) year on year.  Equivalent petrol cars still undercut EVs at £13,392 in February (11.6% or £1750 cheaper than an EV), but the gap narrowed during the past year, as average used petrol values rose by 2.4% (£304) month on month and by 4% (£509) year on year.  Cox said the used EV parc was in for “a significant growth trajectory over the next four years”, with volumes increasing by 117.5% by 2028. It added that dealers – many of which recently shunned second-hand EVs due to price volatility and even introduced buying bans – had begun to acknowledge their value, as they were typically selling faster and performing well, while cheaper examples could look like bargains. A survey by Cox and Regit, a provider of car management tech, found that 69% of drivers wouldn't be willing to pay more for an EV over a petrol or diesel alternative, so the “prospect of lower priced used EVs could help drive adoption”.   However, Cox added that second-hand EVs weren't without their issues. In its latest Insight Quarterly report, insight director Philip Nothard wrote that the \"used market for EVs is expected to remain fragmented, as they are generally priced lower than their ICE counterparts, posing challenges when it comes to retaining their value\".  He continued: “This, combined with regulatory pressures, including VAT charges on charging, the changes to benefit-in-kind [tax] rules for PHEVs (which could drive up the rate for certain models from 8% to 24%), Vehicle Excise Duty [from April] and the prospect of road pricing means that an air of uncertainty lingers around the used electric market.” In its new car market forecast, Cox estimated that EVs would account for 24% of UK registrations this year, followed by 30% in 2026, 34% in 2027 and 36% in 2028. Based on current targets, those figures would trail the ZEV mandate targets by three, four and 16 percentage points respectively.  Cox said it expected the total number of used car transactions to remain flat this year, with 7.6m anticipated by the end of 2025, but predicted values to remain strong, due to the shortage of new vehicles built during the Covid and post-pandemic eras. Nothard said this was “likely to continue into 2026, until prices begin to return to standard depreciation patterns\". He added: “Supply and demand are central to the dynamics of the used car market but successful retailers must go deeper. Stock profiling – ensuring the right mix of vehicles aligns with market needs – and strategic stock sourcing are now more crucial than ever.”",

    "description": "Looks-wise, the Moto Guzzi Breva 750 is one of the blandest motorcycles to ever roll out of the Mandello del Lario factory. But that doesn’t make it a bad bike—it just lacks the charisma of the several iconic Moto Guzzis that pundits usually drool over. Rusty Brains didn’t pick the Breva for its looks though. For their debut build, the Italian custom shop wanted a classic Moto Guzzi V-twin motor in a reliable package. The Breva ticked those boxes—and with a full overhaul on the cards, its looks hardly mattered. Based in Milan, Rusty Brains was founded by friends Luca Adami, Silvio Ferraretto, and Bogdan Lupu. Luca and Silvio each have over three decades of motorcycle design and modeling experience, and Bogdan is a pro photographer.…",

    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Unlike the RS, its footpegs have rubber tops. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "description": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the go-to luxury car for anyone with money. It’s the German luxury brand’s number one model and the bestselling car in its class, largely thanks to its long wheelbase, which provides the much-coveted legroom rear-seat passengers desire. In India, where luxury sedans are predominantly chauffeur-driven, rear-seat comfort is a top priority. BMW, recognising Mercedes’ winning formula, finally joined the long-wheelbase club with its latest 5 Series. But Mercedes struck back with an even stronger offering – the new E-Class with three engine options, ensuring it covers all bases. The E 450 is priced Rs 14 lakh higher than the E 200. We tested the E 200, the base version, which we loved for its ride comfort, but the engine is a bit anaemic and just doesn’t have the pep customers who want to drive would like. That’s where the range-topping E 450 4MATIC with the M256 engine comes in. The 3-litre, straight-six turbo petrol mill produces a humongous 177hp more than the 2-litre unit in the E 200, and because of that, the E 450, with an ex-showroom price of Rs 92.5 lakh, costs Rs 14 lakh more than the E 200; the on-road price is well north of a crore. However, aside from the upgraded powertrain and all-wheel drive (4MATIC), equipment levels remain essentially the same. So, are the extra horses and traction worth the extra rupees? The answer lies in the driving experience. Mercedes E 450 exterior design Despite the AMG Line package, the E 450 doesn’t look as sporty as the AMG counterparts The E 450 comes in AMG Line trim only, which includes the sportier alloy wheels. Visually, the E 450 LWB maintains the stately limousine aesthetic of its lesser siblings. The only differences are the trapezoid exhausts, the AMG Line-styled front bumpers and AMG alloys, which, wrapped in high-profile rubber in the interests of ride comfort, quite frankly don’t look very sporty. Otherwise, it is unlike its AMG counterparts, which flaunt their muscle with aggressive bumpers, flared wheel arches and loud exhausts. Mercedes E 450 engine and performance Not as loud as full-fat AMGs, but still blisteringly quick Smooth straight-six engine produces 381hp and 500Nm of torque. At the heart of the E 450 is Mercedes’ M256 engine, churning out 381hp and 500Nm of torque. Paired with a mild-hybrid system that adds a temporary 23hp boost, the E 450 rockets from 0kph to 100 in a blistering 4.5 seconds. That’s the kind of acceleration you’d expect from a proper AMG, yet here, it’s delivered in the most refined manner possible. Unlike the full-fat AMG models with aggressive exhausts and crackling overrun sounds, the E 450 remains discreet. It doesn’t shout about its capabilities, but make no mistake – it moves with serious intent. The 6-cylinder engine is silky smooth, and the 9-speed AT is impeccably tuned With a claimed 0-100kph in 4.5 seconds, the E 450 is quick. The 9-speed automatic transmission is impeccably tuned, delivering almost imperceptible shifts in Comfort mode but responding with urgency when you put your foot down. More than just performance, there’s something to be said about a six-cylinder engine, which, quite frankly, is even becoming a rarity in the Mercedes world. A straight-six feels so much smoother, so much more effortless than a four-cylinder, and it’s the velvety punch, the lusty power that marks out this motor. It also sounds so much sweeter and richer than a four-cylinder, reminding you there’s something special under the hood. The other ace up its sleeve is the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, adding a reassuring layer of security when pushing hard or tackling loose surfaces. Mercedes E 450 ride and handling Ride quality isn’t as plush as the 5 Series but strikes a better balance between sporty and comfortable  Only over really big bumps will one have to be careful in the E 450. Ride comfort has always been a core strength of the E-Class, and this latest version, like the E 200, remains absolutely top-class. It soaks up bumps, undulations and everything Mumbai roads throw at it with ease. However, dare I say, the ride isn’t quite as plush as the new 5 Series, which has sacrificed a little of its signature sporty edge for an extra degree of comfort. What’s remarkable about the E 450 is that it hasn’t sacrificed anything. It feels sporty, nimble and agile without compromising on comfort – a rare balance that Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Handling and agility are impressive for a car of this size The E 450 is a nimble handler for its size. Of course, having a strong engine is one thing, but being able to fully exploit that power is another. And that’s where the E 450 truly shines. The body control is superb, the handling precise, and the agility impressive for a car of this size. But what really stands out is the steering. Mercedes has aced it – it’s that perfect blend of accuracy, feedback and lightness, making it effortless to manoeuvre at slow speeds while still being engaging when you pick up the pace. Mercedes E 450 interior and features No other car in its class comes close to the E-Class in terms of rear seat comfort But here’s the question: at slow speeds or in traffic, is it really the driver’s seat you should be in? I ease myself into the back seat to remind myself why the E-Class is the segment’s bestseller in the first place. Step inside, and the E 450’s interior is a masterclass in luxury. The dashboard is dominated by Mercedes’ Superscreen – a stunning combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch central touchscreen and a 12.3-inch passenger display. While the tech is impressive, Mercedes has taken a largely buttonless approach, meaning even basic functions like climate control require navigating menus. It’s sleek but occasionally frustrating. The selfie camera in the dashboard for video calls is neat, though one for the rear-passengers might have been as helpful. Rear-seat comfort is where the E-Class truly distances itself from rivals, especially the 5 Series. In this department, nothing comes quite as close. The long-wheelbase variant offers limousine-like legroom, but it’s not just the space – it’s how Mercedes has used it. The reclining rear seats, which tilt from 24 to 36 degrees, make a huge difference in comfort, allowing passengers to stretch out in a near-business-class position. Pair that with the chauffeur package, which lets you electrically move the front passenger seat forward when unoccupied, and you can comfortably sit cross-legged – just as you would at home. Where the 5 Series falters, the E-Class excels. BMW’s new 5 Series LWB has softened its ride to appeal to chauffeur-driven buyers, but it still doesn’t offer the same seat recline, legroom, or sheer sense of indulgence. One key area where the 5 Series loses out is the lack of rear sunshades–in the E-Class, you get electrically operated sunshades all around, including a rear sunblind, enhancing privacy and comfort. The E-Class is still the reigning champ in terms of rear-seat experience in this segment. The Burmester 4D surround sound system with Dolby Atmos further elevates the experience, turning the E-Class’ cabin into a rolling concert hall. And then, there’s an interesting modern touch – Mercedes has included a selfie and video camera on the dashboard. It’s great for video calls, though one could argue a rear-seat camera for executives attending Zoom meetings would have made more sense. Ultimately, the E-Class is the luxury sedan to beat. For most owners, this will be a chauffeur-driven car from Monday to Friday, but when the weekend arrives, there’s more than enough under the hood to tempt them into the driver’s seat. Mercedes E 450 price and verdict The E 450 blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either    The E 450 4MATIC is the ultimate stealth weapon. It’s got the power and acceleration to rival an AMG but without the loud styling and exhaust theatrics. It delivers everything the E 53 AMG does in real-world driving: effortless power, a rewarding drive and a level of comfort no sports sedan can match. Unless you truly crave the full AMG experience, the E 450 offers 90 percent of the performance with 100 percent of the practicality. It’s the thinking man’s AMG – a car that lets you enjoy serious performance while flying under the radar. The way it blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either is something not even the cheaper 5 Series can match. Pricey it is, but that’s the cost you pay for getting the best of both worlds.

    "description": "There’s little doubt the Hyundai Ioniq 5, our 2024 Car of the Year, is one of the best cars Hyundai has put to market in recent times. Part of this is because it breaks new ground and seamlessly integrates modern EV tech into regular everyday motoring. Using the Ioniq 5 for the past couple of months has literally been transformative. The large 72.6kWh battery and good efficiency of 5.5-6.0km per kWh in Eco mode allow me to charge the battery once a week at work (six hours at 11kW). What makes the Ioniq 5 experience even more seamless is that it is such a comfortable and easy car to live with. It gives between 440km and 460km on a full charge when driven in Mumbai traffic. Sure, it’s wide, and that does take some getting used to in congested Mumbai traffic, but what gets the corners of my mouth to curl up is that it does such a good job almost everywhere else. Take the supple and absorbent ride for instance – near perfect for Mumbai’s lunar roads; the superb sound insulation that creates a hush inside the cabin despite a wedding procession outside, the very comfortable and almost armchair-like seats, which can be adjusted at the front and rear, or the fact that even in Eco mode, the Ioniq 5 has enough zip. And Eco also gives me a range between 420km and 440km on a single charge. It’s big and wide, so squeezing into tight parking slots isn’t always easy. On sections where there are multiple speed cameras, I use the ADAS, which works great so long as the cameras can see the lane markings clearly. It even drives the tight corner inside the Coastal Road tunnel perfectly, slows down for slower traffic ahead, comes to a full stop, and starts up again without any input from the driver. You have to hold the steering wheel, of course; otherwise, the car puts out a warning. You can have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but only if you carry a wire. What I do miss is having wireless Apple CarPlay, a definite pain point as I use Google Maps every day for route selection. The faster route is 15-20 minutes quicker, at times. Other pet peeves include the dull fascia and the lack of a spare tyre, and when you really begin to enjoy driving this rear-wheel-drive version with its sharpish front end and direct steering, the long-travel, soft rear suspension lets you down. I do like the fact that the centre console slides back and allows the driver to exit from the left door quite easily; this helps when you need to park this really wide EV. The best bit is that it’s an EV that is both characterful and charming. Good-quality rubber helps deliver both direct steering and a comfy ride.   Also See: Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 19,500km report Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 15,900km report",

    "description": "The Ducati DesertX Discovery variant has launched in India at a price of Rs 21.78 lakh. It is essentially a dressed-up and kitted-out version of the standard DesertX and gets additional equipment such as aluminium panniers, a centre stand and engine guards as standard. Slots between the standard DesertX and the DesertX Rally  Carries a Rs 3.45 lakh premium over the standard model Gets a new livery with added protection and accessories as standard Ducati DesertX Discovery new features and colours  The Ducati DesertX Discovery is based on the already capable DesertX. To differentiate it from the pre-existing model, it has additional accessories, such as heated grips, a larger touring windscreen, aluminium panniers and a centre stand, as standard. Moreover, the Discovery features a bull bar, a radiator grill and a bash plate for added protection to the DesertX’s engine and bodywork. The Discovery also has a unique red/black/white colourway to set it apart from the base bike. Ducati also claims that it has adhesive graphics to protect the livery from scratches and rock chips. Ducati DesertX Discovery engine and specs  The Ducati DesertX Discovery carries the same 937cc Testastretta L-twin as the standard and Rally DesertX bikes. The output figures remain unchanged, rated at 110hp and 92Nm. The engine is mated to a six-speed gearbox and comes equipped with a bi-directional quickshifter. The Ducati DesertX Discovery comes with a large fuel capacity of 21 litres, with an auxiliary fuel tank of 8 litres available as an optional extra.  Ducati has revealed a new 890cc V-twin, which will replace the ageing 937cc Testastretta motor in its middleweight bikes and is already found in the V2 Streetfighter, Panigale and Multistrada. It remains to be seen when the DesertX makes the switch, as it is one of the newest 937cc Ducati models.   Ducati DesertX Discovery price and variants  In terms of pricing, the DesertX Discovery sits between the standard DesertX and the off-road-focused DesertX Rally. The standard DesertX is priced at Rs 18.33 lakh, while the Discovery costs Rs 21.78 lakh, carrying a premium of Rs 3.45 lakh. Meanwhile, the top-spec DesertX Rally is priced at Rs 23.7 lakh. Bookings for the Ducati DesertX Discovery have begun. Also see: Ducati DesertX Rally launched at Rs 23.7 lakh",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Another car bought sight unseen, another “gotta own this one someday” box checked. It also ticked the “probably definitely won’t break down” box, a critical facet for this purchase. The job? Scout the ’22 Overcrest Rally: 10 days, 8-10 hours a day, and thousands of miles, all in one state. Idaho. The 1979 300TD was rough but rust-free, and as my grandfather would say with a touch of irony, “a smooth runner with a straight body.” Despite its quirks, the W123’s legendary reliability and patience testing pace made it the perfect scout vehicle for the rally.   Most of the state is seen from a 72 mile jaunt across i90. A stretch easily defeated by those that would often rather be “there” than wherever “here” was. In about one episode of a podcast it's over and everyone is on to Spokane, Seattle, Portland, or some far off distant easterly place where pizza and bagels are made just right. No one hops off to venture inland to try some finger steaks or french fries from potatoes pulled out of the ground a few hours earlier. There are no grandma's huckleberry pies on the interstate either. But Idaho's uniqueness goes beyond just the food, it has roads. Some of the best one's you'll ever get the pleasure to find. Idaho proudly wears the Sawtooth Mountains at its heart. At the state’s beltline lies Boise, the capital city that initially wasn’t even on our radar. It lay too far below the squiggly tarmac and unknown mud and gravel of the forest roads. Before heading up there, the car needed a few things. It was the crest of summer, and the air conditioning didn’t work. We needed to install the European headlights that came with the car or we couldn’t bear our own existence. It didn’t have a roof rack, which seemed like a shame, and Jasin, the co-driver, a quiet, sharp, and witty man, wanted a bicycle in case we got stranded somewhere. “Dude, We are not going to need a bicycle. This thing is the most reliable vehicle ever made” “We might.” “We won’t…” Despite the w123 being the most reliable vehicle ever made, we ended up looking for a bike. After a bunch of “is it availables” we still ended up just going to a Pocatello pawn shop. We now had a bike (and cooler for Dews) on our roof rack. The air-conditioning swallowed up some cans of r134, and with some hotwiring of the compressor, we had ac. There was no power with it on, but we had it. 77hp with it off, and probably 65 with it at full chat. The vacuum system controlling the HVAC in the car was shot and screwdrivers were shoved through the vents to hold the blower flap open. It was the only way to get air flow. The fact that each one was essentially a guaranteed death by being impaled in an accident wasn’t lost on us, but aircon is aircon, the bastion and oil gilded holy grail of any old shitbox. If you’ve got it, you’re a king, and we had it. Us kings, royal purveyors and surveyors of the almighty road trip. May all without it bow before our superiority, piety, and condescension.  Far up into the mountains, we were met with snow. It was somewhere between \"no problem\" and \"big problem\" in depth, located a two-hour drive from where we’d started, and just 100 yards from the summit. The other side of the summit, and our route out, was right there. You could have hurled a stone and hit dirt on the other side. It was the answer to all of the “do we really want to drive 2 hours backwards?” considerations. The easy answer to this was no. No we did not. This route was supposed to be on the rally, which meant we’d have to drive back the other side just to check it out. The 30-40 yards of snow that swept across the mud was dense, and slushy, the last vestige of a long winter at 9000 feet. Making it through would save half a day of driving. The bike loomed. “What do you think?” “Not great.” “Not great… yeah.” “Should we make a run at it?” “Sure, why not.” Why not was that it was a really bad idea. At that altitude that car, even with the AC off was gutless. Maybe 50 hp. When it was new. 270k miles ago. The gearshift dropped into low and the old OM617 wheezed without spinning the tires in the mud towards the snow. There was no climax, no “ope, he might make it.” It was beached with just a few yards to go. The bike loomed again. Hours passed and after the digging with the top tray of a toolbox got tiresome the conversation got closer and closer to riding back down the mountain. In the middle of the debate a truck rounded the bend. After a chat the driver realized he wouldn't make it through either, but he did have a tow strap. Kings saved by mere mortals, a story for all time.  “Told you we wouldn’t need the bike.” On the way out, some sort of celestial car karma kicked in and the right front caliper seized. The roads were slick with rain and the car was not doing well downhill.  A call out to social media didn’t help and we were forced into heading to Boise to hit up a junkyard. There, the two wrench trick and some elbow grease yanked a caliper off an old w114 250C. It was pure luck the car was there and we knew it. This was the land of Bumpside Ford’s, not the land of vintage German tanks.  On the way out the door of the yard we spotted another w123 parked right next to ours. A turbo diesel sedan with a lot of miles. This thing had been around the block, a million times. It was well worn. The US headlights were in rough shape with one side missing the bezel, and the other side about to be.  The caliper got chucked in the backseat for later We knew exactly what we had to do. Working fast, we yanked the Euro-spec H4s out of their boxes, uninstalled the very nice US-spec lights, and swapped them out. Just as we finished, the owner of the million-block W123 walked up. As is often the case the man looked a bit like his car. He’d seen a few things and his weathered skin and thin wild hair spoke of it.   “Love your car sir.” “Thanks a lot.” “Hey so we noticed you maybe needed some headlights.” “Yep, thats why I was here, but no luck.” “I tell you what, take these.” “What do you want for them?” “Nothing.” The man thanked us, took the headlights graciously, hopped in his car, and clattered away. It's possible we got stuck and that caliper got seized for a reason.  Incredible roads were in abundance. Warm Lake Road, a monument to loneliness, curling up and up eternally, forcing us to shove snow in the engine compartment to keep going. White bird grade. A high bedrock set of switchbacks set in the hills below Grangeville. Both were empty. No one ever came, and it was ours for every mile. These roads are not in your backyard, and it takes significant effort to get out that far past the border of what people consider nowhere, but it's worth it, when you find out they’re all yours.    Continue...",

    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",
