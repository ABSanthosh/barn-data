    "description": "This 1935 Packard Eight Series 1201 wears style 811 phaeton bodywork and is said to have spent 50 years with the same family in Ohio. It underwent a refurbishment in the 1970s before being purchased in 2013 by Packard collector Tom Crook, from whom the seller purchased the car in 2015. The 320ci straight-eight was rebuilt later that year, and the car subsequently won third-in-class at the 2022 Packards International at the San Marino Motor Classic, and participated in the 2023 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Finished in yellow over red leather upholstery, the car features a three-speed manual transmission, mechanical drum brakes, an adjustable ride-control suspension, red-painted 17” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a cormorant radiator mascot, a driver-side spotlight, rear-hinged front doors, a tan soft top, a fold-down luggage rack, and a rear footrest. This Twelfth Series Packard is now offered with a copy of a letter from Raymond Dietrich discussing the construction of 1935 phaeton bodies, service records, car show awards, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

    "title": "2025 KTM 390 Adventure review: Second time’s the charm",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/2025-ktm-390-adventure-review-second-times-the-charm-434691#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Five years after the launch of the original 390 Adventure, there’s a brand new one in town, and this time around, KTM have got it right. The new 390 ADV makes up for its predecessor's adventure-related shortcomings, and it manages to do so thanks to the all-new platform that debuted in the Gen 3 Duke. Everything that benefited the Duke does so here as well, including the side-slung monoshock and repositioned airbox, which have helped bring the seat height down from 855mm on the previous ADV to a more palatable 830mm. KTM 390 Adventure changes for 2025 But it's not just a lower seat height that takes the new 390 ADV a big step forward, because this bike now has more suspension travel (up from 170/177mm to 200/205mm), and it also has much more ground clearance (200-237mm). In fact, the design of the new 399cc engine also contributes to the ground clearance, thanks to a higher positioning for the crankshaft compared with the old 373cc motor. So, in many ways, the new-gen 399cc platform shines brightest when it comes to the ADV and its Enduro/SMC siblings. With 46hp and 39Nm, the motor makes the same numbers as the 390 Duke, but it gets a bigger 46-teeth rear sprocket (up by three teeth), which compensates for the added weight and the larger wheels. What truly stands out is the engine’s duality. It’s punchy and exciting at high revs when you want it and results in this being the only bike in the segment that manages a sub-6 second 0-100kph time in our tests. But more importantly, it’s also calm and relaxed at lower speeds, which makes it easy to live with on a day-to-day basis. Curved radiator on the 390 Adventure. There are three riding modes – Rain, Street, and Off-Road – which adjust throttle response, ABS and traction control settings. Off-road mode is the most reactive of the three, but it's also usable enough even in the city. One common concern with single-cylinder engines is vibration and the KTM suffers from it as well. While the buzz is very well controlled in the handlebars, it gets quite pronounced in the footpegs, especially at city speeds. However, out on the highway, the vibrations don’t get overwhelming and this bike can hold 120kph or even higher with an ease and composure that its rivals don’t quite match.  The bi-directional shifter is not flawless and sometimes feels a bit clunky, but it adds to the fun factor of this motorcycle. The underbelly exhaust provides a typical KTM soundtrack: a brappy, exciting sound at high revs and a clattery, unremarkable note at gentle speeds – something to be expected from a high-strung single-cylinder engine. As for the exhaust design, an upswept unit would have certainly looked more appropriate but KTM says there are no concerns with water wading and have tested the bike in water crossings 400mm deep. KTM 390 Adventure ergonomics, seat comfort The 830mm seat height is still on the tall end for the average 5’6” rider, but the lower weight and weight balance on this bike make it easier than its immediate rival to manage. The rider ergonomics are also an improvement over the old bike with better placed footpegs. The position is especially improved when it comes to standing up off-road, with more real estate on the bike to grip with your lower body. A slightly taller bar would have been nice for off-road work, but the overall set up works as is. The opposite holds true for the tall, non-adjustable windscreen – it works well at highway speeds but blocks so much air that the rider will wish for more cooling breeze when riding inside the city in the summer heat. The 390 Adventure has ergos that are more conducive to off-road riding now. When it comes to handling, the 390 Adventure feels light and nimble, especially when compared to the Himalayan which weighs a full 14 kilos more. This is a tall bike, but it feels relatively agile and easier to manage in city conditions. A reasonably light clutch and well-controlled engine heat dissipation add to its usability in the city. The seat itself, while not immediately uncomfortable, is on the firm side, and I found myself feeling sore in about an hour’s time. A more plush accessory seat would be nice, but as of now KTM has only three accessories on offer – a more comprehensive front mudguard, a centre stand and a headlamp guard. KTM 390 Adventure off-road performance  The new 390 Adventure shines brightest when it ventures off the beaten path. With a combination of relatively low weight, a balanced feel, and impressive suspension travel, this bike is more than capable in a variety of off-road conditions. The 21-inch front wheel, combined with the confidence-inspiring chassis, allows the 390 to tackle rocky, loose terrains with ease. The ground clearance also encourages you to clamber over large rocks and mounds with the knowledge that the bike also has an aluminium bash plate. All this leads to a bike that encourages you to ride out into unknown terrain, and that’s a very nice thing for an adventure motorcycle. The new 390 ADV is very capable off-road. Things start to become an issue when you push the bike hard, especially over big jumps. At this point, the suspension blows through its stroke and bottoms out. Thankfully, the fork is adjustable for compression and rebound while the rear gets preload and rebound adjustability. I kept adding compression damping till all 30 clicks were in on the fork, at which point the KTM was a lot more compliant off-road, but more skilled riders who intend to push this bike hard off-road will probably want to look at aftermarket options for changing the suspension’s spring weights and/or the damping rates. But despite coming close to the limits of the stock suspension, it's clear that this chassis manages to offer a light and friendly feel, but it is also up for quite a high level of off-road riding. I believe it manages this balance better than any similar rival on sale in India at the moment. KTM 390 Adventure on-road handling On-road handling-wise, the same attributes that appealed off-road makes the difference. The light and agile nature extends to the way the motorcycle corners, and it's a similar story of ease meeting confidence. Direction changes don’t take much effort and the bike is happy to lean quite far over without the footpegs scraping. On the road, the bike feels light and agile, with quick direction changes. Suspension comfort and its ability to absorb rough roads is quite good, but not as good as the Himalayan 450. The Apollo Tramplr tyres are a good fit for the motorcycle in terms of their road grip and ability to handle some off-road riding, but they get quite loud as the speeds rise. As for braking, the move to an axial front brake caliper may seem like a downgrade, but the performance suits the bike well. Initial bite is dull, which is nice off-road, but the braking force ramps up well when you give the lever a harder squeeze. The braking performance on- and off-road is also bolstered by the intuitive ABS system, but for that we must move to the next topic – features. 2025 390 ADV uses an axial caliper but braking performance is still very good. KTM 390 Adventure features, design  The 390 is a very well-specced motorcycle. Its 5-inch TFT looks familiar but has excellent graphics and is controlled via the chunky switchgear on the left. The rear ABS and traction control can both be turned off very easily and the bike remembers your settings and keeps them that way, even after turning it off. Then there’s the aforementioned quick shifter as well as the segment-first cruise control that works quite well. TFT dash is well-laid out, intuitive and feature-rich. This is also the first Indian KTM to offer spoked wheels that support tubeless tyres. These wheels have a patented design that uses a rubber seal to make things air-tight. I imagine there must be some life span to this rubber component, and we’ve asked Bajaj to let us know about this. New design language inspired by KTM's Dakar Rally bikes. The new design theme inspired by the Dakar rally bikes is another improvement in my opinion, and while I still wouldn't call it a classically beautiful bike, it has a new found sense of purpose that I quite like. KTM has also switched to a new material for the bodywork that they say is similar to what's used on the international dirt bikes and is capable of taking much more abuse. The plastic is also pigmented, rather than stickered (including the graphics) which means that if it does get scratched, it will reveal the same colour underneath. KTM 390 Adventure price and verdict The new 390 Adventure offers a great balance of performance, capability, equipment and ease of use. That being said, it also commands a rather steep Rs 3.67 lakh, ex-showroom, and for those who find this to be too much of a leap over the Himalayan 450, the lower-spec 390 Adventure X may be more appealing. Either way, this bike is a huge leap forward for the 390 Adventure nameplate, and in many ways it's what we’d hoped that the original bike would be.  Also See: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure video review",

    "description": "When it comes to luxury cars, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has long been a benchmark, offering a level of refinement that is hard to beat. The new Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series takes that opulence to another level, combining elevated luxury with distinctive dark accents and the power of a V12 engine. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series exterior Dual-tone Onyx Black and Mojave Silver paint 20-inch alloy wheels The Night Series offers exclusive exterior dual-tone paint combinations. While the Maybach S 680 shares much with its lesser S-Class counterparts, the Night Series edition adds a host of unique design features. These include unique paint shades, like the striking dual-tone Onyx Black and Mojave Silver pairing. Subtle touches, such as rose gold accents in the headlamps and dark chrome elements in the grille, further add to its exclusivity. The 20-inch wheels, whose seven spokes are surrounded by dozens of Maybach logos, also complement the car’s visually commanding presence. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series interior Aluminium strips run on the dash 31-speaker Burmester sound system Step inside, and the S 680 Night Series instantly envelops you in a world of luxury. The dashboard boasts a herringbone wood pattern, with subtle aluminium strips running through it. A central console area, finished in glossy piano black, features the Maybach logo embossed in a classy, understated manner. The attention to detail continues with a wood-and-leather steering wheel and quilted leather seats; black is the only upholstery colour in the Night Series. The back of the front seats feature the same intricate pattern as the central console. The herringbone wood grain with aluminium accents looks sophisticated. Every element in the cabin has been carefully designed, from the Night Series branding on the door sills to the plush, high-pile carpets. Ambient lights flash lane change alerts When it comes to features, the S 680 Night Series offers a laundry list of cutting-edge technologies aimed at both comfort and safety. One standout feature is the ambient lighting, which not only looks stunning but is also functional. The system is actively integrated with the car’s lane-change warning system: if there’s something in your blind spot, the lights flash as a reminder to check your rearview mirror before changing lanes. The 3D instrument cluster adds a modern touch to the traditional dashboard, providing a floating effect. And on top of that, you have everything from a panoramic sunroof to a 31-speaker Burmester sound system, massage and ventilated seats, rear seat entertainment screens, wireless chargers at the front and rear, and just about everything you can think of. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series engine and performance 0-100kph takes 4.5 seconds Silky smooth V12 engine is the highlight in this variant. The moment you close the doors and start the engine, the S 680 demonstrates its refinement. One of the most noticeable aspects of the car is the silence inside the cabin. It’s as though the outside world fades away as you’re cocooned in a bubble of tranquility. Strong power delivery for a 2.3-tonne car While this may seem like a car built for comfort, it’s far from just that. The S 680 is equipped with a 6.0-litre V12 engine, producing 612 horsepower and an astonishing 900Nm of torque. When you punch your foot down on the pedal, the power delivery is strong. To put it into perspective, this 2.3-tonne car does 0-100kph in just 4.5 seconds. However, the power is delivered in a progressive manner, where acceleration and gear shifts are all delivered smoothly. Nothing ever feels aggressive, staying true to its focus on comfort and luxury. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series acceleration timesSpeed (from rest)Time (in seconds)20kph0.8640kph1.5760kph2.4180kph3.44100kph4.69120kph6140kph7.58 Individual mode customises suspension, steering and performance The S 680 makes high-speed cruising effortless. At triple-digit speeds, the car feels entirely composed, eating up miles without breaking a sweat. This smoothness is further enhanced by its adaptable driving modes. The Maybach mode prioritises comfort, ensuring a pillowy-soft ride, while the Sport mode injects a bit more responsiveness into the car when you need it. For those who like to fine-tune every aspect of their driving experience, the Individual mode allows you to customise the suspension, steering, and performance to suit your exact preferences. Rear-axle steering is great Handling is another area where the S 680 excels. Despite its large size, the rear-axle steering system allows you to manoeuvre the car like a much smaller vehicle, making U-turns and tight spaces a breeze. The steering itself is well-calibrated, providing a light, responsive feel for city driving while offering more weight and confidence when cruising on the highway. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series comfort and ride 180mm extra legroom than standard S-Class First-class levels of luxury; long wheelbase lets you recline fully, with enough room to stretch your legs. Though the S 680 comes with a V12 under its hood, it’s clear that the rear seat is the real star of the show. This extra-long-wheelbase version offers an additional 180mm of legroom, creating an expansive space that’s as comfortable as it is stylish. The Night Series comes with the First Class Suite package, which means rear passengers can enjoy fully reclining seats at the touch of a button, complete with a leg rest that unfolds to provide private jet-level relaxation. Fridge keeps beverages chilled The back seat features large screens for entertainment, a tablet for controlling various features, a wireless charging pad, sun shades and a full suite of massage functions. If that’s not enough, there’s even a fridge to keep your champagne cool, with two champagne flutes waiting to serve. Ultra-soft pillows add to the plush experience, making long trips feel like a retreat. Refrigerator eats into the boot space but is removable. With the car in Maybach mode, the ride is incredibly smooth, absorbing most imperfections on the road. However, larger potholes or deep ruts can still cause a noticeable thud, reminding you that even the finest of cars can’t beat our roads. Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series price and verdict S 680 priced at Rs 3.48 crore; Night Series pricier by Rs 40 lakh The Maybach S680 Night Series isn’t just a car; it’s an experience. From the sophisticated design and cutting-edge technology to the extremely refined comfort and smooth, strong performance, this flagship sedan represents the pinnacle of automotive luxury. Of course, such indulgence doesn’t come cheap. With a price tag of Rs 3.48 crore (and another Rs 40 lakh for the Night Series package), the S 680 is truly a car for those who demand nothing but the best. But, as they say, all good things come at a price - and in the case of the Mercedes-Maybach S 680 Night Series, it’s a price worth paying.

    "description": "Twenty-five years ago, the first-generation Octavia introduced the Czech brand Skoda to India, and since then, every generation of the car has been on sale here. However, Skoda India pulled the plug on what was the fourth-generation model in early 2023; the good news is it’s coming back this year. What better way to celebrate Skoda India’s 25th anniversary than with the relaunch of the car that started it all? The facelifted fourth-gen model will arrive in the sporty RS guise but will do so as completely built units (read pricey), costing around Rs 50 lakh. So, will it be worth it? To get an idea, we drove the Octavia in Croatia at a racetrack and on the road. Skoda Octavia RS engine and performance Upgraded 2.0-litre TSI engine makes 265hp and 370Nm E888 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine now makes 20hp more at 265hp. While the regular Octavia has a bevy of engine options –petrols, diesels, CNG and hybrids – the RS makes do with the familiar E888 2.0-litre TSI petrol engine, which, for the fourth generation, has new piston skirts and tweaks to the crankshaft and crankcase. And in the RS, its power is up by 20hp to 265hp, while the peak torque is 370Nm. 0-100kph in a claimed 6.4s Given its sporty pretensions, Skoda had an Octavia for us at the Automotodrom Grobnik in Rijeka. It’s a small circuit but perfect for a car like this; an F1 track would make the car feel awfully slow. A few convoy laps were all we had, but straight off, the quick acceleration was apparent and impressive. Skoda claims a 0 to 100kph time of 6.4 seconds, which is plenty fast for a family sedan. Put your foot down, and power comes in eagerly, and you pull away smartly. The gearbox is quick, with the 7-speed DSG unit also capable of being influenced by steering-mounted paddles, which felt small; given the RS guise, I would have preferred larger ones. Keeping up with the lead car driven by an ex-Skoda rally champ wasn’t a problem – but only because he wasn’t pushing it at all. Still, we managed to cross the 200kph mark on the straight and rather easily, too, not surprising given that it had plenty more to give with its 250kph electronically limited top speed. Cruising and overtaking on public roads is effortless Linear power delivery makes highway cruising and overtaking a breeze. Out on public roads, the engine does a great job at daily driver duty, and high-speed expressway cruising was effortless, as was overtaking slower-moving traffic. What’s nice is that power delivery is linear, and for everyday overtaking, you don’t have to wait on the box to drop a gear or two unless you’re in a big hurry and prod further with the throttle. Skoda Octavia RS ride and handling Ride quality is good; Normal and Sport modes work best Octavias have always handled well; they are typically European with a solid, planted ride, and the new fourth-generation RS is the same. On the racetrack, despite a few crests and uneven sections, it tracked well, and only while braking really hard over a crest did I feel the car was a little unsettled. Even high-speed motorway cruising was a steady and calm affair. The expansion joints and undulations, which seemed to be the nature of the roads around us, didn’t upset the car. Ride quality, too, felt good, and I found that the Normal and Sport modes worked the best. The Comfort mode brought in some float over the smooth but undulating roads; it would be best for slow, rough sections of tarmac. Only on bad roads would one have to use the Comfort ride setting.   Body rolls during cornering As for handling, there’s enough grip in corners, but push really hard, and typical of its front-drive setup, it will understeer. The steering has a good amount of weight to it, but it’s not very communicative, especially when viewed through the car’s sporty lens. However, my only issue with the car was the lean around corners. On the track, even in Sport mode, I expected this because of the higher speeds and tighter-than-usual turns, but going up a mountain section, too, this felt more than it should have. Given that the RS has dynamic dampers, I would have liked a tighter body control in Sport mode. Skoda Octavia RS exterior design and platform RS-specific changes make Octavia look sportier The current-generation Octavia was launched in 2019 and is underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MQB Evo platform. The car returning to India is that model’s facelift unveiled early last year. The facelift gets the requisite styling updates, but the changes go deeper with a refreshed interior, some new tech and a bump-up in engine power in the RS version. Neat boot lip spoiler finished in black accentuates sporty appeal. On the outside, the car gets a sharper stylistic treatment, even more so in the RS version. The headlights cut prominently into the bumper, and that effect is accentuated by the jagged DRL signature. The bumper has chiselled edges on the outside and pointy, triangular, blacked-out sections that house inlets that channel air around the front wheels. Being the RS version, the grille and lower air intake area are blacked out, with the grille carrying the RS badge. 19-inch alloys don't look too sporty 19-inch aero-optimised alloys don't suit the sporty pretensions. The 19-inch alloys are aero-optimised, and while the company says they reduce drag, they take away some of the sporty look with the large closed-off area. In profile, the Octavia wears the sedan look well, though the boot lid is actually a lift-back design – a hallmark of all Octavias. At the rear, there’s a neat little boot-lip spoiler, and, like the headlights, the tail-lamps have a sharp lighting signature. The bumper’s lower edge has a sporty, blacked-out treatment, with twin exhaust pipes at each side. Skoda Octavia RS interior, features and comfort  13-inch touchscreen is new While the insides of the facelifted Octavia are largely the same, the big change is a new 13-inch touchscreen that’s crisp and responsive to touch. Some controls, such as the engine start-stop, are contained in the screen; thankfully, some functions, like drive-mode selection and HVAC, are via the buttons below. The RS has sports seats that look really cool with their black upholstery and contrasting red elements in the fabric and stitching. All-black cabin with contrasting red stictching looks sporty, and has ample space. Skoda's Simply Clever features are noteworthy The comfort is good, and for my smaller frame, the deep bolstering felt just right. The dashboard is also an all-black affair, covered in neoprene and with red stitching. The three-spoke steering wheel has the RS logo at the bottom and familiar scroll wheels that feel nice to use. Given that this is a Skoda, there are quite a few of the brand’s signature ‘Simply Clever’ features, such as a phone holder that fits inside the cup holders, and my favourite: a small microfibre duster to wipe the touchscreen, stored securely inside the centre console. Octy's cabin is spacious with ample headroom As expected, the cabin is spacious; at both front and rear, there’s considerable headroom, but note that our car didn’t have a sunroof. The legroom, too, is very good, and I had more than sufficient space for my 5-foot 8-inch frame. So, even if you choose to be chauffeur-driven, you’ll be happy here. Front sport seats offer excellent support.   Skoda Octavia RS price, launch and verdict Octavia RS price expected to be around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom) As with its predecessors, the new Skoda Octavia RS will be priced higher than its regular sibling, which Skoda is working hard at getting to India after the RS launch. But as these will come as CBUs, expect higher sticker prices – we hear that’s around Rs 50 lakh for the RS. Interestingly, Skoda tells us that instead of importing a fixed number of cars, it will go by customer orders. While that translates into a waiting period of four to five months, it also means that customers can specify a variant and features based on what’s available in the UK. CBU status will mean a price tag around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Octy RS. Customers who sign up can thus expect some level of a personalised RS and, of course, a well-rounded sedan. A more lively handling character would be nice, but that aside, the new Skoda Octavia RS is one gem of a car. It can pull off daily driver duties and transform into a sporty, energetic car with ease. It’s comfy, with plenty of space inside, and the brand has plenty of street cred, too. So it really can be all the car you’ll ever want.

    "title": "Why are car makers displaying ads on the touchscreen?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-are-car-makers-displaying-ads-touchscreen",
    "description": "Jeep played a blinder with its Harrison Ford Super Bowl commercial – but not with its in-car ads Jeep has had quite the few weeks. Initially things went rather well for it, because it convinced Harrison Ford to star in its Super Bowl half-time commercial, which not surprisingly was received very fondly. Ford teased himself about his name being Ford and teased Ford itself for copying the Wrangler with the Bronco. You can imagine the marketing teams sharing high fives. Until, that is, somebody reported their Jeep was serving them advertisements in a pop-up on its touchscreen that, try as they might, they couldn’t get rid of. They would tell the pop-up to go away and it would, for a few minutes, before reappearing again the next time – and every time – they came to a stop, offering to connect them to an operator so that they could purchase an extended warranty. Someone else then reported their Jeep doing the same. It drove these owners mad, and I can understand why. Last week, my work phone kept reminding me via a pop-up, often mid-text or email, that I should update its operating software to the latest version – something I had been avoiding, because friends and colleagues and the wider internet had told me it would ruin the photo and email apps. As I dismissed each pop-up, I wanted to put the darned thing in the microwave, and it’s not even my phone. If I’d have dropped fifty grand on a new car that insisted on trying to get me to phone an extended warranty department, the call I’d actually make would be to an insurer to explain that there has been a terrible accident and that my car was at the bottom of a ravine, on fire, so could I please have the money to replace it with something different? Thankfully – so very, very thankfully – Jeep says the message repetition was delivered in error. As it explained to American website The Autopian, the note was meant to appear once (this may still seem one too many times to you) and disappear and not return once dismissed.  It said it had contacted the affected owners and already corrected this “glitch”. This hasn’t made everyone’s concerns go away, though. News stories, features and social media posts – both hinged and, obviously, unhinged – point to Jeep owner Stellantis’s aim to collect €20 billion from software initiatives by the end of the decade. It’s reported that in 2023 Stellantis told a US customer “ads are part of your contractual agreement with [radio broadcaster] Sirius XM” when those appeared on their car’s screen. And, of course, plenty of these stories also reference controversial subscription services like those offered by BMW, which has rowed back on some but not all of them. Right now, it’s still offering speed camera information for £25 a year and parking assistance or driving plus assistant for £19 and £35 respectively per month. This, remember, is to access hardware features that are already fitted to the car.  In other words, people’s concerns about ads appearing unwanted on their car’s screens are stoked simply by how plausible it seems: ‘It’s just what they’d do.’ You’d like to think they wouldn’t, but see how instead of walking 10 metres into the departures lounge, air passengers must now walk a circuitous 200 metres through a shop. I would take whichever goon came up with that idea and sentence them to walk through a fug of perfume, tripping over wheelie bags that, by the way, clearly aren’t hand luggage, for the total time that passengers have wasted trudging along these curvy corridors (that makes them sound rather more alluring than they are). Last time I was in this forced retail environment, I looked up how many air passengers there were per year, and the answer was 4.5 billion. So if one in five of those wastes a minute at an airport that has adopted this practice, that’s 1711 years and two months. If you were in the meeting where this new reality was signed off, I’d cover your bedroom floor with upturned plugs that you’d have to tread on and crawl across every single night for the rest of your life. Preferably beyond. I digress. I’m pleased to find that the Jeep scare was just a one-off, not something that heralded a new policy. The reaction to it should serve as a cautionary tale for any car maker that’s thinking of actually adopting it. Should – but will it?",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/defender-vs-land-cruiser-vs-grenadier-ultimate-4x4-showdown",
    "description": "The showdown: which 4x4 is the king of the class? Does Toyota's perennial off-roader have what it takes worry the Land Rover Defender and Ineos Grenadier? We may not be in the same league as the indigenous peoples of North America when talking about snow, or those of the Middle East about sand. But depending on which regional dialect you zoom in on, you may find as many as 30 synonyms for mud in the various tongues of the British Isles. Clag, clart, gunk, mire, ooze – call it what you will, it seems we are notorious global experts on it. And we’re looking at the full glorious spectrum of it today, in an old Rutland limestone quarry criss-crossed with tracks and paths. This is exactly the kind of place we need to be to settle a question posed by the arrival of the new, J250-generation Toyota Land Cruiser. Here and now, which is the best, toughest and most capable road-legal, dual-purpose off-roading 4x4 on sale? It will take plenty of climbing, descending, articulating, crawling, fording, squelching and squeezing to know. In the way of the new Toyota stands some very serious opposition. The Ineos Grenadier and Land Rover Defender are cars whose stories are irrevocably intertwined. The first is close enough in design and concept to the original Series Land Rover as to feel almost like an unsanctioned restomod. The second is the long-awaited official sequel model similar in spirit but altered in execution – much to the apparent approval of the SUV-buying public. The Grenadier – with its ladder frame, rigid beam axles, recirculating ball steering and three locking mechanical differentials – could be called studiously traditional. The Defender – with its monocoque chassis and independent suspension, actively managed air springs, ‘intelligent’ driveline (itself with two active locking diffs) and myriad Terrain Response off-road driving modes – is fully committed to the technological avant garde. We wanted both in their most capable guises, which is why we’ve got a short-wheelbase Defender 90 D350 (with optional air suspension and configurable Terrain Response driveline, active rear differential and all-terrain tyres) and a Grenadier 3.0T petrol Trialmaster (with optional Rough Pack consisting of locking diffs front and rear, and BF Goodrich all-terrain tyres). But can either prove itself to be superior, both off the road and on it, to the inheritor of probably the toughest automotive reputation in all motordom? The new Land Cruiser comes to us in 2.8 D-4D First Edition form, with locking rear diff and disconnecting front anti-roll bar as standard, optional Yokohama all-terrain tyres and a suspiciously Camel Trophy-looking shade of Metallic Sand paint. Sizing them up You might not expect a modern Land Rover to be capable of playing the little guy in any Autocar comparison exercise – but just look at this one. Ineos has no plans for a short-wheelbase Grenadier. Toyota remains mute about any possibility of a short-wheelbase J250 Land Cruiser. So if you want a car with a shorter wheelbase naturally better suited to off-roading in the first place (check out the breakover angles on p45 for proof of the difference it makes), the Land Rover has a big advantage straight away. That you don’t see so many Defender 90s on the road probably tells you plenty about how much off-roading buyers of this car actually have in mind (although a 110 remains a seriously capable 4x4, as it has proven on these pages before). Still, what more can Land Rover do? If you want one, have one. It’s choice. As far as Toyota, Ineos and the impact on the result of this group test are concerned, choice may well turn out to be something of a bitch. More fortunately for others, that isn’t the only natural advantage that applies here. Not counting its mirrors, the Ineos is 1930mm wide, or 50mm narrower than the Toyota and nearly 70mm skinnier than the Land Rover. When it comes to threading it between rocks and through gaps, that could make a difference, as could the fact that you sit a little higher at the wheel of the Grenadier, with a clearer view of the extremities of the car and its straighter, more sheer sides. Equally, though, the Grenadier’s near-3.0m wheelbase makes me worry for its manoeuvrability. But it does have lots of practical touches that are ideal for off-road use, such as outsized switchgear that you can easily operate with a gloved hand, and drainage holes so you can hose out muddy floors and footwells. For all its size, the Grenadier’s cabin packaging isn’t really a patch on that of the Land Cruiser, which offers seven seats as standard and plenty of room in rows one and two. But the Ineos does seem like a car designed and built expressly for off-roading, in a way that so many ‘off-roaders’ don’t. When you make the interior muddy, as inevitably happens on these occasions, you don’t think you’re doing the Grenadier a disservice, whereas the Land Rover’s cabin is so neat and lovely that you feel like you’re defiling it. Mud and thunder Eyes down, wellies on and low range engaged, then. How do these cars compare as conveyances ready to take you a long, long way off road? This will sound like a cop-out but  there really isn’t one outstanding off-roader here. There are at least two – and the worst might even be the most fit-for-purpose car of the trio. For climbing – scaling steep Scottish fells mountain rescue-style and needing unwavering confidence that no gradient will be beyond you – take the Defender. The sheer grip, security and controllability it has in extremis put it in a league of one in so many ways. That doesn’t only make driving it easier. It also gives you options. If you need to pick your way slowly up a muddy slope, or stop, roll back and then restart, you can. The Land Rover’s clever active driveline and suspension seem to be able to read your mind. It will lock and unlock its active diffs, pump down a wheel to find contact with the ground and recalibrate its stability control without you even knowing it’s happening. And it simply could not be easier or more reassuring to drive, for which – when you are at 40deg, in perilous circumstances and, I dunno, perhaps want to keep your passengers from panicking – there’s probably an awful lot to be said. Then again… if I were setting out on a three-month-long jungle expedition along rutted and cratered tracks, and across makeshift bridges and shallow rivers, I think I’d prefer the Land Cruiser – and the Grenadier would make at least a fairly close rival for the Defender. For wheel articulation – a factor much more likely to define an off-roader’s ability to avoid becoming beached on a rock, bank or tree stump than static ground clearance – the Grenadier does very well indeed. Its cantilevered axles move as one, reaching out below on one side as the opposing wheel is compressed, to better cradle the car’s body than most independent suspension systems ever could. It’s a car you have to drive very deliberately, though. Decide up front how many levers to throw and buttons to press, and then live with your decisions for both good and bad. You often find the right way to proceed via trial and error, and in spite of a pretty terrible turning circle that only gets worse when you start locking diffs. The Ineos has other shortcomings. When it’s climbing steeply, the petrol engine can come up a little short for accessible torque and start to bog down. It feels heavier than its rivals too – because it is, by some 400kg. But it does feel like the default off-roading enthusiast’s choice here – the one you might get the biggest kick out of from successfully scaling the north face of the Eiger in because, a bit like some lightweight sports car, it tells you very clearly when you’re operating it well, and when you’re not. As for the Toyota? Crikey, it just gets on with it. That long rear overhang would be easy to clout on rocks or ridges and the breakover angle makes the underbody a bit vulnerable. But somehow, it doesn’t seem to matter. Find a car with a greater appetite for punishment than this, I dare you.Having so much torque at low revs, that four-cylinder engine is incredibly well suited to grunting around up slopes and over obstacles. It combines superbly well with a torque-converter gearbox that itself winds up like some kinetic snatch tow rope to twang the drive through, multiplying it usefully at low revs. You seldom need more than 2500rpm to get where you intend in this car – and, thanks to the new electromechanical power steering system, it’s so much easier to steer than the lumpy, inconsistent-feeling tiller of the Grenadier. The Land Cruiser’s electronics for the traction, suspension and diff don’t feel as clever as the Defender’s but, with just a bit of forethought, the end result is mostly the same. And you would bet on it being the same 99 days out of 100, in the harshest and most remote places on the planet. Because, despite its fairly plush cabin and selectable drive modes, there’s really only as much complexity to the Toyota as it absolutely needs – and that familiar, striking sense of mechanical robustness that neither the Defender nor the Grenadier can quite match is present in abundance. Time to hit the road Off road, then, this contest is one of particular horses – or heavy-laden, hard-working draft bullocks, if you prefer – for courses. For a clear winner, we will have to look to the road, where, I have to say, the outcome becomes a lot plainer. We have touched on the daily-use practicality, comfort and ownership appeal of these cars a little already. As a 90, the Land Rover would be a bit of a pain for families because of the back-row entry and exit rigmarole. The boot feels a bit like opening a bank vault’s door on the interior of a music box. But so what? Ninety per cent of this car’s off-road capability is fathoms more than you will probably ever need. Just have a 110 instead. The Land Rover’s interior is certainly the most inviting and pleasant place here. It’s followed at least fairly closely by the Toyota’s (roomy, solid, comfortable and well furnished, though not in any way rich or luxurious) and really rather distantly by the Ineos’s (a little perched and tight-feeling up front, comfortable enough – just – for adults in the back, with quite a cleverly configured and roomy split tailgate boot, but very deliberately short on frippery and decoration). So, on balance, the Land Cruiser looks like it might just force its way to the head of the field initially – until the driving starts. That’s when the clattery drone of the Toyota’s long-stroke four-cylinder diesel engine starts to contrast starkly with the muted hum of the Land Rover’s straight six. Then the slightly fiddly, fidgety, body-on-frame ride of the Land Cruiser, improved though it may be relative to the old car, contrasts with the more settled, smooth, quiet and fluent ride of the Defender. And the ability of the Land Rover to hunker down a little on its air springs and corner amazingly sweetly on that shortened wheelbase just takes the test away from the inevitably  more ponderous and less biddable Toyota. Where’s the Grenadier? Best not to ask. This car has the sort of handling and steering on the road that would make you assume it must be utterly peerless off it – and probably a little disappointed to learn the reality, however nuanced it may be. That recirculating ball steering has such a dearth of centre feel and positivity that steering dead ahead is a job of constant correction and exiting tighter bends requires as much input as entering them. The ride is fairly soft and settled enough, and though it’s notably noisier at a cruise than either the Toyota or the Land Rover, its BMW-sourced straight six does at least give the car motorway performance that an original Land Rover could only dream of. But it’s always compromised, not very modern-feeling and a little uncouth. What the Grenadier ably does, as much as this may infuriate some of the key people who created it, is to illustrate by contrast what a world-class bit of engineering and shining example of technological leadership the modern Defender is. If the latter had to win this test on off-road ability alone, it would have – with its singular drivability, traction and dependable composure in any terrain. But take into account its stunning breadth of dynamic ability as a road car, its desirability as a product and its understated luxury appeal, and its superiority remains utterly clear and totally undeniable. The Toyota Land Cruiser is very good and the Ineos Grenadier at least singular and different. But the Land Rover Defender proves that an outstanding dual-purpose on- and off-road remit can be served without bad manners, rough edges or comfort compromises. It’s a car that has clearly already won its commercial success, but it also continues, rather vividly, to earn it.  1st. Land Rover Defender 90 D350 X-Dynamic SE Edges the result off road; blitzes it in a wider sense. Surely one of the most versatile new cars in the world.  2nd. Toyota Land Cruiser 2.8 D-4D 204 First Edition A diamond-hard, utterly unstoppable 4x4 as only Toyota can make, though the softer usability edges are apparent. 3rd. Ineos Grenadier 3.0T Trialmaster Mixes hardcore off-road hobbyist appeal with some practical touches and works well in the right setting. But the road definitely isn’t it.",

    "description": "They come from near and far. Cars, cars, and more cars. Modern classics, all of them: sports cars, limos, performance sedans, muscle cars, and SUVs. Real cars. With real engines. real performance and real muscle. Cars from Germany, Italy, Britain Japan and US. Performance icons, cars renowned for their styling, cars that adorned our walls. The good and great, all placed together. Row upon row of epoch-making cars, a veritable museum of auto delights. Around 120 modern classics, carefully placed on the green lawns of the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, each with its own story to tell and era to revisit. Modern Classic Rally 2025 opens with 120-strong car exhibition Iconic muscle cars like Dodge Viper, Ford Mustang, and Chevrolet Camaro on display Sportscars from Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, and more also drew attention Modern Classic Rally 2025 muscle cars The cars that draw the biggest crowds are the muscle cars – outlandish designs with large bonnet scoops, air inlets and shaker hoods. Highlights include multiple Ford Mustangs (it was Ford that pioneered the mass-produced V8 engine), some with massive bus superchargers sticking out of the bonnet, Mach 1’s, big 427s, and iconic fastbacks. Gen 1 Dodge Viper also made an appearance Also present are multiple Pontiac Firebirds, with even a few early small-block equipped cars, as well as others with the famous square headlight and flaming bird decals on the bonnets. There are also multiple Corvettes and Camaros from Chevy, and a Charger fastback and a 8-litre V10-equipped Viper, of course, probably the pinnacle. Modern Classic Rally 2025 JDM cars From the US to Japan, and some delicious JDM cars. Honda’s game-changing NSX that taught Ferrari and Lambo how to make useable supercars, Nissan’s fabulous early GTRs that pioneered the electronic control of traction, and the outlandish Supra, with its near-indestructible 2JZ, which could easily be taken up to 800 or even 1,000hp with only minor mods. Modern Classic Rally 2025 Italian cars Ferrari, Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo, and Maserati cars galore Italians, however, do it better, and this time we have a special treat. Not one, not two, but three special Ferrari V8s. The F430 Scuderia, with its track-focused upgrades, a 458 Speciale Aperta – the last of the great naturally aspirated V8s, and the 488 Pista, the twin turbo special with 711hp. What a set, and they are all in red. We even have a Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, or lightweight, that, despite its four-wheel-drive hardware and big V10 in the back, comes in at only around 1,500kg. From Ferrari to Alfa, and half a dozen or so spectacular examples. From the sublime Duetto convertible by Pininfarina to the 1750 GTV designed by the master Giugiaro and a rare six-cylinder 2600. Also Alfas sporting sedans, the Berlina and Super that helped actually also helped BMW define its brand. We even have three cool Maseratis: the Biturbo, the world’s first twin-turbo production car; the elegant 4200 with its timeless lines; and a more modern MC Straddle, with its Ferrari V8 engine and sharp front-engine handling. Modern Classic Rally 2025 European cars Also present in good numbers are BMWs, all the way from the E21 and E30s to M3s with big V8s under the hood. And we even have early TDS diesels that still sound super smooth. Up ahead, the Mercedes SLs, the timeless R129, partly responsible for the Youngtimer or Modern Classic, movement. We also have the tough-as-a-tank R107 SL, and even a pair of SECs, which still have lines that look better than today’s coupes. Also, Porsche, from the first 356, an SC, to a 996 911, and a pair of 997s, one of them a turbo. Rolls Royce, Jaguar, and Lotus classic cars exhibited as well Finally, from the UK, a quartette of Rolls-Royces, from the Silver Shadow onwards, all the way to the Phantom. Also in the mix, a pair of Lotus Elises, the lightweight bonded aluminium cars that rewired the sports car world, and a pair of E-Types, a convertible and a coupe with that rear door. Modern Classic Rally 2025 route map Mumbai While these are only some of the cars, you can see, hear, and feel all of them drive by if you are in Mumbai. The cars will leave from the Grand Hyatt hotel in Kalina at 10:30 hrs, head to the Sea Link, and then take the coastal road, taking a U-turn at Breach Candy before heading back.

    "description": "The first two months of this year have been quite eventful for the Indian automobile industry, thanks to Auto Expo 2025 in January and new car launches in February. The inaugural quarter of 2025 will close at the end of March, which will see the addition of more cars and SUVs to the market. Volvo XC90 facelift Launch date: March 4, 2025 The current-gen Volvo XC90 SUV has been on sale in India since 2016, so it’s due for an update. The Swedish carmaker first revealed the XC90 facelift last year with redesigned exterior styling elements adopted from the EX90 electric SUV. These include a revised grille with diagonal slats, slimmer headlights, refreshed bumpers, darker tail-lamps and new alloy wheels. Inside, the XC90 facelift offers a larger 11.2-inch Google-based touchscreen infotainment system that supports over-the-air updates. The powertrain is expected to remain the same as the current XC90, with a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol mild-hybrid engine channelling 250hp and 360Nm of torque through an 8-speed automatic gearbox to all four wheels. Prices are yet to be revealed, but the Volvo XC90 facelift will most likely come at a premium and compete against the BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz GLE and Audi Q7. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 Monogram Series Launch date: March 17, 2025 First unveiled internationally last year, the Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 Monogram Series will debut in India next month. The luxury roadster evidently builds upon the Mercedes-Benz SL and is claimed to be the sportiest Maybach model ever made. The SL 680 dons Maybach’s definitive dual-tone paint scheme, a new grille with vertical slats and multi-spoke wheels. The interior features white Nappa leather seats, a white dashboard and steering wheel with satin silver trim pieces, and a quieter exhaust system than the standard SL Roadster. Despite the luxury focus, the Maybach SL 680 comes equipped with a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8. The unit produces 585hp and 800Nm, channelled to all four wheels through a 9-speed automatic gearbox, enabling a 0-100kph time of 4.1 seconds. The Maybach SL 680’s price for India has not been disclosed yet. However, considering that the SL 55 Roadster retails for Rs 2.35 crore (ex-showroom), the Maybach SL 680 is expected to cost more than that. Maruti Suzuki e Vitara Launch date: March 2025 Maruti Suzuki will finally launch its debut EV for India, the e Vitara, in March. Design-wise, the e Vitara retains many of the styling cues of the eVX concept that previewed it in 2023: the upright stance, large LED headlights and chunky cladding all around. The e Vitara will feature 18-inch wheels as standard, and the rear of the SUV is dominated by an LED light bar. The e Vitara’s cabin sports a more upmarket design than the other Maruti Suzuki offerings in India, and the top-spec variant will include goodies such as a floating 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, a 10.1-inch fully digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a fixed panoramic sunroof, a 10-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, ventilated front seats, and more. The safety will be taken care of with seven airbags, rear disc brakes, a blind-spot monitor, a Level 2 ADAS suite, a 360-degree camera, and an electronic parking brake with auto-hold, among other bits. Two LFP battery packs will be offered for the e Vitara: 49kWh and 61kWh. Torque output is the same for both at 192.5Nm, but the smaller battery makes 143hp, and the larger pack develops 173hp. Maruti Suzuki has claimed a 500km MIDC-tested range for the 61kWh e Vitara. As far as pricing goes, the Maruti Suzuki e Vitara is expected to retail between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 30 lakh. It will rival the MG ZS EV, Tata Curvv EV and Mahindra BE 6. Also see: Maruti e Vitara features, colour options revealed Maruti e Vitara vs Toyota Urban Cruiser EV: design, specs, features compared",

    "title": "The Perfect Elixir: Lab Eleven",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ \"If a car sits too long, it starts to die.\" That is the ethos at Lab Eleven. No over-polished baubles. No overbuilt tech experiments masquerading as classics. Just 911s built to be used, built to last, and built to keep showing up for its only job, to be driven. The restomod world has a habit of missing the point. Somewhere between the bespoke interiors and the carbon fiber everything, a lot of builders lost track of why people love these cars in the first place. The formula has gotten predictable. Strip a 911 down to its studs, load it up with more power than anyone will ever use, tweak the suspension until it stops feeling a bit bitey, and then call it an improvement. It isn’t. It is just progress for the sake of it, and progress does not always move things forward. Lab Eleven is not interested in better for the sake of automotive performance theater. They are interested in better for the sake of driving. Pino La Rosa and his daughter Milena run their shop in Milan the way you would expect from people who actually care about these cars. Every Lab Eleven build starts with an accident free 993 and gets stripped down. What happens next depends on the car and the owner, but the process is always the same. Make it sharper, stronger, and more usable without killing what makes it a 911. \"We are not here to make a completely different car, we are here to make the best possible version of the car that already exists.\" That means no unnecessary gimmicks. No touchscreens, no pointless tech, no desperate attempts to make an air cooled car feel like something that rolled off a production line yesterday.  \"You should still feel the road, still hear the engine, still know what the car is doing beneath you.\"  The engines are rebuilt in three stages. A 3.6, a 3.8, or a 4.0 liter pushing anywhere from 300 to 400 horsepower. It is more than stock but not excessive, just enough to make the car feel alive. This may turn things into a bit of a handful for the rear engined uninitiated, but never more than one. Some panels are swapped for aluminum or carbon fiber, but only when it improves balance and durability. There are no qualifying laps that reward weight savings, and Colin Chapman is not breathing down your neck as you roll out of your garage. The goal is not to shave grams off a control arm or hub. It is about balance. Inside, they stick to materials that belong, wool fabrics, houndstooth, and leather that looks and feels right. Somewhere along the way, the restomod scene evolved into a competition to build the most expensive cars and coffee accessory. Machines that flick their blinkers a few times before arriving at an asphalt prison, only to be tucked back into a temperature controlled garage, polished with an overpriced orbital, and plugged into a twelve volt battery tender, the automotive equivalent of life support. Lab Eleven builds cars that need to be driven. Lab Eleven cars belong on alpine passes, winding back roads, and long stretches of open road where dirt and rock chips are part of the experience. A Porsche was never meant to be perfect. It was meant to be driven, to wear in, to collect the marks of use that prove it is alive, and when the time comes, you pass it on, imperfections and all.

    "title": "How (Not) to Rally Scout in the Unkillable Mercedes W123",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Another car bought sight unseen, another “gotta own this one someday” box checked. It also ticked the “probably definitely won’t break down” box, a critical facet for this purchase. The job? Scout the ’22 Overcrest Rally: 10 days, 8-10 hours a day, and thousands of miles, all in one state. Idaho. The 1979 300TD was rough but rust-free, and as my grandfather would say with a touch of irony, “a smooth runner with a straight body.” Despite its quirks, the W123’s legendary reliability and patience testing pace made it the perfect scout vehicle for the rally.   Most of the state is seen from a 72 mile jaunt across i90. A stretch easily defeated by those that would often rather be “there” than wherever “here” was. In about one episode of a podcast it's over and everyone is on to Spokane, Seattle, Portland, or some far off distant easterly place where pizza and bagels are made just right. No one hops off to venture inland to try some finger steaks or french fries from potatoes pulled out of the ground a few hours earlier. There are no grandma's huckleberry pies on the interstate either. But Idaho's uniqueness goes beyond just the food, it has roads. Some of the best one's you'll ever get the pleasure to find. Idaho proudly wears the Sawtooth Mountains at its heart. At the state’s beltline lies Boise, the capital city that initially wasn’t even on our radar. It lay too far below the squiggly tarmac and unknown mud and gravel of the forest roads. Before heading up there, the car needed a few things. It was the crest of summer, and the air conditioning didn’t work. We needed to install the European headlights that came with the car or we couldn’t bear our own existence. It didn’t have a roof rack, which seemed like a shame, and Jasin, the co-driver, a quiet, sharp, and witty man, wanted a bicycle in case we got stranded somewhere. “Dude, We are not going to need a bicycle. This thing is the most reliable vehicle ever made” “We might.” “We won’t…” Despite the w123 being the most reliable vehicle ever made, we ended up looking for a bike. After a bunch of “is it availables” we still ended up just going to a Pocatello pawn shop. We now had a bike (and cooler for Dews) on our roof rack. The air-conditioning swallowed up some cans of r134, and with some hotwiring of the compressor, we had ac. There was no power with it on, but we had it. 77hp with it off, and probably 65 with it at full chat. The vacuum system controlling the HVAC in the car was shot and screwdrivers were shoved through the vents to hold the blower flap open. It was the only way to get air flow. The fact that each one was essentially a guaranteed death by being impaled in an accident wasn’t lost on us, but aircon is aircon, the bastion and oil gilded holy grail of any old shitbox. If you’ve got it, you’re a king, and we had it. Us kings, royal purveyors and surveyors of the almighty road trip. May all without it bow before our superiority, piety, and condescension.  Far up into the mountains, we were met with snow. It was somewhere between \"no problem\" and \"big problem\" in depth, located a two-hour drive from where we’d started, and just 100 yards from the summit. The other side of the summit, and our route out, was right there. You could have hurled a stone and hit dirt on the other side. It was the answer to all of the “do we really want to drive 2 hours backwards?” considerations. The easy answer to this was no. No we did not. This route was supposed to be on the rally, which meant we’d have to drive back the other side just to check it out. The 30-40 yards of snow that swept across the mud was dense, and slushy, the last vestige of a long winter at 9000 feet. Making it through would save half a day of driving. The bike loomed. “What do you think?” “Not great.” “Not great… yeah.” “Should we make a run at it?” “Sure, why not.” Why not was that it was a really bad idea. At that altitude that car, even with the AC off was gutless. Maybe 50 hp. When it was new. 270k miles ago. The gearshift dropped into low and the old OM617 wheezed without spinning the tires in the mud towards the snow. There was no climax, no “ope, he might make it.” It was beached with just a few yards to go. The bike loomed again. Hours passed and after the digging with the top tray of a toolbox got tiresome the conversation got closer and closer to riding back down the mountain. In the middle of the debate a truck rounded the bend. After a chat the driver realized he wouldn't make it through either, but he did have a tow strap. Kings saved by mere mortals, a story for all time.  “Told you we wouldn’t need the bike.” On the way out, some sort of celestial car karma kicked in and the right front caliper seized. The roads were slick with rain and the car was not doing well downhill.  A call out to social media didn’t help and we were forced into heading to Boise to hit up a junkyard. There, the two wrench trick and some elbow grease yanked a caliper off an old w114 250C. It was pure luck the car was there and we knew it. This was the land of Bumpside Ford’s, not the land of vintage German tanks.  On the way out the door of the yard we spotted another w123 parked right next to ours. A turbo diesel sedan with a lot of miles. This thing had been around the block, a million times. It was well worn. The US headlights were in rough shape with one side missing the bezel, and the other side about to be.  The caliper got chucked in the backseat for later We knew exactly what we had to do. Working fast, we yanked the Euro-spec H4s out of their boxes, uninstalled the very nice US-spec lights, and swapped them out. Just as we finished, the owner of the million-block W123 walked up. As is often the case the man looked a bit like his car. He’d seen a few things and his weathered skin and thin wild hair spoke of it.   “Love your car sir.” “Thanks a lot.” “Hey so we noticed you maybe needed some headlights.” “Yep, thats why I was here, but no luck.” “I tell you what, take these.” “What do you want for them?” “Nothing.” The man thanked us, took the headlights graciously, hopped in his car, and clattered away. It's possible we got stuck and that caliper got seized for a reason.  Incredible roads were in abundance. Warm Lake Road, a monument to loneliness, curling up and up eternally, forcing us to shove snow in the engine compartment to keep going. White bird grade. A high bedrock set of switchbacks set in the hills below Grangeville. Both were empty. No one ever came, and it was ours for every mile. These roads are not in your backyard, and it takes significant effort to get out that far past the border of what people consider nowhere, but it's worth it, when you find out they’re all yours.    Continue...",
