    "description": "Supercar-slaying interceptors are the coolest in the emergency vehicle fleet Some (not me) will be able to cast their minds back to the late 1970s, when TV screens were awash with hit detective shows. You had the great Gordon Jackson starring alongside Martin Shaw and Lewis Collins in The Professionals (which to this day still has one of the best theme tunes), Dennis Waterman was tearing up west London in Minder, and when he wasn’t doing that, he was buddying up with John Thaw for The Sweeney. Many moons ago, Phillips Sr – who grew up watching Bodie and Doyle take fake punch after fake punch – would often subject me to re-runs of his favourite episodes during the school holidays. While the storylines didn’t strike much of a chord with me, the cars of the protagonists certainly did. The silver Ford Capri 3.0 S in The Professionals was a peach, as was the Diamond White Mk2 Ford Escort RS2000 – not to mention the immaculate Copper Bronze Ford Consul GT driven by The Sweeney’s DI, Jack Regan. The producers of these shows obviously chose cars with the same star power as the actors: you can’t imagine George Cowley skidding around an industrial wasteland in a Reliant Robin. And what made the Capri and Consul even cooler was that their propensity to intimidate was undented by stickers, plant pot lights and comically tall aerials. These were unmarked police cars – and all the more effortlessly threatening for it. Using plain cars to snatch wrongdoers became a popular tactic for police forces during the 1980s and 1990s, and they’re still deployed to great effect by traffic units and drug squads today. But the thing that makes unmarked police cars so much more dramatic is that they are often supercar-slaying performance derivatives, capable of chasing down a miscreant without breaking a sweat. Dive into the Autocar Archive and you’ll see that many forces relied on V8-powered MGBs for traffic enforcement work in the mid-1970s – a far better prowler than the sluggish, Austin Princess that British Leyland was supplying to the police at a similar time. The snarling Daimler SP250 is another early undercover icon, and you would have slowed right down if a sinister-spec Rover P6 flew up behind you on the motorway. Later, at the turn of the millennium, some road crime units famously turned to the likes of the Subaru Impreza WRX and Mitsubishi Lancer Evo, as these mighty WRC-inspired heroes could easily keep up with any vehicle hoping to evade the police – on or off road. And we can’t ignore today’s unassuming estates. The other day I stumbled across what looked like an unmarked BMW 320d Touring but was in fact a dressed-down M340i, complete with the punchy ‘B58’ engine. Talk about the ultimate sleeper. The best thing about these unmarked patrol cars is the air of deception: they’re basically hot, enthusiast cars styled to look like humble cooking models and equipped with the necessary hardware to take down the bad guys. What’s more, buying a used one is a fantastically cheap way of getting into an aspirational motor – so long as you can overlook the moon miles and PIT-manoeuvre scars…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/old-snake-new-tricks-driving-ac-cobra-mkii",
    "description": "It looks like the classic but is entirely new... The recreation of the classic roadster is at first glance a faithful facsimile of a 1960s performance benchmark The timing of my first few yards in AC’s ‘new’ Cobra MkII 347 is spectacularly bad. Gingerly making my way from its temporary base above Brooklands Museum’s historic Finishing Straight, the heavens open with truly biblical fervour. Any thoughts of a road trip in this factory continuation car that even hints at the Cobra 427’s transamerica thrash in the 1976 film The Gumball Rally are washed away as quickly as some of the loose rubble on Brooklands’ track. If nothing else, our slightly shorter schlep will now include some of Gumball’s filmic grit as we take on the rain-swept roads of southern England, picking up destinations that have particular relevance to this 2024 Cobra’s heritage. AC Cars, as you will have seen from Matt Prior’s prototype drive of the new Cobra GT Roadster, is now bringing the marque full pelt into the 21st century. But the car I’m driving is the Roadster’s genesis, being one of four final MkII Cobras the factory will make and ending a somewhat erratic production run, which started more than 62 years ago in February 1962. Of course, this last-of-the-line MkII is not completely faithful to its 1960s forebear, with each car needing to comply with current Individual Vehicle Approval regs. The upside is that the MkII’s power output is up by 50% to 400bhp, thanks to the installation of a bespoke, 347cu in (that’s 5.7 litres) Ford V8, the design of which is based on the original car’s ‘small-block’ 289cu in, or 4.7-litre, unit. Still with an iron block and aluminium heads, the engine is built to AC’s own specification by Prestige Performance in North Carolina and, as you would expect, swaps the in-period four-barrel Autolite carb for modern Holley fuel injection. Mated to this is a five-speed Tremec TKX gearbox, which, as we will see, is thoroughly in keeping with the Cobra’s character. It delivers drive to the rear wheels via a Quaife limited-slip differential. Other than these not insignificant changes, the MkII is the genuine article. Its body is identical to that of the original model (save for being made from composite materials rather than aluminium) and, to my eyes at least, is the sweet spot of the Cobra dynasty, looking more like the AC Ace on which it was based rather than the MkIII with its Carlos Fandango tyres and steroidal arch extensions. This MkII also retains a 3in tubular-steel ladder-frame chassis and rides on period-correct 15in wire wheels, just as before. Mind, the thought of venturing on to these sodden roads in a 330bhp-per-tonne projectile with all-round leaf-spring suspension really does focus your mind. But at least we can ease into our road trip at sane speeds. We’ve started at Brooklands because from 1988 and into the ’90s AC’s factory was situated along a now redeveloped section of the old Finishing Straight, after Brian Angliss’s Autokraft company acquired the rights to the AC name. As well as continuing to build the Cobra MkIV, Angliss attempted a modern take on the Ace, but high development costs brought the company to its knees after only 50 cars had been built. A more upbeat link with Brooklands can also be found from 1922 (the company’s history stretches back to even earlier in the last century), when an AC became the first 1500cc car to cover 100 miles in an hour on the old banked circuit. Today, though, we’re struggling to even hit the urban speed limit as we wade our way across London’s western suburbs to our next destination. Mercifully the rain has subsided, but since we’re roofless today, a tonneau cover protects the passenger side of the cabin for when it returns. You sit low in the Cobra’s leather-trimmed bucket seat facing a deep dashboard ush/pull buttons – for heat, wipers and so on – and a further four unmarked flick-switches, one of which is for lights while the others remain a mystery for now. A classic three-spoke, wood-rimmed steering wheel looks quite large for the cabin – although it’s probably ’60s-accurate – but no doubt calms your responses at high speeds, as well as giving you extra leverage at parking speeds for the unassisted rack. It’s all in keeping with this car’s authenticity, though, so when you fire up the Cobra and shut your eyes, you could be on the starting grid at Goodwood’s Revival. Exhausts exit either side of the car, and even at idle they produce a mellifluous rumble, with a portend of what’s to come. The clutch is appropriately heavy and the gearlever located further back than you would expect. But with this much torque you can happily bumble around in top gear, with the engine turning at just 1000rpm at 30mph. Thames Ditton, Surrey, is our next stop and the spiritual home of the original Cobra. AC was based here from 1911, occupying the old Ferry Works, which still exists as a multi-business hub today. Brothers William and Charles Hurlock bought the business in 1930, and the company moved to another since-demolished site in town, now commemorated by a plaque on the side of a modern building. It was here in 1961 that a Texan chap by the name of Carroll Shelby approached the Hurlocks after being impressed by their Ace model’s competition success. Working for Ford, Shelby had been tasked with stealing some of the thunder GM had generated with its Chevrolet Corvette, and he had developed a new lightweight V8 for the purpose – one that, with a bit of angle-grinding, could be installed in AC’s Ace. A deal was struck, giving Ford a ready-made Corvette challenger and AC a second, V8-powered wind for its by then eight-year-old Ace. In February 1962, the first car from an initial order for 100 AC Cobras rolled out of the Thames Ditton factory, destined for Dean Moon’s Santa Fe Springs speed shop in the US where the new 260cu in (4.2-litre) engine would be fitted. But after just 126 cars had been produced, a MkII emerged with rack and pinion steering (replacing the Ace’s steering box) and a larger, 289cu in engine making 270bhp. In all, AC and Shelby produced just under 530 MkII Cobras before production ended in 1965 and switched to the fatter and even more powerful MkIII variant.  But it’s this MkII version, with its narrower hips and skinnier tyres, that not only pays more heed to AC’s heritage but also is a better fit – both physically and aesthetically – for UK roads. If proof were needed (and we decide it is), we motor south to Goodwood Motor Circuit, our next photo stop, on the A283 in West Sussex. The Cobra is in its element on a twisty, relatively narrow, fast-moving road like this. It requires all your concentration, and to some extent courage, to maintain a decent pace, especially on gnarled, sometimes waterlogged surfaces. But the rewards are manifold: smooth applications of the throttle are vital on the exit from bends in order not to excite the leaf-sprung rear end, but extend the Cobra’s V8 down the straights and you’re repaid with a soundtrack that’s as uniquely American as Gershwin or pumpkin pie.  The hard-edged hammering of eight pistons working hard grows into a guttural roar as you trip past 4500rpm: it sounds so damned violent (but also intoxicating) that you’re tricked into believing the Cobra is travelling faster than it actually is. AC estimates a five-second 0-60mph time, which feels about right, but there are few more dramatic ways to achieve that figure. We pause in Petworth, a few miles north of Goodwood, for photographer Max to take some beauty shots of the Cobra. I do a few slow circuits of the market town’s narrow, old-school one-way system while he snaps away, but the strident bark from the Cobra’s V8 – no matter how gently I stroke the throttle – seems to be at odds with Petworth’s genteel, antique shop vibe. But no, not at all, it seems; in fact, quite the opposite. Instead of being besieged by the local noise police when we park in the town square, a small army of middle-aged, well-to-do shop owners and residents descend upon the Cobra, grins on their faces and phone cameras at the ready, wanting me to explain why it’s so clearly ‘vintage’ yet wears ‘74’ registration plates. The Goodwood effect is clearly alive and well in these parts. And Goodwood-bound we are now. I have the rare pleasure of an empty road for most of this part of the trip and really start to gel with the Cobra. You can’t drive this car with any hint of indifference for fear it will bite you. The steering is prone to kickback but full of feedback through its large, thin-rimmed wheel, and it’s pleasantly high-geared for fast-road work. Its separate chassis reacts to every surface change, and you’re constantly on the lookout for mid-bend potholes and drain covers that threaten to send the 1950s suspension awry. But this is the real deal, warts and all. You hang on for dear life but at the same time revel in the Cobra’s brutality and the demands it makes of you as a driver. Which, if you’ve ever attended Goodwood’s Revival or Members’ Meeting, is why our penultimate stop is at the Motor Circuit. In more modern times, Cobras have been a thorn in the side of so many Jaguar E-Types and TVR Griffiths that it only seemed right we should pay tribute with a few (loud) runs through its famous tunnel. We can’t dwell here, though. Our car is needed back at AC’s new works, just down the A27 in Bognor Regis. It’s the same high-tech factory that will also produce the new Cobra GT Roadster. But it’s only thanks to the car I’m in right now that it will enjoy the success it undoubtedly deserves. By Simon Hucknall",

    "description": "Earlier this month, the Pacifico Yokohama convention hall hosted the 32nd running of the mega-popular Yokohama Hot Rod Custom Show. A whopping 24,000 visitors sashayed their way through the scores of custom bikes and cars during the one-day show, displaying a sort of organized hubbub typical of Japanese events. Among them were our friends Marc Holstein and Christine Gabler; a formidable German photography duo with a deep love for Japan and her culture. With an invite to the much quieter setup day, Marc and Christine captured the show’s most intriguing machines in vivid detail, before returning the next day to document the colorful whirlwind that is the Mooneyes show. We’ve already profiled a couple of hits from the show; Sureshot’s zany Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 and 46Works’ stylish Ducati Monster 900.…",

They sell a whopping three million units a year—which makes them the country’s third-largest marque—and they own Norton. Most notably, all of the motorcycles they produce have a capacity of 312.2 cc or less. Proving that small bikes are big fun, TVS makes models like the neo-retro TVS Ronin 225, the fully-faired TVS Apache RR 310, and the edgy TVS Apache RTR 310 naked. They also regularly work with custom workshops like Smoked Garage to show off the potential of their plucky street bikes.

    "description": "I love using my Suzuki Access to bop around the city. It’s comfortable, practical, frugal and zippy. So much so that I haven’t ever found myself wanting another commuter. That was until the Ather Rizta entered our long-term fleet. Ever since it arrived, my Access hasn’t seen much action, and in the month that I’ve spent with the Rizta, I’ve covered more than 500km. Two things that have made a positive impression on me in these early days are its enormous boot and intuitive regenerative braking. Its 34-litre boot is deep enough to fit in a lot of stuff, along with the big charger. The 34-litre boot here isn’t the biggest in the e-scooter game, but it’s almost double the size of the one on my Access (and most other ICE scooters). I’ve managed to fit in my fully packed Kriega sling bag and the bulky charger supplied with the Rizta, with room to spare. This is also the only e-scooter (besides the River Indie) that can accommodate an ECE-certified full-face helmet, which I think deserves praise. Unlocking the boot always needs two hands, which is frustrating on a daily basis. The trouble is that when I need to open the boot, it doesn’t unlock with just the twist of the key. I need to press down on the seat exactly where the locking mechanism is located with the key in the unlock position to get it to release every single time. This isn’t a big negative, but it is one of those things that gets mildly irritating with time. Another positive here is Ather’s Magic Twist feature, wherein the regen progressively slows you down when you twist the throttle backwards. This has proved to be quite a treat in Mumbai’s typically staccato traffic. At speeds below 40kph, with a bit of planning, I didn’t have to use the brakes and relied solely on the regen to stop.   Ather’s Magic Twist is intuitive and works beautifully well in city traffic. But there is a problem here. Locking the rear wheel up is all too easy when you’re coming to a halt hurriedly. Part of that blame must be attributed to Mumbai’s atrociously slippery concrete roads, but Magic Twist and the rear brake working in tandem seem to enhance this tendency. This has forced me to actively pay attention to how much pressure I apply on the brake lever. Either that, or I avoid using the regenerative braking when coming to a halt quickly, using only the brakes. Barring these irritants, it has been smooth sailing with the Rizta, and I’m looking forward to adding more digits to the odo reading. Strong regen, along with rear brake usage, can cause the rear wheel to lock up easily. Nevertheless, the biggest advantage of any EV has to be the beautifully low running cost. Per my usage, I spend around Rs 1,000 on fuel every month with my Access, but using the Rizta, that number drops to roughly just Rs 120! Also See: TVS iQube S long-term review, 2,200km report",

    "description": "Despite the bleak future of diesel engines, the demand for a three-row SUV with a diesel engine is still strong. And so, while the recently updated Alcazar got all the modern frills and features, it also continued with a diesel mill. Hyundai has also priced both the turbo-petrol and diesel variants at par, and that might put some buyers in a dilemma, but there are some caveats before you start calculating the running costs and fuel economy. The 1.5-litre diesel unit is smooth and vibe-free. On the design front, there is no difference between the petrol and diesel versions. You get the same new look with LED headlamps and H-pattern DRLs, the same 18-inch wheels and the same rear look as well. There isn’t even any badging to distinguish them. It’s a similar story on the inside; well, almost. The dashboard layout and dual-screen setup mirror that of the petrol version. But glance higher up, and you’ll notice the missing panoramic sunroof. In fact, there is no sunroof and that, Hyundai says, is due to the extra weight, which brings down efficiency. When it comes to a diesel car, fuel efficiency takes top priority. No sunroof for diesel variants. We got a chance to sample the 7-seater version, which meant a bench seat instead of the captain chairs we tested on the turbo-petrol. Space and comfort are adequate, but you miss out on the extendable under-thigh support, lateral support on the headrests and the ventilation function. That said, the seat can be slid back and forth, and the backrest can also be reclined. An advantage of the bench seat is the ability to tumble it down, making access to the third row a whole lot easier than in the captain seat version. Third-row space is good for children, and the Alcazar is more of a 5+2 seater and not a full-size 7-seater. While the lack of a sunroof will not be of much bother to many, what will be concerning is the lack of a spare wheel. You get a puncture-repair kit for emergencies, which feels like cost-cutting gone too far, especially on a diesel SUV. It is available as an optional extra, but on a diesel SUV it surely deserves to be a standard fit. Sure, good efficiency helps, but how much are you ready to put on the line for a couple of extra kpl? No spare, only a puncture-repair kit. Powering the diesel Alcazar is the same engine as before – a 116hp, 1.5-litre mill that is also shared with the Creta, Kia Carens and Kia Seltos. It’s a smooth and vibe-free engine once you get going, but sedate driving is what it expects. Rush the engine for extra performance, and you’ll be greeted with a coarse diesel drone and a linear power delivery. The engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic, which complements the overall character and is relaxed. You get drive modes that alter the response in the bottom end, but it still remains an SUV you drive with a relaxed right foot. 0-100kph takes 12 seconds, but crucially, the diesel Alcazar returns 12.5kpl in the city and 16.3kpl on the highway. It is an able cruiser with an engine that can munch on the kilometres, a pliant ride that feels confident at speed and a practical cabin to carry plenty of luggage if the third row is folded down. The missing sunroof won’t hurt as much as the missing spare wheel might. However, if you are someone who racks up kilometres but also wants an easy-to-drive SUV in the city, the Alcazar makes for a good case.

    "description": "The Indian electric vehicle market has been buzzing with new launches month after month. However, EV passenger vehicle sales saw a slight slowdown in November, with 8,596 units sold compared to 11,165 units in October 2024. As the year comes to a close, car brands and dealers are pushing sales with attractive discounts and benefits on almost all models. Here’s a look at some enticing discounts on offer for mainstream electric cars and SUVs in India this month. Tata Motors EV discounts for December 2024 Save up to Rs 3 lakh Tata Motors has one of the biggest EV line-ups in India, with every model available at attractive discounts and benefits this month. The Tiago EV and Tigor EV for MY24 come with discounts and benefits of up to Rs 1.15 lakh, including exchange bonuses for some variants. On the other hand, the Tiago EV and Tigor EV for MY23 get much higher discounts of around Rs 2 lakh, along with an additional exchange bonus of up to Rs 1 lakh, depending on inventory. The Punch EV also gets discounts on MY24 models, ranging from Rs 25,000 for lower variants to Rs 70,000 for the top variant. Do note that these benefits also include exchange bonuses for some variants. While the Nexon EV for MY2024 does not have any official discounts, we are told that some dealers are offering benefits at their end depending on unsold stock. For MY2023 models, Tata Motors is offering discounts of a whopping Rs 3 lakh on the pre-facelift Nexon EV Prime and Max variants. The facelifted MY2023 Nexon EV gets discounts of around Rs 2 lakh. MG Motor India EV discounts for December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.25 lakh off The MG Comet is available with multiple discounts and offers up to Rs 75,000 at some locations. We are told this number could be higher at outlets with a higher number of unsold inventories. Similarly, for the ZS EV, dealers are offering discounts in the range of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2.25 lakh, depending on stock. There are no discounts on the newly launched MG Windsor EV. Mahindra EV SUV discounts for December 2024 The only Mahindra electric SUV available with a discount is the XUV400, which gets benefits worth Rs 3.10 lakh on both battery options. The slow-selling XUV400 is a capable electric SUV that rivals the likes of the Nexon EV and the MG ZS EV. Also read Best year end discounts on sedans, MPVs  Biggest year end discounts on SUVs",

    "description": "The Ford Mustang GTD has set a new lap record at the Nürburgring, completing the 20.8km-long track in just 6 minutes and 57.68 seconds. This makes it the fastest American road car to conquer this tough circuit, surpassing the previous record set by Porsche's 911 GT3 four years ago by 2.2 seconds. However, several other German cars have bested the Mustang's time earlier. GTD is the most extreme Mustang yet, surpassing even the Ford GT It’s the sixth vehicle in its class to break the seven-minute barrier Mercedes-AMG One is the fastest yet at the Nurburgring Faster cars around the ‘Ring The Mustang GTD’s time is surely respectable, but it is still behind the 911 GT3 with the Manthey Racing Performance Kit (6min 55.737sec), the 911 GT3 RS (6min 49.328sec), the Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series (6min 48.047sec), and the previous-generation Porsche 911 GT2 RS modified by Manthey (6min 43.300sec). The standout, however, has been the Mercedes-AMG One, which finished the lap a whole 28.595 seconds quicker than the Ford, clocking in at 6 minutes and 29.09 seconds. This was a 6.84 percent faster performance by the current road-car record-holder at the track. Mustang GTD engine, specs and design Ford's track-focused Mustang boasts a 5.2-litre V8 engine, which packs a massive 826hp, producing 63 percent more power than the 506hp-Mustang Dark Horse. It comes equipped with race-ready modifications like dry-sump lubrication and an active-valve exhaust system. Further, its chassis also sees major upgrades with a lower and wider stance, complemented by carbon-ceramic Brembo brakes for better track handling. “The team behind Mustang GTD took what we’ve learned from decades on the track and engineered a Mustang that can compete with the world’s best supercars,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. In terms of design, the GTD draws heavily from its racing equivalent, the Mustang GT3, featuring an aggressive body kit with broad wheel arches, cooling ducts for the engine and brakes, and a large rear spoiler. The Mustang GTD was only available for purchase through a special application process, which ended on July 19. Ford plans to attempt another lap next year to further improve the GTD's record, potentially rivalling the Porsche 911 GT3.
