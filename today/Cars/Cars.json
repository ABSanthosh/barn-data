    "description": "\"Everything we want to do at Jaguar is to be brand-led\", said Rawdon Glover Brand's managing director admits surprise at scale of response to its new look “I don't think you can plan to be the most talked-about brand on the planet…” says Jaguar boss Rawdon Glover, as he recalls those few days late last year after Jaguar’s rebranding, which must have left him reaching for his phone’s mute button. Ultimately, “the strategy played out” because the rebranding was designed to increase interest in the concept car that was soon to be unveiled. “You do a tease phase to ultimately get more eyeballs on the real thing”, says Glover, and Jaguar certainly did that. Yet he admits: “On a personal level, it took everybody a little bit by surprise in just how much commentary, how much debate, how much engagement there was on that.” It was not all positive – quite the opposite – and there “was definitely a little bit of shock” in some of the responses. Glover’s analysis shows a clear dividing line between social media reaction and general media reaction. Guess which one was more constructive and nuanced. Still, a goal of the rebranding was for Jaguar to be relevant. Glover says: “In the cultural Gulf Stream… when someone like Elon Musk is commenting on it, you think: ‘Oh, we’re in the conversation.’ In one respect, it’s job done. We’re getting visibility. “That’s one of my reflections from it: that for years nobody was talking about Jaguar and then for a few days everybody was. Nobody had been talking about what Jaguar was doing prior to this, so if you gave me the option of being talked about or not talked about, it’s obvious what you’d take.” The pile-on against the rebranding was “a bit frustrating” because two weeks later there would be a physical car to attach it to for the first time and all would become clear. “We knew that when stories started to land on the concept, it would balance out the argument – and that’s pretty much what we saw,” says Glover. Indeed, another reason the rebranding came before the car was because “everything we want to do at Jaguar is to be brand-led”. Glover elaborates: “With the way EVs are moving and the homogeneity of EV products, if you are going to be an EV-only brand, your brand has really got to differentiate. So starting off just by talking about the brand and not leaping straight into a vehicle you can buy seemed like an entirely appropriate place to start.” Glover says it “was interesting, really quite surprising” even, to see “the level of impatience” from some corners as to “how you could possibly talk about your brand for two weeks and not actually show us the car. “I certainly didn’t lose any sleep over that.”",

    "title": "Ripping up Jaguar history would be 'big mistake', says brand boss",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ripping-jaguar-history-would-be-big-mistake-says-brand-boss",
    "description": "Big step was needed because of move to EVs and arrival of Chinese brands Rawdon Glover reveals why the controversial rebrand was so vital to Jaguar's future Rawdon Glover, managing director of Jaguar, says you can never remind people enough about why the brand had to change. So, from the top, it was due to the fact that Jaguar was “at a pivotal point in its history”, with all its products and platforms coming to the end of the road. While the BMW-rivalling era of Jaguars had been critically well received, they had not done well in the marketplace, so “economically, the Jaguar model didn’t make sense”. Glover said “going south” with Jaguar’s pricing was “not an option” so “instead, partly informed by our history, [we decided] actually we should take Jaguar upmarket. “We should take Jaguar back to a positioning of when it was much more successful in the marketplace and really try and restore that real lustre that the brand definitely had, and we definitely see. “That’s why the brand still has such a strong affinity. But the interesting thing about Jaguar is most of the affinity tends to be with what we’ve done historically, not what we’ve been doing recently.” The decision was taken to move the products upmarket and, with a firm eye on future legislation, to make them all-electric too. In doing both those things, said Glover, “you need to take the brand with you”, hence the rebranding of Jaguar alongside the radically different cars and powertrains. However good the new cars might be, Glover said that in doubling the price of the new Jaguars, “you need to make sure the brand can actually carry it. You need to look at how you manage the brand and all of the experiences associated with that brand.” Before that, said Glover, an “elegant sunset” for winding down the existing Jaguar range is ongoing. While some models are on sale in other global markets, Jaguar no longer has a new car retail presence in the UK. “There’s no real playbook for that, because nobody else has done it before,” he said. “It’s definitely been a really interesting challenge to take that on. We’re quite a long way through it. We will have this period now of ‘breathing space’ to really build the [new] brand, the awareness, the interest, before we actually start taking orders further down the track.” While “there are times in a brand’s life when, particularly if it’s really successful, you tweak with tiny, little incremental changes, and that’s entirely appropriate”, something more drastic was needed for Jaguar because it was not in that position. The move towards EVs and “the increasing threat from Chinese brands” meant a small step would not be appropriate. Glover said: “We needed to make one really big step, because the environment is changing. The competitive set is changing. We think client habits are changing. Across the board, it wasn’t the time for Jaguar to take a little tentative step, which is probably what caught some people off guard in terms of it being a really big step for Jaguar. “But the ‘why’ is really important for me, becausewhen you take in all of those contextual factors, it demands a change of that magnitude.” When that change was first revealed to the world, initially as a rebranding in November and then with the unveiling of the Type 00 concept car a month later, Glover was acutely aware that reaction was at best mixed. (“Some commentators completely got it. Others haven’t. Similarly, some enthusiast groups have got it and others haven’t and we need to take them on that journey.”) But he is unwavering about why this needed to be done. “The team is absolutely unflinching on this: what it’s going to take for Jaguar to succeed and the way that we’re going to do it,” he said. “The design teams, the engineering teams – everybody’s been involved in getting it this far.” Returning to enthusiasts, Glover is frustrated that “messages get filtered” and about the sentiment that this new Jaguar is not for those who have loved and bought into the brand to date. “One example being: ’we are leaving our customers behind; we don’t care about our current customers’. That came from some of the negative commentary. But that was never the intention,” he said. “I can understand how that has been interpreted, because we’re basically saying Jaguar needs to attract a new audience. But that doesn’t mean to say we’re not interested in our current audience. Quite the opposite. [We] want to take as many of that current audience on that journey with us as possible. “We probably could have done a better job in just laying that out and explaining the narrative about why we were making the change, why the change was so dramatic. I think that was probably lost in that story. There’s definitely learning in that process.” Are there comparisons with how JLR reinvented the Land Rover Defender and upset the purists? “It’s definitely a good parallel,” said Glover. “From the experiences in the reaction, and then parallels in what we’re doing. “People ask me with Jaguar how you can completely break production, take a new concept, double the price point and increase the volume. “We’ve already done it. We did exactly that with Defender. We took an icon that was cherished and we reimagined it. Most people would say it’s an authentic Defender. It does what a Defender should do. “It operates at a completely different price point and we’ve tripled the volume and doubled the price point. We’re not looking to triple the Jaguar volume, but it’s an indication that these things can be done.” Much like the Defender reboot before it, the deep passion within Gaydon for its brands’ storied cars will become even more evident closer to launch. When Jaguar starts talking beyond brand and design, said Glover, this “phase of the communication will help enormously” with those who are not convinced about what Jaguar is doing. “There are clearly lots and lots of people out there that love Jaguars and heritage and history of the brand,” he said. “But the people here are exactly the same. “Many people like that are in this organisation. You’re in our head office today in Gaydon and there’s about 20,000 people here. For many, the reason they’re here is because their grandfather worked at Jaguar, their father worked here, and they have an affinity with it and they are deeply passionate about what we do. They care and they also really understand. “I quite often get asked why I’ve cut the umbilical cord with Jaguar’s history, to which my response is [I’ve done] quite the opposite. “We’ve looked at our history and what we’re going to be doing is not a literal interpretation. If you’re looking for a literal interpretation, we’d have just gone and done an E-Type restomod and been rightly criticised. “But if you look at Jaguar’s history and look at those moments in its history when it was really successful and really relevant, culturally, socially, commercially, it’s because it was very, very clear about what it was about. There are some beautiful, iconic vehicles in our history and it’s understanding what was different about those.” While there are nods to previous Jaguars in the design of the Type 00, Glover said “it’s not an E-Type and nor should it be” yet it does have “the essence of the brand” in it. “The essence of the brand is that sense of having the strength of conviction of what we’re doing,” he said. “If everybody else is turning right, maybe we’re okay to turn left. When we’re questioned or challenged about our history, I’m at pains to point out that the spirit of what we’re doing is absolutely in keeping with our history. “What we absolutely haven’t done is just ripped up the past and said we only look forward. It would be a big mistake. What’s happening in the market, with lots and lots of Chinese competitors, if we want to get into a ‘tech fest’ with those brands or a commodity pricing competition, that’s not a game we can win. “But those brands don’t have 90 years of storied history. They don’t have Le Mans wins. They don’t have associations with some of the iconic people that we do. And why would you not want to lean into that from that sense?”",

The shop sells brand new electric motorcycles alongside pre-owned gas guzzlers, and offers services on everything from vintage Harleys to modern sportbikes. Somehow, they still find time to build charming custom bikes—like this 1979 BMW R65 bobber. Fittingly, finding time was the most challenging aspect of this particular project. That’s because it was the pet project of Zen co-founder Chris Pirola, and often had to sit on the back burner while client projects took precedence. “I’ve always been a fan of the boxer engine and some of the amazing builds people create all around the world and was inspired to try and create one for myself,” says Chris.…",

    "description": "The GP Tech V4 suit serves as a replacement for my Missile Ignition suit, which has served me very well for the past five years. The GP Tech V4 costs about half of what you’d pay for the top Racing Absolute suit used by the top racers, but it incorporates many of the learnings and top-tier materials that you will find there. The biggest improvement for me is the overall fit and comfort. The first time I wore this suit, I was in it from 8am to 4pm, with much of that time being spent hanging around the pit area. Normally, that would have been a rather uncomfortable experience, but the GP Tech was surprisingly pleasant. Much of this goes to all the work Alpinestars has put into incorporating stretch panels in strategic spots, but it’s also down to the materials. This suit uses kangaroo leather in certain panels on the chest, arms and legs, and this material has the benefit of being lighter than the usual bovine leather. I was surprised to see that the armour used is CE Level 1, but the reasoning is that it resides behind tough, hard shell protectors on the shoulders, elbows and knees, which amps up the safety but keeps weight and bulk down. The GP Tech V4 uses kangaroo leather in select areas. From a fit standpoint, the GP Tech V4 is superb once you squeeze into it, and the only thing that caught my attention was that it felt a bit tight behind the knees. However, this was only a problem when standing and not on the bike. My sole gripe is that the leather around the chest area bunches up slightly at the seams, which causes no functional issues, but it doesn’t look great. There are some innovative materials in use here, including Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. This helps reduce the heat buildup when leather drags on the tarmac at high speed, which can burn the skin. Then, there’s the MATRYX® material, which uses a combination of Kevlar and polyamide yarn and promises high levels of abrasion resistance as well as excellent breathability. The suit uses Kevlar panels bonded under the leather in high-risk areas. Breathability is excellent, and there are even little intake ducts built into the hard armour on the shoulder and knees. One thing worth noting is that this suit is airbag-compatible but only with the newer systems. Older Astars airbag vests that need to be zipped into the suit don’t seem to be compatible with this one. Vents are built into the hard armour for better airflow. At around 2,000 dollars, the price for the GP Tech V4 hasn’t changed compared to its predecessor. You can get much more affordable suits for sure, even from Alpinestars, but if you’re a racetrack regular looking for the next step in comfort and protection, you’ll love the GP Tech V4.

    "description": "CNG-powered car sales touched a record high in 2024. Sure, the rising cost of petrol has fuelled a sharp increase in their demand, but manufacturers have also done their bit to draw in buyers. In contrast to the few taxi-spec CNG options available a few years ago, now there’s a wide variety of CNG models across different price bands and even body styles. Joining the CNG bandwagon is the new fourth-generation Maruti Swift priced between Rs 8.20 lakh and 9.20 lakh, which places it a notch higher than its natural rival, the Hyundai Nios CNG (Rs 7.68 lakh to Rs 8.38 lakh), almost in the premium hatchback territory. To find out whether Maruti has really upped its game, we pit it against the Tata Altroz iCNG (Rs 7.60 lakh to Rs 11.00 lakh) that’s already made its mark in its segment. So, which CNG hatchback should you put your money on? Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG exterior design Altroz larger than Swift Respectable 210-litre boot despite CNG tanks below; Instrument cluster execution could have been better; Front armrest adds to driver comfort; LED headlamps missing even in the top variant. The Altroz is larger than the Swift in every dimension, and its wheelbase is substantially longer, too. It is also the more stylish and well-proportioned hatchback that continues to turn heads, commendably nearly five years since launch. With its chiselled body lines, sharp creases and aggressive stance, the Altroz exudes a bold and premium look. Its wide grille, sleek headlamps and sporty 16-inch alloy wheels enhance its road presence. On the other hand, the Maruti Swift retains its signature silhouette, but the fourth-generation model features a curvier, more youthful design. Its rounded headlamps, prominent grille and sculpted bodywork lend it a fresh appeal. While it may not be as striking as the Altroz, it has a charm that resonates well with younger buyers. Swift CNG fuel-filler an eyesore and access is hampered The buttery smooth manual gearbox is a joy to use; CNG filler placement looks like an afterthought; Refined, peppy and efficient engine; The lack of boot space and cladding is disappointing. What is an eyesore is the exposed CNG filler cap on the Swift’s rear right fender. It gives the impression of being an aftermarket CNG job, which it isn’t. Also, to access the CNG filler, one needs to use a separate physical key provided along with the standard keyless remote; the internal release lever only unlocks the fuel filler lid, which is located on the other side. The Altroz is more sophisticated in this respect. Its CNG filler is tucked away beside its fuel filler, neatly covered by the tank lid. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG interior space and comfort Altroz feels more premium on the inside than Swift A layered dash design, coupled with light colours and textured bits, lends an upmarket feel; Seat is slightly higher set; cushioning is firmer; Wide cabin; it’s easier to seat three adults. Inside, the Tata Altroz continues its premium appeal with a layered dashboard, textured plastics and a floating infotainment screen. The dual-tone colour scheme and premium upholstery add to its sophisticated feel. However, the XZ variant’s instrument cluster with the 4-inch digital speedometer flanked by the readouts for the CNG and fuel levels on one side and the digital tachometer on the other doesn’t blend seamlessly. The Maruti Swift doesn’t feel quite as special inside. While the layout is functional, the plastics feel a bit basic, and the all-black theme doesn’t do much for the ambience either. The analogue instrument cluster with retro-styled needles is easy to refer to, as is the touchscreen, though the latter’s oversized bezel is an eyesore. Altroz is more spacious and comfortable Although functional, the all-black cabin with rudimentary plastics doesn’t feel upmarket; Nicely sculpted seat, but cushioning is soft; Supportive seat; not as spacious as Altroz. Both cars have broad and supportive seats with similar adjustability. But with relatively firmer seat cushioning and a central armrest, the Altroz has an edge in terms of comfort. Expectedly, the Tata is noticeably more spacious, thanks to a wider cabin and a longer wheelbase; if you frequently travel with five passengers, the Altroz will be the comfier pick. Twin-cylinder CNG kit makes Altroz's boot usable However, the real ace up the Altroz’s sleeve is Tata’s clever twin-cylinder tanks nestled beneath the boot floor. Not only are the cylinders hidden from view, but this clever arrangement liberates a respectable 210 litres of room for luggage. The Tata is also the only one here to pack in a spare wheel, albeit beneath the body. Tata’s twin-cylinder layout frees up a lot of usable boot space. The Swift’s single CNG tank, placed in the boot, takes up most of the space there, leaving barely enough room for a soft cabin bag. Also, the lack of cladding in the boot, with the CNG and its mounting visible, isn’t a pleasing sight. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG price and features Mid-spec Altroz XZ iCNG costs Rs 50,000 more than top-spec Swift ZXI S-CNG Maruti offers the Swift S-CNG in three variants, with prices ranging between Rs 8.20 lakh and Rs 9.20 lakh. However, unlike the petrol iteration, there isn’t a base and a fully loaded equivalent variant. Tata, on the other hand, offers the Altroz iCNG across the board, undercutting the Swift with a starting price of Rs 7.60 lakh and going all the way up to Rs 11 lakh for a fully loaded variant. To keep things close in price, we’ve considered the top Swift ZXI S-CNG (Rs 9.20 lakh) and the mid-spec Altroz XZ iCNG (Rs 9.70 lakh). Features common to both include auto headlamps, rear wiper and washer, 7-inch touchscreens, 6-speaker audio system, automatic climate control, rear air-con vents and ESP, to name a few.

Features unique to the Swift ZXI are side and curtain airbags, hill-start assist, LED headlamps, a wireless charger, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and some connected car features. Of course, buyers have the option of higher variants of the Altroz, which have most of the features listed here, besides boasting a sunroof, a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen and a delightful Harman audio system, among other bits. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG performance Swift CNG's engine more refined than Altroz Maruti’s three-cylinder engine is far smoother and more refined. Both models use 1.2-litre, 3-cylinder petrol engines and 5-speed manual transmissions. When driven using compressed natural gas (CNG), the Maruti unit develops 70hp and 102Nm, while the Tata one makes 74hp and 103Nm. It’s the Maruti’s mill that’s quieter and vibration-free. On the move, too, it does its job extremely smoothly, and only when you spin it closer to the redline will you hear the typical thrum associated with a three-pot. The engine also scores well on drivability by delivering its torque lower down, and as a result, it doesn’t warrant constant gear shifts to get a move on. Further, the car’s light clutch and buttery-smooth manual transmission not only remove the stress from driving but also make for an overall joyful experience. Altroz's clutch heavier and gearbox is more vague than the Swift  Unlike the Swift, which uses petrol to fire up the engine (by default) and then switches to CNG automatically with an audible mechanical ‘clang’, the Altroz starts in CNG mode, thanks to a single ECU (engine controller unit) setup. While the start-up process is pretty seamless, in this company, the Tata unit emits a gruff note, which progressively gets louder as the engine speed increases. Also, while the Altroz makes do with shorter gear ratios (than the Swift), particularly second and third, drivability leaves much to be desired. You need to work the gears to keep up with traffic. Even building speed in second gear after crossing a speed breaker is a slow process – something that can get annoying in traffic. While the Altroz doesn’t feel as light on its feet as the Swift, it delivers a strong rush of power beyond 2,500rpm, which makes the engine feel more willing, especially while overtaking. But unlike the Maruti’s rev-happy unit, this engine feels strained and outside its comfort zone when spun faster. Another sore point in the Altroz’s experience is its long-travel clutch pedal, which, although light, can feel a bit tricky to modulate to begin with, and even its gearbox feels a bit vague and doesn’t slot into gates as smoothly as the Maruti’s.

Interestingly, the Altroz redeemed itself in the 20-80kph in third gear and 40-100kph in fourth gear slogs, clocking times similar to the Swift. Both cars perform noticeably better when driven in their respective petrol modes, recording nearly 1 second quicker times. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG efficiency Swift S-CNG more fuel efficient in the real world than Altroz iCNG While the 0-100kph will hardly be a deciding factor for CNG buyers, what will matter is the car’s efficiency and, subsequently, the running costs. While Maruti claims that the Swift S-CNG will deliver an efficiency of 32.85km/kg, Tata quotes a 27.8km/kg figure. To put these numbers to the test, we emptied the cars’ tanks, filled them with a certain quantity of CNG, and ran them dry in the city; we repeated this process for our highway run. The Altroz drives like a bigger car thanks to its exceptional ride-handling balance. In urban conditions, the Swift S-CNG delivered 24.35km/kg, whereas the Altroz iCNG managed 20.56km/kg. The delta between the two was much closer in our highway tests, where the Swift managed 31.38km/kg, and the Altroz returned 29.65km/kg. Notably, neither gets an automatic engine stop-start function to save fuel while idling or has any drive mode to maximise efficiency. The Altroz has the larger CNG tank capacity of 60 litres; the Swift’s is 55 litres. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG handling and ride quality Altroz's ride quality better than Swift at higher speeds  In order to accommodate the added weight of their respective CNG tanks, both cars feature a stiffer suspension setup than their petrol-only versions. The Altroz continues to exude a sense of toughness, and its ride quality, whether at low or high speeds, remains comfortable and compliant. Its quick ratio steering lends a sporty handling character, as does its excellent body control. In isolation, the Swift’s suspension does a great job within urban confines, but at highway speeds, you feel sharper movements inside, which are nicely ironed out in the Tata hatchback. Excellent drivability and better efficiency make it the better performer.   Swift's brake pedal feel is better but Altroz's stopping distance is 2m less What’s nice is that the Swift’s steering feels light and easy, and with this new generation, its returnability (unaided return to the original position after a turn) feels very natural. The Swift’s brake pedal, too, feels a tad more natural, while the Altroz’s could come across as a touch too sudden. That said, in our panic braking tests from 80kph, the Altroz stopped 2 metres earlier than the Swift, indicating a stronger stopping power. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG verdict Maruti Swift S-CNG              Rating – 8/10 Tata Altroz iCNG        Rating – 8/10 The Swift, even in its CNG avatar, remains a driver’s delight on account of the feel from behind the wheel. Compared to the Altroz CNG, its performance is stronger, refinement is better, and true to its roots, its efficiency is higher. But while the Swift is an excellent and economical runabout, the CNG iteration’s dearth of luggage space and a missing spare tyre make it impractical, particularly for highway journeys. And that’s where the Altroz steals a march with its twin CNG tanks tucked neatly below the boot floor. Furthermore, the Altroz has a larger cabin and gives you a big-car feel, particularly due to its excellent ride and handling balance. The engine isn’t refined, but the car’s many and significant strengths more than compensate for it. And then, there’s the entry-level pricing, which undercuts the Swift by a substantial margin, and even though the Altroz’s top spec is pricier, it packs in pretty much every feature you’d expect, easily justifying the premium. So, while the Swift S-CNG is buttery smooth and more efficient, the Altroz iCNG comes across as a more rounded package with a broader appeal, which is why it wins this comparison test.

    "description": "Spending an extended period with the Audi Q3 Sportback helped me explore its true character – a car that effortlessly blends luxury, sportiness and everyday usability. The journey has been a delightful one, filled with scenic drives, moments of pure driving pleasure, and a few quirks that add personality to the ownership experience. Whether it’s cruising on smooth highways or taking detours down lesser-known inner roads, the Q3 Sportback has proven to be a capable and stylish companion. For someone like me, who constantly seeks out beautiful and less-travelled roads, the Audi Q3 Sportback feels like the perfect partner. One of my favourite drives has been the route from Mumbai to Nashik. While most travellers stick to the straightforward National Highway 3, I find joy in exploring alternate paths that weave through the serene landscapes of the Sahyadri mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. It’s versatile enough to explore uncharted territory while keeping its occupants comfy. On one such adventure, I veered off NH-3 near Kasara and took a quieter road connecting to the Trimbakeshwar highway. The Audi Q3 Sportback handled the varied terrain with ease, delivering a smooth and composed ride. Whether it was cruising on flat stretches or navigating twists and turns through scenic hills, the Q3 Sportback maintained a perfect balance of comfort and control. I must say I really like the way the Q3 Sportback looks. One of the most striking bits about it is its Turbo Blue exterior, which grabs attention wherever it goes. The sleek, coupé profile, accentuated by aluminium inserts, gives the car a sporty and premium look. Though the sloping roofline does contribute to its striking design, it comes at the cost of rear-seat headroom. Knurled knobs for the air-con and volume control have a tactile feel. The cabin exudes a futuristic vibe thanks to its sharp dashboard design and high-quality materials. One of my favourite elements is the manual air-conditioning controls, with knurled knobs that operate with a satisfying click. It’s a small but thoughtful touch that enhances the tactile experience of the driver’s seat. The 530-litre boot capacity, which matches that of the regular Q3, offers ample storage space. Whether it’s luggage for a weekend getaway or daily errands, the boot has always been sufficient. The rear seat is fairly comfortable; taller passengers might find it a bit cramped in the back, but it’s not a deal-breaker for someone like me, who spends most of the time behind the wheel. Under the hood, the Q3 Sportback is powered by a 2.0-litre TFSI engine that perfectly complements its sporty demeanour. The engine’s versatility is one of its highlights – it’s equally at ease cruising at low speeds as it is revving up to its 6,000rpm redline for a spirited drive. The silky-smooth performance ensures a stress-free drive during long-distance trips, while the engine’s eagerness adds a fun factor when the road opens up. The 2.0 TFSI engine is very refined; it loves to be revved to the redline, especially in manual mode. The suspension setup deserves special mention, too. While it leans slightly more towards comfort, it doesn’t compromise on handling. This dual character makes the Q3 Sportback a pleasure to drive across different types of roads. It absorbs bumps well on uneven stretches while offering stability and confidence when cornering. While my overall experience has been positive, a few minor issues popped up during the long-term stint. One notable instance was when the key fob battery ran low, triggering a warning message on the instrument cluster. Fortunately, replacing the battery was a simple task that only required popping the key open with a screwdriver. Small quirks like these are part and parcel of long-term ownership, but they didn’t detract from the overall enjoyment of driving the Q3 Sportback. The reversing camera is not very sharp and doesn’t offer a 360-degree view. Living with the Audi Q3 Sportback has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience. It’s a car that excels in multiple areas, offering a great mix of luxury, practicality and driving pleasure. Whether it’s the excitement of exploring lesser-known routes or the convenience of urban commuting, the Q3 Sportback handles it all with poise. Its stylish design, comfortable interior and capable engine make it a compelling choice for anyone looking for a premium compact SUV with a sporty edge. As I look back on my time with the Q3 Sportback, I can confidently say it has been a reliable and fun companion. Now that this long-termer has been handed back, Audi has been kind enough to replace it with its bigger sibling, the Q8. More exploration coming soon!

    "description": "Honda Motorcycle \u0026 Scooter India (HMSI) has overtaken Hero MotoCorp Ltd in monthly two-wheeler dispatches to the domestic market, securing the leading position in February. The automaker has closed the gap to Hero MotoCorp, which is at its lowest-ever market share. Hero MotoCorp’s market share dropped to 28.6 percent from 30.2 percent in April-December 2024. Honda’s market share increased to 27.2 percent from 25.2 percent, narrowing the gap. Honda is closing in on the top spot for the largest market share in India. Honda Motorcycles narrows gap with Hero: sales figure The Indian unit of the Japanese auto giant, which recently stated it is on track to capture the largest market share in India, dispatched 3.84 lakh two-wheelers in February, surpassing Hero MotoCorp’s 3.57 lakh units. Prior to February, Honda had already outpaced Hero MotoCorp in monthly domestic sales during July and August of this financial year. While Hero MotoCorp remains the top player in the domestic market for this financial year, Honda has significantly narrowed the gap. Hero MotoCorp’s domestic dispatches from April to February totaled 51.02 lakh units, while Honda followed closely with 49.25 lakh units. The gap between the two now stands at 1.77 lakh units, a significant reduction from 8.90 lakh units in the previous financial year, highlighting Honda’s rapid progress in closing the market share difference. Hero MotoCorp has faced significant pressure this financial year due to weak demand for its core entry-level motorcycle segment. Meanwhile, Honda has reduced the gap, driven by a revival in scooter sales and the increased volumes from models like the Shine 100 and some premium offerings. Hero’s share of the domestic market wholesale volume dropped to 28.6 percent during the April-December period, down from 30.2 percent in the 2024 financial year. In contrast, Honda increased its share to 27.2 percent, up from 25.2 percent during the same period. Recently, Minoru Kato, Head of Motorcycle Business at Honda Motor Company, stated that the Japanese two-wheeler giant is now well within reach of achieving the largest market share in India.

    "description": "Photos: Rosario Liberti Tuberculosis is a heck of a way to start an article about some ice racing history, and an even wilder way for a town to find its purpose, but here we are. Back in 1866, an Englishman named Arthur Edward Vansittart Strettell, while coughing his bloody lungs out, decided St. Moritz might just save his life. The pure alpine air (or luck) worked its magic, and he stuck around long enough for people to notice. Soon, more of Europe’s well-heeled started showing up,not just to breathe better, but to winter in style.   That might have been part of the beginning, but Johannes Badrutt, a Swiss hotelier, turned it into a destination. In 1864, he made a bold wager with his English summer guests: return in winter, and if you don’t love it, I’ll pay for your entire trip. They took the bet, expecting bitter cold and suffering. Instead, they found sunshine bouncing off snow-capped peaks, a winter unlike anything they had known. St. Moritz was no longer just a retreat, it is possibly the birthplace of luxury winter tourism. By the time it hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics, St. Moritz was more than just ski chalets and cocktails. It was home to the Cresta Run, a skeleton track where men in tweed willingly hurled themselves face-first down a mile of ice. Horse racing? On ice. Polo? On ice. It was only a matter of time before we ended up with cars, on ice. If it could be done with risk and elegance, it happened at St. Moritz.  Fast forward to 2019, and The ICE St. Moritz started carrying that same spirit forward. But this time, instead of jockeys or sledders, it’s Ferrari 250 SWBs, Bugatti Type 35s, and Maserati 450Ss sliding across the frozen lake, their reflections blurry and fractal on the ice.  Part concours, part fever dream, spiked tires chew through ice while vintage race cars dance across a surface that was never meant for them. And then there’s the light, snow refracting golden-hour sunlight, exhaust vapor swirling in the cold. It’s a photographer’s paradise, a filmmaker’s storyboard, a dreamscape of speed and style. With a little history behind us, and that light in mind, we’re sharing a gallery of the finest photos from St. Moritz 2025. Enjoy the view.  Continue...",

    "title": "The Perfect Elixir: Lab Eleven",
    "link": "",
    "description": "﻿ \"If a car sits too long, it starts to die.\" That is the ethos at Lab Eleven. No over-polished baubles. No overbuilt tech experiments masquerading as classics. Just 911s built to be used, built to last, and built to keep showing up for its only job, to be driven. The restomod world has a habit of missing the point. Somewhere between the bespoke interiors and the carbon fiber everything, a lot of builders lost track of why people love these cars in the first place. The formula has gotten predictable. Strip a 911 down to its studs, load it up with more power than anyone will ever use, tweak the suspension until it stops feeling a bit bitey, and then call it an improvement. It isn’t. It is just progress for the sake of it, and progress does not always move things forward. Lab Eleven is not interested in better for the sake of automotive performance theater. They are interested in better for the sake of driving. Pino La Rosa and his daughter Milena run their shop in Milan the way you would expect from people who actually care about these cars. Every Lab Eleven build starts with an accident free 993 and gets stripped down. What happens next depends on the car and the owner, but the process is always the same. Make it sharper, stronger, and more usable without killing what makes it a 911. \"We are not here to make a completely different car, we are here to make the best possible version of the car that already exists.\" That means no unnecessary gimmicks. No touchscreens, no pointless tech, no desperate attempts to make an air cooled car feel like something that rolled off a production line yesterday.  \"You should still feel the road, still hear the engine, still know what the car is doing beneath you.\"  The engines are rebuilt in three stages. A 3.6, a 3.8, or a 4.0 liter pushing anywhere from 300 to 400 horsepower. It is more than stock but not excessive, just enough to make the car feel alive. This may turn things into a bit of a handful for the rear engined uninitiated, but never more than one. Some panels are swapped for aluminum or carbon fiber, but only when it improves balance and durability. There are no qualifying laps that reward weight savings, and Colin Chapman is not breathing down your neck as you roll out of your garage. The goal is not to shave grams off a control arm or hub. It is about balance. Inside, they stick to materials that belong, wool fabrics, houndstooth, and leather that looks and feels right. Somewhere along the way, the restomod scene evolved into a competition to build the most expensive cars and coffee accessory. Machines that flick their blinkers a few times before arriving at an asphalt prison, only to be tucked back into a temperature controlled garage, polished with an overpriced orbital, and plugged into a twelve volt battery tender, the automotive equivalent of life support. Lab Eleven builds cars that need to be driven. Lab Eleven cars belong on alpine passes, winding back roads, and long stretches of open road where dirt and rock chips are part of the experience. A Porsche was never meant to be perfect. It was meant to be driven, to wear in, to collect the marks of use that prove it is alive, and when the time comes, you pass it on, imperfections and all.

But it does showcase that the brand remains mindful of its heritage and it’s something we’d be happy to see from other automakers.",
