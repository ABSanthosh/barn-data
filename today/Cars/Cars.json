    "link": "https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1929-ford-model-a-201/",
    "description": "This 1929 Ford Model A is a steel-bodied, five-window coupe that was acquired by the previous owner as an unmodified example and subsequently turned into a hot rod during a multi-year refurbishment that was completed in 2012. Power comes from a 239ci 8BA flathead V8 that has been fitted with Offenhauser heads, dual Stromberg 97 carburetors, an Offenhauser intake manifold, a Mallory dual-point distributor, and Red’s Headers. The steel body features a 3½” roof chop and a ’32-style grille shell and is mounted on a boxed and Z’d frame that is fitted with a ’32-style K-member, an F1 steering box, a drop front axle, hydraulic drum brakes, 16″ steel wheels, and “big and little” Firestone tires. Additional details include a Mercury three-speed manual transmission, a ’48 Ford rear end, and a torque tube and axles from a Lincoln. The car has won various awards, including a Rodders Rep Pick at the Goodguys 2012 Fall Del Mar Nationals, and was a Club Pick at the 2013 Grand National Roadster Show. Additionally, the car was featured in the GoodGuys Gazette in July 2013, the French publication American Muscle Car Magazine in December 2013, and Street Rodder Magazine in April 2014. This Ford hot rod was acquired by the seller in 2017 and previously offered on BaT in April 2024, and it is now offered again at no reserve with a California title in the seller’s name.",

    "description": "Longer travel suspension, lower weight and more features – these three things were evident on spied test bikes ages ago, and they all promised that the new Bear 650 had the potential to be RE’s finest twin yet. Now that we’ve finally ridden the bike in India, we can confirm if that’s how things have panned out.  Royal Enfield Bear 650: Weight and dimensions   While it actually weighs just 2 kilos less than the Interceptor (216kg vs 218kg), the Bear feels more manageable as soon as you ride it out of the showroom. That’s thanks to the single exhaust pipe that hugs the motorcycle more closely than the wide dual pipes on the rest of the 650s, which need more careful management in heavy traffic. Beyond that, the Bear also manages to feel a little more agile and lighter on its feet.  Chassis-wise, it’s based on the Interceptor platform but with a strengthened headstock and a new rear subframe. Wheel sizes have gone from 18-inch at both ends to a 19/17 setup, and there’s now more suspension travel as well – climbing from 110mm/88mm to 130mm/115mm at the front and rear, respectively. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Ergonomics The riding position is not what I’d have expected, given that this is meant to be a scrambler. The footpeg placement is quite nice – a little lower and more forward set than the Interceptor. The new seat is much more comfortable than the Interceptor’s. However, the new wide handlebar puts the rider in a slightly forward-leaning position. It’s not uncomfortable by any means, but it’s definitely more roadster than scrambler. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Performance With the move to a two-into-one exhaust, RE was able to liberate a bit more torque, but the actual performance gains are higher than the spec sheet would suggest. The parallel engine is now more responsive, acceleration feels stronger, and the accompanying soundtrack is both louder and more exciting. Our test results show a significant improvement over the Interceptor and Continental GT as well, with this being the first RE to dip below the 6-second mark in our 0-100kph tests.  Royal Enfield Bear 650: Ride and handling Handling seems more sure-footed and grown-up-feeling. High-speed stability is much better with none of the mild steering weave you encounter on the INT. Thankfully, the brakes are better, too, with a sharper bite that demands less lever effort. However, the ABS can get triggered quite easily, and you will be very aware of the bike’s weight under heavy braking.  The rear shocks are a bit too firm for a bike like this. It’s a similar story in the corners – as long as you’re mindful of the Bear’s size and weight, you can have quite a lot of fun. There’s good cornering clearance, and the bike holds a line nicely once you get it pointed in the right direction. The new MRF Nylorex tyres do well on smooth, grippy tarmac, but they feel a bit vague and greasy on less-than-perfect surfaces. This is where the Bear 650 finds its main shortcoming. The suspension, particularly at the rear, is too firm for this bike’s own good. It’s not to the point of being an absolute dealbreaker, but you feel every imperfection on the road, and if you are looking forward to a plush and comfy bike, this is not it.  That said, it’s still fun if you throw some light off-roading at the bike, with decent ground clearance and plenty of torque to spin up the rear. You can also deactivate the rear ABS, but the overall weight and the front fork’s tendency to bottom out on big landings mean you shouldn’t take it too seriously. Royal Enfield Bear 650: Verdict The Bear 650 is equipped with the TFT display from the Himalayan 450, but you don’t have the choice of spoked wheels that support tubeless tyres. With prices ranging between Rs 3.39 lakh and Rs 3.59 lakh ex-showroom, depending on which of the five colours you pick, I think the value proposition is fair. It is about 40k more than the Interceptor but also more capable and better equipped. Most of all, I believe that this is the best 650 yet, but that suspension setup restricts the Bear to the point of being a good motorcycle – which is a pity because it had the potential to be a great one.

    "description": "Our market is no stranger to the long-running Toyota Camry as the sixth-gen model was introduced way back in 2002. From the seventh-gen (2013) onwards, the luxury sedan was locally assembled at the brand’s plant in Bidadi, Karnataka. The Camry we're driving today is in its ninth-gen avatar, and it has seen many of its competitors fall by the wayside; Hyundai’s Sonata and Honda’s Accord are no longer on sale, and the Skoda Superb is quite a bit more expensive as it's a CBU. While the Camry is Toyota’s sole sedan on sale in India, the Japanese brand considers it one of its flagship offerings. The sedan has not only been on sale here for 22 years but it's also Toyota’s longest running nameplate in India. In essence, this new Camry, which arrives with an edgier design, more tech – from infotainment to ADAS – and a more powerful, yet more frugal hybrid powertrain, has the segment to itself. Toyota Camry 2025 design and chassis Cues from upmarket Lexus models seen on the new Camry. Despite being a new-gen model, it shares the same TNGA-K underpinnings and suspension setup as its predecessor, although Toyota claims there are improvements in almost every area. The design is definitely all-new though – it sports the Japanese brand’s new ‘Hammerhead’ styling, which gives the sedan a more pointed nose that's accentuated by the slim LED headlights and Daytime Running Lamps. The bonnet gets more prominent creases, flows sharply down, and has the Toyota logo (sans the blue highlights seen on the previous model) just below the point where the bonnet opens. The front bumper’s angular air dam and its diamond pattern are reminiscent of premium Lexus cars. A new prominent shoulder line runs from bonnet to boot, the star-like 18-inch machine-finish alloy wheels add to the stance, and the rear features new C-shaped LED tail-lights. Overall, the new Camry’s design is more aggressive than the outgoing model. Low-profile 235/45 section tyres don't hamper ride quality. What makes the new Camry look even sportier, is the Sprint Edition, which Toyota offers as a dealer-level fitment, but hasn't quoted an official price for. The Camry Sprint comes with contrasting black elements replacing the chrome ones, and a black roof.  Toyota Camry 2025 interior   Tan leatherette upholstery and the new dash layout make the new Camry feel more premium. Step into the new Camry’s cabin and the tan and grey dual-tone theme along with the silver highlights make the interior feel a little more premium and cheerful compared to the outgoing model’s black and light beige theme. The steering wheel and slatted dash design are new and while the latter’s piano black finish does look upmarket, it’ll be a dust magnet and pick up fingerprints easily. The central AC vents have now moved below the smart-looking (and very accessible) climate control buttons, which themselves sit below the new 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen. A wireless charging pad and two USB-C ports are positioned right in front of the gear knob. A highlight of the previous Camry was its comfortable seats, and the new model retains the well-bolstered units. The front seats get 10-way power adjust helping you find the right driving position and the ventilation function keep one's back and bottom cool. Rear passengers will have no complaints about the headroom, legroom or shoulder room. You get powered reclining seats, which is unique at this price point, and controls for the three-zone climate control via a screen in the rear armrest. However, the rear bench is best for two as the armrest takes up space even when folded away, as do the rear AC vents and USB-C charging ports. Rear seat space is excellent for two and the reclining seats are well-bolstered.   Toyota Camry 2025 features and ADAS It gets a boss mode that allows anyone to adjust the front passenger seat, a 9-speaker JBL system and a single-pane sunroof instead of a panoramic one. The new infotainment system is slicker to use than the outgoing model’s 9-inch unit and the clarity is much better; in fact, the screen’s resolution is so good it makes the 360-degree camera's display seem slightly grainy. While the unit supports wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto is wired only. Toyota has also added a connected car suite that allows one to remotely start the Camry, access seat ventilation functions, and open and close the boot, among other safety features. 360-degree camera's resolution not as good as the touchscreen's. One big addition to the new Camry is an ADAS suite, which Toyota calls Safety Sense 3.0. The system features a forward collision avoidance function with pedestrian detection, adaptive and standard cruise control, lane-keep assist, a road-sign read-out and an automatic high beam function. On Bengaluru’s well-marked highways, the lane-keep assist worked unobtrusively to ensure the Camry kept to its lane, while the autonomous braking system provided ample warning before it started kicking in progressively. Like its predecessor, the new Camry gets nine airbags and rear parking sensors; the front parking sensors are new. Toyota Camry 2025 performance and mileage Toyota claims the upgraded hybrid powertrain not only produces more power but is also more frugal than the outgoing Camry. The 2.5-litre four-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine now makes 187hp, 9hp more, at 6,000rpm, but the torque figure is the same 221Nm. When paired with a 136hp, 208Nm electric motor, its total output is 230hp; 12hp more than its predecessor. Toyota claims a 0-100kph time of 7.2 seconds, which is acceptable for this class. Hybrid system's combined output has increased by 12hp. That extra power isn’t easily noticeable when driving the new Camry, and in any case, this is a sedan enjoyed best at seven-tenths of its full potential. A sedate driving style really makes the hybrid system’s seamlessness in switching from the electric motor to the petrol engine shine through. When driven in this manner, especially in Eco mode, the new Camry also seems to run on battery power for longer and switches to it more frequently – even on the highway. Speaking of drive modes, Eco prioritises using the battery, while the engine kicks in earlier in Normal and Sport for marginally better performance at the cost of efficiency. While the 10-step eCVT’s simulated gears give the driver a greater degree of control, the rubber band effect can be felt if pushed hard. Toyota has improved on the sound-deadening as well and refinement is good in general, though the engine starts to sound buzzy at higher revs. EV-like instant torque ensures adequate pulling power while overtaking. It should be noted that how one drives greatly affects the Camry’s fuel-efficiency figure. In the few hours we spent with it, which included more highway than urban driving, the Camry delivered almost 20kpl, which is impressive for a 1.6-tonne car. Toyota Camry 2025 ride and handling As before, a highlight of the Camry is its supple ride quality, which, surprisingly, isn’t hampered by the low-profile 235/45 R18 tyres. Toyota claims an unladen ground clearance of 145mm, and this is enough to clamber over large speed breakers without scraping its underbelly. Whether at speed or at a crawl, the Camry makes light work of road undulations and only the really rough stuff filters into the cabin. 145mm of ground clearance is adequate and it doesn't scrape over large speed breakers. Compared to the outgoing model, body roll is better contained and the stiff chassis, along with the decently feelsome steering, provide confidence on a winding section. For a car that’s over 4.9-metres long, the 11.4m turning circle isn’t too bad, and the Camry is nearly as easy to drive in tight spaces as it is on an open road. Toyota Camry 2025 price and verdict With the ninth-gen Camry, Toyota has certainly improved on a proven formula. It looks edgier, and it’s nicer to be in. While it may not be for those looking for an enthusiastic drive experience, it is also marginally better to drive than before, not to mention more frugal. That it’s also far better equipped than its predecessor for not much of a premium (just Rs 1.83 lakh) makes the new Camry’s case even stronger. Considering its price tag now overlaps with the likes of the Audi A4, the new Camry should be considered as a more frugal alternative to those German luxury sedans.

It’s light, makes great power, sounds awesome, and seems generally great to live with. Heck, even the Street Triple’s most divisive feature—its distinctive dual headlight design—has grown on us over the years. Not everyone is a fan of the styling though; you either love the Street Triple’s bug eyes, or you don’t. Junichi Nomura falls into the latter camp. After buying a stock standard 2010 Street Triple 675 from a friend, he spent a year giving the perky triple a facelift. “I’m not a professional bike builder,” Nomura-san admits. “I’m just a Japanese guy who likes to modify bikes in my garage at home.”…",

But finding the right engine, frame, and running gear for a custom chopper is only half the struggle. You need to know exactly which parts to pick—and you need to know how to combine them to create a cohesive machine. Martin Becker at MB Cycles excels at this. The German custom bike builder is a matchmaker of sorts, combining bits from wildly different sources to create jaw-dropping V-twin performance choppers. He’s a master of stance, proportions, and details, and knows how to make modern and vintage details harmonize.

Additional ‘Sport’ lettering and a decal reading ‘ZC33S powered by Suzuki’ are positioned near the gear lever. The car retains the regular Swift Sport’s bucket seats, aluminium-finished pedals, and red stitching on the steering wheel and upholstery.  Customers who want their Swift Sport ZC33S Final Edition to look more unique can opt for optional aero accessories that include more decals, light garnishes, and other add-ons to enhance the car’s visual appeal. Swift Sport Final Edition gets no mechanical changes The ZC33S Final Edition is identical to the regular Swift Sport in terms of mechanicals. It comes with the same 1.4-litre turbo petrol engine, producing 138hp and 230Nm of torque. It gets a front-wheel-drive (FWD) layout and offers a choice of a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox. This powertrain in the Japanese-spec car does not get any electrification, while the Swift Sport sold in Europe has had mild-hybrid technology since 2020 due to stricter emission norms. Production of the Swift Sport ZC33S Final Edition will begin in March 2025 and continue until November 2025. Swift Sport India launch details Maruti has shown the Swift Sport in India many times at various events. However, it has not gone on sale in India throughout its history. The standard Swift and its sedan sibling, the Dzire, entered their respective new generations in India this year.

    "description": "Mahindra-owned design house Pininfarina is celebrating its 95th anniversary this year. To commemorate this milestone, the brand has released a mildly restyled logo highlighting the brand’s legacy. Apart from designing many iconic cars, the brand introduced the Battista electric hypercar in 2019. Mahindra acquired Pininfarina in 2019 Pininfarina has also built a 1900hp Battista hypercar Pininfarina anniversary celebrations to be held in many cities The new logo is essentially a contemporary graphical evolution featuring the crowned 'f,' a symbol of the company since the 1930s, which has received a minor nip and tuck. Alongside it is the italicized 'Pininfarina' logotype, introduced in 1961 when a presidential decree merged the founder’s nickname, ‘Pinin,’ with the family name ‘Farina,’ creating a new surname and company name. Throughout 2025, the logotype will be accompanied by the number ‘95’ in the same red as the crown. This new logo will be used in all brand communications and events, including those in Italy (Milan and Turin, historic hubs of Italian design), France, Germany, and China. There will also be commemorative events at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance and initiatives organised by Pininfarina of America, based in Miami, New York as well as in the Middle East, where significant architectural collaborations are ongoing. There will also be design competitions for students from all over the world who specialise in mobility design and architecture. Pininfarina vice chairman and CEO Silvio Angori said, “In 2025, we will celebrate an extraordinary milestone that reflects the strength of our history and the power of our vision. This achievement was made possible thanks to all our clients, who have stood by us over the years and will remain at the heart of our 95th-anniversary events. We look forward to 2025 with optimism and determination, ready to embrace future challenges and continue innovating.” Mahindra acquired the Pininfarina brand in 2019 and the Pininfarina Battista electric hypercar made its debut in the same year. The hypercar made its India debut at the Hyderabad Formula E race in February 2023. A few days later, the Battista set a new Indian top speed record of 358.03kph with editor Hormazd Sorabjee behind the wheel.  Also See: Honda-Nissan merger could be in the works Hyundai partners with Google for Android OS infotainment system",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/breaking-volkswagen-cut-35000-jobs-2030",
    "description": "German car maker says decision is part of comprehensive restructuring plan to save up to €4 billion Volkswagen will cut 35,000 jobs over the next five years as part of a comprehensive restructuring plan to save up to €4 billion (£3.4 billion). The decision was announced this evening after the car maker finalised an agreement with its works council. The manufacturer said the plan is designed to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and secure a competitive financial footing as it pivots to electric vehicles.  The majority of the reduction will be implemented through voluntary measures, including early retirement and severance packages, in an effort to minimise social disruption, says the German car maker. VW has approximately 120,000 employees in Germany, about half of whom work at the main plant in Wolfsburg. The restructuring will also prioritise optimising production efficiency and reallocating resources towards Volkswagen’s electric vehicle strategy in a move aimed at reducing the overall capacity in its German manufacturing network by 700,000 vehicles annually. Volkswagen confirms the historic former Karmann factory in Osnabrück, which dates back to 1901 and was acquired by Volkswagen in 2009, and the Transparent Factory in Dresden, originally opened in 2002 to produce the now-discontinued Phaeton, will remain in operation, but they are planned to be repurposed in a bid to slash costs. According to reports by Wards Auto, Osnabrück will remain open until 2026 to fulfil a contract to produce the existing T-Roc Cabriolet. It is claimed there are plans for a defence company to step in and preserve as many jobs at the plant as possible. The Dresden site, where ID 3 models are currently manufactured, has been earmarked to cease vehicle production. In the future, it is expected to house a yet-to-be-confirmed Volkswagen-run technical operation. The announcement of the restructuring follows weeks of intense negotiations between Volkswagen management and worker representatives. The talks were prompted by Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume’s earlier calls for dramatic measures to cut labour costs, citing Germany's high wages as a barrier to competing with key rivals. Blume had controversially proposed a 20 per cent wage reduction and warned that factory closures were essential for Volkswagen's long-term competitiveness. The potential closure of the Osnabrück and Dresden facilities has drawn sharp criticism in Germany, sparking debates in the German parliament. While Volkswagen management had also pushed for the closure of a third plant, both its Zwickau and Emden facilities have been spared in the cost-cutting measures. Volkswagen’s restructuring underscores the delicate balancing act it faces: maintaining production of traditional best-sellers like the Golf, Tiguan and Passat, while ramping up output of newer electric offerings, including the ID 3, ID 4 and ID 7. The agreement represents a crucial step towards securing greater profit margins amid growing competition from Chinese automakers such as BYD, Chery, and Geely. Volkswagen's supervisory board approved the agreement in a special session on Friday, signalling strong support for the restructuring. Meanwhile, the works council, a powerful force in Volkswagen’s corporate governance, succeeded in securing measures to cushion the impact on affected workers, including a job security clause through to 2030, but has agreed to waive wage increases until 2030.",

    "description": "Hybrids combine the convenience of fossil fuel with the appeal of zero-emissions running. Which do we recommend? The best hybrid cars deftly combine green emission ratings with low running costs, as well as the ability to fill up in mere moments from a pump. Appealing to private buyers and company car owners alike, the commercial success of hybrids has been quite a thing to witness over the past couple of decades. Hybrids are popular for several reasons. They can save you money at the petrol pump, and even significantly drive down how much benefit-in-kind (BIK) company car tax you pay. That's because hybrids boast lower emissions ratings, while others provide a useful electric-only range that helps make most of your daily motoring emissions-free. But which are the best you can buy? We've complied a list of our most highly rated hybrids and plug-in hybrids on sale in the UK today, and the venerable Toyota Corolla tops our list.",
