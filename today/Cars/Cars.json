    "description": "This 1961 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster is one of 1,858 roadsters built during a six-year production run and is among 250 examples manufactured in 1961. Chassis 002753 is said to have been purchased out of New Orleans in 1981 by an owner who commissioned a refurbishment before utilizing the car in Gull Wing Group events during the course of his 35-year stewardship. The car was purchased by its current owner 10 years ago and subsequently underwent further refurbishment work that included a repaint in Fire Engine Red, a re-trim of the interior in Palomino leather, and overhauls of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six and four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include Bosch mechanical fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, servo-assisted four-wheel drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a low-pivot rear axle equipped with a 3.89:1 ratio, chrome 15” steel wheels, a body-color hardtop, a tan soft top, and a Becker Mexico radio. This W198 roadster is now offered by the seller in California on behalf of the owner with invoices from the last 15 years and a clean Arizona title.",

    "link": "https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1969-ford-mustang-212/",
    "description": "This 1969 Ford Mustang was originally built as a 302-powered SportsRoof, and it was modified as a custom commission for MLB pitcher Jack Morris at a claimed cost of over $400k. The customized body is mounted on a chromoly frame with an integrated roll cage, and it has a Heidts independent front end and a four-link rear end with a Panhard bar as well as coilovers all around. The car rides on staggered modular BBS wheels and has four-wheel disc brakes, and power is from a Roush-built Ford V8 with a Dart aluminum block, Wiseco pistons, Eagle connecting rods, AFR 225 heads, and a Holley carburetor. Claimed to produce over 600 horsepower, it is linked to a six-speed manual transmission and a Ford 9\" rear end with an Eaton Truetrac differential and 4.11 gears. Inside are bucket seats, harnesses, custom upholstery, air conditioning, and a Hurst shifter. Following completion of the build, the car was a finalist in the Goodguys Muscle Machine of the Year selection for 2012. Acquired in 2020 by its current owner, a retail Arizona dealer, this modified Mustang is now offered on their behalf with build documents and a clean Arizona title.",

    "description": "You’re unlikely to see a Kymco KTR 150 on the street outside of Taiwan, where it’s built and predominantly sold. But this humble single-cylinder commuter is quickly gaining fame, thanks to a growing contingent of Taiwanese workshops choosing it for their custom builds. It’s easy to see why. The KTR is readily available and affordable, and its utilitarian nature makes it a versatile platform for customization. In the hands of experienced outfits like 2LOUD Custom, it sings. The Taipei-based workshop has been churning out custom bikes at a rapid rate lately. This svelte Kymco KTR 150 scrambler is their latest project, and it’s as much a champion of the KTR’s popularity as it is a showcase for 2LOUD’s skills. According to shop boss Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng, the goal was to build a carefree street bike with vintage motocross styling.…",

    "description": "It’s not often that a long-termer is this hard to let go of. But the Hyundai Ioniq 5 isn’t just any car – it’s one of those rare machines that leaves a lasting impression. It was our 2024 Autocar Car of the Year, and over the six months I’ve had it, it’s reaffirmed exactly why. At a glance, it’s the design that turns heads. The pixelated lights, origami-like lines and retro-futuristic vibe make it look like it’s straight out of Blade Runner. But what truly won me over was the cabin. Step inside, and it’s like entering a concept car that actually made it to production. Absence of transmission tunnel frees up space in front. The flat floor afforded by the dedicated E-GMP skateboard platform opens up a generous sense of space, made even airier by a minimalist, lounge-like design. Clever packaging abounds – the central console isn’t fixed; it slides fore and aft, and that’s more than just a party trick. On one occasion, boxed in by another car on the driver’s side, I was able to slide across from the passenger side into the driver’s seat – try doing that in a conventional SUV! Hard buttons and touchscreen offer easy access to all functions. There’s a calming clarity to the way the cabin has been thought out. After spending time in some of the newer Indian EVs, where ergonomics feel like an afterthought, the Ioniq’s layout – with physical buttons where you want them and a crisp, easy-to-read touchscreen – is refreshingly intuitive. The graphics are elegant, the menus aren’t buried in complexity, and everything just works perfectly. Out on the road, the Ioniq 5 is every bit as polished as it looks. The ride quality is simply superb. Whether gliding over rutted urban roads or cruising the highway, it isolates you from the worst of our infrastructure. And yet, there’s no float. Body control is tight, the handling tidy, and it doesn’t wallow like some of the plusher EVs - in fact, I’ll stick my neck out and say the ride is better sorted than many of Mercedes’ electric SUVs, which tend to pitch and bounce more. Performance is brisk, too. The 217hp motor and instant torque mean overtakes are despatched with a flex of your right foot. But it’s not just fast – it’s smart about how it deploys that power. The regenerative braking is among the best-tuned I’ve experienced, with multiple levels and a one-pedal mode that feels natural and progressive. Crucially, the handover between regen and friction braking is seamless, with beautifully linear pedal feel – a benchmark that shows the difference between mature engineering and feature overload. Fantastic range makes Mumbai to Mahabaleshwar easy despite steep 40km climb up the Ambenali Ghat, which sucked 119km of range. Then there’s the range. Real-world usability, not brochure figures, is what matters. As with all long-termers in our fleet, the Ioniq 5 was put through the Mahabaleshwar test – a 230km drive with a 1,200m elevation gain. I started with a full charge and a range readout of nearly 400km. By the time I got to Poladpur 180km later, I still had 225km of range left and an SOC of 56 percent. Confident in the reserves, I drove up the Poladpur Ghat in range-sapping Sport mode. The steep 40km climb cost me 119km of range and a 27 percent hit in charge, but I arrived with 29 percent left – good for over 100km. That level of predictability and honesty in the range meter is rare and reassuring. Charging from a 15A plug is slow; it took 19 hours to top up the battery from 29 percent SOC. Charging, of course, depends on where you are. In Mahabaleshwar, with only a 15A plug and a 3kW charge rate, it took nearly 19 hours to juice up. But since it’s a place I go to hibernate, I didn’t flinch. On long weekends, the Ioniq 5 proved to be the perfect companion: enough boot space, excellent comfort, and the range to go the distance without anxiety. Long wheelbase and width make Ioniq 5 tricky in tight spaces. In the city, its width can be a bit of a handful in tight lanes, and the massive 3,000mm wheelbase and no rear-wheel steer mean low-speed manoeuvrability is tricky. Also, those pristine white seats – plush as they are – are hard to keep clean. And a minor niggle: the storage shelf below the central console is unlit, making it a black hole at night. But these are small compromises in what’s otherwise an incredibly well-rounded package. Light-coloured seats get stained easily and are hard to maintain. More than anything, the Ioniq 5 is a statement – not just of style or tech, but of Hyundai’s coming of age. Two decades ago, it would’ve been unthinkable to use Hyundai and “world-beating” in the same sentence. Today, it’s a reality. The Ioniq 5 is proof that the company now belongs on the global EV main stage. It’s not just a good Hyundai – it’s a damn good car, period. And one I’ll miss dearly.

    "description": "Hero has had its sights set on younger scooter buyers for some time, and the Xoom line-up plays directly into that ambition. The new Xoom 125 offers more performance, better hardware and a more mature design than the Xoom 110. Armed with its competitive price and swanky design, is the Xoom 125 ready to take on the best in the segment? Well, here’s what we discovered. Hero Xoom 125 design and quality (8/10) It is well-equipped for the price with upmarket looks, though practicality has its limits.  The first thing that grabbed my attention was the sharper, more grown-up design. Compared to the quirky Xoom 110, this scooter feels more polished and upmarket. The 14-inch diamond-cut alloys are quite eye-catching and give it a good stance. This top-end ZX variant commands a premium of Rs 6,000 and brings a host of extra features. Key specificationsHero Xoom 125Kerb weight121kgSeat height777mmGround clearance164mmFuel tank capacity5 litresWheelbase1327mm These include two additional colour options (taking the total to four), machined alloy wheels, sequential LED indicators, a boot light, an illuminated start button, turn-by-turn navigation, an extra front storage pocket with a tethered USB charger and a boot lamp. Two fairly large cubbies that host a USB charger and can accommodate some knick-knacks. The Inferno Red paint pops nicely in daylight. However, the overall paint and plastic quality is about average, the switchgear feels a little basic, and the finish levels aren’t the best in the segment. The new sharper-looking headlamp performs quite well and will be a good companion for night commutes. That said, I’m not a huge fan of the rear design, and while the new tail-light does look sleek, it’s not nearly as unique or recognisable as the ‘X’ shaped tail-light found on the Xoom 110. This new design has also left some empty space, and the rear just ends up looking rather blank. The Xoom 125’s simple and easy-to-read LCD display does the job but with no extra flash or flair baked in. The LCD is basic and easy to read, with two buttons to help you toggle through. The USB charging port is covered with a rubber cap that appears to be reasonably weather-resistant and is tucked into the front cubby. Practicality, however, is a mixed bag. While there’s enough underseat storage for groceries and small items, it can only accommodate a half-face helmet. But the added storage at the front somewhat makes up for it, depending largely on what you’d be carrying. 17 litres of underseat storage is on the low side and won’t hold a full-sized helmet; a half-face helmet will fit. The cubby is large enough to hold small water bottles and other small items. In case you’re wondering, both cubbies have drain holes at the bottom, so they should be fairly easy to clean and rinse. The external fuel filler is a practical touch, and Hero has even added a buzzer reminder in case you forget to shut it. Overall, it’s a design that should appeal strongly to younger buyers without feeling over the top. Hero Xoom 125 riding position and comfort (7/10) The seat shape leaves both tall and short riders with some compromise. The Xoom 125 keeps the riding triangle friendly for everyday use, but it’s not what you’d call spacious. While the 777mm seat height is accessible on paper, the wide shape makes it a little tricky for riders shorter than 5’7” to be able to flat-foot. At the other end, at 6 feet tall, I found that the contour of the seat forces you to sit quite forward, which is awkward. While this seat is well-cushioned, its shape leaves both tall and short riders with a bit of compromise. There is still space for a tall rider’s knees, but the rider’s seat restricts room to move back, and you’ll start to feel cramped within half an hour. Despite having a well-cushioned seat, these factors make the ergonomics a slight compromise for both tall and short riders. Pillion space is decent and well-cushioned for short spins. Hero Xoom 125 performance and efficiency (8/10) Its peppy, low-end response makes it fun in the city. The Xoom shares its 124.6cc engine with the Destini 125, but it produces a marginal 0.79hp more. It feels eager and responsive off the line and has a good surge from standstill up to mid-range, making it enjoyable while cutting through dense city traffic. EngineHero Xoom 125Engine124.6cc, single-cyl, air-cooledPower9.9hp at 7250rpmTorque10.4Nm at 6000rpm In fact, performance is up there with the competition. In our tests, it managed 0-60kph in 7.56 seconds and 0-80kph in 15.39 seconds, on par with the company’s claims. That’s faster than Hero’s own Destini 125, despite the Xoom 125 weighing 6kg more and having larger 14-inch wheels.  PerformanceHero Xoom 125Acceleration0-60kph7.56s0-80kph15.39sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.49s30-70kph9.4s50-80kph11.34sBraking60-0kph (in meters)18.39m Engine refinement is another strong point, and the motor stays smooth and buzz-free even at 60-70kph and only just starts to feel a bit busy closer to 90kph. In everyday use, it offers a nice mix of pep and poise. I would have liked a nicer exhaust note to go with its sporty nature, but instead, you’re left with a rather ordinary, typical scooter drone. Despite being peppy, the Xoom 125 is quite frugal in daily use, and its city figure of 56.7kpl is aided by a start-stop system that works decently well but is not class-leadingly responsive. With a highway figure of 55.7kpl, the Xoom returns an average of 56.2kpl. A 5-litre fuel tank translates to a real-world range of a little over 250km, which is more than enough for weekly commuting duties. Hero Xoom 125 ride comfort and handling (8/10) The Xoom 125 feels agile and confident, but the braking feel could be better. One of the standout traits of the Xoom 125 is how light and flickable it feels in traffic and around corners. Despite the 14-inch wheels, it doesn’t feel cumbersome at low speeds, and their larger size only adds to its stability. The chassis feels composed and nimble, whether you’re filtering through tight spaces or taking a corner a little quicker than usual. UnderpinningsHero Xoom 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic/monoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc/DrumTyres (F/R)110/80-R14 / 120/70-R14 In fact, even with a pillion on, the ride quality remains balanced and composed. The MRF Zapper tyres also offer solid grip in both dry and wet conditions. That said, braking performance leaves something to be desired, and while the actual stopping power is adequate, the levers feel hard and offer almost no feel, which isn’t what one would expect from a sporty scooter. The ZX variant’s 14-inch wheels are machine finished and add a touch of flamboyance. As for the ride, the suspension setup is quite well-balanced and slightly on the firmer side. That said, larger potholes and broken patches will filter through. On corners, though, it feels composed, eager and confident. It is evident that the suspension favours agility over outright plushness but still manages to find a commendable balance between the two. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict (8/10) Not the fastest or the most practical, but it’s a stylish and capable scooter that has plenty of appeal. The ZX variant offers great additional value and equipment. At Rs 93,000, the Xoom 125 ZX finds itself priced close to the Suzuki Avenis 125 and below the TVS NTorq 125, which are its most direct rivals in terms of positioning, performance and features. The Xoom leans more toward a youthful, design-first approach, and if you’re a college student or young office-goer looking for something sharp, fun and frugal, it makes a strong case. But if comfort, space, and a premium feel matter more to you – or if you’re a taller rider – this may not be the scooter for you.

    "description": "Even in isolation, you’d be able to appreciate the niceties of the Ather Rizta, but having just come from my stiffly sprung Aerox, the effect was even more pronounced. This simple, no-nonsense e-scooter has been my daily commuter ever since Dinshaw and I swapped rides a couple of months ago, and for the most part, it has been a superbly pleasant experience. The performance is smooth, the ride is excellent, and it’s a very slick experience overall. Despite this being the smaller 2.9kWh variant and me not having a home charging facility, the range has never been an issue. My daily commute is only a 10km round trip, and the 105km true range figure can comfortably get me through a week of commuting with enough to spare for detours and spontaneity. A once-a-week top-up at the office has been enough to keep the scooter juiced up, but charging rates could stand to improve – 0 to 80 percent takes upwards of 6 hours on this 2.9kWh variant, which gets a slow 350-watt charger. The MagicTwist regen works well and is useful in city traffic. As for the actual riding experience, it’s exactly what you’d want from a city-centric e-scooter. The throttle response is well calibrated and feels natural, but what I’ve found especially useful is the MagicTwist regen that allows you to stay off the friction brakes extensively. It’s well-measured and powerful enough to slow down for speed breakers and signals, resulting in an almost single-pedal-like experience seen in some electric cars – I only use the friction brakes 5-10 percent of the time on my commute and during emergency situations. Add to this the absorptive suspension setup and massive seat and boot space, and the end result is a slick and practical overall package. But it’s not totally free from issues. Massive boot gobbles up vast amounts of luggage with ease. The smaller issues are that the seating position is a bit knees-up and the self-cancelling indicators are quite hit-and-miss, but the bigger issue is the system glitches we’ve faced. On multiple occasions, the scooter has unexpectedly entered a limp mode, the display and headlight have cycled off and on while riding, the joystick and display have become unresponsive, and on one occasion, it just went completely dead while in motion. The scooter has faced fairly major electronic bugs and glitches. Every time, a simple key-off-and-on cycle has rectified this, but these bugs can become a major safety concern if they happen, for instance, while overtaking. These issues have persisted for some time, and we reached out to Ather regarding them, in reaction to which they took the scooter back and replaced the wiring harness to rectify the issue. However, the issues have continued even after the replacement, so a fix hasn’t yet been found. Seating position moderately knees-up; so not the most comfortable. This has put a black spot on what is otherwise a very satisfying, enjoyable and well-sorted experience. We have once again returned the scooter to Ather who is trying to find a lasting solution, so watch this space for future updates.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz has unveiled the third generation of the CLA Shooting Brake, making it the very first all-electric estate from the German luxury carmaker. Aside from the paradigm shift in the powertrain department, the new CLA Shooting Brake is larger than its predecessor in every way, and packs in a lot more tech too. 2025 CLA Shooting Brake gets connected headlights and tail-lamps, backlit grille cover Cabin is more spacious than CLA sedan; gets triple screens and huge panoramic glass roof 85kWh battery is standard; up to 354hp and 761km of claimed range 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake exterior design Outsizes previous-gen model. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake measures 4,723mm in length, 1,855mm in width, and 1,469mm in height – 35mm longer, 25mm wider, and 27mm taller than the outgoing model. Its 2,790mm wheelbase is also up 61mm over the previous CLA Shooting Brake. Looks identical to CLA sedan up to the B-pillar. Expectedly, the overall design of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake largely mirrors that of the new-gen CLA sedan, which was revealed earlier this year. Up front, there’s a connected LED headlight setup with tri-star DRL signatures, and the grille underneath houses the Mercedes-Benz insignia. Depending on the variant, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake gets either a conventional grille or a closed-off panel with 142 illuminated stars embedded in it. Coming to the side, you get retractable door handles and aero-optimised alloy wheels, and the rounded rear section includes connected LED tail-lamps with tri-star signatures, a roof spoiler with an integrated stop lamp, and a smooth gloss black bumper. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake interior and features Roomier on the inside. Much like the exterior, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake’s cabin layout is virtually identical to its sedan counterpart. However, there's 26mm more headroom for second-row occupants, and the 455-litre boot (expandable up to 1,290 litres) is 50 litres more voluminous. Moreover, larger rear door apertures have made second row access easier. Trio of screens take prominence on dashboard. A triple-screen setup – comprising a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display, a 14-inch central infotainment system, and an optional 14-inch passenger display – spans the width of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake’s dashboard. The passenger screen allows you to stream movies/TV shows and play games, and buyers who don’t opt for it get a panel with illuminated star-pattern graphics. Illuminated and dimmable panoramic glass roof. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake also features a massive panoramic glass roof that extends from the windshield to the rear spoiler. This dimmable unit is made with heat-insulating laminated safety glass with an infrared-reflecting and low-emissivity coating, which prevents the cabin from excessively warming up during the summers and reducing heat loss during the winters. The glass surface is also embedded with 158 illuminated stars, colour-matched with the rest of the ambient lighting. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake battery and range Both variants use an 85kWh NMC battery. Initially, the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake will be sold with electric powertrains only. The entry-level 250+ variant gets an 85kWh nickel-manganese-cobalt battery pack coupled to a single rear-mounted motor, developing 272hp and 335Nm, while the stronger 350 4Matic variants throw in an extra motor on the front axle for four-wheel-drive capability, bumping the output up to 354hp and 515Nm. Up to 761km of range. On a single charge, the 250+ variant of the 2025 CLA Shooting Brake achieves a WLTP-claimed range of 761km and the 350 4Matic variant delivers a range of 730km – 31km and 40km down, respectively, from the equivalent variants of the CLA electric sedan. Thanks to Mercedes-Benz’s 800V architecture, the CLA Shooting Brake can yield a 310km range in just 10 minutes when charging from a 320kW DC source. AC charging can be carried out at up to 22kW. 0-100kph in as little as 5 seconds. In terms of performance, the CLA 250+ Shooting Brake can complete the 0-100kph sprint in a claimed 6.8 seconds, while the dual-motor 350 4Matic variant achieves the same in 5 seconds dead. Both models have a top speed of 210kph. 2025 Mercedes CLA Shooting Brake launch details CLA sedan coming to India. The 2025 CLA Shooting Brake is set to launch in Europe in March 2026. An India launch of the estate is unlikely given that this body style doesn’t really resonate with customers here. However, the CLA sedan is headed here, and is expected to launch by the end of 2025.

    "description": "In its second round of teaser campaigns leading up to the Independence Day event, Mahindra has now given us a new look at the upcoming Vision X concept. Four new Mahindra concept SUVs, along with a new platform vision, will be showcased on August 15, and this one is expected to add to the XUV family. Mahindra Vision X has headlamps mounted on the bumper Could be a traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV Mahindra Vision X new design details The previous Mahindra Vision X teaser gave us a top-angle view of the bonnet, showing some very stylish and athletic lines on it. This one shows us a side-profile view, hinting at a layered design for the fascia, with the headlamps mounted on the bumper. The Vision X also gets wheel-arch cladding and what looks like aero-optimised alloy wheels. We expect this concept to preview a new model in the XUV family. In fact, this could be the long-awaited XEV 7e, which will be a more traditional SUV alternative to the XEV 9e coupe-SUV. The XEV 7e has even been spied on testing on several occasions, with the top hat of an XUV700 and EV-specific updates and interior bits from the XEV 9e. The Vision X certainly seems to have a premium and urban positioning as opposed to the more rugged appeal of the Vision S and Vision SXT that have come before. Not many details are available about the Vision X at the moment. We’ll know more about the SUV once it debuts on August 15 alongside three other concepts. Stay tuned.
