    "description": "The iconic hot hatch took on a harder edge with its eighth generation, at the expense of its intoxicating blend of everyday performance. Can this facelift make it a better GTI? The new Volkswagen Golf GTI is not electric and it’s not a hybrid, not even a mild one.In fact, it seems to carry on in much the same way it has done for nearly 50 years, being a simple but sensible take on the hot hatch that’s received incremental, pointed updates with every new generation and mid-cycle facelift. Viewed logically, this latest GTI should be the best there has yet been.Of course, the ‘new’ Golf GTI isn’t entirely new. The Mk8.5 is the updated version of the Mk8, which arrived in 2021 to hardly universal acclaim. It suffered from the Mk8 Golf’s general cabin tech problems, as well as a suspension tune that was uncharacteristically hardcore for what has always been a more grown-up take on the hot hatch.A face-off with the Toyota Corolla and Peugeot 308 showed that the standard Golf has returned to the top of the class – even if the Corolla won on penalties. Can the GTI manage the same?Join us for an overview of the Mk 8.5 Golf GTI. We've done the full road test with all the numbers on the standard car, but this review also covers our first impressions of the Clubsport and the 321bhp Edition 50.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/light-bites-stiff-drinks-celebrating-50-years-lotus-legend",
    "description": "50 Lotus Esprits were gathered at East Carleton Manor, the former home of Colin Chapman Lotus marked its 50th anniversary with a VIP event and a special display at a fitting venue We think of the Porsche 911 as being the stalwart of the junior supercar world, but after 28 years and more than 10,000 sales, the Lotus Esprit in all its guises was probably the closest contender. And this year marks half a century since it broke cover at the 1975 Paris motor show, where its radical Giorgetto Giugiaro-designed shape was revealed in production form for the first time. Overseen by Colin Chapman and a small team from Hethel, the Esprit went on to be Lotus’s first proper Ferrari challenger. Its four-cylinder engine and initially meagre output were mitigated by a sublime chassis, a sub-900kg kerb weight and bar-raising mid-engined dynamics. So it is only right that Lotus – or rather Classic Team Lotus – has seen fit to celebrate the Esprit’s 50th birthday at its annual Garden Party, held in the manicured gardens of East Carleton Manor, former home of the late Colin and Hazel Chapman and a stone’s throw from Lotus’s HQ. Of all the 50 (of course) Esprits gathered on East Carleton Manor’s lawns, there are just a handful of S1 cars, the purest exponent of the original ‘Silver Car’ concept’s acutely wedge-shaped lines. Giugiaro is seated near one, with his interpreter, and I ask about his relationship with Colin Chapman: was there a language barrier? Giugiaro smiles back and replies: “Drawing was our common language.” Engines fire up behind us, and I turn to see a mouthwatering selection of Colin Chapman’s 1960s single-seat race cars being driven out on to the manor’s front drive. There’s Jim Clark’s Type 18, Type 32B and Type 35, among a few others. Clive Chapman, Colin’s son, has just returned in one of them and I ask him why the Esprit is so important in Lotus folklore. “Dad was always looking forward. He saw what other companies were doing and wanted to raise Lotus’s game,” he replies. “We had gone from the Elan to the Esprit, but this extraordinary car still had (the Elan’s) handling characteristics… so you had your foot in both camps.” Wandering around the gathered Esprits gives you a measure of how Lotus sweated the model for all it was worth with, by my reckoning, 22 derivatives produced during its life – possibly even more. As well as the S1s, all the models from different designers are represented – X180 (Peter Stevens), S4 (Julian Thomson) and last-of-line V8 (Russell Carr) – plus special editions like the black and gold Esprit JPS and blue, red and silver Esprit Essex, both referencing Lotus’s F1 ties. And what do we find in the manor’s swimming pool? Naturally, James Bond’s Esprit sub – aka ‘Wet Nellie’ – from the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me. In fact, it’s what looks to be a half-scale model, with the actual full-sized prop at the poolside, in front of the Turbo Esprit from the 1981 Bond film For Your Eyes Only. As I leave the event, heads are turned towards Giugiaro, who is now sitting in an S1 parked next to Lotus’s 2024 Theory 1 concept car. In 50 years’ time, I only hope that car will prove as influential to Lotus’s future as the Esprit was in 1975.",

He’s had a hand in many of the amazing machines that have graced our pages—and he’s learned a thing or two, judging by this beautifully executed BMW boxer bobber. “I was there with Arjan when he built the Mutant, and most of the other BMWs that put Ironwood on the map,” Sam tells us. “It was an extremely exciting time for me, as you can imagine.

But it’s a lot harder when the bike in question has already been customized, particularly if the existing mods don’t harmonize with your vision. The man behind the HB-Custom name, Holger Breuer, knows this all too well. When this 1978 Kawasaki Z1000 arrived at his workshop in Hussum, Germany, it had already been turned into a streetfighter with a hodgepodge of pricey parts. But it was a far cry from what Holger’s client wanted, both aesthetically and practically. “It came with a 180-wide rear tire, a K\u0026J swingarm, and high handlebars,” he explains. “It had a short rear with a Giuliari seat for one person, and a very loud Marving four-into-one exhaust system.…",

    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO specificationsKylaqXUV 3XOLength (mm)3,9953,990Width (mm)1,7831,821Height (mm)1,6191,647Wheelbase (mm)2,5662,600Boot capacity (litres)360295Ground clearance (mm)189201Tyre size205/55 R17215/55 R17Engine3 cyls, 999cc, turbo-petrol3cyl, 1197cc, turbo-petrolPower115hp at 5000-5500rpm131hp at 5000rpmTorque178Nm at 1750-4000rpm230Nm at 1500-2500rpmGearbox6-speed torque converter auto6-speed torque converter auto Overall, the XUV does appear to be the more substantial of the two, given that it’s the widest and has the longest wheelbase in the segment. The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

Common features include LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, a sunroof, a wireless charger, a digital instrument cluster, a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, leatherette upholstery, auto climate control, six airbags, traction control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Commendably, both the Kylaq and XUV 3XO have a 5-star BNCAP rating. However, they both have features unique to them as well. Kylaq one-ups XUV 3XO with powered and ventilated front seats Ventilated front seats unique to the Kylaq. The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performance and refinement Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performanceAccelerationKylaqXUV 3XO0-20kph (seconds)1.471.370-40kph (seconds)2.972.780-60kph (seconds)5.134.720-80kph (seconds)7.977.610-100kph (seconds)11.6911.050-120kph (seconds)16.0215.7420-80kph (seconds)6.386.3840-100kph (seconds)8.728.11 Now, on to the driving bits. Both SUVs are powered by a 3-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo-petrol engine, but they vary in displacement and output. The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiencyFuel efficiencyKylaqXUV 3XOCity (kpl)8.709.89Highway (kpl)13.3613.01 Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO ride comfort and handling Kylaq corners better, but XUV 3XO feels more stable at high speeds Around the bends, the Kylaq feels more engaging. The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

    "description": "Tata Motors has outlined an aggressive mid-term plan to bridge critical product gaps across its portfolio, particularly in the Rs 10–20 lakh price band and premium SUV segment, with a Rs 33,000–35,000 crore investment over the next five years. The company is lining up 30 new passenger vehicle models, including seven all-new nameplates, to reverse recent sales sluggishness and target an 18–20 percent market share by FY30. The strategy is centred around expanding its presence in under-served segments—urban compact EVs, lifestyle SUVs, midsize family cars and premium electric SUVs—while refreshing its core ICE portfolio. The next phase will see Tata Motors move beyond volume-driven nameplates like Nexon and Punch to a more layered, multi-product strategy targeting specific use cases and customer profiles. Details on upcoming Tata models Two new compact EVs and sub-4m compact SUV inbound Autocar India understands that upcoming Tata models, which include the facelifted Punch (slated for October 2025), the next-gen Nexon - codenamed Garud - scheduled for H2 2026, the next-gen Harrier and Safari (called Taurus and Leo) planned for 2027, two compact EVs internally dubbed 'Kuno' and 'Terra', and a sub-4m lifestyle SUV called the 'Scarlet', will target previously underpenetrated sub-segments. Hybrid Tata SUVs may launch in 2027 Range extender hybrid SUVs (REX/REV) are also being actively studied for a potential launch in 2027–28, say people in the know. An email sent to Tata Motors did not elicit any response. Tata's product ambitions for the coming years 23 model refreshes and facelifts planned alongside growth in nameplates Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director – Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility recently told investors and media that the company will expand the number of nameplates from eight to 15. This includes the Sierra, two Avinya models, two new ICE products, and two new EVs. In addition, it will carry out 23 refreshes and facelifts. The Rs 10–20 lakh range will be a key battleground as Tata addresses a segment where its presence has historically been limited. With new products like the Nexon replacement and the all-new Sierra, the company hopes to gain share against competition from Hyundai, Mahindra, and Toyota. He admitted that model stagnation in the hatchback category had affected the company’s momentum, but said refreshed versions of Tiago and Altroz are already helping recover lost ground. Next-gen Harrier and Safari may leverage new platform that offers AWD With Mahindra marching ahead in SUV segment above Rs 20 lakh market - Tata is mooting a new platform that is likely to spawn an all new Harrier and Safari, which is likely to be bigger, bolder and better. The vehicle length may be increased by 100 mm to 200 mm, and they may sport new silhouttes and be high on tech and connectivity with four-wheel drive capabilities, say people in the know. Tata EV plans 50 percent EV market share is the goal On the EV front, Tata Motors plans to retain its leadership and regain lost share with a target of holding 50 percent share, having seen its market share drop to 35 percent in May 2025. The company is adopting a three-tiered approach: entry-level EVs below Rs 12 lakh offering roughly 200km of range; mid-segment EVs between Rs 12–20 lakh with around 300–350km of range; and premium EVs above Rs 20 lakh capable of traveling over 400km on a single charge. Two differentiated products will be offered in each segment. Chandra explained the strategy as 2-2-2 i.e. offer two offerings in each segment of the market – entry, mid and premium segment. Avinya brand to be comprised of Tata's Gen 3 EVs Tata’s premium EV ambitions will materialize under the Avinya brand, which will house multiple Gen-3 electric vehicles starting in 2027. Built on a new platform, these EVs will offer long range, fast charging, and a software-rich experience. Two concepts have already been showcased and industrialization is underway. Increased investment in digital architectures A significant R\u0026D thrust is also underway in the area of software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Tata is developing centralized computing, OTA updates, and ADAS systems under a new SDV architecture called TiDal. Over 100 engineers are working with Desay SV and group companies like Tata Technologies, Elxsi, and TCS to enable next-gen digital cockpits and connectivity. The Harrier EV, with deliveries expected to begin shortly, and Sierra EV in H2 FY26, are both key to the company’s premium EV strategy. Tata to significantly grow EV charging network To support growing electrification, Tata Motors is investing in charging infrastructure, targeting 4 lakh chargers by 2030, including 500 high-capacity megachargers. It is also working on improving home and workplace charging convenience. At the same time, Tata is developing hybrids for specific performance or competitive needs in premium petrol segments, although EVs remain the strategic core. To ensure financial resilience, Tata Motors has set a target of 10 percent EBITDA across its PV and EV businesses. Network expansion on both sales and service fronts will accompany the product blitz to deliver a seamless ownership experience. With a clear roadmap to bridge gaps, push premiumisation, and embrace digital and electric transformation, Tata Motors is aiming to reposition itself as a full-spectrum player in India’s fast-evolving automotive landscape. Whether this ambitious multi-front investment plan can help the company reclaim market share and challenge established rivals will unfold over the next five years.

    "description": "Among the 7 new nameplates that Tata Motors plans to launch by 2030 is a new compact SUV. Codenamed Scarlet, this sub-four-metre model is said to be a boxy looking SUV, with design cues inspired by the slab-sided and upright Sierra. New Tata compact SUV platform It will be underpinned by a monocoque platform While details on the Tata Scarlet compact SUV are scarce, it is expected to be underpinned by a monocoque chassis that will be compatible with internal combustion and electric powertrains. Whether it will use the Nexon’s 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine, the Curvv’s 125hp, 1.2-litre direct-injection turbo-petrol, the new naturally aspirated 1.5-litre petrol, or have a diesel option is still unknown. The all-electric version may come with motors on the front and rear axles giving buyers an AWD option. Due to cost and packaging constraints, an AWD version of the ICE compact SUV is unlikely. New Tata compact SUV price and rivals New Tata compact SUV price likely to overlap with Nexon With the mini Sierra, Tata is looking to grab a greater share of the compact SUV segment, where it already has the Punch and Nexon. Prices for the Scarlet compact SUV are expected to overlap with the Nexon (Rs 8 lakh-15.6 lakh) and Nexon EV (Rs 12.49 lakh-17.19 lakh), though Tata plans to avoid any cannibalisation of sales as the existing compact SUV and the new one target a different set of buyers. Some sources have referred to the Scarlet as a competitor to the Mahindra Thar and Maruti Jimny, though naturally as a monocoque based SUV, it is unlikely to have the same sort of off-road prowess. Instead, the Tata Scralet will be positioned as a lifestyle SUV, and an alternative to the current crop of crossover-like compact SUVs.   New Tata compact EVs also in the works Besides the Scarlet, Tata Motors also has plans for two more compact all-electric cars. These models – codenamed Kuno and Terra – are likely to be compact EVs. Tata Motors MD, Shailesh Chandra had mentioned before the launch of the Harrier EV that the brand’s strategy is to have two models in every segment: entry, mid-level and high. More details on these models, and the Tata Scarlet compact SUV, will be revealed in due time. Stay tuned.
