    "description": "This 1950 Allard J2 is one of a reported 89 examples produced between August 1949 and 1951. Chassis 1733 was ordered new via Washington D.C.-based dealer Jack Pry with K2-style wing fenders, and it was delivered on September 13, 1950. It was campaigned by its second owner in SCCA events before it was sold to the Battelle Memorial Institute of Columbus, Ohio, in November 1951. The car was subsequently used as an evaluation vehicle for the development of a sports car project that was underwritten by the Murray Corporation of America before it was sold again in November 1953. It spent approximately 20 years stored in an open garage before it was purchased out of Peoria, Illinois, in June 1986 and underwent a multi-year refurbishment that included a conversion to right-hand drive before it won an award in the Limited Production and Special Bodied class at the 2008 Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance. The car is finished in silver gray over red leather upholstery, and power comes from a 342ci Cadillac V8 paired with a Muncie four-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes dual Carter WCD carburetors, Hildebrandt valve covers, a De Dion rear axle, a Halibrand quick-change rear end with a limited-slip differential, finned aluminum drum brakes with inboard rear units, 16” Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels, and a Bluemel's Brooklands steering wheel. This J2 was purchased by the current owner in 1997, and it is now offered on dealer consignment in Saint Louis, Missouri, with spare parts, a S.Co.T supercharger, copies of factory documentation, photographs taken between the 1950s and 1990s, service records, a scale model of the car, and a clean Montana title.",

    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "Ramon penned the interior designs for both the A6 e-tron and Q6 e-tron Interior guru discusses his favourite Audi interiors, Vorsprung durch Technik, and the secrets of great cabin design Welcome to the final of our four-part interview series where we’ve been finding out what Audi’s iconic slogan – Vorsprung durch Technik, or progress through technology – means on a deeper, more personal level to people at the cutting edge of Audi design and engineering.  Here we sit down with Ramon Bäurle, the interior design expert behind the cockpits of the new all-electric Audi A6 e-tron and the Q6 e-tron. Also in the series: Exterior design extraordinaire Frank Lamberty; head of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics Dr. Moni Islam; and lighting designer Christoph Häußinger. Discover the all-electric Audi e-tron range Introduce yourself and what you do…My name is Ramon Bäurle and I'm an interior designer at Audi. There are lots of elements to my job. When coming up with a new concept, we start with a completely blank piece of paper, which is exciting because we are literally coming up with the future of Audi’s cars. We’re constantly working in competition with other designers to make sure Audi selects the very best sketches or designs. What’s your personal interpretation of Vorsprung durch Technik? To me, personally, I would split Vorsprung durch Technik into two pieces. First, Vorsprung, which means being ahead, or leading. But not just leading, you really have to be ahead when you translate it from its German meaning. But this in itself is challenging, because leading is hard to plan, you know? You can try to set it as a goal, and you can motivate yourself to reach this goal and always work hard to fulfill it, but there's no guarantee that you’ll manage it. But for me this in itself is motivation – having a clear goal which you want to achieve, which will basically make you better than everything else. And then the second part, ‘through technology’, is basically what we do at Audi which is to always question whether there is a better solution, a better way of doing things. In the design department we have implemented new technologies in the quest for better results. We transitioned from physical modeling to a more digital process. We also now use virtual reality glasses to evaluate early-stage designs. All of this is to ensure the customer has the best experience possible inside their Audi. Where do you find inspiration for your work? As a designer, I see inspiration basically everywhere – it doesn’t matter what it is. It can be fashion, it can be architecture, it can be other products. Everything has its own design aesthetics and uses different materials, which makes them interesting to analyse. And sometimes you’ll see something random and you just can’t forget it. You think: ‘Why have they designed it like this? How has it been manufactured? Could I achieve something similar? Why is this particular product higher quality than another?’. These are all very interesting and important questions that go through a designer’s head. What makes for good interior design? A good interior is a combination of several key elements that make up a perfectly balanced product. First, a good interior needs strong technical clarity. All the features need to be integrated in a way that’s not distracting, helps the driver and passenger, and has a strong, clear theme. A good interior also gives strong weighting to both the driver and the passenger, because the passenger is an essential person. A good interior also has to match the essence of the car, whether it’s a car that’s more angled towards the driving experience, or a car where you’re more connected to your surroundings through connectivity features – a car designed for long distances, for example. And a good interior has to use the right materials. High-quality materials can make a huge difference in both physical and perceived value, so it’s important that all the touchpoints close to the driver and the passenger are of the highest possible quality. Exquisite interior design has always been a core pillar of Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik ethos. Which Audi’s from the past were milestones in this regard? I think it's very difficult to say because there have been so many. Right now, I think the latest generation of Audi TT has an amazing interior. It has amazing details. The digital air vents with the indication in the display are great both from a technology and a design point of view. Looking back through history, the Audi 100 had a very nice dashboard. Its wrap-around design is something we still see in our cars today. Its dashboard was also trimmed in wood material, which was kind of unique for a car like this back in those days.  And I have to say the R8, no matter which generation, has this really strong, almost monoposto (single-seat), architecture where the steering wheel is very much the centre of attention to create this really sporty race-car feeling – it’s fantastic. The Audi Q6 e-tron and A6 e-tron share the same overarching interior design ethos. What was the vision before pen had even touched paper? The initial vision when we started with the interior design for the Q6 e-tron was to have a strong design theme which is very, very clean. One which combines all the digital elements seamlessly and in a way that doesn’t distract the driver at all. We also had a strong vision to create a sort of 360-degree wrap-around architecture which combines the dashboard with the door. Both the Q6 e-tron and A6 e-tron have a completely new interior philosophy which channels Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik spirit. What are the highlights? The overall design philosophy in both interiors is driven by what we call aesthetic intelligence. This is made up of four key pillars which define the overarching ethos. The first pillar is human centric. This is all about how the driver and passengers feel inside the car. The comfort. The connection to what’s happening immediately around them. To achieve this, we’ve designed the architecture of the car in such a way that it feels like it’s completely surrounding you. This is what we call a soft-wrap design, where the dashboard and door come together as one seamless entity. The second pillar is the digital stage, and this is where Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik philosophy really shines through. This incorporates all of the digital elements of the interior, including the interaction light on the dashboard which gives you notifications via ambient lighting. The curved panoramic touchscreen which has been designed for maximum size and clarity while also being easy to operate for the driver. The passenger touchscreen which, for the first time ever, allows the passenger to interact with the setting of the car. And the augmented reality head-up display which makes driving easier and safer. The third pillar is visual clarity. Ensuring that every element of the interior is integrated beautifully and comes together in one seamless sculpture. This soft-wrap architecture also plays a big part in this. And finally there’s the material-driven design. This isn’t just about ensuring the interior uses high-quality materials, but also emphasising the look and feel of the materials with shapes and lighting. We use three dimensional shapes which catch the light in certain ways. On the top, we have areas which are more in the dark, so there's more shadow, which means the material is really presented in its best shape. And then there are some features that appear in the A6 e-tron specifically, like the virtual wing mirrors. These were first introduced on the Audi Q8 e-tron, but customers told us that the interior screens were too low in the door, so looking at them didn’t feel natural. For the A6 e-tron, these have been moved up where traditional wing mirrors would be, making for a much easier user experience. And then there’s the panoramic sunroof with switchable transparency, which allows you to control exactly how much light enters the cabin which gives a very nice look and feel to the interior. Where do you think Vorsprung durch Technik will take Audi in the future? I think our Vorsprung durch Technik philosophy means Audi will continue to always question and re-question the tools which it uses and the features which it offers its customers. For interior design this is particularly important because it is essential to offer the customer exactly what they want, and live up to their expectations of what an interior should be.

    "description": "Goodwood central sculpture this year celebrates greatest achievements of Gordon Murray Aston Martin, Hyundai and MG are among the brands making a splash at this year's Festival of Speed The Goodwood Festival of Speed (10-13 July) is in full swing and it's shaping up to be one of the highlights of the motoring year. It is hosting big reveals from Lanzante, Hyundai, MG and plenty more besides, as well as an array of debuts from Aston Martin, BMW and Honda. Below is our guide to the most important cars at this year's Festival of Speed. Alpine A110 R Ultime Production of the Alpine A110 ends next year and this is its last hurrah. The Ultime's 345bhp output – 49bhp up on the existing R – pushes beyond the limit of the original car’s gearbox, so a new six-speed unit has been swapped in. Swathes of carbonfibre feature elsewhere, cutting its weight to 1120kg, and it also gets an aggressive aero set-up. It’s priced from £276k and just 110 will be built, so its participation in the Festival of Speed might just be your only chance to see one being driven to its limits. Everything you need to know about the Alpine A110 R Ultime Alpine A290 Rallye The rally-ready version of Alpine’s electric hot hatch gains a limited-slip differential, bigger brakes and a hydraulic handbrake. There’s even an exterior speaker for the enjoyment of spectators.  Everything you need to know about the Alpine A290 Rallye Alpine A390 Alpine’s Porsche Macan challenger will make its British debut at the Festival of Speed. Due to go on sale next year priced from around £60,000, it uses a tri-motor powertrain and torque vectoring to emulate the agility of the A110 sports car.  Everything you need to know about the Alpine A390 Alpine Alpenglow Hy6 This hydrogen-combustion demonstrator packs a twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre V6 that kicks out 740bhp. It can rev to 9000rpm as well. Aston Martin DBX S This new performance-focused version of Aston’s luxury SUV outpunches the Ferrari Purosangue, putting out a substantial 717bhp. You'll be able to see it in the First Glance paddock at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin DBX S Aston Martin Valhalla The Festival of Speed will be your first chance to catch Aston Martin’s new 1064bhp hypercar rolling on home turf. Production of the Valhalla is scheduled to begin imminently. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin Valhalla Aston Martin Vantage S Aston Martin turns up the wick on the Vantage with the S, packing 671bhp and a top speed of 202mph. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin Vantage S BMW M2 CS BMW’s junior sports car gets the Competition Sport treatment, gaining 50bhp more than the regular M2 and packing a generous 479lb ft. An abundance of carbonfibre also helps to reduce its kerb weight to 1700kg and it dispatches 0-62mph in just 3.8sec. Goodwood will mark the first time it’s been displayed to the public in the UK. Customer deliveries will start at the end of the summer. Everything you need to know about the BMW M2 CS BMW Concept Speedtop Last year’s striking Skytop convertible has been transformed into a svelte shooting brake for a lucky handful of BMW loyalists. It has been conceived as an “intentional counterpoint to our current models”, according to BMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk, and is set to make limited production. This may be your only chance to catch one in the metal before they disappear into collections. Everything you need to know about the BMW Concept Speedtop BMW Vision Driving Experience Four motors, five downforce-producing fans and 13,269lb ft of torque: the Vision Driving Experience is BMW’s manifesto for driving enjoyment in the electric age. The firm's performance machines will still be rear-biased, for example, and they will use control electronics that can respond 10 times more quickly than those fitted to previous-generation M cars. This car will make its first UK appearance at the Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the BMW Vision Driving Experience Bovensiepen Zagato The Bovensiepens, founding family of Alpina, have established a new coachbuilding firm – and this is its first car. Based on the BMW M4 and styled by Zagato, it has 603bhp and 516lb ft, yielding a 0-62mph time of 3.3sec and a top speed north of 186mph. Everything you need to know about the Bovensiepen Zagato Callum Wood \u0026 Pickett Mini Former Jaguar design chief Ian Callum’s take on the Mini turns it into a hot hatch for zipping around the streets of London. Its arches are widened, deep-dish wheels are fitted, and its A-series engine is upsized to 1310cc. That gives it 110bhp, sufficient to have required the fitment of a reinforced gearbox.

Its chassis has been reinforced with carbonfibre, the brakes overhauled, traction control added and the V12 tweaked with new camshafts and springs. It has also received a redesign, with ‘pop-down’ headlights, flared wings and exposed exhaust pipes. It will take to the Goodwood hillclimb, marking the first time it will have been seen in action. Ferrari 296 Speciale Billed by Ferrari as the \"most fun-to-drive, emotionally charged\" car it has built to date, the 296 Speciale brings a swathe of upgrades compared with the existing GTB. Power is up by 49bhp, downforce is improved by 20% and it's 60kg lighter than the GTB.

The GT Concept is the homologated variant of the incoming GT3 GR hardcore racer – itself revealed in concept form in 2022 – and both took to the hillclimb. The road-going GT3 GR is likely to wear a Lexus badge, rather than a Toyota one, in keeping with the premium brand’s history of large-engined sports cars, including the LFA, LC 500 and RC F. As such, it is thought to preview what could be the spiritual successor to the acclaimed LFA – and may take the LFR name. All we know about the new Lexus flagship Maserati MCPura The Maserati MC20 has been renamed the MCPura as part of its mid-life update. The styling is subtly tweaked, with a reshaped grille and front diffuser, plus a new twin-spoke wheel design.  Everything you need to know about the Maserati MCPura McLaren W1 McLaren's striking new flagship picks up the mantle from the P1 and F1 with an electrified 4.0-litre V8 that sends 1258bhp to its rear wheels.

Read our MG Cyberster review MG CyberX A boxy 4x4, this radical concept car hints at MG’s plans to expand into new segments and punch upmarket.

A veteran of the Sultans of Sprint series and the man behind Kraftstoffschmiede, he’s made a name for himself building wild, boxer-powered BMWs—like his 2019 stunner, Achilles. Our suspicions were right. Philipp has been with BMW for years, working in both the automotive and motorcycle divisions, and is currently part of Motorrad’s R\u0026D team. This R 1300 R is his latest creation—built inside BMW’s prototype workshop, with help from a crew of in-house designers and engineers. It’s a full-blown skunkworks special, and one of the most impressive we’ve seen. Revealed just three months ago, the new BMW R 1300 R is an aggressive naked roadster with a forward-heavy silhouette.…",

The duo’s aura of sublime simplicity is complemented by a monochromatic wardrobe, consisting of black suits, ties, fedora hats, and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. Even after dark, the Ray-Bans took what could be a plain, G-man appearance to the epitome of cool. For motorcycle riders, sunglasses aren’t just an expression of style. They can be essential for protecting your eyes from wind and debris, not to mention reducing glare and increasing visibility in challenging light situations. And yeah, they can also make you look cool, but not every pair of shades will make the cut on the open road.…",

    "description": "SUVs big and small are all the rage, but there's another story developing on the sidelines – the rise of MPVs. MPVs outsold sedans in India last year and there's record interest in the body style high up the price ladder too. Kia's Rs 64 lakh (ex-showroom) Carnival is sold out for the year while Toyota delivered over 1,000 units of the Rs 1.22 crore Vellfire over the past 12 months. It’s customers like these who are happy to spend big on an MPV that MG wants to win over with its own luxury MPV. Meet the M9. MG hasn’t announced prices as yet but has hinted that the M9 will slot in right between the Kia Carnival and Toyota Vellfire. Giving the M9 more distinction is the fact that it’s the first all-electric luxury MPV in India. As you’d imagine, there’s lots to talk about.  MG M9 exterior design and engineering - 7/10 Being 5.27m long, 2m wide and 1.8m tall, the MG M9 is massive. For perspective, it’s longer and wider than the Carnival and Vellfire.The 3.2m long wheelbase is huge in its own right and hints at the space inside. At 5.27m, the M9 is longer than a Carnival and Vellfire.  In its basic shape, the M9 is boxy to allow max cabin space. It’s not a looker but then again, MPVs are all about what they are like on the inside, rather than visual appeal. The front end is home to slim DRLs up top, main headlights lower down on the bumper and a large grille at the base, with generous use of chrome to add some flash. This being an EV means the bonnet lifts to reveal storage - a handy 55 litre frunk in the M9’s case. 19-inch wheels and a stylistic chrome finish at the window line help uplift the slab-like sides. At the back, if the size doesn’t do it, the lighting that drops down at the side will sure help identify an M9.    Under the bonnet is a 55-litre frunk. The M9 uses a monocoque construction and positions its 90kWh NMC battery pack under the floor. The battery powers a front motor that drives the front wheels. The MG M9’s 19-inch rims come wrapped in Continental Contiseal tyres. What makes these tyres special is a viscous sealant layer that self-seals punctures up to 5mm.  19-inch rims come wrapped in self-healing tyres.   MG M9 interior space and comfort - 9/10 Access to the M9’s middle row is via powered sliding doors that can be opened via a button on the door, the key fob or controls near the driver. It’s a slight step up into the cabin but a large grab handle at the B-pillar does help the journey in. The doors open to a massive cabin and what gets you first are the middle row seats. XL-sized, beautifully cushioned and finished in perforated leather and suede, the seats – scratch that – armchairs immediately establish the M9’s core competency – delivering a VIP experience for the boss sat at the back. M9's middle-row seats are more like armchairs. The standard seat position is comfy in its own right and there’s 16-way power adjust too to control for everything from backrest recline and headrest height to seat slide and legrest position. One-touch functions make the job of setting the seat easier. For the full effect, you need to experience the seats at max extension (made possible with the middle row seat all the way back and front passenger seat electrically slid forward). Backrest at full recline and legrest rolled out, the seat feels no less than a recliner. Oh, and there’s seat ventilation and heating too, as well as eight soothing massage functions to choose from. The experience is every bit business class on land. In standard position, the middle-row seats are already very comfortable. While middle seat comfort is central to the M9’s appeal, the experience at the very back is pretty good too. You’ll have to make your way to the third row via the passage between the middle row chairs. It’s not quite a walk in but is convenient enough, as third rows go. The seating position is comfortable and there’s room for three average-sized adults to sit in comfort. Unusually, there’s no middle seat headrest or fold down armrest for the third row. Also note, the third row is all but unusable with the middle row seats fully extended. Stretching out the seats to their max gives a recliner-like experience. What’s noteworthy is that front seat occupants have it nice too. The seats are fully powered and also pack in heating, ventilation and massage functions. The driver environment does take some getting used. Partly because of the M9’s sheer size, and partly because of the layout of the controls - the gear selector sits on the right stalk behind the steering while the left stalk is for lights and wipers. Third row has space for three adults, but no middle seat headrest. The M9’s dash is neatly done but the flush finish to the climate control functions on the dash panel looks better than it is in practice.    MG M9 features and safety - 9/10 The M9 is offered in a single fully loaded variant. And MG has really gone the distance to pamper those sat at the back. As mentioned, the seats are fully powered with ventilation, heating and massage functions. There’s 64-colour ambient lighting, a dedicated climate control zone for the middle row, an onboard air purifier, a panoramic sunroof for the rear section of the cabin, a sweet-sounding 13-speaker JBL sound system and you can also get rear entertainment screens as an accessory. Middle-row passengers get a dedicated climate zone and panoramic sunroof. Seat adjustment, cooling and lighting functions are controlled by a screen on the middle seat armrests. Trouble is, the fixed position of the screen makes it hard to read in some lighting conditions and hard to reach when the backrest is all the way back. MG should have also given the M9 powered sun shades for the middle row windows. The manual operation isn’t in keeping with the M9’s price. On the subject, there are no sun shades for the third row windows and that means middle-seat passengers will feel the heat on their face at full recline. Armrest-mounted screen controls seat, cooling and lighting functions. Up front, you get powered, heated, ventilated and massage seats, dual-zone climate control and a single-pane sunroof. Taking pride of place on the dash is a 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto/ Apple CarPlay, and eSIM-based connected tech. The 7-inch digital dials, in comparison, look small and basic. What is nicely done is the digital mirror. It relays a feed from a rear camera and gives a crisp view of the world behind. Touchscreen measures 12.3-inch size; supports wireless Android Audo/Apple Carplay. The MG M9 hasn’t been rated by Global NCAP or Bharat NCAP as yet but it’s reassuring to know that the big MPV is a 5 star Euro NCAP car. As standard, the M9 gets 7 airbags, ESC, all-around disc brakes, Isofix child seat mounts, a tyre pressure monitor and a 360-degree camera (the resolution is so-so). Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS are included too. Functions such as lane departure assist worked well on the smooth and well marked roads in Goa. Also part of the package is a driver attention system that monitors for drowsiness, distractions like mobile use and even smoking!   MG M9 performance and refinement - 8/10 Power delivery is strong and nicely measured out. The MG M9 has a front axle mounted motor that puts out 245hp and 350 Nm of torque. There’s also Normal, Eco and Sport drive modes, but that doesn’t transform this luxury cruiser into a rocket ship and that’s a very good thing. All too often, all manner of EVs dump their power in one go for wild acceleration, just because an EV can. Not in the M9, make no mistake though it’s not slow, a sub 10 second 0 to 100kph time is what should be possible and that’s quick enough, what’s nice however is that its power delivery is strong and nicely measured out, perfectly in sync with the vehicles character. Overtaking is thus easy, even in Eco mode, put your foot down and the M9 moves off smartly. Road, wind and suspension noise are very well contained on the M9.  Refinement is a highlight on the M9. You do hear a whirr from the electric motor at very slow speeds, but otherwise, the powertrain runs quiet. Road, wind and suspension noise are also well contained yielding a soothing atmosphere on the go. MG M9 range and efficiency - 7/10 The M9 has a 90kWh battery, and while an ARAI-certified range figure is awaited, MG claims a 548km range achieved over internal tests. Internationally, though, the MPV has a certified WLTP range of 430km. On our drive, the M9 indicated a range of around 300km, but that was with a lot of time spent idling with the AC on during the shoot. We’ll only know the actual range once we put the M9 through our instrumented tests in Mumbai. The M9 has a certified WLTP range of 430km. Given the unreliable charging infrastructure on our highways, the M9 isn’t ideal for long cross country trips. Delivering supreme comfort over intra city commutes is the M9’s forte.  MG M9 ride comfort and handling - 7/10 Where MG could have done more to pamper the M9’s crorepati clientele is in ride comfort. There’s a stiffness to the setup which means body movements are well contained at higher speeds. However, the suspension and tyres can’t iron out smaller imperfections at lower speeds as successfully. The low-speed ride feels a bit busy for what is a luxury car.   It handles surprisingly well for its size and mass.  The MG M9 manages its bulk around corners fairly well, driven sensibly or even slightly quickly, body roll is well contained, no doubt helped by the battery mass down below. The steering and brakes also have two drive settings – Normal and Sport, the latter of which firms up the steering and was generally nice to use. The Sport mode on the brakes though wasn’t to my liking given that at lower speeds it comes off as grabby. Speaking of brakes there’s adjustable regen modes with three levels on offer, L1 offers up a deceleration akin to a conventional ICE vehicle while L2 and L3 offer up stronger retardation, there is however no single pedal driving. MG M9 price and verdict - 8/10 The MG M9 is easy to drive for something so large but lets be honest, it’s not intended for the self drive owner. It’s for chauffeur-driven buyers. And it’s this target clientele that will have much to like about the M9. Middle row space and seat comfort are fantastic, refinement is really impressive and MG has also packed in a whole lot of goodies. Ride comfort could have been better but it’s not a deal breaker.  The M9 delivers on the brief of a luxury MPV quite appropriately.  The promise, then, is for Vellfire-like comfort for a whole lot less money (we estimate a price of Rs 90 lakh ex-showroom). To help convince buyers to see the M9 as a vehicle worthy of the big bucks, MG will retail the MPV from its new, premium MG Select dealerships. The M9 might not be the first luxury vehicle that comes to mind for anyone shopping at this price bracket, but it sure deserves a look. It might just surprise you.  Also see: MG M9 interior, seating and comfort review 2025 Bentley Bentayga Speed review: Luxury SUV embraces its sporty side",

    "description": "Ather Energy has announced that it will be showcasing its new scooter platform – EL – and a bunch of other fresh developments at its annual Community Day 2025 to be held on August 30. New Ather EL platform to debut on August 30 Company working on new fast chargers  Recently, Ather Rizta crossed the 1 lakh unit sales milestone Ather EL scooter platform, new fast chargers being readied Ather Stack 7.0 operating software to also debut at this event. At its Community Day 2025, Ather will be showcasing its new scooter platform – EL – and concept vehicles, some of which are likely to be based on this new platform. Ather claims its new EL platform is engineered to be versatile and cost-efficient and will enable the company to expand its product line-up to cater to a wider range of customers. Currently, Ather is the sole mainstream player in the electric two-wheeler industry to not have an offering under the Rs 1 lakh mark. Competitors such as Bajaj, TVS, Ola Electric, Vida (Hero) and Greaves all have at least one product under that threshold and this new EL platform could remedy this for Ather. Ather is also working on its next-generation of Grid fast chargers, which it claims will make charging quicker and more convenient. For reference, the current Ather Grid chargers can top up any Ather e-scooter at the rate of 1.5km/min and any Vida e-scooter at 1.2km/min; since Vida uses Ather’s open-sourced charger connector, its products benefit from this system. Last but not least, Ather will also debut an upgraded version of its software stack, Ather Stack 7.0, which is likely to bring in more features to its products. At its previous Community Day, Ather launched its first family centric offering, the Rizta, which recently surpassed the one lakh unit sales milestone.
