    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Despite the bleak future of diesel engines, the demand for a three-row SUV with a diesel engine is still strong. And so, while the recently updated Alcazar got all the modern frills and features, it also continued with a diesel mill. Hyundai has also priced both the turbo-petrol and diesel variants at par, and that might put some buyers in a dilemma, but there are some caveats before you start calculating the running costs and fuel economy. The 1.5-litre diesel unit is smooth and vibe-free. On the design front, there is no difference between the petrol and diesel versions. You get the same new look with LED headlamps and H-pattern DRLs, the same 18-inch wheels and the same rear look as well. There isn’t even any badging to distinguish them. It’s a similar story on the inside; well, almost. The dashboard layout and dual-screen setup mirror that of the petrol version. But glance higher up, and you’ll notice the missing panoramic sunroof. In fact, there is no sunroof and that, Hyundai says, is due to the extra weight, which brings down efficiency. When it comes to a diesel car, fuel efficiency takes top priority. No sunroof for diesel variants. We got a chance to sample the 7-seater version, which meant a bench seat instead of the captain chairs we tested on the turbo-petrol. Space and comfort are adequate, but you miss out on the extendable under-thigh support, lateral support on the headrests and the ventilation function. That said, the seat can be slid back and forth, and the backrest can also be reclined. An advantage of the bench seat is the ability to tumble it down, making access to the third row a whole lot easier than in the captain seat version. Third-row space is good for children, and the Alcazar is more of a 5+2 seater and not a full-size 7-seater. While the lack of a sunroof will not be of much bother to many, what will be concerning is the lack of a spare wheel. You get a puncture-repair kit for emergencies, which feels like cost-cutting gone too far, especially on a diesel SUV. Owners buy a diesel vehicle for long-distance driving, and given our road conditions, a spare wheel is absolutely crucial. Sure, good efficiency helps, but how much are you ready to put on the line for a couple of extra kpl? No spare, only a puncture-repair kit. Powering the diesel Alcazar is the same engine as before – a 116hp, 1.5-litre mill that is also shared with the Creta, Kia Carens and Kia Seltos. It’s a smooth and vibe-free engine once you get going, but sedate driving is what it expects. Rush the engine for extra performance, and you’ll be greeted with a coarse diesel drone and a linear power delivery. The engine is mated to a 6-speed automatic, which complements the overall character and is relaxed. You get drive modes that alter the response in the bottom end, but it still remains an SUV you drive with a relaxed right foot. 0-100kph takes 12 seconds, but crucially, the diesel Alcazar returns 12.5kpl in the city and 16.3kpl on the highway. It is an able cruiser with an engine that can munch on the kilometres, a pliant ride that feels confident at speed and a practical cabin to carry plenty of luggage if the third row is folded down. The missing sunroof won’t hurt as much as the missing spare wheel might. However, if you are someone who racks up kilometres but also wants an easy-to-drive SUV in the city, the Alcazar makes for a good case.

    "description": "Cast your mind back to early 2017, when Mercedes-Benz India did a mic drop and revealed the long-wheelbase E-Class for India. We all knew instantly that it would change the game, and it did. Yes, it was more expensive than rivals, but that didn’t matter to Indian buyers, who just lapped it up, making it the bestselling car in its segment by a long shot. Rivals responded in different ways, but none were able to stem the E’s mighty tide. Now, as we move into the next generation, BMW has boldly followed down that path, replacing its 5 Series and 6 Series GT with one model – the 5 Series LWB. It’s an expensive path, mind you, requiring a lot of investment from each brand, as ours is the only right-hand-drive market in the world to sell them; they’re not just made in India, they’re made for India. And as luck and lifecycles would have it, the launch of the 5 Series L (code: G68) has coincided nicely with that of the new-generation E-Class LWB (code: V214), which, of course, is going to defend its predecessor’s well-manicured turf. Its traditional rivals – the A6, the S90 and the ES – remain, of course, but the battle of the boss seats is really between these two. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series rear seats Recline function, wraparound ambient lighting and boss mode give the E-Class a proper business-class feel. So, let’s start right there. What’s common in both cars is a ridiculous amount of rear legroom and the fact they’re best for two; a middle passenger has to deal with a big transmission tunnel and raised centre cushion. But from there on, they do things differently. The 5 Series’ 110mm stretch is reflected in its massive doors that also have huge windows attached. The E-Class, as before, has Merc’s ‘Maybach’ doors, in which the quarter glass is fixed to the bodywork, and the door itself – soft-close, incidentally – is smaller. Each has its benefits and drawbacks; the BMW is easier to get in and out of (also helped by a higher seat) thanks to the wider opening, but the doors are a pain to open in tight spaces. The Mercedes doesn’t have this problem and also gives you some privacy as you can hide behind the C-pillar, but then you have to climb around this pillar and lower yourself into the seat. Softer seat cushioning, more room, but no recline in the BMW. Aftermarket sunblinds are poorly executed. You sink into the 5 Series’ seat thanks to its thicker, softer cushioning, both for the base and backrest, with plush outer-side bolstering that hugs you in place. They’ve chosen an up-tilted seat base angle for better support and a fixed backrest angle, rear set at 31 degrees to lay your spine into. The huge fixed glass roof – in combination with the large windows – makes the cabin feel airy. But, while there is a powered shade for the overhead glass, there are no window shades, nor one for the rear windscreen, which is a huge miss. As a quick fix, BMW has fit removable aftermarket shade panels, but their execution is basic. And should you have to remove them to enjoy the view outside or to open the window, they will just sit in the cabin with you. Powered seat and blind controls elevate E-Class’ rear cabin. The E-Class’ seat cushioning might not be quite as soft as the 5’s, but on every other front, it knocks it out of the park. For one, it gets sunshades not only on both rear windows but on the rear windscreen, too, and all are powered and operable from either rear door. Then, there’s the band of ambient lighting that wraps around the rear seats, enveloping you in a glow of your chosen colour. But the real draw is that both seats have a powered recline (up to a generous 36 degrees), as well as a powered seat base extension for better thigh support. All this makes travelling in the E-Class feel like a business-class flight journey. You can even move the front passenger seat forward from back here. In the BMW, your driver has to do that for you via the touchscreen. BMW’s big fixed glass gives better sense of airiness. It’s clear then, while the 5 Series has a slight edge on seat softness and knee room, it’s the E-Class that really pampers you with a more special back-seat experience. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series features Both back seats have the expected set of amenities – four-zone climate control, USB ports, multiple AC vents, cup holders and wireless chargers in the armrests. While both get sunroofs, the Mercedes, as ever, uses a split dual-pane arrangement where only the front glass opens. The BMW, instead, has one large fixed glass and ultimately is the one that makes the cabin feel airier. Though neither gets a rear entertainment system, the BMW does at least offer an accessory for mounting your own device onto the back of the front seat. Merc ‘Superscreen’ with crisp displays is a big draw; third screen adds to the wow factor. Unusually, neither car offers heated or ventilated seats in the back, which feels like a miss when so much effort was expended in stretching them, and in both, all the fancy tech is at the front. For instance, while both cars offer tremendous-sounding, ultra-high-end audio systems, the Merc’sBurmester 4D system has exciters in the front seats that thump to the beat. The Bimmer has ventilated front seats, meanwhile. Similarly, both cars have selfie cameras up front, and while the BMW’s is mainly for the anti-theft system, the Mercedes’ lets the driver do video calls; so, why not in the back? BMW dash is clean but plain; helpful shortcut keys on centre console to access favourite functions. At the front of the E-Class, you can’t miss the ‘Superscreen’, which effectively replaces the dash with screens under a glass pane, and though it means little for those at the back, its wow factor alone elevates it above the 5 Series. All three screens are crisp, vivid and well laid out, and even though the passenger-side screen feels redundant and gimmicky, it’s all part of the occasion. As ever, they are quick and smooth to operate, but the downside is the whole dashboard is easily covered in fingerprints, dust and reflections. As with many modern cars, most functions have now moved away from buttons and into the screen. But what’s particularly annoying is that the AC fan and temperature, unlike the C and S-Class, now require two steps to adjust instead of one. They’ve also given it digital AC vents that can auto adjust based on presets in – you guessed it – the touchscreen, but luckily, they can also be used manually. Merc dials classy, easier to read on the go. The BMW’s AC vents are also technically digital in that you adjust them from electronic toggles placed lower in the dash, but the frustration here is that you can’t see what you’re adjusting. That’s because the vents are concealed behind the ‘interaction bar’, a contextual strip of crystalline LED lighting that flows across the dash and into the doors. Contextual because it changes colour with drive modes and emergency warnings and even has some touch controls built into it. Though the result is a clean, minimalist look, it feels quite ordinary next to the Merc. The 5 Series has a more conventional pair of screens, laid out in a curved array stacked on top of the dash. These are also good-looking and responsive, though we’d have liked a straightforward ‘dial’ option for the driver’s display; the futuristic aesthetic isn’t very intuitive. 5 Series gets an optional tablet holder. Quality in both cars is excellent and a step up from that of their predecessors, and each offers a choice of upholstery colours – cream, black or brown in the Mercedes, and brown on grey or blue on black in the BMW. The front seats are generous in both cars, with plenty of adjustment and soft neck cushions, but the 5 Series has a slight edge again with its softer cushioning. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series performance So, it’s a great place for your chauffeur, too, but what do they have to work with under these cars’ bonnets? Today, we’re driving the E 200 and the 530Li, which are both mild-hybrid 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol engines. Mercedes offers a four-cylinder diesel and a spicier six-cylinder petrol, too, and while we’re still to see any other engines in the BMW, there is the hot 600hp i5 EV. Back to the powertrains at hand, the Merc’s engine is now up to 204hp and 320Nm of torque, aided by a generous 23hp and 205Nm of electric boost. As with previous versions, it feels linear in its power delivery, with more than enough pep for sudden overtakes should you need them. There is a Sport mode, but it only makes a marginal difference. As before, the 9-speed gearbox can trip up and hunt for gears at crawling speeds, but in rare high-rev situations, and while very refined in isolation, engine noise creeps in sooner than in the 5 Series. The BMW also has much stronger performance; its engine produces a headier 258hp and 400Nm. And though its e-boost is considerably less, at just 11hp and 25Nm, you can never tell while driving it. In fact, apart from a Sport drive mode, the gearbox has its own sport mode, and then there’s the boost function, unlocked by holding down the left paddle shifter. With all these engaged, prepare for some very un-limo-like performance, the 530Li rocketing to 100kph in our tests in just 6.45 seconds – nearly 2 seconds quicker than the E 200. However, disarm all these modes, and it can do smooth and docile as well, with its ZF 8-speed gearbox handling matters better than the E’s 9-speed unit. The real surprise comes in ride quality. Neither car has air suspension or even adaptive dampers, but they both ride well, and despite their 3m-plus wheelbases, there’s enough ground clearance to get over most speed breakers without making contact. The E-Class feels a bit more tied down through corners and also at expressway speeds, but show it an uneven surface, and you’ll find considerable movement in the cabin, which spoils the otherwise serene experience. BMW’s ride has a softer edge over bumps. In an unexpected role reversal, it’s the 5 Series that has the better ride. Not only is it softer-edged over bumps, it’s more refined, too, letting in less road and tyre noise. And yet, it maintains its composure well at high speeds and is far more engaging through the corners, should you be driving yourself. The E-Class has a well-calibrated and accurate steering, but the 5’s is lighter at low speeds. It’s nowhere near as sharp to drive as its short-wheelbase predecessors, but for something this large, the long-wheelbase 5 Series’ breadth of dynamic ability is impressive. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series design There has been much talk about the way both these cars look, good and bad, and their design philosophies couldn’t be more different. The 5 Series has some seriously cool details, like its large, tipped-forward (and illuminated) grille, peeled-back adaptive LED headlamps with blue accents, sharp creases, slim LED tail-lamps and sporty bumpers. The trouble is, they don’t come together well on the bulky, amorphous and disproportionate sedan, and the aggressive M Sport styling kit feels particularly out of place here. 4cyl E-Class misses projector, adaptive lamps. The perfect example is the wheels, which have a sporty design on their own, but thanks to their deep-dish look, chunky rubber and the vast metal surface they sit under, they look tiny. Fun fact: The E-Class uses the exact same size of wheel and tyre – 225/55 R18, but you’d never guess by looking at them. It’s because of a clever dual-tone design that makes them visually larger, and the wheel arch gap is smaller. Massive doors cumbersome in tight spaces. Moreover, the Merc is a much better-proportioned limousine that has retained a proper three-box shape, giving it a regal stance on the road. There are some overdone details, like the black grille surround and flashy three-pointed-star tail-lamps, but they aren’t enough to detract from the overall classy look, nor are the headlamps that don’t get projector elements. It may be subjective, but we think the Mercedes has won the beauty contest here. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series price and verdict Going into this test, we thought it would be a walkover for the E-Class, but it ended up being closer than anticipated, and that’s largely down to the 5 Series’ better-sorted mechanical package, which only a back-to-back drive could reveal. Apart from being quicker and more fun to drive, traits important to the chauffeur-driven impressed, too, like refinement, ride quality, smoothness, seat comfort and space. And that’s before the Rs 5.6 lakh price advantage it has on the Merc. 5 Series’ powertrain is not just more powerful but also smoother and more refined. But then, a price premium has never stopped people from thronging to the E-Class before, has it? And this time, the package has only gotten better. Where the Merc lags behind the BMW, it does so only by small margins, but where it gets ahead, it does so in style and delivers a tremendous feel-good factor. It can be found in the soft-close doors, the chauffeur package, the C-pillar that you hide behind, the pop-out door handles, the powered blinds, and yes, even the big touchscreen dashboard. Most of all, though, it’s in the way the back seat makes you feel like you’ve got your money’s worth, mainly down to the reclining backrest and extending squab, and also the grandeur it delivers with its wraparound ambient lighting. To sum up, BMW has put up a worthy challenge with this new 5 Series, and it’s worth your consideration. But it’s clear Mercedes has used eight years of the previous E-Class LWB dominance to study its customers and hone in on what matters most, and has thus delivered the better car.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/reverse-parking-only-way-and-i-can-back-it",
    "description": "The mainstream media is utterly wrong to suggest forward parking is the better solution Now look, I’m not the sort of person to routinely disparage the mainstream media, because I suppose basically I’m part of it. I’m not a ‘wake up, sheeple’ conspiracy theorist who thinks that the MSM is somehow out to dupe you, increasingly popular grift though that is these days. More than that, I’m deeply suspicious of people who begin sentences with “I am not a…” and who follow it with “…but”, because what happens between those two clauses is very often disturbingly revealing about what they actually think. And yet with those caveats made, here goes: I’m not a conspiracy theorist who thinks the mainstream media is out to dupe you, but recently two national newspaper columnists raised an issue that has made me truly doubt their seriousness. I am, of course, talking about parking in a bay. I didn’t think I had particularly strongly held views on this matter. I usually, albeit not exclusively, reverse into a perpendicular parking space. Always have done. Likely always will. I find it easier to back into a bay, and for sure it’s easier to drive out of it afterwards. That’s about the start and end of things. I do this, forget about it and bear no particular ill will towards those who prefer to park nose inwards; I just silently think they’re absolute savages, obviously, particularly if it’s taking them ages and I’m waiting to go past. I thought most people, deep down, knew that reversing into a space was the objectively better thing to do, with the only downside – and I will admit that it’s a genuine one – being that it can leave it difficult to access your car’s boot if it’s backed against a wall. But if you don’t need to stack shopping from trolley to boot, parking rear end first wins, hands down. Anyway, while clearly not everybody parked like I did, I wasn’t going to start banging on about it: in nearly 12 years of writing this column, I haven’t mentioned it once. But when they actively came for the reverse parkers, I had to speak out. Twice in the past six months (and I won’t name the columnists or the papers concerned because, honestly, I can’t be bothered with somebody tagging us all on social media), I’ve read mainstream journalists – not car enthusiasts, nor clearly ones with any notable grasp of physics – assert that reverse parkers are actively wrong; that nose-in parking is the superior, more sensible, even the more noble and less selfish thing to do. That it’s objectively ‘better’, less time-consuming, less bothersome. Ugh. If we must, let’s begin the process formally known as debunking. The reason it’s better to perpendicularly reverse into a bay is the same reason that steered wheels are at the rear of forklift and pallet trucks: it allows for much greater accuracy in positioning the pointy end. The same principle applies if you try to parallel park forwards in a tight space: there’s a bigger chance that the front wheels will swing wildly into the kerb than if you go in backwards. There’s more: when you’re nosing into a space, the bay’s lines are usually quickly obscured by the bonnet. When you’re reversing, they’re reflected in your wing mirrors, so you can keep the car centred easily. Then you get a much clearer, safer view when you want to exit, in one clean, easy manoeuvre, rather than that infuriating shuffle between two rows of tightly packed cars, as some doddery Vauxhall Mokka will be doing in the multi-storey opposite the office as I write this. Physically and objectively, reverse parking is better. I don’t care if you don’t do it, but for heaven’s sake, MSM, don’t come at us pretending that it isn’t.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/snow-slouch-2025-mercedes-benz-cla-ev-vs-alps",
    "description": "The most important new Mercedes model in years is just months away – and we've been out for a ride The Austrian ski resort of Hochgurgl is 2150 metres above sea level - roughly equivalent to two Mount Snowdons or nearly three Burj Khalifas. When we visit in early December, temperatures on the exposed, wind-chilled summit of the road that winds up from here and across the Italian border – usually closed for winter – have reached a balmy peak of -15dec C by mid-morning.  The wind is unforgivingly biting and the road completely covered in thick, heavily compacted snow. There are darker patches that you might mistake for the safe, grippy refuge of uncovered Tarmac, but more fool he who seeks traction on this blackest of black ice.  We’re here partly because “driving on this road is cool”, admits Mercedes-Benz CLA project leader Oliver Zolke as he casually lets the back step out midway through a particularly icy hairpin, but primarily because it’s the best environment for showing off three defining characteristics of the newly electric saloon: \"The ability of the recuperation, the traction and uphill acceleration, and the softness of the suspension”. From the passenger seat, the third-generation CLA feels to all intents and purposes finished. Camouflage cloaks the finer design details outside and the obligatory black bedsheet shields the dashboard from view, but Zolke says it’s “99% there” ahead of an unveiling in March and a launch around summer, with just “some homework” to do on the software and user interface. Even with much still left to the imagination, it’s clear just how closely this car will be to the pleasingly proportioned concept from last year - right down to the full-width digital display we can see peeking through the gaps in the sheeting. For better or worse.  Our test car is the range-topping four-wheel-drive model (Mercedes-Benz CLA 4Matic with EQ Technology, to give its full name), equipped with a 268bhp motor on the rear axle and another with 107bhp at the front. Mercedes has yet to confirm a combined output, but bank on around 375bhp, which should give it a slight accelerative edge over the Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD and the dual-motor Hyundai Ioniq 6.  This is one of two electric powertrains being introduced for the next-generation CLA, which is described as the first car of the ‘EV 2.0’ era for Mercedes, so dramatically different is it from the current EQE and EQS. The other forgoes the front motor for a smaller list price (expect low-£40,000s for the version with the smaller 58kWh LFP battery) and a higher maximum range of somewhere around 440 miles from the 85kWh NMC pack.  There will also be a combustion version, pairing a 1.5-litre petrol four-cylinder engine with a small electric motor in the gearbox for up to 188bhp and claimed \"diesel levels of efficiency\". It's due around six months after the EV, towards the end of 2025.  The range-topping EV certainly feels brisk enough, even on this glassy terrain, when Zolke floors it from a standstill, the lack of scrabbling and sliding off the line testament to the advanced stage of development this all-new powertrain is at - although potentially also the legally mandated chunky winter tyres that our mule is wearing…  A long straight section of the otherwise ceaselessly meandering Timmelsjoch pass provides the opportunity to briefly exploit the CLA’s full reserves, and we surge quickly and confidently to north of 60mph, which wouldn’t feel especially rapid but for the unnerving sense of detachment that comes from having such limited reference points. With the roadside largely indistinguishable from the blacktop and no fixed landmarks flicking past the window, we might as well be doing 150mph, or 20mph.  Either way, the CLA is unflustered. I did the same thing in the same place a few minutes previously in a Mercedes-AMG C63 and, even allowing for the assistance of 4WD and winter tyres, found myself making constant small corrections to my line in order to keep the nose pointing the right way. Zolke’s arms remain rigid by comparison: “There’s not much work to do from the driver’s seat,” he remarks, the car tracking straight and true with no perceptible directional input from either man or machine.  Zolke maintains his relaxed demeanour as a tight right-hander approaches, carrying our cruising speed well beyond the point at which I would have started bleeding off the pace. As the apex comes into focus, he lifts off the accelerator but leaves the brake pedal alone to demonstrate the efficacy of the regenerative deceleration, which can send power back to the battery at speeds of up to 200kW.  \"There's no need to do any mechanical braking\" in D mode, Zolke explains. It would be more efficient in terms of energy usage, but \"more smooth is the recuperation, as you don't feel it\". To demonstrate the contrast, he gives the left pedal a good stab and our conversation is interrupted by the noisy and juddering intervention of the ABS, which despite its best efforts is unable to bring the car’s speed down any quicker than the motors. The 4Matic model has an advantage here, because the second motor on the front axle boosts the maximum regeneration rate, but the rear-driven CLA will also be able to stop with no physical brake input. \"And that's more or less a side effect of efficiency. We didn't do it for these conditions; we did it to get maximum energy back from the car,\" says Zolke. Judging the suppleness of the chassis is trickier, given the tyres don’t really come into direct contact with the road itself during our time in the car, but the fact that I’m able to chat with Zolke while simultaneously writing in my notebook on one of Europe’s most challenging roads is probably an indication of its composure. Unlike the bigger electric Mercs, the CLA will be exclusively coil-sprung, but with optional adaptive dampers for greater control over the suspension characteristics - as with the BMW i4 and Tesla Model 3. Beyond its dynamic credentials and straight-line performance, the CLA is aiming to steal sales from its rivals with a claimed cruising efficiency of 5.18mpkWh - giving it long-distance abilities that it has proven by breaking the record for the longest distance travelled by an EV in 24 hours: 2410 miles around Italy’s Nardò high speed ring. Minimising power wastage at a cruise is crucial to attaining that figure, but being able to charge at up to 320kW dramatically reduces time spent idle. Zolke acknowledges that it's a big ask to marry segment-leading efficiency (Mercedes loftily refers to the CLA as “the one-litre car of the efficiency age”) with highly competent dynamics and engagement, but \"the biggest challenge of the project\" was instilling the new saloon with all those attributes while also keeping it tightly proportioned and low to the ground. He explained that Mercedes' focus for EVs has so far been focused on 'higher' – both taller and more premium-focused – model lines, because of the cost and bulk of EV batteries, but as both of them come down, lower ride heights become possible. Nonetheless, Zolke said, there was a paradox to address: \"The challenge was the height of the car, because we need space for the battery underneath but to keep the height comparable to the predecessor for styling, you don't want to have it too high – also for aerodynamics.” Even with the car still heavily camouflaged, it's clear that the CLA is a close proportional match to its predecessor, and the seating position feels roughly as low-slung as it would in a petrol saloon. Comparing the two with each other – and with their respective rivals – post-launch will give a clearer picture, but the early signs point to the new CLA being a remarkably uncompromised all-rounder.",

The R80 and its successor the R100GS combined the best of BMW’s road-going features with increased suspension travel and the new ‘monolever’ swingarm in a form that excelled on any terrain, setting the stage for hundreds of thousands of dual-sport BMWs since. For all their timeless rugged charm, you wouldn’t call either bike stylish in a traditional sense, prompting a unique challenge for the craftsman at Stile Italiano.

His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "BMW’s M performance division has revealed the first set of camouflaged images of the M3 electric prototype (codenamed: ZA0), and it looks inspired by BMW’s Neue Classe Vision Concept showcased last year. Notably, this follows sightings of the standard i3 Neue Klasse sedan in November. BMW plans to expand the Neue Klasse line-up with models like the M4 EV and iX3 M by 2028, catering to a range of performance needs. Neue Classe is BMW’s grounds-up EV architecture   M3 EV has a much sportier stance than the regular i3 sedan It may arrive with an AWD system BMW M3 EV exterior design Up front, the M3 EV gets double-barrel lights surrounding the low-slung signature kidney grille and a very clean looking bumper that’s devoid of aggressive cuts and creases. In profile, the overall silhouette resembles the concept’s three-box design. Wider wheel arches, M design bits like flared fenders and sportier alloy wheels set it apart from the standard i3 Neue Klasse sibling. It also seems to sport a much lower stance, which could be due to a sportier suspension. A sloping rear roofline and big boot are also reminiscent of the concept.   BMW M3 EV powertrain, specs Though BMW hasn’t confirmed specifications, media reports suggest the base M3 EV could deliver up to 670hp, with more powerful variants potentially on the way. Earlier, BMW had hinted at a quad-motor setup making over 1,300hp, but we believe that power output is likely for models higher in the line-up. BMW Neue Klasse platform The electric-only platform is designed to support structure-integrated batteries from 75-150kWh. These in-house developed cylindrical cells also allow for fast charging speeds reaching 270kW. BMW stated that they are 20 percent more energy dense than the prismatic cells used in their previous EVs. Both RWD and AWD setups will be supported and can handle a variety of electric motor configurations. The first model built on the Neue Klasse platform will debut in H2 2025, paving the way for five additional models by 2030. BMW-owned Mini will also utilise this architecture.
