    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "Aston Martin gives its big, V12-engined GT concept one last spin, with more power and technical commitment than ever The Aston Martin Vanquish is another brand-new, V12-powered, front-engined exotic super-GT to get stuck into, hot on the heels of the one you may have read about only a few weeks ago - the Ferrari 12Cilindri.The Vanquish joins the Ferrari among a dwindling number of 12-cylinder sports cars setting out to battle upstream, fingers in ears and screaming blood and thunder, for the next half decade or so at least, against a swelling current of pressure to downsize, electrify and generally cut out the old-school combusting of hydrocarbons in one of motordom’s very grandest engine configurations.Good luck to them, I say. This, you’ll probably already have surmised, will not be a review that lampoons how power outputs have grown to ridiculous and untappable extremes, or that laments the impact that such power has on cars really meant for fast, laid-back, long-distance cruising.The new Vanquish is certainly a car that could provoke those kinds of reactions. It’s very fast; very, very powerful; necessarily quite purposeful in its grip and body control levels; and, yes, it probably would make a better fast GT if it were, in fact, smaller, lighter, slower and generally gave its contact patches a bit less to do. But never mind all that. The bigger point, and one worth celebrating in 2024 as riotously as we may fleetingly be allowed, is that Aston Martin has found a way to make it at all. A couple of years ago, when I drove the last-generation Aston Martin V12 Vantage, I worried that it might be Gaydon’s last-ever series-production V12 (unicorns like the Aston Martin Valkyrie, Victor and Valour notwithstanding). It would have been a rather unfortunate way for Aston’s 5.2-litre V12 to sign off.But, thankfully, it was nothing of the sort. The Aston Martin V12 sports car lives again. And how.",

    "description": "Audi RS3 Sportback Audi's newly updated mega hatch is outlandish and offers stonking performance for the price There’s an admirable belligerence about the Audi RS3. It hasn’t been made a crime just yet, after all, to put a big engine into something relatively small and create an amusingly alternative driver’s car in the process, much as a great many of Europe’s CO2-based taxation regimes would already suggest it ought to be.It really would be an aberration, though, if Audi’s excellent EA855 five-cylinder performance engine, motivator of the likes of the Audi TT RS and RS Q3 and winner of more International Engine of the Year awards (yes, they do exist) than you can shake a golden crankshaft at, were taken from us any earlier than were absolutely necessary.Hot hatchbacks like this used to be a little more common, but the RS3 has become the last of that over-engined breed, with motors significantly bigger, more powerful and more mechanically exotic than you expect to find in any humble five-door and something of the aura of the custom-built, engine-swapped hot rod about them.The Mercedes-AMG A45 is just as outrageous, but it's powered by merely four cylinders. The Volkswagen Golf R is a more subtle alternative, while the Toyota GR Yaris is smaller and perhaps a bit more fun.But the RS3 is somehow mechanically bigger and bolder than its rivals. Which could explain why that engine, with its 394bhp output and 369lb ft whack of torque, was left untouched for the mid-life update that has just arrived.In fact, glance at the technical specification of this facelifted RS3 and you might wonder whether the mechanical bits have even been touched: the top speed and 0-62mph time remain unchanged too.But while you can easily glen the styling changes, this isn't one of those facelifts that’s all style and no substance. It's just the technical work has all been detail stuff, refining the car's complex hardware and software.It's easier to understand by starting with the outcome: a new compact class Nürburgring lap record of 7min 33.123sec, which is, most pertinently, more than 7sec quicker than the pre-facelift RS3’s best time. And, Audi is at pains to point out, that improvement came from work on the car rather than Frank Stippler simply having a good day.",

    "description": "It isn’t often that a new car impresses me as much as the Toyota Hyryder has. The hybrid’s EV-like initial responses, fuel efficiency that’s better than most frugal diesel cars and a likeable package backed by Toyota are some of the reasons why I persuaded my wife to buy the SUV as soon as it was launched. But while I have one at home, it’s hard to pry it away from my wife. So, I grabbed the keys to the one Toyota lent us as a long-termer. I think the Hyryder’s design is very appealing, and its ‘Speedy Blue’ paint makes it quite striking, too. On the inside, the dashboard and doors have a nice leatherette padding, and the brown and black colour scheme certainly lifts the cabin’s perceived quality. You can’t ignore that it shares many parts with lower-priced Marutis, but it isn’t to the extent of feeling cheap or offensive at its Rs 20 lakh price. The Hyryder’s ergonomics are spot on, with plenty of seat, steering and central armrest adjustment for you to get comfortable. However, the seats aren’t the comfiest, and the cushioning results in some body ache on longer drives. At the rear, space is adequate for two adults – it isn’t as wide as the Creta’s – although six-footers will find headroom tight even with the backrest fully reclined. Soft leatherette materials up the cabin’s premium appeal. After several road trips and airport runs, I can confidently say that with a plus-sized check-in bag in the boot, there’s only about enough room for a laptop bag; you can slide a laptop bag into the slim storage beneath the boot floor, too. On either side of the boot, there’s a deep storage area that is useful to stow smaller items. I must talk about the touchscreen and wireless charger as well; the touchscreen’s software is buggy, resulting in frequent disconnection and low call volume when connected to wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. We hope a software update solves this. The wireless charger is also flawed; it suspends charging often without reason, which is very annoying. Wireless phone charger’s erratic functioning is frustrating. Also, the thin sun shade for the sunroof allows the cabin to be soaked in heat far too quickly when parked outdoors. A high-quality sunfilm on the sunroof could alleviate this issue. Though Toyota has connected car tech, the vehicle locator is the only feature I found useful. It also tells you how much fuel is left and the current range, but I would have liked more information, especially related to fuel efficiency, and a trip log. You can’t unlock the vehicle via the app if you don’t use the app to lock it in the first place, which is quite strange. There is a pre-cooling feature, too, that I’ve used only once. Rounding off the not-so-nice bits, when the engine/generator kicks in to charge the lithium-ion battery, the system occasionally makes quite a few sounds, which can take the uninitiated by surprise, and if you’re paying attention, you’ll also feel some vibrations at idle. Hybrid’s drivability and responsiveness are spot on. Now, let’s talk about the things I really love. The first is performance. A seamless and silent electric startup is something I truly appreciate. Next, the electric motor nicely complements the three-cylinder petrol engine, delivering almost electric vehicle-like responses, making it ideal for closing gaps or when overtaking. The torque curve tapers soon after, and the e-CVT makes the engine rev quite a bit when your foot is pinned to the throttle, emanating a rather unpleasant note. But the highlight is its fuel efficiency. In Eco mode, the best I’ve achieved is 26.5kpl, with 80 percent highway driving and the rest in the city. With no effort to drive with the intent of maximising efficiency, the average city efficiency is about 20-21kpl in winter months, and this number drops to 18-19kpl in summer. An insider at Toyota explained that the e-compressor puts a high load on the hybrid system, which explains the lower efficiency when ambient temperatures are higher. Do note that these numbers are measured using the tankful-to-tankful method. i-Connect app is too basic; more info on efficiency, trip log would’ve been nice. Lastly, the Hyryder’s suspension is on the firmer side, but driving manners and steering make it feel very confident at highway speeds. It also exudes an underlying toughness while dealing with poor, broken roads, which, to some extent, makes it similar to its rugged sibling, the Toyota Fortuner. The Hyryder has been a fill-it, shut-it and forget-it car, one that goes about doing all that’s expected of it in a fuss-free and competent manner.

The man has a taste for 80s and 90s off-roaders, and he knows how to capture that vibe. This time, he’s done it with an unlikely donor—a Honda Monkey.

    "description": "Francesco Bagnaia took victory in a wet 2024 Thai GP, ahead of chief title rival and current championship leader Jorge Martin. After a heated battle with factory KTM rider Jack Miller, Pedro Acosta finally prevailed to take his third podium of the season.   Gap between Martin and Bagnaia is 17 points now Johann Zarco finishes P8 best result for a Japanese bike Ducati wins 2024 MotoGP teams’ crown Fight for the win While Saturday’s Sprint was a dry race won by Enea Bastianini, Sunday’s race was a different story altogether. Sunday’s 26-lap race was a wet one where initially, Martin got off to a good start and took the lead in the opening stages. However, a mistake some laps later gave Bagnaia and Marc Marquez the opportunity to go past Martin, who dropped down to third place.  Bagnaia and Marquez were then engaged in a tense battle for the lead and while Marquez did overtake the reigning World Champion a couple of times, he couldn’t make a move stick. In pursuit of the lead, Marquez crashed out on Lap 14, but was able to rejoin the race.  With Marquez out of the running, Bagnaia eked out consistently fast laps to increase his already substantial lead over Martin and ultimately took the chequered flag in first place. With this win, the factory Ducati Lenovo outfit  also sealed the 2024 MotoGP teams’ title.  GasGas vs KTM for podium Marc Marquez’s crash brought Jack Miller into podium contention and the Australian managed to stay there for much of the race. But Acosta was on a charge in the closing stages, and passed Brad Binder before setting his sights on Miller. Acosta and Miller then engaged in a fierce battle for the final podium place in which the hard-charging Acosta and his GasGas machine prevailed.  Top 10 finish for Zarco LCR Honda racer Zarco had been strong all weekend and was the only Honda rider to find a hard-fought spot in Q2, even if it was the last one available, in 12th place. He managed to put in consistently quick lap times in the race to finally take eighth place when the chequered flag dropped.  2024 MotoGP standings Martin’s advantage to Bagnaia with just two rounds pending is a slender 17 points. Bagnaia’s teammate Bastianini and Marc Marquez (fourth and third in the standings, respectively) have been ruled out of mathematical contention for the World Championship. The penultimate round of the 2024 season will be held at the Sepang circuit in Malaysia on November 1-3. 2024 Thai GP results 2024 Thai GP resultsPosRiderTeam1Francesco BagnaiaDucati2Jorge MartinPramac Racing3Pedro AcostaGasGas Tech34Fabio di GiannantonioVR46 Racing5Jack MillerKTM6Brad BinderKTM7Maverick VinalesAprilia Racing8Johann ZarcoLCR Honda9Aleix EspargaroAprilia Racing10Alex MarquezGresini Racing11Marc MarquezGresini Racing12Luca MariniHonda13Takaaki NakagamiLCR Honda14Enea BastianiniDucati15Joan MirHonda16Fabio QuartararoYamahaNCAugusto Fernandez GasGas RacingNCAlex RinsYamahaNCLorenzo SavadoriTrackhouse RacingNCFranco MorbidelliPramac RacingNCRaul FernandezTrackhouse RacingNCMarco BezzecchiVR46 Racing Also see: Australian GP: Marquez wins, Martin extends MotoGP title lead",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/motor-sports-news/cs-santosh-on-his-rally-return-dakar-goals-with-royal-enfield-433344#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+News+feed",
    "description": "“After my crash, I didn’t remember two-three years of my life; I couldn’t even balance. But I was thinking about the Dakar [Rally] all the time.” A lot has changed for CS Santosh since his near-fatal crash in the 2021 Dakar Rally, which left him with some significant neurological damage. But what didn’t change was his love for motorcycling and that hunger to conquer Dakar once again. Now, over three years after the incident, he’s returned to competitive rallying. It was a monumental first step for the Indian, not just because of all the work he had to put in to reach this stage but also because it was his very first rally outing with Royal Enfield. First steps back to rallying The 2021 Dakar Rally saw Santosh come back from the brink of death – quite literally. In the months since, he’s had to work on regaining his motor functions and memory. While racing had to take a back seat as he focused on recovery, he explored other sides of motorsport as the owner of the Indian Supercross Racing League-winning team, BigRock Motorsports. And although he was back on a bike just eight months after his crash, there was still a long road ahead before he could even consider returning to rallying. “You look like a normal guy, but the thing is that you’ve hurt your CPU,” says Santosh. As part of his recovery journey, Santosh has made several visits to the Red Bull Athlete Performance Centre in Austria and even worked with Michael Schumacher and Marc Marquez’s doctors. He finally feels ready to take those first steps back into the world of rallying. The event picked for his rally return was the relatively unknown Rallye TT Cuenca – a 400km Baja format rally in Spain spanning just two days. “This is the format that we chose to compete in because it’s the smallest format in this type of cross-country rally,” explains Santosh. “I needed to first validate if I could have an aspiration for the Dakar. And it’s pretty much under the radar, so it was just me and my motorcycle.” Of course, a few basic modifications were made to the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 to make it rally-ready – mainly a different suspension, rally-spec tyres, a full-system Akrapovic exhaust, and the addition of the navigation tower. “It wasn’t a rally bike at all. But this is a motorcycle that you can buy out of the showroom and take off-road, and that’s what we did,” says Santosh. “So, it’s not that I’m going to go and win races on this bike, but it enables me to be who I am and at a cost that I can afford. A rally bike costs [anywhere near] 30,000 euros, so it’s an expensive motorcycle, and this, you can buy out of the showroom.” A total of 38 racers competed in the bikes category, and Santosh ended up finishing 30th overall. It’s worth noting that this was simply a shakedown test, and the project is still in its infancy. So, while on paper, this finishing position might not seem like the most impressive, the outing achieved its main goals. “With the bike, I’m glad that we completed this first race. That was beautiful,” says Santosh. “In terms of me, I was a little surprised that it took everything from me to compete; I was exhausted. I’m the guy that races at the Dakar, and this is like a really short format of racing, and it took its toll on my body. [But] yeah, I know what I need to work on now. You can train all you want, but unless you race, you would never know what is required.” Working with Royal Enfield Back in 2015, Santosh became the first Indian to participate in the Dakar Rally, and over the years, he played a key role in Hero MotoSports’ Dakar programme. However, after six years of racing together, this partnership concluded in late 2022. Santosh remains all praise for his former team but admits that after his crash, they envisioned having him on board occupying a different role. “They were like my family; it was hard for me to leave them. [But] I’m the guy who wants to compete and be out there, and I still have to fulfil my own potential, whatever that might be,” he adds. Since then, he’s been working with Royal Enfield. Few know this, but his connection with the manufacturer goes back several years, when he tested the first Himalayan back in 2012-2013. Santosh adds that his partnership with Royal Enfield isn’t just limited to racing, and, in fact, this is one of the major reasons why he wanted to team up with the brand. “Royal Enfield was the first partnership we had at BigRock Dirt Park (the off-road motorcycling training facility Santosh set up near Bengaluru) with Slide School. They saw the relevance in terms of the expertise that we bring in, and they also spent a lot of time testing with us. So, it’s not just me going out there and racing motorcycles. It’s pretty much why I brought Royal Enfield on board in this manner for this race in Cuenca because it’s not just me but even my people testing and collaborating with them.” Dakar Rally goals Santosh says he’ll look at competing in other Baja rallies in the near future. But this is just the start, and he has his target locked on Dakar, albeit with a new goal. “I remember bits and pieces of wanting to be a top-20 rider, and I think I was in the position to do it, but life had other plans as such. Competitively, I don’t think I am that guy anymore. That guy died with my crash.” Instead, Santosh wants to explore the very roots of the Dakar Rally, referring to the early days in the ’70s and ’80s when amateur racers would compete on production bikes, equipping them as they saw fit to tackle some of the harshest conditions in the world. “Now it [the Dakar Rally] is competitive with prototype motorcycles and all that kind of stuff. But this is me going back to the roots – having a motorcycle that I can buy out of a showroom at a price I can afford and then having the aspiration to do the Dakar in this manner,” he says. “I’m just going to go out there and endorse the adventure aspect of motorcycling, and that’s beautiful in its own sense,” he adds. Royal Enfield hasn’t officially confirmed any plans to race at Dakar, but the new Rally 3 class – for production enduro machines adapted for rally use – certainly gives them the perfect opportunity to explore this approach that Santosh outlined.
