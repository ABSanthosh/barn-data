The first and third Testarossas ever produced were brought back to that same location for the first time in two decades. Both cars were reportedly in immaculate condition as they were raised on a pedestal in the middle of the stage. Reminiscent of the way the Testarossa was first unveiled to the public all those years ago. Continue...",

It’s a revisionist history and rose-tinted present we can play along with. This go-everywhere auto comes to us by way of the folks at Cool \u0026 Vintage of Lisbon, Portugal. It’s a simple name, and a simple idea: essentially, a used car garage — but cooler and vintagier. Their model isn’t just to buy, build, and trade on the classic car market; they’ve committed to documenting and creating a lifestyle around their endeavor by taking the autos, using them, and highlighting their potential producing beautiful video and photographic content in the process.…",

We conclude the weekend’s proceedings with news of the 2025 KTM 1390 Super Adventure S EVO. Vespa ‘Tribute’ by SIP Scootershop Spend five minutes anywhere in Europe or Asia and you will realize that it’s scooters—not motorcycles—that rule the roost.

    "description": "Get your nominations in for our new awards celebrating diverse automotive talent There are just a few days left to get your nominations in for the 2025 Drivers of Change awards, a new initiative held in association with Ennis \u0026 Co and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) to champion diverse talent in the automotive industry. A returning name with a completely new format and approach, Drivers of Change is a sibling event to Autocar’s Great Women initiative, which celebrates the automotive industry as a place that welcomes everybody.  Autocar Drivers of Change winners will be individuals who are driving change and promoting diversity in their business in whichever role they perform. Judges will be looking for entries that can demonstrate the adoption of diversity of background, experience and thought in their business. Head here to submit your nomination before the deadline at midnight on 1 November.  Winners will be named in nine categories but anyone appearing on the shortlist will be able to call themselves an 'Autocar Driver of Change'. They will all be celebrated at a special event hosted at the SMMT’s London headquarters on 6 February 2025. The top candidates will be selected from the following areas of the car industry: marketing; manufacturing; operations; PR and communications; purchasing; retail; sales; talent; and vehicle development. Individuals can put themselves forward for consideration, or can be nominated by friends, colleagues and employers. The awards are open to all working in the British car industry, and Britons working abroad. Do you know someone you could nominate? Think far and wide within your organisation - we’re encouraging people to think outside of their immediate team for people deserving of an award. Those nominating will need to supply evidence of the nominee’s business and/or industry impact. There is no limit to the number of nominations that can be submitted by a company.",

    "description": "Ace Electric uses Tremec motor and battery package Reborn 1950s roadster gains EV option that weighs little more than its petrol-engined sibling AC Cars has unveiled an electric version of its Ace roadster that tips the scales at less than 1134kg, making it one of the lightest open-top EVs on sale. The single-motor MG Cyberster weighs 1885kg and the Wiesmann Project Thunderball is said to be just above 1700kg. The combustion-engined Ace, meanwhile, is 1100kg. The Ace Classic Electric uses gearbox maker Tremec’s eGT413 powertrain, comprising a 72kWh battery pack and 300bhp motor. Carbonfibre bodywork, as used by the petrol Ace, helps to keep the EV’s weight down.  AC has yet to announce performance figures for the Ace Classic Electric, but it should comfortably shade the petrol Ace, whose turbocharged 276bhp four-pot yields a 0-62mph sprint time of 4.6sec. It may even nudge the V8-powered Cobra GT, which hits 62mph in 3.4sec. AC also claimed that the EV is capable of driving more than 200 miles between charges. The EV will be offered with the same two bodystyles as the petrol car, drawing on the Bristol- and Ford-engined versions of the roadster from the 1950s and 1960s.  Prices will start at $275,000 (the equivalent of £212,000) before tax or personalisation, and deliveries are scheduled to begin in spring next year. The car will make its debut at the SEMA show Las Vegas on 5 November.",

    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "Chinese manufacturer BYD (Build Your Dreams) is perhaps best known in India for its Atto 3 electric SUV and the Seal electric sedan, but BYD began its India chapter with the launch of the e6 electric MPV. It was initially offered just to fleet operators, but when sales opened to personal buyers, it couldn’t shake its commercial image. That’s where this new eMax 7 comes in. Essentially a revised and improved version of the e6, the eMax 7 comes with a larger battery, more features and a third row of seats. BYD eMax 7 platform, powertrain Before we get to the cosmetic and interior bits, let’s talk about what’s under the eMax 7’s skin because it is interesting. It makes use of BYD’s e-platform 3.0, which includes the innovative Blade battery and an 8-in-1 electric powertrain. BYD’s Blade battery has a reputation of being one of the safest batteries out there, having passed tough safety tests like nail penetration, strength and bend tests. The unique arrangement of the cells in a blade-like formation also allows for efficient heat transfer and BYD says it can maintain its energy density for a long time. This is backed up by the 8 year/1,60,000km standard warranty that the battery comes with; the motor has a similar 8 year/1,50,000km warranty. Like the battery, the new 8-in-1 electric powertrain also allows for tighter packaging and it’s more energy efficient. This system essentially integrates eight components of the electric powertrain like the motor, reducer, on-board charger, battery management system and more. Though this frees up quite a bit of room under the bonnet, BYD has opted not to provide a frunk even though they could easily have done so.   BYD eMax 7 performance, range The range-topping eMax 7 Superior puts out 204hp and 310Nm to the front wheels, which is said to be good enough for a 0-100kph time of 8.6 seconds. Compared to the older e6, this is 109hp and 130Nm more. The entry-level Premium variant produces a lower 163hp but has the same 310Nm for a claimed 0-100kph time of 10.1 seconds. BYD also claims a top speed of 180kph for both variants, and though we weren’t able to verify its performance claims, the eMax 7 Superior we sampled does feel sprightly on the move. As with any EV, the instant torque means it feels brisk off the line. But, keeping with this MPV’s family and chauffeur-driven purposes, BYD has done a good job of making the power delivery linear. However, a prod on the throttle makes it respond instantaneously – typical of EVs – that makes darting in and out of gaps in traffic a breeze. There’s three drive modes on offer – Eco, Normal and Sport; Eco being the most conservative and Sport being the most aggressive. The difference between them isn’t huge, but, as expected, the eMax 7 does feel most energetic in Sport. The Superior draws power from a 71.8kWh battery pack that is said to give it a range of 530km (NEDC cycle), while the Premium’s 55.4kWh pack is claimed to do 420km. During our drive, we covered 137km, which depleted 45 percent of the MPV’s battery. This should translate into a real-world range of around 350km, which is respectable. Mind you, our running was done in the sweltering Chennai heat, with a mix of highway and city driving using different drive modes. As for charging, the Superior’s larger battery can be topped up using a 115kW DC fast charger, which is said to take it from 0-80 percent within 37 minutes. And, like the rest of BYD's range, the eMax 7 is also capable of vehicle-to-load charging, meaning it can power appliances.   There’s two regen modes – Standard and Larger – with the latter recouping charge in a more aggressive manner. Again, like the drive modes though, the difference between modes isn’t huge and what’s nice is that both allow for some coasting so you don’t have to be on and off the throttle constantly. BYD eMax 7 ride and handling On the move, the eMax 7 impresses with its ride quality, which is absorbent and on the softer side at low speeds. As the speeds rise though, it tightens up and there’s very little vertical or side-to-side movement, even over expansion joints. Body roll is also kept well in check around corners and the overall handling feels predictable. The BYD then, is a composed MPV that feels equally at home in the city and out on the highway. The steering is one of the eMax’s weak points. It’s slow to respond, there’s little feel or feedback from it and in certain cases it weighed up unnaturally. What also plays a part in this is the lane keep assist, which will vibrate the steering or even make small corrections depending on the setting you’re in, and this can be unnerving if you aren’t used to it. There is a Sport mode for the steering, but even that has little effect. Coming to the styling, I’ll keep it brief since it’s subjective. The eMax 7 is more of an evolution rather than revolution from the erstwhile e6. The front bumper and grille are all-new and the revised headlights now feature LED elements. Along the sides, the only prominent change is the alloy wheel design. Moving to the back, the eMax 7 gets an LED light bar that connects the new-look LED tail-lamps and a reprofiled bumper. On the whole, the design is inoffensive and a bit too plain to my eyes.   BYD eMax 7 interiors, features Step inside and you’re greeted by a clean and neat dashboard design that’s devoid of many physical buttons, as was the case with the e6. That’s because a majority of the functions are baked into the high-res 12.8-inch touchscreen, which is without doubt the highlight of the cabin. In typical BYD fashion, the screen’s orientation can also be changed from landscape to portrait at the touch of a button. The screen’s UI is easy to understand and navigate and it’s as slick to operate as a tablet. Material quality and fit and finish on the whole are good, but there are some hard plastics in the cabin. What’s nice though is that there’s plenty of storage spaces and cubbies for your belongings. What could have been better is the instrument cluster as the analogue dials just feel too old and important data such as the SoC appear too small.   Getting into the eMax is also an easy affair as the seats are quite low-set and you don’t climb into the cabin. The front seats are well-cushioned and they both get electric adjustability along with ventilation. While the 6-seater version we tested featured two captain’s chairs in the middle with armrests, the 7-seater version gets a bench layout. Like the ones at front, these seats are also comfy, but the high floor means that you sit quite knees-up. This robs you of under-thigh support, especially for taller people. Passengers at the rear are well-catered to, as you get individual AC vents on the roof with blower control, USB charging ports and front seatback pockets for storage. What’s nice is that the middle row has a sliding function and it can be folded, too.   In the 6-seater, the easiest way to get to the third row is by walking in the middle of the two captain’s chairs. Once back here, space is actually ample for adults and you get AC vents, cupholders, adjustable headrests and three-point seatbelts. Here, too, the lack of under-thigh support due to the knees-up seating position is a downer. With all rows up, boot space is a nominal 180 litres, but with the third row folded, it opens up to 580 litres. However, there’s no spare tyre on offer.   Apart from the aforementioned features, the eMax 7 Superior packs a crisp 360-degree camera, a large panoramic glass roof that extends from front to back and really accentuates the sense of space in the cabin, brown leatherette upholstery, two wireless phone chargers, a PM 2.5 air filtration system, a 6-speaker audio system, powered tailgate, 6 airbags, TPMS and lock/unlock using an NFC card. There’s also Level 2 ADAS as part of the package, with features like adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot detection, auto emergency braking and more. In our brief time, we didn’t get to fully experience the ADAS suite but the lane keep and AEB did work as intended. It’s also nice that these can be turned off completely, should you choose to do so.   BYD eMax 7 price and verdict Pricing for the BYD eMax 7 starts at Rs 26.90 lakh for the Premium 6-seater and goes up to Rs 29.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the Superior 7-seater. This MPV does have its drawbacks: it isn’t as large or roomy inside like the MPV it’ll invariably be compared against, the Innova Hycross; the steering isn’t confidence inspiring; and it doesn’t have the flash or brand value. But the eMax 7 is a trailblazer for electric MPVs, and as such, has a lot going for it. What it does do admirably well is ferry up to seven people around in silence and comfort, with the benefits of lower running costs, a respectable real-world range and the latest features. So for those looking for a family EV that’s well suited to the city and the highway, the BYD eMax 7 is your only choice for now. Also see: BYD eMax 7 video review",

    "description": "The Royal Enfield Bear 650 is a new scrambler based on the company’s venerable 650cc platform. While it is based on the Interceptor 650, the Bear gets some significant changes that give it its own identity. Gets different wheel sizes and longer travel suspension Highest torque among all the 650s The new Royal Enfield Bear 650 uses the same chassis as the Interceptor 650, but with different suspension and wheel sizes. The front and rear wheel setup has moved from 18-inch/18-inch to 19-inch/17-inch, which is more in line with a scrambler motorcycle. The suspension has also been upgraded, with the Bear getting a similar Showa USD fork as the Shotgun, but with different internals, while the rear gets new dual shock-absorbers.  Suspension travel has also increased from 110mm/88mm on the Interceptor to 130mm/115mm. As a result, the seat height has gone up as well, and at 830mm, this is now the tallest of the 650s. The Bear 650 also debuts new MRF Nylorex block pattern tyres by MRF on spoked wheels - there’s no tubeless option here.  The front disc is a similar 320mm unit to that of the Interceptor, but the rear disc has gone up from 240mm to 270mm. The Bear 650 is equipped with dual-channel ABS, which can be deactivated at the rear. The ergonomics have also been revised, with a new wide handlebar and a different foot peg position. The Bear 650 uses the same 648cc parallel twin engine as all of its siblings, but with one big change. Instead of dual exhaust pipes, the bike now runs a two-into one system with a single exhaust on the right side. With this change, torque has gone up from 52Nm to 56.5Nm at the same 5150rpm, while peak power remains similar at 47hp at 7250rpm. While this new exhaust set up would have certainly helped save some weight, the Bear 650 only weighs two kilos less than the Interceptor at 216kg. This is partly down to the new suspension and wheels/tyres, but also because Royal Enfield has braced the chassis in numerous areas to accommodate the light off road riding that the Bear is capable of. Design wise, the Bear 650 differentiates itself with a unique stance from its new wheel sizes, as well as a scrambler-style seat which is kicked up slightly at the rear. The head and tail lamps are both familiar round LED units from existing Royal Enfields, and the Bear 650 also gets new LED indicators. Adding to the scrambler vibe are the competition number boards on the side panels, as well as the raised ground clearance - now 184mm.  The bike also drops the simple dual pod instrument console from the Interceptor 650 in favour of the new circular TFT display from the Guerrilla and Himalayan. This display supports Google Maps and it is controlled by new switchgear. The Royal Enfield Bear 650 will be available in five different colours. Prices as well as our review of the motorcycle will be revealed on 5 November. Also see: Updated Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 spotted with twin front disc brakes",

    "description": "It has been over two years since Triumph launched its all new Tiger 1200 in India and the company has now rolled out an updated version in our market. Focus on improved refinement Reduced seat height options The new Tiger 1200 was a big departure from the older model in its shift from the previous super smooth three cylinder motor to a more gruff T-Plane configuration. Like with the Tiger 900, this T-plane three cylinder engine was more characterful with a more torquey nature, but it brought increased vibrations. Triumph’s first big updates for its 1200 Tiger are mostly around improving refinement and comfort. The 1,160cc engine produces the same 150hp and 130Nm, but it receives changes to the crankshaft, alternator and balancer shaft, besides some engine calibration changes. Triumph says that these changes have resulted in smoother low rpm torque delivery. An updated clutch is also said to enable a smoother selection of first gear.  While Triumph says that engine changes have reduced vibrations, the standard GT Pro and Rally Pro also get the damped handlebars and risers from the Explorer variants. The seats have also been reprofiled with a flatter shape to liberate more space for the rider. An accessory low seat reduces the position by 20mm, taking it down to 830mm on the GT Pro and 855mm on the Rally Pro. A new Active Preload Reduction feature is now available across the range which reduces the rear suspension preload as the Tiger 1200 slows to a stop, lowering the seat height by up to 20mm. The GT Pro and GT Explorer models will now have more cornering clearance, thanks to repositioned footpegs that have been moved higher up and closer in towards the bike. Prices have risen marginally by around Rs 19,000, with the Tiger 1200 range now starting at Rs 19.39 lakh ex-showroom for the GT Pro. The Rally Pro starts at Rs 20.38 lakh, while the Tiger 1200 GT Explorer costs Rs 20.88 lakh and the Rally Explorer costs 21.88 lakh.  Also see: 2024 Triumph Tiger 900 GT review: Better but not perfect Triumph Tiger Sport 800 revealed, likely to replace Tiger 850 Sport",
