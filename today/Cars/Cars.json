    "description": "Last Luton-built Vivaro was built at 12:18pm on Friday 28 March 2025 Vauxhall Luton has built its final vehicle, a Vivaro van, bringing to an end 120 years of production at the plant. The decision to close the historic commercial vehicle factory was announced by Vauxhall owner Stellantis in November 2024. All of the company's UK van production will be moved its site in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Former Stellantis chief Carlos Tavares announced the decision just a few months after he had threatened closures as part of a battle with the UK government over its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate. Tavares said the ZEV mandate was “hurting significantly our business model”, because car makers were being forced to sell more EVs yet no incentives were being offered to buyers and the industry was grappling with a downturn in EV interest. He said that moving all operations to one base would “consolidate” Stellantis's UK manufacturing footprint. He added that this decision would “potentially contribute to greater production efficiency” – something the firm said would also allow it to meet increasingly stringent ZEV mandate targets, which rise to 26% this year. All of Luton’s machinery will be moved to Ellesmere Port, where more than £50 million will then be spent to upgrade it to take on the extra workload. The decision to close Luton put 1100 jobs at risk and just a few hundred roles were guaranteed to be moved to Ellesmere Port, Stellantis said. A consultation was launched for affected workers, with those unable to make the move being offered retraining or potentially jobs at neighbouring businesses. Following November’s announcement, union bosses called on Stellantis to reverse its decision, given that it was made just days before Tavares’s shock resignation. Unite called the closure decision “one final example of Tavares’s failed strategy” and said it “must be halted as the company embarks on the hunt for a new CEO and a new direction”. In response, Stellantis committed to “the continuity of the ongoing projects that have been already communicated” under the guidance of chairman John Elkann and an interim executive committee. Unite argued that until Tavares's successor is appointed (due in the first half of 2025), all previous major decisions should be halted.",

    "description": "Bolt Motor Company specializes in lithe custom creations with sharp lines and crisp finishes. Their ethos likely has to do with the fact that they share a workshop with their sister company—the Spanish Formula 3 racing team, Campos Racing. Of all the marques that pass through Bolt’s doors, we can tell they love tinkering with BMWs the most. Since opening their doors, they’ve peppered us with a steady stream of custom BMWs ranging from mild to wild. This custom BMW R100 sits squarely in the latter camp. The donor bike, a 1982 R100RT, was first wheeled into Bolt Motor Co.’s workshop with very high mileage and looking more than a little worse for wear. Bolt loves nothing more than restoring rough wrecks into fantastic forms of fantasy, so they happily tore into it.…",

One machine in particular stood out—a plucky Honda Dax that took on bikes twice its size while snagging a silver medal in the hotly contested Freestyle class. The bite-sized Dax needs no introduction. First released in the 70s, before being brought back three years ago as part of Honda’s modern-classic mini-bike range, its pressed steel T-frame is iconic. It’s also a prime candidate for customization. This show-stopping Honda Dax is the product of a collaboration between JZO Crafts and Kunimoto Hidetoshi. JZO (‘Jie’ to his friends) is the man that Rough Crafts turns to for its fabrication needs. Kunimoto is the founder of Nemoto—a shop specializing in mini-bike parts.…",

    "description": "A heavily camouflaged test mule of the updated Suzuki Burgman has been spotted testing for the first time. The Burgman will likely feature a redesign and powertrain upgrade, similar to the new Access. Here’s what we can deduce. Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon Sports a different exhaust, suggesting some engine changes Currently priced between Rs 95,800 and Rs 1.16 lakh Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon; spotted testing The Burgman has largely remained unchanged since its launch in 2018 With this update, it is likely that Burgman’s design will see evolutionary updates, similar to the changes we saw on the 2025 Access compared to the previous model. The brake light on this Burgman test mule appears to be similar to the Avenis, but the spy shots reveal that the display has been carried over from the outgoing model. This update is likely to revise the design of the Burgman with some feature additions, just like Suzuki did with the latest Access.  It is likely that the updated Burgman will feature powertrain and chassis upgrades similar to those of the Access. One clue that the engine will see some revisions is in the different exhaust muffler on the test mule, which is quite similar to the latest Access.  The Suzuki Burgman was launched back in 2018; since then, this maxi-scooter has largely remained unchanged. It recently received an update to comply with the OBD2B norms and a new colour, but its overall design has remained unchanged. It is available in two variants: Street (Rs 95,800) and Street EX (Rs 1.16 lakh), where the latter gets a 12-inch wheel. It’s worth mentioning that before the 2025 Access was launched, spy shots of its test mule had been seen for quite a few months. Since this is the first time a spy shot of the updated Burgman has surfaced, its launch is likely some time away. When this updated Suzuki Burgman does launch, expect a small price bump in price over the current model. All prices ex-showroom, Delhi.

    "description": "The BMW R 12 G/S has been revealed overseas after the brand teased its imminent arrival a few days ago. This is the scrambler version based on the R 12 nineT platform and it shares its engine and main frame with that bike.  BMW R 12 GS has 200mm / 210mm (F/R) of suspension travel It shares its engine, main frame with the R 12 nineT Available with 17-inch or 18-inch rear wheel options BMW R 12 GS engine, weight, styling details R 12 GS rides on a 21/17-inch (F/R) setup with raised suspension The R 12 G/S is a scrambler that is based on the R 12 nineT. In terms of design changes, the R 12 G/S features hand protectors with cockpit fairing as standard.  The R 12 G/S comes with a 21-inch front wheel as standard. For the rear wheel, there are two options, depending on the chosen package: Standard or Enduro Package Pro. The main differences between these two packages are the rear wheel size and seat height. The Enduro Package Pro upgrades the rear wheel from 17-inches to 18-inches and raises the seat height from 860mm to 875mm. With the optional Rallye seat, the seat height can be increased further to 890mm. Additionally, the Enduro Package Pro includes features like off-road footpegs, a 20mm handlebar riser and the Enduro Pro riding mode, which adds to the standard Rain, Road, and Enduro modes. It sports minimal bodywork and sits higher from the ground with a fully adjustable USD fork with 200mm of travel and a monoshock with 210mm of travel. The R 12 G/S has a tank capacity of 15.5 litres and with it fully brimmed, it tips the scales at 229kg. These updates give the scrambler a distinctly purposeful stance, complemented by the Paralever swingarm. Its design is more closely aligned with the earlier HP2 Enduro than the R 1300 GS, and its heritage can be traced back to the iconic R 80 G/S. Braking duties are handled by twin 310mm discs up front with axially mounted Brembo callipers coupled with a 265mm rotor at the rear. It gets a full suite of electronic rider aids from BMW such as traction control, cornering ABS (switchable), engine braking control, keyless ignition and LED headlight with optional adaptive headlight. The 1,170cc, air/oil-cooled, horizontally-opposed (boxer) twin-cylinder engine is carried over from the R 12 nineT that produces 109hp at 7,000rpm and 115Nm at 6,500rpm. It provides the same peak power at identical rpm as the R 12 nineT. It is available in a single variant with three colour options. It remains to be seen when BMW launches the R 12 G/S in India and at what price. Also see: Royal Enfield Classic 650 launched at Rs 3.37 lakh",

    "description": "The Eldorado’s new looks for 1967 were received very well, and generated immediate sales success for Cadillac’s halo coupe. Eldorado had continually struggled to find anything but a niche customer base since its inception in 1953, but it seemed its time had finally arrived. As discussed in our last entry , both 1967 and 1968 were banner years for the Cadillac brand and Eldorado, and the company broke its overall sales record on both occasions.  In 1968 Cadillac sold 230,003 vehicles, and despite a hefty 11 percent price increase 24,528 of those were Fleetwood Eldorados. 1969 brought new styling across the line, and Eldorado strayed away from its sleek origins. But would customers take notice and shop elsewhere? ( Note: The bearded 18th century man glares angrily at the 1969 Eldorado because it is significantly uglier than the previous year.)",
