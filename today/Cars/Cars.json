    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Rubber-mounted footpegs are new here. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-manufacturing/breaking-mini-delays-ev-production-oxford",
    "description": "Electric Cooper and Aceman models, currently built in China, were due to start rolling out of UK plant next year Electric car production at Mini’s Oxford plant has been delayed for an unconfirmed amount of time, with the worldwide slowdown of EV sales blamed. The decision was confirmed to Autocar this evening by Mini parent company BMW Group. The German firm previously announced all non-Chinese market production of the electric Mini Cooper and Mini Aceman would move to Oxford from China in 2026. More than £600 million has already been spent readying the factory, and the nearby Swindon body pressing plant, for electric car production. That money has chiefly funded an extension of the body shop, the construction of a new area for battery installation and new logistics facilities - the latter already built. A spokesperson said: “Given the multiple uncertainties facing the automotive industry, the BMW Group is currently reviewing the timing for reintroducing battery-electric Mini production in Oxford.” The spokesperson added that a previously announced government grant - of an unspecified amount – that was to be invested into the plant on top of BMW Group's cash will now not be taken. In 2024, electric vehicle sales in Europe stalled, with their market share slightly shrinking from 15.7% in 2023 to 15.4%, according to figures from Jato Dynamics. It attributed the slump to the withdrawal of incentives, as well as their high average price. The slump was highlighted further as petrol models rose from a market share of 47.9% to 48.4% and hybrids grew from 9.9% to 11.8%. Such is the slowdown of electric cars, car makers have already begun to rewrite their previously confirmed all-electric timelines. The likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi, for example, have extended the lives of some hybrid models in the face of falling EV sales. Mini Oxford employs some 4000 workers and produces cars for markets across the globe including the UK. It currently builds petrol-engined versions of the new Cooper and from 2030 was due to switch to 100% EV production. Previously announced plans for the plant targetted a top-end output of 200,000 cars of both types annually between 2026 and 2030. The plant began producing the BMW Group’s first Mini in 2000 and 19 years later built the electric version of the last-generation hatch. At its peak, that car accounted for a quarter of the plant’s output last year, making it the UK’s biggest producer of EVs.  This is a breaking news story. More to follow.",

Sign up to Vorsprung durch Technik Live here The event will give you the chance to get up close and personal with a collection of iconic Audi heritage cars, hear from key Audi personnel, participate in a live Q\u0026A with the Autocar team, and even drive a selection of Audi’s latest all-electric e-tron models, including the high-performance e-tron GT and the all-new A6 e-tron. To sign up, simply fill out this form with a little bit about yourself, what you drive, and why you’re interested in attending. The event will take place on Thursday, May 1. We’ll be filming the entire event and conducting some short interviews throughout the day, so it’s important that you’re comfortable with being on camera. Attendees must be 18+ and hold a valid driving license. Spaces are limited. What is Vorsprung durch Technik? Chances are you’ve heard of Audi’s iconic ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’ (VDT) slogan. First introduced in 1971 by advertising legend John Hegarty, VDT has evolved over the past five decades into far more than just a catchy tagline. Translating to ‘progress through technology’, VDT represents a deep-rooted philosophy that places innovation at the very centre of all of Audi’s design and engineering endeavours. The result? A peerless roster of extraordinary cars that have continuously reimagined the impossible. From the revolutionary four-wheel-drive Audi quattro (1980) that dominated world rallying, to the ultra-efficient Audi A2 (1999) that set new standards in chassis design and lightness, to the Audi R8 (2006) that forever changed the trajectory of mid-engined supercars. Today, that same relentless pursuit of progress underpins each and every one of Audi’s all-electric e-tron models, resulting in a lineup of class-leading electric cars that push the boundaries of performance, range, aerodynamic efficiency, and technology.

Case in point; this Moto Guzzi California 1100, which takes inspiration from the hit zombie apocalypse TV series, The Walking Dead. It’s the work of Matteucci Garage, run by Marco Matteucci out of Montegranaro, Italy. And it’s not just inspired by The Walking Dead in general, but rather by a particular character; Negan. Played by the charismatic Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Negan is a villian-cum-anti-hero known for his dark humor and brutal methods. Negan is also known for his attire and choice of weaponry. He’s typically seen in a leather jacket and red scarf, and wields a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire.…",

Moc kept the XB9S engine and fuel-bearing frame, but everything else was replaced, upgraded, or built from scratch. Most of the work was done by Moc and his two-man team, but specialist jobs like paint, wiring, and tuning were outsourced to local workshops—including Bike EXIF regulars MFix.

    "description": "MH 03 EL 6295 is wearing a few scars these days. Scars entirely of my making. Here’s the back story. To make space for a test Mercedes-AMG G 63 (yup, first-world problems!), I had to park the Creta N Line in an adjacent parking slot that’s alongside a pillar. Days later, when I got back to the Creta, I forgot how close it was to the pillar and reversed out as always with my eye on the rear view camera feed. Crrrunch. The left-wing mirror took the hit. The glass broke, but thankfully, the electronics (mirror adjust, camera and blind view indicator) survived. Phew! Because replacing the whole wing mirror would have cost a crazy Rs 32,000! All the ADAS features and electronics have made the humble wing mirror expensive. The Rs 1,000 replacement glass that I needed seems like a bargain in comparison. The mirror casing isn’t perfectly aligned, and resultantly, there’s a small blind spot in the blind view monitor. It’s not ideal, but I view it as a small reminder of the perils of being over-reliant on cameras. Lesson learnt. Objects in the mirror are pricier than they appear. Entire assembly costs Rs 32,000! Since the last report, the Creta N Line has been my ride for a few short excursions out of town. Particularly nice was a weekend in Alibaug over a spell of very pleasant weather. It was really refreshing to drive with all four windows down; the overworked dual-zone climate control and air purifier sure needed the day off. Speaking of windows, the fact that the rear windows go all the way down is something that has got a vote of approval from my drive-loving dog. This one feature is almost a make-or-break for him and is a detail I’ve learnt to be mindful of when reviewing a car. All members of the family need to enjoy the car, right? Also worth a mention are the Creta’s handy integrated rear window sunshades that my (human) passengers are prompted to put to use on sunny days. Two-zone climate control and ventilated seats work effectively against the heat. Not nice is the Creta’s fuel economy. The figure is hovering around the 7.9kpl mark in town, which makes our N Line a bit of a wallet buster. It rises to 12-14kpl over easygoing highway journeys, though. Anyone interested specifically in a Creta N Line should also know that its attractive 18-inch rims do come with compromises in ride comfort. You feel more of the surface below than you would on the standard Cretathat rides on 17 inchers. The pesky bolt-on speed bumps that have been spread like minefields in my housing complex make for a jarring start to my office commute. Single-digit fuel economy is the norm in town. Highway drives can up the number. I will be experimenting with some aftermarket solutions to enable wireless Apple CarPlay in the weeks to come, and I am also researching ways to get the N Line to sound throatier. Will keep you posted on my findings in the next report. Rear windows that roll down fully a hit with my dog. Sun shades a boon, too.

    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",

    "title": "Ferrari at a Crossroads: Cavallino Classic '25",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Breakers really shouldn’t exist. Not in its current artful form anyway. Built in 1896 as a wooden retreat for America’s elite, it was a beacon of wealth and exclusivity, until a kitchen fire consumed it in 1903.The owners rebuilt bigger, and grander, determined to make it even more opulent. But again in 1925, disaster struck, this time from something as trivial as an electric curling iron left on in a guest room. The flames ripped through the wooden structure, reducing it to embers once more.  Rather than admit defeat, the owners made sure it would never happen again. Inspired by the great Renaissance palaces of Italy, they rebuilt The Breakers in fire-proof stone, and marble. They wanted its legacy to last for generations.  That same spirit of preservation of legacy, reinvention, of perseverance, makes it the perfect stage for a sold out crowd Cavallino Classic, where Ferrari’s past and present meet in a curated display of mechanical art and automotive obsession.  Walking through the resort and then stepping out onto the 13th hole, it’s clear: this isn’t just another car show. The event was the biggest ever for organizers despite the layout itself reflecting a tight and quite exclusive capacity for cars. The lauded 250 GTO, of course stood commandingly, quietly, at the peak of the display.  The meticulously curated lineup of Ferrari’s greatest hits, F40s, Enzos, LaFerraris, formed the next tier, blue-chip collectibles that define generational milestones. Beyond that, the broader field of concours entrants stretched across the 13th green.  It’s easy to assume that Cavallino is just a playground for the ultra-rich, and it absolutely is, but that’s a lazy and pretty myopic take. Yes, these cars are enormously valuable. Yes, the event is very exclusive. But what stands out beyond the wealth, is the obsession. Talk to the attendees, and you realize just how deep the passion runs. These aren’t absentee collectors. They’re historians, archivists, curators of the Ferrari’s DNA. They don’t just know their car’s production numbers, they know who ordered it, and when. Where it’s been, how it was optioned, and what color thread was used in the interior stitching. Many of the participants care. Deeply. Cavallino isn’t just a concours; it’s a gathering of true believers. Dare to say, these are some absolutely ultimate car nerds. The Cavallino Classic isn’t just about \"owning\" a Ferrari. That’s why the judging process at at the event is taken so seriously. 70 out of 104 cars registered for judging this weekend achieved a 97 out of 100, earning them a best of show accolade.  Winning here isn’t just a physical trophy, it’s validation, and a stamp of approval from some of the most ruthless and knowledgeable judges on the planet. Ferrari historians, restorers, and experts are flown in from the U.S. and Europe, all working under the strict rules of the IAC/PFA, which, for the uninitiated, is the International Advisory Committee for the Preservation of the Ferrari Automobile. Basically, if you’re restoring a Ferrari and want it done right, these are the people you don’t want to disappoint. If they're happy. You're happy. Passing muster here adds weight to a car’s history, increases its value, and cements its place in Ferrari lore. A platinum award means that a panel of the world’s most discerning judges has picked your car apart and deemed it worthy.  In addition to well versed judges, Enzo Mattioli Ferrari, a direct descendant of the legendary Enzo Ferrari, partner and president of Cavallino Classic, and grandson of Piero Ferrari, attended the event. This added serious weight to not only the awards given, but the event itself.  “I strongly believe in the Cavallino project, and for this reason, I am excited to participate in its development and growth, not just with financial investment, but with strategic involvement,” said Enzo Mattioli Ferrari upon being named President of Cavallino. On display are cars both new and old. As of late, Ferrari’s latest hypercars, like the F80, the 12Cilindri, or even the Purosangue, don’t have that same immediate recognition outside the die-hard enthusiast circle as some of the legends of the past. Ferrari has leaned into hyper-exclusivity, and while that strengthens its brand prestige, it’s also pulling it further out of reach for the next generation. The F80, the current flagship is one of those cars. Batted about a bit in the media, it certainly doesn’t get justice it deserves. Photos don't do the trick. In person, it’s commanding, aggressive, a statement piece of design and engineering. But was it the standout of the councours? Maybe. Maybe not. It had a presence, no doubt. A modern Ferrari halo car always does, but was it the gravitational center of the event? People will wax on, telling you its not like the F40. “THAT was an instant icon” people usually opine. “Every kid with a bedroom wall had that poster! Something is missing.” Nostalgia is murky, and the truth is a little more nuanced. Upon its release in 1987, the Ferrari F40 received a mix of acclaim and criticism. It performed, but it was brutish, especially compared to its competition. It wasn’t yet on a pedestal. It had to earn it. And it would. Eventually. But it took decades to become the untouchable legend it is today. Whether the F80, or any other modern hypercar for that matter can achieve such heights is uncertain.    The Cavallino Classic is a crossroads, connecting Ferrari’s past, the stuff of legend, to whatever comes next. The show definitely captures Ferrari, and it's culture at a crucial point in time. Some of these cars will matter forever, some might never make it to the kind of legendary status we're used to seeing for some models. Right now, it is tough to know what’s to come, but at least we know the heritage is safe in the hands of everyone that came out to celebrate the legend that is Ferrari at Cavallino.

Interior styling received a considerable update too, with minimal chrome, no wood paneling whatsoever, and a driver-focused cockpit which would become the hallmark of the personal luxury car. But as was de rigueur , General Motors set about messing with the Eldorado via various annual changes.",

BYD Atto 3 facelift features redesigned bumpers, alloy wheels, tail-lights, and more Enhanced ADAS system uses multiple cameras and 29 sensors Launch details are unconfirmed, but India launch is very likely BYD Atto 3 facelift exterior design The front end of the facelifted Atto 3 gets a larger trapezoidal air dam flanked by slimmer and sportier air intakes. No changes have been made to the headlights and the distinctive chrome-plated panel between them, but the 18-inch alloy wheels feature a new design. Rear end gets more comprehensive updates The D-pillars are now partially blacked-out too, and it gets a new roof spoiler with dual brake lights and a redesigned rear bumper. The tail-lamps also get new interweaving LED signatures with dynamic turn signals. BYD Atto 3 facelift ADAS features One of the headline inclusions of the Atto 3 facelift is the \"God's Eye C\" ADAS system, which uses a three-camera block mounted underneath the windshield, four surround-view cameras, five long-range cameras, five mm-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic radars and 29 sensors all around the SUV. BYD claims that the facelifted Atto 3 supports 10 high-speed navigation scenarios and six intelligent parking modes. BYD Atto 3 facelift battery and range Mechanically, the Atto 3 facelift will most likely remain unchanged. The India-spec Atto 3 is powered by a 60.5kWh LFP battery pushing 204hp and 310Nm of torque through a single front-mounted motor. There's also a 49.9kWh version of the Atto 3 that generates the same amount of power, but has a lower 345km WLTP range compared to the 60.5kWh version's 420km WLTP range. BYD Atto 3 facelift launch details The company has yet to confirm its exact launch plans for the Atto 3 facelift. Since BYD has been attempting to grow its presence in India, the facelifted Atto 3 will most likely make it here as well.

    "description": "Mercedes E-Class and C-Class sedans have been recalled in India, along with a separate recall that affects the GLC and G-Class SUVs, and the S-Class, AMG GT and AMG E 63. The E-Class and C-Class have been recalled to fix the software of the engine control unit (ECU), while the other models have a fuel delivery module that “might not meet specifications”. Mercedes recall for ECU unit affects 2,546 units Recall to fix fuel delivery module affects 96 units Mercedes E-Class, C-Class petrol recall 2,543 E-Class models made between April 29, 2022 and August 20, 2024 affected 3 C-Class models made between August 31, 2021 and October 31, 2021 affected As per the SIAM document, the software glitch in the ECU of the affected models has the potential to deactivate the fuel injection in the petrol engine when exiting ‘sailing mode’, which is a feature that is advertised to allow the car to coast more naturally when one takes their foot off the accelerator pedal, thereby increasing fuel efficiency. Deactivating the fuel injection may lead to the car losing “its propulsion without any prior warning, elevating the likelihood of a collision”. The software issue has been found in 2,543 E-Class models made between April 29, 2022 and August 20, 2024, and just three C-Classes made between August 31, 2021 and August 20, 2024.

The SIAM circular also notes that only the petrol variants of the affected model have the faulty fuel delivery module, which could cause the fuel pump to switch off. This could cause the car to “spontaneously lose propulsion, and increase the risk of accident or injury”.
