    "description": "Nostalgia is a really powerful emotion, and it’s one of the big drivers behind the success of so many brands like Harley-Davidson, Royal Enfield and the born-again Jawa and Yezdi motorcycles. The 42 FJ you see here is the latest motorcycle from Classic Legends, and the initials in its name are a tribute to Jawa’s founder, František Janeček. It has been over four months since the bike went on sale, and Classic Legends finally gave us the opportunity to ride one. And they took us all the way to Ooty to do so.  Jawa 42 FJ engine, chassis While it shares the first half of its name with the smaller Jawa 42, the reality is that these two bikes aren’t very closely related. The FJ not only moves from the 293cc engine to the bigger 334cc mill, but it also uses a different chassis, one that is more closely matched to the Yezdi Roadster. And it is this engine that proves to be the most impressive aspect of the motorcycle.  New Alpha 2 engine is quick and enjoyable. This Alpha 2 engine is the same 334cc as has been seen on some earlier Jawa/Yezdi motorcycles, but it’s been significantly reworked internally. The unit now makes 29.2hp and 29.6Nm, which is a slight drop, but that’s fine because it has made big gains in terms of refinement and rideability. The fuelling is almost perfectly judged, and you’ll encounter no irritating surging or snatchiness at low speeds. LCD is hard to read in direct sunlight. Classic Legends has also tried addressing multiple customer complaints about engine heat. Their solution has been to use a larger radiator fan with a new shroud that is supposed to direct hot air away from the rider’s legs. The weather in Ooty was far too cold for me to confirm how well this has worked, but I can tell you that the fan is quite loud. Jawa 42 FJ performace, handling The best part is the strong mid-range performance, aided by rather short gearing. The Alpha 2 effortlessly pulls you forward in almost any situation, and I even found it comfortably climbing uphill in 4th gear at speeds as low as 28kph. The 6-speed gearbox also feels more crisp and precise, and the whole experience is topped off with a nice soundtrack from the dual exhausts. They not only belt out a surprisingly loud sound but one that’s also deeper than before and is accompanied by some occasional burbles and pops. Exhaust pipes blare out a loud and engaging sound with occasional pops and burbles. The Alpha 2 engine seemed perfectly at home whether ridden at a gentle pace or wrung out over some of the faster winding roads in the region. The chassis was also happy to play along, and the 42 FJ can best be described as easy and agile. Classic Legends quotes 184kg weight without fuel, so this will be about as heavy as a Classic 350 with its 12-litre tank brimmed. In reality, though, it feels lighter and more manageable, and the company has done a good job with this. The FJ was good fun around the Nilgiri’s non-stop bends, with enough lean-angle clearance that it doesn’t scrape its exhausts very easily. That said, it’s not particularly sporty, and you don’t get much feedback about what’s happening on the road, but there’s enough stability, grip and agility for you to trust the bike and carry quite a high pace. The braking is also decent – more front-end bite would have been nice, but the bike slows down well enough, and you have the security of dual-channel ABS. Jawa 42 FJ ride comfort, design The suspension can also be described as decent; I’d have liked it to be a bit more plush and absorptive, but it’s not bad, either. It would have been nice to have a more supportive seat, as this one starts to get achy in about an hour. As for the riding position, your arms are slightly stretched forward to the handlebar while your feet are in a neutral posture. At first, it felt a bit strange, but I found that it’s not bad over longer periods, and the seat-to-footpeg ratio is not as cramped as on the original Jawa 42.  Rear suspension, seat comfort can improve. As for the design, this is a good-looking bike with some typical Jawa traits, like the flowing side panels and twin exhaust pipes. However, the brushed aluminium tank and the overall colour palette seem a bit too derived from the Ducati Scrambler. Quality levels are rising steadily with every new product from Classic Legends, but the overall fit and finish is still some distance away from the competition. Jawa 42 FJ price, verdict At the end of the day, nostalgia will only take you so far, and the product has to stand for itself. Classic Legends’ products have been a bit behind the curve, but this new wave of bikes has brought about some big improvements, and the bikes are now genuinely good to ride.   Of course, the company also has to fix its reputation for quality and reliability, and that’s something only time can prove. But for what it’s worth, I’ve ridden the 42 FJ for three days now with quite a bit of hard riding and speed-breaker jumping, and nothing has come loose or fallen off, and that’s not been the case with past Classic Legends bikes.  With ex-showroom prices in the Rs 2 lakh-2.2 lakh range, the FJ goes up against the likes of the Triumph Speed T4, RE 350s and Honda CB 350 RS, and I think it now makes for a worthy challenger. So yes, seven years after the first Jawa bikes were launched, Classic Legends appears to be at the cusp of a new era, and I now look forward to what’s in store. Also See: Jawa 42 FJ video review",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-launch-first-ev-2030-after-hybrid-model-blitz",
    "description": "Aston's first EV – here imagined by Autocar – was previously planned for 2027 New boss Adrian Hallmark outlines plans for the future, including mid-engined investment and a push for the DBX Aston Martin will rapidly expand its hybrid line-up and increase the number of model variants it offers in the coming years, according to new boss Adrian Hallmark – and it will launch its first electric vehicle before the end of this decade. Former Bentley boss Hallmark took over as CEO of the sports car firm in September last year and has been working on a revised strategy for the coming decade. Hallmark said he had been tempted into joining Aston because it was “an amazing brand” with “great potential, great shareholders and investment for the future, and a product portfolio we have never had before and couldn’t have dreamed of”. The dramatic growth in the number of luxury car buyers in recent years has expanded Aston’s market potential, he said, and the key to its future success is that “the plan has got to be boring and stable. You can create the excitement around you, but you don’t create excitement by ripping the plan up every five minutes.” The challenge of Aston Hallmark had been in his previous role at Bentley since 2018, and said he “loved” working for the company. But he added: “This opportunity came alone, and the chance to be the first person in 112 years to make it sustainably profitable, when I believe there is a way to do so, was irresistible.” Speaking to a select group of reporters, including Autocar, Hallmark said he is confident he can achieve that target “because we’ve got the playbook, not just from Bentley but all the luxury players that are out there.  “In the last 10 to 15 years, the market has totally changed, and so have the prospects for luxury car markers. If you go back 10 or 20 years, the number of people that would buy products in our price bracket was a fraction of that it is today. Both the number and average wealth of luxury buyers has increased fourfold, so the market for luxury has exponentially increased – and the opportunities for companies like Aston Martin have matched that.” Hallmark said he was also attracted to Aston by the investment made in the firm since it was taken over by a consortium led by Lawrence Stroll four years ago. He added: “There’s no way in my old world, with any of the brands I’ve worked directly or indirectly for in the last 25 years, [they] would have tried a product offensive like Aston did over the last 18 months [with the launch of the DB12, Vantage, Vanquish, Valkyrie, Valhalla and several specials]. \"It almost worked, but not every car was perfect day one, and there's been delays, but the ambition and the spend is all genuine. It's not any difficulties we've had, and not because of lack of money. This is a genuine endeavour and the commitment to make a high-potential company a high-performance one is there.” Electrification plans Previous Aston management touted plans to use plug-in hybrid powertrains as a ‘transitional’ technology on the firm’s path to electrification. The forthcoming mid-engined Valhalla will be Aston’s first plug-in hybrid model, but the firm has a partnership to use PHEV technology developed by Mercedes-AMG for other models. Hallmark said the electrification pathway is “not as clear-cut as three or five years ago, but the general direction is absolutely towards electrification. Our commitment is towards carbon-neutral or net zero. But to get there we will double down and add incremental products in the hybrid space before we get to full electric.” Nevertheless, Hallmark insisted Aston’s first EV will arrive “in this decade, but we’ll add hybrid derivatives as well, through to 2035”. Previous management had set a date of 2027 for the first EV but Hallmark said he had questioned that even before starting his role and he refused to be drawn on a specific date. He added that “we have all the prerequisites defined, and some of them developed” for the first EV models. Aston has a deal to use US EV firm Lucid’s electric motor, battery control systems and inverters for its EVs. Asked by Autocar whether the first EV will be a new model or a variant of an existing one, Hallmark said: “For a company of our size, you have to either replace an existing nameplate and take the brave pill, or create the niche [and do] an incremental model as the first one. We haven’t fully decided. The original plan was to go with an incremental model, but we’re looking to other options.” The approach is about being “flexible” over the next 10 years, said Hallmark, adding: “The key message will be to be flexible and have multiple options that fit with legislative and customer requirements over that period.” Hallmark said he expects combustion models “with some form of electrification” to account for the bulk of sales until 2030, with the firm eventually becoming “full electric some time between 2035 and 2040”. He said: “We’re not resisting. We’re just taking account of legislation and trying to manage through a period of high risk for a small company. We can’t afford to do engines, hybrids and electric cars and just see which ones work and then turn off the factories of the others.” Consolidation Hallmark joined Aston shortly after one of the biggest product offensives in its history, including the new DB12, Vantage and Vanquish, along with the Valkyrie hypercar. Hallmark said he had “never seen as much ambition in 18 months”. He acknowledged that the rollout of those models hadn’t been as smooth as anticipated due to that compressed cycle and he hinted that, EV aside, further new model lines won’t arrive until after 2030. Instead, the focus will be on maximising the potential of the brand’s existing models. Hallmark said Aston’s limited provision of model variants means it risks existing buyers going elsewhere. He cited the example of Porsche, which offers numerous variants of the Vantage-rivalling 911. “At the moment, customers buy a Vantage, DB12 or DBX and keep it for two years or so, which is the average ownership cycle in the luxury segment,” said Hallmark. “So in two years’ time, there’s got to be a reason to buy a better Vantage, and then two years after that an even better Vantage. We’ve never had the intensity of life-cycle innovation that we need, and if our competition are doing it and we’re not, we’ll never be as successful as we could.” This approach will include substantially expanding the list of high-end options, after Aston found that some rivals were offering close to 200 more options and extras than it was. While he said not all those were relevant to a performance brand, he said Aston had identified around 100 options that could be added to its range – “titanium exhaust, carbon wheels, high-end audio and so on” – to add further value.  Hallmark said: “If we can add those and have normal levels of uptake, the per-year improvement in our bottom line, and more importantly the fit in meeting customer needs, is massive.” Mid-engined cars As part of its luxury push to rival Ferrari, Aston has moved into the mid-engined supercar sphere in recent years, with the Adrian Newey-designed Valkyrie and the upcoming Valhalla. Newey now works for Aston’s F1 team, and while Hallmark didn’t rule out an eventual Valkyrie successor, he said developing that sort of boundary-pushing model is “a once in a seven- or 10-year cycle” project. He added: “Not many car companies can afford, financially or emotionally, to do a car that is so far ahead of themselves and everybody else every year. It would kill you.” He was non-committal on a Valhalla successor, suggesting its platform can’t be used for a lower-priced version. “If I look at the second half of this 10-year period, this is all about the acceleration of the launch of BEVs and the redefinition of the core portfolio,” he said. “There's no question that if we want to be a high-performance sports car brand as well as what would be in the past, then mid-engine is attractive. \"Valhalla is too sophisticated a platform in totality to make an affordable mid-engine car, so it would mean a completely new platform, and we haven’t defined that yet. It’s not off the cards, but it’s not defined.” Hallmark also cited the profitability of ultra-limited-run specials in the luxury market and said both the Valhalla and front-engined Vanquish will be used “as the basis to do a couple of specials”, but he added: “We're not going to go specials crazy in terms of overdoing it, because there is a finite market for these cars as well.” He hinted that those specials will “not just have a different roof” from their base car, but will be “a completely different concept, but using the core technologies from those two.” Faith in the DBX Hallmark is confident the DBX SUV will eventually succeed, despite lower than expected sales so far. He compared it to Bentley’s struggles with the Bentayga in the first few years after its launch and said there is still work to do on raising awareness of the model. “In 2018 the Bentayga was seen as a failure that was selling 3500 to 4000 cars per year, but there was a little facelift and a lot of communication and it was selling nearly 8000 in 2023,” said Hallmark.  “Not everybody knows we’ve got a DBX. If you go to America and look at the awareness of the brand and then the products, only around 40% of luxury buyers know we even do an SUV. We launched the DBX during Covid, and we’ve got a problem in that it was launched in a strange way. “We had a position for the car we’ve subsequently changed, and [we changed] the pricing as well. But I fundamentally believe that if 52% of the luxury segment is SUV, then we need an SUV. [The DBX] hasn’t done everything it needs to do yet. “Watch this space in the next one to three years. We’re going to attack through the life cycle, and give people reasons to come back or come to us. We want to keep the strength we have with two-door cars and boost the exotic nature of the Valhalla. We will keep that sports car, supercar, hypercar story moving nicely, but we can and will make the SUV work – because it’s a brilliant car.” Sales targets Late last year, Hallmark scaled back Aston’s planned 2024 production output by 1000 units to around 6000 units and it lags behind rivals, such as Ferrari, that produce closer to 13,000 cars annually.  Asked about Aston’s goals, Hallmark said: “Look at the Luca di Montezemolo [former boss] period at Ferrari: there was this repeated rule they would never go above 7000 cars, and look how much money they made on 7000 cars.  “We’ve never made that much money, and I’m not saying our limit is 7000 cars, but we don’t need 13,000 cars to be a great company. What we need is the right margins, the right volume of cars and the right cost base. What you’ll see in the next period is volume, no question, but you’ll also see us addressing the productivity and cost structure of the company.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/renault-5-vs-ford-capri-when-do-retro-cars-hit-mark",
    "description": "Reprising an old nameplate is nothing new and has proven successful for brands like Renault To nobody’s great surprise, the other day the Renault 5 and Alpine A290 jointly won the 2025 Car of the Year award (the original and still the best of the big international car awards thingies). I haven’t driven the regular model, but I have driven the performance variant and enjoyed it very much. A friend of a relative has decided to order one on the back of my review, so I hope I wasn’t wrong. Anyway, what also appealed to them about the 5/A290 is the treatment that Renault has given this car, resurrecting not just a famous name but also the looks to go with it. In the face of huge competition not just from traditional rivals but also a surging Chinese car industry, it’s a trick that has been recommended by marketers and brewing for a while. The idea is to remind customers that one has been making cars for a long time and is particularly good at it, so this is a model you can trust. Hence if you remember the 5 from the first time around, you will have a slightly warm, fuzzy feeling towards the new one already. China’s SAIC bought and uses the MG brand here for precisely that reason, but applying the heritage trick to a particular model is an advantage that young car makers can’t mimic. For some customers and in market research clinics, maybe it doesn’t register, but there are enough new Fiat 500s and Minis on the road to suggest it’s a strategy that works. It’s almost a surprise to me that more car makers don’t do it more often – but then I talk to some designers and realise why. They think it’s clear that you don’t progress in life by looking backwards, that the world moves ever onwards and they didn’t become designers or creatives for a living to just redraw something somebody did 30 years ago. Many, many designers are allergic to retro. They would rather create icons than recreate them. Think of bands that don’t like playing their early hits, and they even wrote them. I get it. But at a point, if it’s clear that it will be what customers want, because it confers a sense of familiarity and trust or nostalgia, it takes dispassionate leadership to say: “Suck it up, team, and get on with it.” (I’m not suggesting this is what happened at Renault, by the way; the designers there might have all loved the idea from the outset.) And in Renault’s case, on early showing of interest, it looks like it will pay off. Less convincing is the approach of Ford, a company I worry about. It has found making money out of cars in Europe difficult in the past, which has bothered it less than it might other manufacturers, because it sells so many vans here (it’s our biggest light commercial vehicle provider). If it wasn’t for the cars living alongside them, it wouldn’t be able to utilise economies of scale to make the overall operation profitable. Cars and vans have fed happily alongside each other. But the cars have to make a contribution and, particularly in the UK, where Ford has been under-equipped to cope with the zero-emission vehicle mandate, I wonder how bad the situation is. Ford has half of the retro idea right, by bringing back a classic name, but for me and I think a lot of the buying public, it’s not hitting the mark without a fitting product attached to it. How much would you like an actual Capri that looked the bomb – a drop-dead update of the classic coupé? Yes, me too. But something called a Capri, a Mustang or an Explorer or whatever that doesn’t have killer looks and does the same kind of thing and looks as normal and unfamiliar as any number of other models and, well, what’s the hook? Why would I be interested, beyond thinking that this wasn’t what the name was designed for? If I were Ford, or indeed another established car maker in the squeezed middle, I would swallow my pride, find a big name from my back catalogue and attach the right looks to it.",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-comparison-reviews/mercedes-eqe-suv-vs-bmw-ix50-comparison-434391#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The last time we compared these big luxury electric SUVs, exactly 12 months ago, the BMW iX, in its xDrive40 guise, was the most affordable in its class and right near the top in aspects such as comfort and driving pleasure. However, it simply couldn’t match the Mercedes EQE’s performance and range. Soon after, though, BMW replaced it with the xDrive50, which had a larger battery, more powerful motors and a healthier claimed range, thus completing the package. But the upgrade made it Rs 18 lakh heavier on the pocket, taking its ex-showroom price to Rs 1.39 crore, exactly the same as the Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV, which was the priciest in its class. Range and performance aside, the EQE SUV had its share of flaws. The good news is that the fully imported EQE SUV now comes with substantial discounts (to the tune of Rs 25 lakh at the dealer level), following the launch of the more luxurious, locally assembled EQS SUV that’s priced just Rs 2 lakh higher than the EQE. So, can the EQE’s discounts give it an edge, or does the improved iX sway the game in its favour? We find out. Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 design Sure, these cars belong to the same segment and are priced similarly, but their personalities are poles apart. The BMW’s unapologetically in-your-face styling commands attention, and even though it might be too radical for some, those who wish to stand out in a crowd are likely to gravitate towards the iX. The EQE appears dwarfed by the iX because of its smaller dimensions and sleeker design language with soft, flowing lines. Out of the two, it has the more understated appearance. While the iX looks more butch and SUV-like, the EQE has a crossover-esque appeal. Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 interior (Clockwise) BMW interface cluttered with too many apps; Dummy switches have no place in this car; Crystal-effect buttons look and feel premium;  Unlike its polarising exterior, the BMW’s minimalist interior has a more universal appeal. The soft-closing doors and frameless windows add to the sense of occasion. The curved screens, an unconventionally shaped steering wheel, champagne-coloured and crystalline-effect trims and even the black-brown colour scheme are all brilliantly executed. The rotary drive selector feels great to use, but the shortcut keys around it don’t. While they make access to the infotainment menus easy, what isn’t nice is that the entire panel moves even if you depress just one key, and that doesn’t feel premium at all. Moreover, the touchscreen’s interface is cluttered with multiple menus and sub-menus, and some important functions are buried deep within; it’s confusing and could overwhelm some users. The softer cushioning in iX feels comfier, but the low-set seat and upright backrest aren’t ideal. The iX feels more ‘SUV’ from the driver’s seat, thanks to an unusually low-set dash, a flat bonnet that’s completely in your line of sight and a raised seat. While the front seats have multiple adjustments and options to get comfortable, the rear seat also has a clear advantage in terms of comfort. The completely flat floor and sheer cabin volume enhance the sense of space, and it is wide enough for three adults. The cushioning and support are good, but the rear bench is low-set, the fixed backrest is quite upright, and it also misses window blinds (motorised or otherwise). So, it falls short of the full chauffeur-driven luxury experience. (Clockwise) Slick, intuitive touchscreen feels great to use; Sound quality and clarity are just outstanding; Passenger screen is likely to have limited use;  That said, with its angled seat base, short squab, upright backrest and hard cushioning, the EQE’s back seat is a few notches lower in terms of comfort. But where this cabin redeems itself is with the ‘wow’ factor. The pièce de résistance is its uber-premium Hyperscreen dashboard, which comprises three screens embedded in a single pane, giving the effect of one gigantic unit. The central touchscreen is far simpler to use than the BMW’s, with a more sorted interface. There’s a third passenger screen, but it feels like an overkill, with little real-world use. While the white interior truly lifts the cabin’s luxury quotient, cleaning it will warrant special effort; you can have it in black, too. The steering-mounted controls are fiddly to use. Some of these are touch-sensitive, and others are buttons, which, like in the BMW, make the entire panel move. It lacks a satisfying tactile feel. EQE’s rear seat isn’t as comfy due to the angled seat base, upright backrest and hard cushioning. An interesting point to note is that despite being built on dedicated EV platforms, neither car gets a frontal luggage area, as seen in most born EVs out there. In fact, you can’t open their bonnets at all. As a result, you have to rely on their conventional boots, and sadly, both have their spare tyres placed on the boot floor, which severely hampers the usable luggage space.  Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 battery, range With its new motors making 523hp and 765Nm, the BMW is abundantly powerful. For a luxury EV, the responses feel a touch too sensitive. With aggressive inputs, it leaps forward like a scalded cat, its four wheels struggling for grip. Outright acceleration times are certainly quicker; 0-100kph comes up in just 4.46 seconds. However, the EQE isn’t too far behind, with a time of 4.8 seconds, and in the real world, it feels nearly as quick as the iX. The ride comfort and dynamics are typical BMW – superb. That’s because even though the EQE’s motors make only 408hp, they make a whopping 858Nm of torque, which lends this Mercedes EV plenty of poke. That said, its responses to pedal inputs are more measured, and the power delivery feels more linear, making acceleration comfier for the driver and passengers alike.  Like all of Merc’s bigger EQ EVs, there’s a great focus on aerodynamics, and the EQE’s slippery shape helped it achieve an overall efficiency of 5.3km/kWh, whereas the boxy iX managed 4.8km/kWh in our real-world range test. However, as the iX gets a larger 105.2kWh battery, its combined range extrapolates to 504km. The EQE, with its 90.56kWh battery, can be driven up to 480km on a full charge. Aerodynamically efficient design aids real-world efficiency. While the iX is marginally quicker and has a slightly healthier range, where it truly holds an advantage over the Mercedes is in the way it drives. Despite its size and bulk, it drives like a typical BMW, exuding the right amount of driver confidence and feeling sharp and willing to change directions. Equally impressive are its ride quality and bump-absorption capability. The iX rounds off rough patches, sharp bumps and road shocks exceptionally well. Unlike the Mercedes, which thuds over bad sections of the road, the iX’s ride feels plush and truly luxurious. What’s more, the EQE SUV’s suspension setup is overly soft in any of its driving modes, leading to excessive pitch, roll and movement, especially at low speeds, which doesn’t do it any favours. Mercedes EQE SUV vs BMW iX50 verdict The Mercedes-Benz EQE’s richly appointed interior, the lure of the three-pointed star and the substantial discounts on offer make it worthy of consideration. But with the iX xDrive50, BMW has taken the luxury game a notch further. Performance and range are better, the ride is comfier, and if, like many buyers in this segment, you love getting behind the wheel, the iX feels great to drive, too. All things considered, you will have to pay more for the iX (taking the EQE’s discount into consideration), but the advantages it holds over the Merc make it feel worth the stretch, and that’s why it wins this comparison test.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/2025-mercedes-amg-g-63-facelift-review-madcap-machine-434370#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The Mercedes-AMG G 63 is the madcap of the automotive world. How else would you describe a boxy 4x4 ladder-frame chassis SUV with not one, not two, but three differential locks and one that also runs on performance tyres to complement a fire-breathing engine? It’s a marriage of very different worlds that somehow works. Mercedes AMG G 63 performance and powertrain It gets a few updates for 2024 and beyond to make it comfier, sportier and, ahem, more politically correct, too. The last bit is courtesy of a new 48V mild-hybrid system. It adds in 22hp, but even when it’s giving its all, it’s merely playing a supporting role to the 585hp, 850Nm, 4.0-litre V8 twin-turbo petrol engine. The engine is relentless in its build of power, and the big power yields big performance. It’s got a 220kph top speed, and we managed a 4.6-second 0-100kph time. Nuts for something as big as a one-bedroom flat and as heavy and aerodynamic as a bank vault. Making the acceleration figure possible is the launch control, which is among the new additions to the G 63. The way the G 63 squats in preparation for launch and then takes off is a sight to behold. What’s also so integral to the G 63 experience is the way it sounds. Those quad exhausts, two on each side, will have you break into a laugh every time you press down on the accelerator pedal. There’s this omnipresent woofle that grows into a growl when you go a bit faster, and then it just erupts when you let loose, letting out a roar a lion would be proud of. The 9-speed gearbox also wastes no time going up and down the gears as you please. In fact, you’ll often downshift just for the accompanying sound effect. Mercedes AMG G 63 ride and handling The G 63 hasn’t just learned to sprint but has taken some yoga lessons to become more agile, too. It handles well by G-Class standards, and that’s thanks to AMG’s new Active Ride Control Suspension. The system does away with physical anti-roll bars and replaces them with a network of hydraulic actuators that connect all four corners of the car and adjust the load settings depending on the driving input. Body control is hugely improved, and it doesn’t feel as top-heavy as older Gs. There’s good weight at the steering, too, and good enough connect. Still, the G 63 is no Urus, Cayenne or RS Q8 in the bends and won’t set records, but who cares? Of more relevance is the G 63’s ride comfort. It feels lumpy in a way you wouldn’t expect a luxury SUV to feel, and the G can’t hide the fact that there’s a ladder-frame chassis underneath. That being said, there’s also a toughness that you don’t get in any other model of this price. Also, as we established over our recent Off-road Day featuring a G 400 d, there’s little to stop a G-Class in the rough. This versatility is part of the G 63’s allure. Mercedes AMG G 63 exterior design No matter what the setting, the G 63 grabs eyeballs. It’s boxy, it’s classic, it’s cool. And I think you’ll agree, it can rock some bright colours. There are 37 colours to choose from, and you can get into the nitty-gritty of the finish for the grille or other embellishments on the SUV. Of course, there’s also a whole range of wheels to choose from, with sizes ranging between 20 and 22 inches. With 37 paint, 10 wheel and 4 trim pack options, no 2 G 63s should look the same. One of the new inclusions with this update is keyless entry. It was apparently a task to incorporate the functionality while retaining the old-school door handles. Ah, and I almost forgot, there are aero upgrades, too! Well, there are mini-spoilers around the A-pillar and the top of the windscreen, as well as a new slot at the rear wheel arch. Hey, at least they tried. Mercedes AMG G 63 interior and features The G 63 sits high off the ground, so you’ll have to use the footboard to pull yourself in. Not much has changed inside, but the centre screen is now a touchscreen. Yup, the G-Class never had a touchscreen before this. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is nice to use and also packs in wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Other changes include an off-road modes shortcut that gives easy access to the off-road menus as well as the ‘transparent bonnet’ function that gives a feed from under the car. It’s very helpful when you’re over uneven ground. New AMG steering is most notable change inside the updated G 63. Personalisation program allows you to spec the interior to your liking; for big money, of course. Do note, a lot of what you see inside this very car is part of the options list. The colour of the weave, the seat stitching, the finish to the panels and even the leather finish for the roof – you can spec your G to your liking, for big money, of course. And remember all those sounds I touched upon earlier that are very intrinsic to the AMG G 63 experience? Well, there’s a lot more, such as the thunk on door shut, the door locks that sound like a rifle being loaded, and the click of the air conditioning vents. The G 63 really feels like a military-grade tool that also does glamour well. Other highlights include 64-colour ambient lighting, a 360-degree camera and a fantastic 18-speaker Burmester sound system. Crisp and vibrant digital dials get multiple themes. ADAS is included, but the auto braking is too sensitive for our conditions, and you have to remember to switch it off every time you start the car. If you’re looking for the most spacious luxury SUV, the G-Class isn’t it. Yes, it is huge on the outside, and the legroom is more than adequate, but it is not as much as you’d expect from something that costs so much. Optional rear seat entertainment screens should help keep passengers at the back occupied. The G’s side hinge tailgate opens to reveal ample luggage space. Our test vehicle came specced with an optional cherry wood floor that would add another Rs 3.8 lakh to the tally.

It’s overpriced, the ride is lumpy for something so expensive, and space isn’t the best either. But you can’t think of a G 63 objectively. It’s loud, proud and mad fun. 12.3-inch central display is now a touchscreen. Also, before your CA dissuades you from dropping Rs 3.6 crore (ex-showroom, before options) on one, you should reason that a G 63 isn’t quite as depreciating an asset as other cars. New car prices are only on the rise (it cost Rs 2.15 crore at launch in 2018), and you’ll always have a ready buyer for your G 63 if you choose to sell. Get in line, though. The 120 AMG G 63s allocated to India for this year are already spoken for.

    "description": "The Union Budget is India's annual financial blueprint that steers the nation's economic direction. For the automotive sector, particularly MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises), this year’s budget holds special significance as the government has made a greater provision to push for EV and battery manufacturing. The incentives come in three key areas: Customs duty exemption on 35 capital goods for EV battery manufacturing Support for domestic manufacturing of motors, controllers and other components Integration of EV manufacturing with Clean Tech manufacturing program This budget continues its commitment to making India a hub for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing. A comprehensive Clean Tech manufacturing support program has been announced to improve domestic value addition in solar PV cells, EV batteries, motors and controllers. The initiative includes 35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing being added to the exempted list. The focus extends to building the entire EV ecosystem, including support for battery recycling and creating charging infrastructure. Special emphasis is being placed on developing high-capacity batteries and promoting research in battery technology. For automotive MSMEs, which form the backbone of the component manufacturing ecosystem, budget provisions for working capital support, technology upgradation funds, and easier credit access are crucial for their survival and growth.

    "description": "The German custom powerhouse WalzWerk has just marked its 35th birthday in the best way it knows—with a handsome BMW boxer bobber. A Frenchman in Morocco takes on the world with a Honda XL 125S, an Indonesian custom shop builds a Honda Trail replica out of a Suzuki, and a Japanese privateer builds a sharp Yamaha SRX600 café racer. BMW R80RT by WalzWerk Marcus Walz is unstoppable. His shop, WalzWerk, built their 1,000th custom motorcycle just over two years ago, and they’ve just hit another significant milestone—their 35th birthday. To celebrate, the German outfit has designed a new limited edition BMW boxer bobber, based on their made-to-order Schizzo custom series. But you’d better act fast if you want one, because almost all of the 35 units they’re building are already spoken for.…",

    "description": "Anyone who’s ever built something will tell you that inspiration can come from the strangest places. In the motorcycle world, it could be a headlight bucket, paint chip or a set of old bias ply tires. For builder Bret Crandell it was something as simple as a 1977 Florida State Inspection sticker that set the tone for his 1966 BMW R50/2 build. While he sought to honor the life his project bike had already lived, the barn-find Beemer proved to be the perfect canvas for a few of his racier ideas as well. Bret hails from Flint, Michigan, which he affectionately calls ‘a post-industrial wasteland city,’ and, he recently quit his full-time gig at Chrysler to pursue his passion. His business is Obsessive Compulsive Design, specializing in the development and manufacture of custom motorcycle parts.…",

    "title": "GLORY RESTORED: Chasing the Alpine Dream",
    "link": "",
    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",
