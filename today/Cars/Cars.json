    "description": "I love using my Suzuki Access to bop around the city. It’s comfortable, practical, frugal and zippy. So much so that I haven’t ever found myself wanting another commuter. That was until the Ather Rizta entered our long-term fleet. Ever since it arrived, my Access hasn’t seen much action, and in the month that I’ve spent with the Rizta, I’ve covered more than 500km. Two things that have made a positive impression on me in these early days are its enormous boot and intuitive regenerative braking. Its 34-litre boot is deep enough to fit in a lot of stuff, along with the big charger. The 34-litre boot here isn’t the biggest in the e-scooter game, but it’s almost double the size of the one on my Access (and most other ICE scooters). I’ve managed to fit in my fully packed Kriega sling bag and the bulky charger supplied with the Rizta, with room to spare. This is also the only e-scooter (besides the River Indie) that can accommodate an ECE-certified full-face helmet, which I think deserves praise. Unlocking the boot always needs two hands, which is frustrating on a daily basis. The trouble is that when I need to open the boot, it doesn’t unlock with just the twist of the key. I need to press down on the seat exactly where the locking mechanism is located with the key in the unlock position to get it to release every single time. This isn’t a big negative, but it is one of those things that gets mildly irritating with time. Another positive here is Ather’s Magic Twist feature, wherein the regen progressively slows you down when you twist the throttle backwards. This has proved to be quite a treat in Mumbai’s typically staccato traffic. At speeds below 40kph, with a bit of planning, I didn’t have to use the brakes and relied solely on the regen to stop.   Ather’s Magic Twist is intuitive and works beautifully well in city traffic. But there is a problem here. Locking the rear wheel up is all too easy when you’re coming to a halt hurriedly. Part of that blame must be attributed to Mumbai’s atrociously slippery concrete roads, but Magic Twist and the rear brake working in tandem seem to enhance this tendency. This has forced me to actively pay attention to how much pressure I apply on the brake lever. Either that, or I avoid using the regenerative braking when coming to a halt quickly, using only the brakes. Barring these irritants, it has been smooth sailing with the Rizta, and I’m looking forward to adding more digits to the odo reading. Strong regen, along with rear brake usage, can cause the rear wheel to lock up easily. Nevertheless, the biggest advantage of any EV has to be the beautifully low running cost. Per my usage, I spend around Rs 1,000 on fuel every month with my Access, but using the Rizta, that number drops to roughly just Rs 120! Also See: TVS iQube S long-term review, 2,200km report",

    "description": "The Q7 was the Q that gave Audi India their big break. It established the brand and has since been a trusty badge if you want a big, luxury 7-seater SUV. However, competition has never been more cut-throat, so the Q7 has received another makeover to keep it relevant. Audi Q7 exterior and design It still gets the recognisable face with the wide grille and sharp lines, but look closer and you will spot small vertical chrome elements on the grille giving it a bejeweled look, the Matrix LED headlamps are even more intricate, and the bumpers are sportier and feature ducts and faux metal panels. Over to the side, the wheels are upsized from 19 inchers to 20 inchers, but the silhouette and lines are the same. Dimensionally, too, there is no change. So, the 3,000mm wheelbase and 5-metre-plus length continue to offer a strong road presence. At the rear, the LED tail-lamps get new detailing and the bumpers are redesigned. Trapezoidal exhaust tips complete the look and the Q7 continues to flaunt the serious, no-nonsense look. Audi Q7 interior, features and space Inside, there is a new dark, open-pore wood panel on the dashboard and door pads. Barring that though, you’d be lost trying to explain the new bits. However, while things may not be new, the quality levels are exceptional, and it's something we have always loved about the Q7. The dual-screen setup, with its click-based interface isn’t all too modern, but the resolution is crisp. We would have also liked wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other modern amenities that one would expect in a luxury SUV like ventilated seats, wireless connectivity and ADAS are missing, too. The Q7 does get lane keep assist, but a full ADAS suite would have sweetened the deal. The front seats are hugely comfy and supportive. You can easily spend long hours in the driver's seat. Middle-row space is impressive even for passengers over six feet. The seats can also be adjusted for length, thereby adding more legroom or aiding more space for the third-row passengers. You get four-zone climate control with vents in the centre console and B-pillars, manual sunblinds, and a panoramic sunroof big enough to be enjoyed by rear-seat passengers without any compromise. The third row is best suited for children or short adults on short drives. But you do miss AC vents and it can get a bit stuffy. Best then to electronically flip down the third row and use it as a massive boot. Now, while space isn’t a concern, what might have some buyers alarmed is the spare wheel, or the lack thereof. You only get a puncture repair kit, and since the tyres are not run-flats, you need to be extra cautious. Audi Q7 engine, performance, gearbox Powering the Q7 is a lovely 3.0-litre, 340hp turbo-petrol V6 engine. Refinement is simply excellent and this Q7, despite being a big and heavy luxury SUV, is rapid! 0-100kph is a quick 5.6 seconds and there is also a raspy exhaust note as you get closer to the redline. Mated to the engine is an 8-speed automatic gearbox that shifts without a fuss. It is quick, has impressive kickdown times and is enjoyable to use. The engine thrums along at 100kph at just a shade over 1,500rpm and the Q7 can munch on the kilometres happily. Audi Q7 ride, comfort, handling While the engine and gearbox are the perfect partners, they are slightly pulled back by the suspension. The Q7 gets adaptive air suspension, but for the more balanced ‘Comfort’ mode, they have kept it on the softer side. As a result there is a fair amount of vertical movement inside the cabin over undulations. The car even nose-dives under braking. A cheat code to counter this is to use the drive modes, and more specifically, the Individual mode. In this mode, you can set the engine and gearbox to be at a relaxed setting that suits the highways, but switch the suspension setting to ‘Dynamic’ that tightens the setup. This ensures you have less pitching and the SUV's more sure-footed. Where the soft setup makes up though is over bad roads, where it absorbs the harsh shocks and thuds that make their way inside. Handling is nothing to boast of, but it's as you'd expect from a big luxury SUV like this. The quattro system ensures there is grip at all times, but there is so much mass moving at such a high speed, it will understeer if you push it. Audi Q7 price and verdict Prices for the updated Q7 start from Rs 88 lakh and this top-spec Technology trim is priced at Rs 97 lakh (ex-showroom, India). This variant goes up against the Mercedes-Benz GLE and the BMW X5, both of which have moved much ahead in terms of modernity. What will be of interest to buyers then, is the lower-spec model that makes for a good value proposition. The ride is comfy, the space and quality is top-level and the V6 is butter smooth. It's a comfy cruiser for those who want to be chauffeured around with little fuss. Also see:    Audi Q7 facelift launched at Rs 88.66 lakh Audi Q7 facelift video review",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/honda-unveil-0-series-suv-concept-next-month",
    "description": "The SUV concept (right) will be showcased at CES alongside the Saloon prototype… The SUV is one of seven planned 0 Series models set to arrive before the end of the decade A prototype of the Honda 0 Series SUV will be unveiled next month ahead of production starting in 2026. To be showcased alongside the previously revealed Honda 0 Series Saloon prototype at CES in Las Vegas, the SUV is the second of seven planned 0 Series models that will arrive before the end of the decade. These futuristic-looking new-era Honda EVs will all sit on a new bespoke platform developed from a clean sheet of paper.  The first to arrive will be the saloon, which will offer around 482bhp and a range of more than 300 miles.  This will be followed in 2026 by the production version of the new SUV prototype, which is expected to be what Honda calls its mid-sized SUV. A smaller entry-level SUV and a larger range-topping SUV will join the line up shortly after. By the end of the decade, a compact SUV, a small SUV and a smaller saloon are also due. Honda 0 Series: powertrain, chassis and technology The Japanese manufacturer has already revealed early technical details of the platform's capabilities at a special preview event, which included the chance to drive an Accord test mule fitted with a development version of the new powertrain. The 0 Series Saloon will be offered with both single- and dual-motor powertrains, featuring newly developed compact e-axles that, Honda claims, can be mounted lower in the car, freeing up space and enabling the vehicle to have a smaller frontal area to improve aerodynamic efficiency. The reduced size of the e-axle motors has been achieved in part by repositioning the inverter to make the units shorter. At least initially, 0 Series models will feature two different e-axle units in three different combinations. Entry-level models will have a 241bhp motor on the rear axle and offer rear-wheel drive. There will also be two dual-motor, four-wheel-drive versions. The top-end models will use the same motor on the front axle, giving a system output of 482bhp (although Honda has yet to confirm if this will be the maximum output). There will also be a 4WD version that mates the 241bhp rear motor with a 67bhp unit on the front axle. That smaller e-axle will be shared with Honda’s next-generation hybrid models. The battery pack will fit under the floor as in other EVs, although Honda said the focus is on making it as thin as possible, claiming it's around 8mm thinner than EV batteries from rival firms. As a result, Honda says the platform enables the 0 Series Saloon to be less than 1400mm in height while offering more interior space than current EVs. The key to the thinner battery design will be the use of a new mega-casting tool to produce the battery pack case in three parts, rather than around 60 separate pieces as previously. Casting it in three sections rather than a single unit will allow two different sizes of battery pack (for medium- and large-size models) to be produced on the same production line. While mega-casting will initially be used only for the battery casing, Honda is aiming to eventually use it to produce the front and rear assemblies of the car as single pieces. That is likely to be introduced when a planned new EV-only assembly plant in Canada is opened near the end of the decade. While Honda has yet to give full details, the 0 Series Saloon and other medium-size models will feature a battery using nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry with a capacity of between 80kWh and 90kWh, giving an estimated range of more than 300 miles. Meanwhile, large models will have a pack of around 100kWh. It's unclear if different battery options will be offered on each model. As well as extensive use of mega-casting, Honda will use a number of new production techniques designed to increase the platform’s rigidity while reducing weight. That includes expanded use of a system called '3D friction stir welding', which can join metals without melting them, along with 'constant DC chopping' (CDC) spot welding, which controls the heat used to weld joints better. The use of both manufacturing techniques is claimed to result in greater rigidity and decreased deformation. In addition, Honda said it has developed the body structure of the 0 Series platform to disperse the impact of a collision to the side of the structure, which reduces the space at the front and rear required for protection for the battery. Overall, Honda claims the 0 Series Saloon will weigh around 100kg less than a current EV of its size, which is also key to the firm's promise to offer an enjoyable driving experience. The car will feature a steer-by-wire throttle, which suggests that the yoke offered on the concept car could reach production. The control unit for the system will be integrated with those for the suspension, brakes and regen system to aid handling. The 0 Series Saloon will feature active aerodynamics that can channel air underneath the car via sculpted bodywork, adding up to six miles of range, as well as creating downforce. 3D gyro sensors, developed for Honda’s humanoid robots, will be used to automatically stabilise the car. Notably, the lightweight aluminium frame has been designed to flex when cornering at speeds, pushing load onto the outside of the wheels to improve cornering balance. All 0 Series models will be software-defined vehicles, able to accept over-the-air software updates to gain new features and upgrades. They will be designed to offer up to level-three (‘eyes-off’) autonomy in certain situations, thanks to a range of camera, radar and lidar sensors.  Production of the 0 Series models will initially begin at Honda’s plant in Ohio, the US, which will be adapted so that ICE and EV cars can be made on the same line. That will be achieved by the use of a new flex cell production system, which makes greater use of decentralised production stations with chassis and parts moved via autonomous robots. This means Honda will be able to constantly adapt ICE and EV output based on demand. A new plant dedicated to EV production, along with a battery plant, will be built in Ontario, Canada by 2028.",

    "title": "Report: Nio to launch in UK in early 2025 with new Onvo L60",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/report-nio-launch-uk-early-2025-new-onvo-l60",
    "description": "New L60 is said to be most aero-efficient SUV on sale Lack of import tariffs means UK will be first European market to get Chinese firm's new affordable EV brand Nio will reportedly bring its new affordable EV brand Onvo to Europe next year, starting with the launch of the L60 coupé-SUV in the UK.  As reported by Automotive News Europe, Nio's product planning boss Eric Yu explained that Onvo would come to the UK first because, unlike the EU, it doesn't put import tariffs on Chinese-built EVs - which will have been a crucial motivator, given Onvo's value-focused billing. Nio's EVs are currently subject to a 31% import tariff in the EU, up from 10% in 2023. Similarly impacted car makers, including BYD, Chery, Mini, Polestar and Volvo are moving production of some EVs from China to Europe to circumvent the tariffs, but Nio hasn't announced any plans to build cars in Europe, having passed on the chance to take over Audi's EV factory in Belgium. Nio started selling EVs in Europe in 2021 but has yet to make its way to the UK, so the expansion of Onvo will mark the company's first foray into the market. Per Automotive News Europe, Yu said that Onvo exports to Europe would begin when production reaches 30,000 units per month, which is expected to be around March 2025. It isn't yet clear how the cars will be sold in the UK; Autocar has approached Nio for comment. News of Onvo's expansion outside China comes just days before Nio is due to unwrap the first model from its second new EV Brand, Firefly, which is conceived as a maker of premium small EVs with a global focus. It has yet to confirm European timelines for Firefly, though.  Nio's existing European line-up is oriented towards the premium end of the market, and so the EU's import tariffs have a less dramatic impact on profitability, but it's likely that the firm will want to build its more value-focused Onvo and Firefly models locally, in order to keep the prices down.  The L60, Onvo's first model, is a Tesla Model Y-rivalling crossover that majors on practicality and efficiency. It's sold in China at the equivalent of £24,000 but is likely to be priced nearer to its American rival at just north of £40,000 in Europe.  The L60 showcases how Onvo will target family buyers in the lower premium segment, with an overt focus on interior space, safety and utility. It claims a significant advantage over the Model Y in being equipped with 900V electrical architecture for ultra-rapid charging and will be equipped with a choice of three BYD-supplied battery packs offering 344, 454 or 620 miles of range (according to China's generous CLTC test cycle). The L60 is also more efficient than the Model Y, Nio has claimed, with a consumption rating of 5.1mpkWh - a figure that owes much to its slippery silhouette. It's said to be the most aerodynamically efficient SUV on the market, with a drag coefficient of just 0.23Cd.  Full dimensions remain under wraps, but Nio said the short overhangs maximise space in the cabin and \"with ingenious storage design, every occupant can bring along their own luggage\".  The L60 is equipped with the same advanced driver assistance functions as Nio's own EVs. It's also compatible with the firm's trademark battery-swap stations, meaning it can gain a fully charged battery in just three minutes at more than 1000 sites across China - as well as being able to top up conventionally at 25,000 of Nio's own public chargers. With no battery swap infrastructure yet installed in the UK, it's unlikely that the L60 will be offered here with that functionality, at least initially.",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/performance-choppers-mb-cycles",
    "description": "Given how long the chopper scene has been around, builders are spoilt for choice when sourcing parts for their projects. But finding the right engine, frame, and running gear for a custom chopper is only half the struggle. You need to know exactly which parts to pick—and you need to know how to combine them to create a cohesive machine. Martin Becker at MB Cycles excels at this. The German custom bike builder is a matchmaker of sorts, combining bits from wildly different sources to create jaw-dropping V-twin performance choppers. He’s a master of stance, proportions, and details, and knows how to make modern and vintage details harmonize. The two performance choppers pictured here were built using one of Martin’s favorite combos—a West Coast Choppers CFL frame and an S\u0026S Cycle V-twin motor.…",

    "description": "The 1930s proved to be a golden era for V-twin-powered American motorcycles, and if you’re fortunate enough to own one, you’re sitting on a substantial pile of dough. Harley-Davidson’s 1936 EL Knucklehead is regarded by many as the single most desirable classic HD and the right Indian Four will net over $200,000 these days. But that’s relative chump change compared to a little-known marque named Crocker, as one of these precious V-Twins can be worth a half-million to the full seven figures. Founded in 1901 and 1903 respectively, Indian and Harley-Davidson enjoyed tenured dominance over any would-be newcomers to the American market. Still, Albert Crocker took the opportunity to learn from both marques. An engineer by trade and an accomplished rider on the weekends, Crocker found himself rubbing elbows with Oscar Hedström and Charles Hendee and secured a job at Indian.…",
