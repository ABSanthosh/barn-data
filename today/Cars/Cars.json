    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/next-nissan-leaf-be-launched-vehicle-grid-charging-uk",
    "description": "Leaf, Qashqai and Juke successors will arrive from 2026 with a system that could help cut costs The electric successor to the Nissan Leaf will feature bi-directional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging available for use by UK customers when it is launched in 2026. Nissan says it is the first car firm to both develop a “breakthrough” on-board two-way charging system and secure the certification needed to offer the vehicle-to-grid charging service – in which energy stored in a car’s battery can be sold back to the grid – in the UK. The service will be offered on “selected electric vehicles” and use a special wallbox that has been developed in partnership with Belgian charger manufacturer Dreev to be capable of accepting electricity in two directions. Hugues Desmarchelier, Nissan’s global electrification ecosystem chief, described the technology as a “potential game-changer for how we view the car” and said the technology would feature on “almost all the new EVs that we will launch on the market after 2026”.  This means the system will be offered on the three new EVs that will serve as successors to the current Qashqai, Juke and Leaf and are set to be built as Nissan’s Sunderland plant – but not the EV successor to the Micra, which will be built by Alliance partner Renault alongside the new 5. The Renault 5 is capable of bi-directional charging but will run on a different system, which Desmarchelier hinted would be offered on the next-gen Micra.  V2G effectively allows cars to become energy storage devices when plugged into the grid, so they could be charged at times when renewable energy is prevalent and demand is low, and then at times of peak demand the electricity in them could be sold back to the grid. That is beneficial to the grid infrastructure, and Nissan estimates it could reduce annual charging costs by up to 50% – while also reducing the CO2 emissions produced by charging by 30%. According to Nissan, the new bi-directional wallbox required to feed electricity back to the grid will cost around the same as a current standard mono-directional unit. EV motors run on DC electricity, while grid electricity runs on AC. To cope with that, EVs now feature on-board converters that switch the electricity fed into a vehicle when charging from AC to DC so that it can be used to power the motor.  Nissan’s system effectively allows the car’s on-board system to reverse that process, so that it can turn stored DC energy back into AC, allowing it to be fed back to the grid through a specially developed wallbox. The new system builds on 40 V2G trial projects that Nissan has run with specially converted Leaf and Ariya EVs in multiple countries in recent years. The new wallbox and on-board unit has been tested on a specially modified Ariya in a trial using the University of Nottingham’s Creative Energy Homes project. V2G charging has been cited by the government as being key to managing future energy demand and usage in the UK, and Nissan’s announcement has been welcomed by Lilian Greenwood, the  minister for the future of roads. She said: “A greener transport network is a key priority for this government, and by working together we will boost consumer confidence and achieve our shared goal of getting more EVs on the road.” The UK will be the first country that the service will be offered in, but Nissan is aiming to expand it to other markets afterwards. The V2G service feeds into Nissan’s wider plan to achieve or exceed cost parity between EVs and combustion-engined cars by 2030, and in its goal to become fully carbon neutral by 2050.",

A returning name with a completely new format and approach, Drivers of Change is a sibling event to Autocar’s Great Women initiative, which celebrates the automotive industry as a place that welcomes everybody.  Autocar Drivers of Change winners will be individuals who are driving change and promoting diversity in their business in whichever role they perform. Judges will be looking for entries that can demonstrate the adoption of diversity of background, experience and thought in their business. Winners will be named in nine categories but anyone appearing on the shortlist will be able to call themselves an 'Autocar Driver of Change'. They will all be celebrated at a special event hosted at the SMMT’s London headquarters on 6 February 2025. The top candidates will be selected from the following areas of the car industry: marketing; manufacturing; operations; PR and communications; purchasing; retail; sales; talent; and vehicle development. Individuals can put themselves forward for consideration, or can be nominated by friends, colleagues and employers. The awards are open to all working in the British car industry, and Britons working abroad. Do you know someone you could nominate? Think far and wide within your organisation - we’re encouraging people to think outside of their immediate team for people deserving of an award. Those nominating will need to supply evidence of the nominee’s business and/or industry impact. There is no limit to the number of nominations that can be submitted by a company. Head here to submit your nomination before the deadline on 25 October.",

    "description": "Building a café racer with an older motorcycle usually involves two phases; getting the bike running, and customizing it. And if the bike is really beaten up, the first phase can be the hardest—especially if the engine is too far gone. Marshall Hewitt had a novel approach to this particular challenge. This ex-police 1991 BMW K100 was a true basket case when he found it, with a seized engine among the myriad issues that needed attention. So Marshall side-stepped the problem entirely, by simply yanking the engine out and replacing it with a modern electric powertrain. An automation engineer by trade, Marshall has been building café racers as a hobby for a few years now. He normally works on bikes with internal combustion engines, but he’s not averse to trying new things.…",

It was a roller coaster of a month with the most fearsome outlaws that the American blacktop had ever seen, and the photos they produced are a fantastic documentation of these mid-century gunslingers. Though Ray and Bride risked life and limb embedding themselves with the lawless outcasts, the story was never published. However, the photos have been floating in and out of the motorcycling community’s collective consciousness since surfacing and have cast their spell on Greg Hebard of Regatta Garage in Salt Lake City, Utah.

We also believe this example to be the 2nd lowest mileage one in the world, as we are aware of a lower mileage car located inside the borders of Russia. The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II was born out of Mercedes' ambition to dominate the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), Germany’s premier touring car championship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As DTM regulations required manufacturers to base their race cars on production models, Mercedes developed the EVO II as a homologation special, producing only 502 units for road use. Furthermore, the EVO II introduced significant upgrades over the EVO I, primarily in aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling. Its bold, wind tunnel-tested body kit featured a larger rear wing and front splitter for improved downforce and high-speed stability. The 2.5-liter engine was also more powerful, delivering 235 horsepower compared to the EVO I’s 204 hp. The EVO II’s adjustable suspension, larger 17-inch wheels, and enhanced chassis provided sharper handling and a more responsive driving experience, making it better suited for both the track and the road. These refinements solidified its dominance in DTM racing. Continue...",

Triumph Tiger 900 GT: engine, performance, refinement The main improvements are within the 888cc three-cylinder engine, and multiple changes have resulted in not just more power and torque but also the promise of more efficiency. The previous Tiger 900 was far from slow, but the jump from 95hp/87Nm to 108hp/90Nm makes the bike feel even more potent and reactive. It looks familiar, but the side panels have been redesigned. But it’s not just about speed because this engine is also really lovely to ride at a relaxed pace. It’s torquey and very flexible with the gears, so you can ride over speed breakers in third and use sixth as low as 40kph. The fuelling is also beautifully smooth, and you can open the accelerator at very low revs without any signs of protest. This means less clutch use – both off the road and in heavy city traffic, and that’s always nice, even though this clutch isn’t particularly heavy to operate. I’m also a fan of the sound and feel of this engine with its deep, raspy growl. That said, while it’s characterful, it’s also far from perfect. The big complaint with the 900 engine was its high-rpm vibration, and Triumph has tried to improve that. Heavier bar-end weights and rubber-damped handlebar mounts have made some very clear improvements, but this is still not the smoothest engine in its class at high speeds. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: comfort, ride \u0026 handling Wind protection is usually based on your height and helmet, but I find that this height-adjustable windscreen results in some uncomfortable helmet buffeting at high speeds. Thankfully, the rest of the ergos are beautiful. Despite having gone up by 10mm, the 820-840mm seat height is very low for an ADV of this size and capability, and even tall riders will be comfy here. The seat is also new, and the comfort is fantastic. Seat and suspension comfort are both superb. The highly impressive chassis remains unchanged, and some fantastic suspension allows this bike to tear effortlessly through any form of terrible road. Like before, there’s a 45mm USD fork with 180mm of travel and a monoshock with 170mm of travel. The suspension is adjustable, but not fully – compression and rebound at the front and preload and rebound at the rear. The stock settings are good enough, but with a remote rear preload adjuster, you can easily make any changes you need. Even though the GT is the road-biased bike in the line-up, it’s fun to ride off-road and will easily get you through one of those Ladakh adventures. But you must remember that it’s running road tyres on alloy wheels and has no crash protection; Triumph has even removed the earlier GT’s plastic sump guard. For most casual ADV riders, this will be more than capable enough off-road, and I’d only recommend going for the Rally if you really want that hardcore capability or taller seat. Despite being the road-biased 900, it’s still surprisingly capable off-road. Road handling is neutral and easy but not particularly sporty, and you won’t have to work too hard to scrape its footpegs. It’s definitely no Multistrada V2 in the corners, but it’s still good enough that you’ll have fun. The impressive braking hardware is the same, but there’s a new linked-braking system that adds in some rear brake when you use the front. It feels quite natural while bringing some more stability to the braking. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: verdict, price, service cost As for features, the biggest change is the new 7-inch TFT from the Tiger 1200. This one has a great layout and, thankfully, gets rid of those weird layouts from the old Tiger 900. But, like in the Tiger 1200, it takes an eternity to boot up and feels laggy to operate. Triumph really should have fixed this. New TFT looks great, but very slow to boot up. But what’s most frustrating is that Triumph still expects you to pay an additional Rs 43,531 if you want a quickshifter. It’s a feature I really missed, and not getting one in this day and age on a Rs 14 lakh motorcycle is quite annoying. Thankfully, you get most of the essentials you’d want on a big ADV, such as two power outlets, cruise control and heated grips; you can even opt for heated seats. The Tiger 900 has always been the sweet spot in the big ADV segment in India, and this latest update only sweetens that package, especially since it costs just Rs 20,000 more than before. Tigers have also built a great reputation for reliability over the years, and they run fine on regular petrol. However, there are some cost concerns. The first is that the Tiger 900 GT is a CBU, so the on-road price gets very high in certain states that heavily tax CBUs – it’s nearly Rs 18 lakh in Mumbai. The other disappointment is that spares and service costs for the big bikes actually went up instead of down and are now about 20-30 percent more expensive than before since Bajaj took over Triumph’s operations in India. Nevertheless, the Triumph Tiger 900 GT is a fantastic all-round motorcycle, and it continues to be my go-to recommendation for the casual adventure rider looking for a premium midsize ADV.

    "description": "The monsoon is a tough time for any motorcycle helmet. Even the best lids in the world eventually succumb to the odour buildup that comes from having wet interiors for prolonged periods of time. Fogging is another issue, and it can happen even in a hot city like Mumbai if the visor is closed in heavy rain and you’re stuck in a traffic jam. This is the ideal time to try out some helmet-specific care products, and Big Bad Bikes sells a little kit from Muc-Off for just that purpose. Helpfully named the Helmet Care Kit, you get three products and two fancy microfibre cleaning cloths. The products include an anti-fog spray, a foam cleaner and another small spray bottle for cleaning your helmet, goggles and visor. Let’s start with the foam cleaner, which shoots out a thick blast of foam that you are supposed to fill your helmet (or gloves/boots) with. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe away the excess before leaving the helmet to dry. The foam does a really good job of getting rid of the odours and giving the helmet a fresh feel, and it’s something I’ll make sure to have around every monsoon. The anti-fog spray also worked a treat, and the effect lasts for quite a few days as long as you don’t touch or wipe down the surface. It’s also claimed to help water bead away if you spray it onto the outside of your visor, but this effect wasn’t as impressive as I’d like. My go-to product for that hydrophobic coating on a visor remains the Motosolutions Rain Coat cream that we reviewed a few years ago. As for the little bottle of helmet and visor cleaner, it works as advertised and is helpful at getting stubborn stains or dead bugs off. Then again, I usually get the same job done with a mild soap solution, and while the Muc-Off cleaner takes a little less effort, it’s not a game-changer. Muc-Off makes some really interesting products, and many of them are biodegradable, which is always a nice thing. On the other hand, its products are also expensive, and this kit will cost you just over Rs 2,700. Happily, you don’t need to buy the whole kit, and if you’d like just one or two products in particular, they’re all also sold separately by Big Bad Bikes.

    "description": "With the introduction of this CNG version, the Tata Nexon becomes the first car in India to be offered with four fuel options – petrol, diesel, CNG and electric. It’s also the first CNG to use a turbocharged engine and come with a 6-speed manual ’box. Here’s what it’s like to drive. Tata Nexon CNG: exterior and interior Cosmetically, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell the Nexon CNG apart from the rest of the ICE range. The only tell is the ‘i-CNG’ badge on the bootlid and the CNG stickers in the front and rear windshield. Other than that, it retains the standard Nexon’s edgy styling with the same alloy wheel design and LED lighting elements. The Creative Ocean and white dual-tone paint scheme you see here also makes it stand out. Save for the iCNG badge, its exterior is identical to the rest of the ICE Nexon range. Inside, too, the changes are minimal but there are some noticeable ones. For starters, this variant – Persona in Tata speak – gets all-black upholstery with blue stitching on the seats.The trim piece on the dash is also slightly different. There’s a CNG button on the centre console that lets you switch between fuels on the fly, there are CNG-specific graphics in the digital instrument cluster that show you the usage split between petrol and CNG modes, and a CNG-only trip meter. The rotary knob for the drive modes – just behind the gear lever – has also been done away with and it’s replaced by a small cubby that can hold small items like the key fob. Perhaps, Tata could have used this opportunity to give the Nexon at least one proper cup holder; it continues to get them inside the glove box. The front seats are sufficiently large and supportive, and it’s easy to find an ideal driving position. At the back, there’s enough room to sit three passengers in relative comfort and it’s nice to see that the panoramic sunroof hasn’t eaten into the headroom. Boot space is down by 21 litres compared to the petrol Nexon, at 321 litres. The Nexon uses Tata’s innovative twin cylinder tech, which means that you don’t lose out on proper usable boot space or a spare wheel. The two CNG tanks, which have a capacity of 60 litres, are placed below the boot floor while the spare wheel is mounted under the car. Boot space has reduced by 61 litres over the standard Nexon to 321 litres (measured from floor to roof), but you can still fit in a couple of suitcases and soft bags. The space saver spare wheel, meanwhile, can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor and it's a relatively fuss-free affair. Tata Nexon CNG features and safety Tata was the first manufacturer to offer a CNG even on top-end variants of the Tiago and Tigor, and the Nexon is no different. The Nexon CNG is available in four trim levels, so buyers can opt for the lower running costs of the CNG without having to compromise on features.  The Fearless + PS DT variant you see here is loaded with equipment,with the headlining feature, quite literally, being the panoramic sunroof.This has debuted on the CNG and we expect it to trickle down to the petrol and diesel versions soon. Other features include leatherette upholstery,ventilated front seats (not electrically adjustable), two 10.25-inch screens for the infotainment and instrument cluster, auto climate control, auto headlamps and wipers, a wireless phone charger, and a superb-sounding JBL audio system. But there are some glitches with the screens that need to be ironed out. Rear seat is spacious and it's nice that the panoramic sunroof hasn't compromised headroom. Safety kit like six airbags and ESP are standard on all variants, with the top-spec variant getting a crisp and high-res 360-degree camera, a tyre pressure monitor, front parking sensors and an auto-dimming IRVM. It also received a 5-star safety rating from Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP. There are some CNG-specific safety features that are a part of the package, too: a fire extinguisher, the engine won’t start if the fuel filler flap is open, and it’ll also cut-off CNG supply and release the gas into the atmosphere if it detects a leak in the system. Spare is mounted under the car and can be lowered by loosening a bolt in the boot floor. Tata Nexon CNG engine and gearbox Powering the Nexon CNG is the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbocharged engine as the petrol Nexon, but it makes 100hp and 170Nm –while the torque is the same, it is 20hp down over the petrol version.However,the torque band is less – it is only available for 1000rpm, unlike the petrol’s 2,500rpm. It comes only with a 6-speed manual gearbox, but Tata could offer an AMT variant later. Thanks to the single ECU that this employs, it can be started up directly in CNG mode, which helps conserve that little extra bit of petrol at startup. There is some noticeable noise and vibration from the engine at idle, but it does smoothen out on the move. Rev it hard though, and the noise does get intrusive inside. Response off the line is good, both in petrol and CNG, and it’s quite eager to respond to part throttle inputs, too. The engine revs freely, but there are some inconsistencies in the power band. Interestingly, it also revs to a more conservative redline of 5,500rpm in CNG, while in petrol it’s 6,000rpm. 1.2-litre, three-cylinder motor puts out 100hp and 170Nm. There is a noticeable difference in the two modes but it’s not as large as you’d expect. The CNG doesn’t make it feel breathless or strained, which means you’ll be happy to let it run in that mode most of the time. the ability to switch between petrol and CNG on the fly makes the entire experience seamless, butthere are no drive modes. The 6-speed manual gearbox has well-defined gates, but the throws are long and the shift action isn’t the most pleasing. What also doesn’t help matters is the snappy nature of the clutch, so you’ll have to get used to its modulation for a smoother drive.  It gets two fuel guages and CNG-specific graphics in the instrument cluster. Tata Nexon CNG performance and fuel efficiency What’s impressive though is the performance, as can be seen in the numbers. In petrol mode, it does the 0-100kph sprint in 13.97s, which is less than a second quicker than the CNG mode. What’s interesting, though, is that it's quicker to 60kph in CNG. There’s a prominent gap in the in-gear acceleration, though, with it being quicker in petrol in both the 20-80kph and 40-100kph runs. Tata Nexon CNG: performancePetrol modeCNG mode0-20kph1.87s1.72s0-40kph3.92s3.37s0-60kph6.55s6.29s0-80kph9.57s10.44s0-100kph13.97s14.69s20-80kph (in 3rd gear)11.21s12.58s40-100kph (in 4th gear)15.53s16.11sBraking (80-0kph)26.25m, 2.66s26.25m, 2.66s Tata claims an ARAI-rated efficiency figure of 24km/kg, but expect real-world figures to be lower. While we didn’t do a full fuel efficiency test, in our preliminary highway test, the Nexon CNG managed to cover 204km at an average speed of 48.19kph and took 7.5kg of gas at the end of our drive. A point to note is that Tata claims the total tank capacity is 9 kilograms; however, unlike petrol or diesel, CNG tanks often take different quantities of gas depending on the time of the day as the change in temperature and pressure can affect its density. Hence, getting an accurate reading is not simple. You’ll also have to contend with the long queues at CNG filling stations. Tata Nexon CNG ride and handling The CNG weighs about 120kg more than the petrol Nexon and Tata has made some changes to the suspension’s spring rate and damping to account for the additional weight. However, there’s not a lot of difference to the way this rides or handles compared to the standard Nexon, and as such, it remains one of this SUV’s strengths. Despite the additional weight, ride and handling remains a strength.  To account for the additional weight of the tanks at the rear, it does feel a bit softer, and though there’s slightly more vertical movement at the rear, it isn’t uncomfortable. Bump absorption remains impressive and the Nexon CNG comes across as a composed SUV. The steering is light at low speeds, enabling you to manoeuvre easily in traffic, and it weighs up nicely as you pick up pace. Tata Nexon CNG price and verdict  Prices for the Nexon CNG range from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and buyers will appreciate that it is offered from the base to the top variant. In comparison, its main rival, the Maruti Brezza CNG, is priced from Rs 9.29 lakh to 12.10 lakh (ex-showroom). What’s also nice is the 3 year/ 1,00,000km standard warranty it comes with. Nexon CNG is available in four trims, priced from Rs 8.99 lakh to 14.59 lakh. With the CNG, the Nexon now has the widest powertrain choice in our market, and given the multiple trims and variants on offer, there’s a Nexon for everyone in the range. The top variant is pricey, the refinement isn’t the best and it continues to suffer from ergonomic issues like the standard Nexon. However, with the CNG, you get the benefits of lower running costs.It also delivers in terms of its drivability and performance, so much so that you can use it in CNG mode only. That, coupled with the fact that you don’t miss out on a boot and a spare tyre, sweetens the deal further.

    "description": "Mahindra has been introducing new mass-market SUVs every few months, giving customers a lot of choices. But, this also leads to the piling up of unsold units of outgoing models. Case in point, the XUV 3XO replaced the XUV300 earlier this year and has been doing quite well in terms of sales. However, some dealers we spoke to have a few leftover units of the XUV300. Similarly, unsold stocks from model year 2023 or early 2024 of some other models such as the Bolero, Bolero Neo, XUV700, and the Scorpio N are also being sold with huge discounts this festive season. Mahindra XUV300 Save up to Rs 1.8 lakh The XUV300 has been a decent rival to the Brezza and the Nexon; however, it was marred by its dated looks and lack of cargo space. It came with an acceptable feature list, a refined 1.5-litre diesel engine, and two turbo petrol options. The SUV was not manufactured in MY2024 and was replaced by the XUV 3XO. Unsold XUV300 units are being sold at discounts of up to Rs 1.8 lakh at some outlets that have inventory. There aren’t many units left, which means customers won’t have much choice in selecting their color, variant, or engine option. Mahindra XUV400 Save up to Rs 4.4 lakh The slow-selling XUV400 EV has been available with discounts of over Rs 2 lakh for almost a year now. There are still some units left, most likely from the MY2023 production batches, which are being offered with discounts of up to a whopping Rs 4.4 lakh. Mahindra XUV700 Save up to Rs 1.8 lakh The XUV700 has seen multiple price cuts and feature rejigs this year. While most MY2023 models have been sold, some unsold units are still available with discounts of up to Rs 1.8 lakh, depending on inventory. The comparatively newer MY2024 stock is being offered with discounts of around Rs 40,000. Mahindra Bolero, Bolero Neo Save up to Rs 1.35 lakh The original Bolero has been a steady seller for the brand and is now available at discounts of around Rs 1 lakh on unsold MY2023 stock. The newer MY2024 inventory gets around 35,000 off. The Bolero Neo, on the other hand, is available with discounts of around Rs 1.35 lakh on unsold MY2023 stock. Mahindra Scorpio Classic Save up to Rs 1.2 lakh The Scorpio Classic has its own fan base. Heavily updated after the launch of the Scorpio N, it even comes with 4WD in some variants. Discounts in the range of Rs 1.2 lakh are being offered on older stock, mostly on the MY2023 units of the capable Mahindra SUV. Mahindra Scorpio N Save up to Rs 1 lakh Sales of the popular Scorpio N have plateaued at the moment, and some buyers are now opting for the new Thar Roxx instead. The Scorpio N ticks the boxes for refined engine options, manual and automatic transmission choices, multiple seating configurations, and 4WD hardware in some variants. Discounts of around Rs 1 lakh are available on the SUV this Diwali. Mahindra Thar discounts: Diwali 2024 As buyers await deliveries of the Thar Roxx, the Thar 3-door is now being offered with discounts of up to Rs 1.6 lakh.
