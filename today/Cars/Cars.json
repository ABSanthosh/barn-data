    "description": "Viaterra’s Second Skin is a base layer designed for motorcycle riding in hot weather, where the aim is to wick the sweat and moisture away from the body to help keep it cool.  As the name suggests, this is meant to be the first layer you wear under your riding jacket, and it’s designed to be as comfortable as possible. The material is nice and stretchy, and Viaterra has taken care to design the seams to be as unobtrusive as possible. The seams are quite flat, and they all have a piping of soft material around them to reduce chafing against the skin. The result of all this is that comfort is very good, and you’ll be happy wearing this for long days on the bike. What I did notice is that it’s not a high-compression fit like some of the more performance-oriented products out there. You can try a size smaller, but the sleeves might end up being too short. Ultimately, this isn’t a super snug, body-hugging fit, and I found myself preferring to use the Viaterra Second Skin for more relaxed, touring sort of riding rather than high-intensity track or off-road riding, where a compression fit is nicer. Polygiene tech helps keep odour build-up under control. One area where the Second Skin has fared well so far is in odour management. I have found that some base layers can retain odour even after a machine wash, and that hasn’t been an issue here so far. The company uses Polygiene technology, which is a silica-based solution that captures and removes odours from the material. The Second Skin is available in six sizes, and you have a choice of five subtle colours, including a couple of interesting-looking camo-style prints. There’s also a choice of lower base layers in the same material. Both the top and bottom are available for Rs 1,499 each, which is on par with the competition and a fair amount to pay.

    "description": "More than the surprise India debut of this long-wheelbase iX1 at Auto Expo 2025, it was the price it was launched at that caught us all off guard. We’ve been conditioned to believe that EVs must be more expensive than their ICE counterparts; call it a technology tax, if you will. But, at Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the iX1 LWB costs Rs 1.8 lakh less than the petrol X1 (as well as all its EV rivals), while delivering much greater room in the back seat. The price is for the first six months of production only, and is the result of local assembly, this being the first BMW EV to be brought in as a CKD. BMW iX1 LWB exterior To the uninitiated, it’s hard to spot the extra 116mm of length at first glance, but to those familiar with the standard model, the stretch is immediately evident. The good news is it doesn’t look ungainly like, say, the 5 Series did after its stretch. In fact, where the standard iX1 looks just a little comical with its exaggerated headlamps, tail-lamps and grille, you don’t get as much of that sensation with this larger vehicle, and to these eyes, the proportions are better. Exaggerated headlamps and grille look more proportional in the LWB model. It’s a shame the wheels didn’t move up a size from the 18 inchers of the previous version; in fact, even their design is the same, and they look a little lost in the large, square wheel arches. 108mm of that increased length is in the wheelbase (now up to 2,800mm), and in case you’re worried about how this affects its speed breaker-crossing ability, BMW assures us the laden ground clearance is around 175mm, which means it’s closer to 190mm unladen. 18-inch wheels look a bit small on the LWB version. Increased length aside, it’s visually identical to the short-wheelbase iX1, even retaining its M Sport styling kit. This gives some requisite attitude to what is no longer a compact vehicle in any sense, and saves it from looking too slab sided. Yes, some of the details might still polarise – tail-lamps and grille especially – but there’s no doubt it looks striking. BMW iX1 LWB interior and features As you might imagine, the lengthening of the iX1 has all gone into the rear of the cabin, and the legroom here is just vast. As before, you’re sat low to the floor in a knees-up position, thanks to the battery, but it doesn’t bother you as much since you have so much more horizontal space to stretch out. It’s also because the seat base has been lengthened by 15mm and softer cushioning has been used throughout, making the seat subtly more comfortable. The backrest can even be reclined up to 28.5 degrees. Huge space at the rear now and seat comfort has improved too. All this makes for a more comfortable chauffeur-driven experience, with space that’s far superior to anything else in the segment. Enhancing the sense of space here is a larger glass area in the form of a bigger panoramic sunroof (now a fixed glass, rather than an openable one) and, naturally, longer windows. However, much like in the 5 Series, the iX1 misses out on rear window blinds, which would have been a worthwhile addition in the LWB version. Dash design is quirky and surprisingly practical. Other spec differences include the removal of the beige upholstery colour; mocha brown is your only option now, and some features that have been removed. Among these are the ‘boost’ paddle behind the wheel which would get you 10sec of extra torque, and the massage function for the front seats. Other features, meanwhile, are there, but for a price, as BMW is offering them as options or subscriptions, including onboard navigation, certain drive modes and even the spare wheel! BMW iX1 LWB performance and range It’s not just features that have been removed, though; the iX1 has ditched its rear motor and now uses a front-wheel-drive setup rather than AWD. With this new sDrive20 powertrain has come a drop in power from 313hp to 204hp, and torque from 494Nm to 250Nm. Naturally, that’s resulted in a dip in performance, with the 0-100kph acceleration times dropping from 5.49sec to 8.31sec, but with the same 66.4kWh battery, BMW’s certified range figure has jumped from 440km to 531km. However, in our short time with the car, we couldn’t do a real-world range test.  It uses the same 66.4kWh battery, but ditches the real axle motor from the SWB model. What we could verify was the performance, which feels noticeably subdued, and not just in comparison to the old xDrive30 version. 200hp sounds like a lot, but this is a larger and heavier vehicle, and during overtakes especially you feel wanting for power, or at the very least that EV-typical instantaneous punch. It definitely has that ‘entry level engine’ vibe about it, and once you make your peace with that and factor in the greater range, the trade-off seems fair. Some of X1's agility has been lost with the added length. The longer wheelbase has brought a more laidback demeanour to the handling too, and combined with the relaxed power delivery, you’re not inclined to push this car as you might have the xDrive30. What’s remained is the excellent ride quality, which is a trait BMW has lately stolen from arch rival Mercedes. Apart from an at-times hollow-sounding thunk on sharp bumps, the suspension is absorbent and even maintains good body composure. BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The front half of the cabin hasn’t changed, for better or worse. This includes the quirky but practical dash and centre console, the hit-or-miss interior quality, and the frustratingly complex i-Drive 9 touchscreen which has swallowed up too many functions (here’s where Merc has stolen a march on BMW). But these are problems for your driver, as the focus with the iX1 LWB is the rear seat. BMW says the car was borne from two factors – buyers’ complaints that entry-level luxury cars felt too cramped for their asking price, and that while market leader Mercedes has a stranglehold on the top end of the market, the bottom end was there for the taking. Think if the iX1 LWB as a sister car to the 3 Series Gran Limousine, and it starts to make sense. It isn't just cheaper than its rivals; it's cheaper than its own SWB petrol counterpart, too. This car, then, is a statement of intent from the Bavarian brand, a flag to mark its territory. And if the combination of superb rear-seat space and a knockout price of Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) entice enough buyers, it might just be what can jump-start the waning entry luxury segment.

    "description": "The French brand's budget SUV is more value than cheap and can be had with seven seats Citroen is going all-in on affordability. When it launched the new C3 it was hailed as the new-age affordable car to take the supermini crown. The axing of the Ford Fiesta had left a suitable hole that it was looking to fill. Now, its big sibling, the C3 Aircross, has arrived, with the same value positioning but with added practicality.This second-generation crossover lands once again in the B-SUV segment. It is positioned as one of the cheapest propositions available, starting from just over £20,000 while kitted with a generous level of equipment. Only the Dacia Duster, in bare-bones Essential form, undercuts it at £18,000.The Citroën’s low price, as with the smaller C3, is partly down to Stellantis’s new cost-saving architecture called ‘Smart Car’ – the new model makes the switch from the PFA1 platform, which dates back to the Peugeot 206. The C3 Aircross line-up opens with Plus spec from £20,240 – £2500 more than the smaller C3 – and rising to £25,740 for the Max trim; here you’ll find luxuries like heated seats. Unlike other Citroën models, no basic You! trim is offered in the UK, although its value standing suggests it could be added in the future.",

Starting with the smaller ë-C3 last year, now we’ve got the larger and more family focussed ë-C3 Aircross.This is a practical and budget-friendly B-SUV positioned to undercut rivals with a starting price of £22,990, making it one of the cheapest electric SUVs on the market. This affordability is partly due to Citroen's new 'Smart Car' architecture, which also underpins the C3 Aircross and the pair’s smaller siblings.At just £2500 more than the combustion powered C3 Aircross, the ë-C3 Aircross undercuts the new Ford Puma Gen-E by around £7000, and the smaller MG 4 by £4000, albeit offering fewer electric miles.Like its sibling, the EV comes in two trim levels: Plus and Max, the latter – from £24,990 – features luxuries such as heated seats and wireless charging.",

Thankfully, Yuichi Yoshizawa doesn’t share our reservations. The frontman of the hit-making Japanese workshop, CW Zon, is known for applying his signature style to the most unlikely of motorcycles.

The Honda CG125—a petite single-cylinder commuter—has been in constant production since 1976, winning hearts and minds through its durability and affordability. Even though it’s no longer in production in Japan, it lives on in countries like Pakistan, Brazil, and China, manufactured by various Honda subsidiaries and partners. This peppy Honda CG125 is a Chinese-made model, built under the Wuyang-Honda label. It’s been masterfully tweaked by Jesse Liu of Kicker Garage, influenced by the popular brat style established by the legendary Go Takamine. The delightful simplicity of Kicker’s CG125 belies the amount of work that Jesse has poured into it. Through a host of subtle, yet well judged, changes, he’s turned the humble commuter bike into a handsome café hopper.…",

    "link": "",
    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The 2025 KTM 250 Adventure has been launched at Rs 2.60 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) which is an increment of Rs 12,000 compared to the outgoing model. It gets a lot of updates for that price bump including a new chassis, a new engine and more features. Gets the same 250cc engine from the Duke Features a new 5-inch TFT display Similar bodywork to new 390 Adventure models The KTM 250 Adventure shares its engine with the latest 250 Duke. It is powered by a single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, 250cc engine producing 31hp and 25Nm of torque. It derives its split-trellis frame from the larger 390 Adventure but misses out on an aluminum subframe which the larger model boasts. It also gets a 0.5 liter smaller fuel tank, rated at 14.5 liters. It’s kerb weight remains unchanged at 177kg It gets a 19-inch front and a 17-inch rear alloy wheel setup and a fully adjustable suspension offering 200mm of travel at the front and 205mm at the rear with a seat height of 825mm.  In addition to redesigned bodywork with a new beak, the KTM 250 Adventure also gets a vertically stacked Bi-LED projector headlight setup, 5-inch TFT display with connected features, bi-directional quickshifter, ride-by-wire with rider modes. All these features are shared across Adventure range.  KTM has launched this quarter liter Adventure motorcycle alongside the larger 390 Adventure and 390 Adventure X. At Rs 2.60 lakh, the KTM 250 Adventure has no direct rivals, with the closest competition being posed by the Suzuki V-Strom SX (Rs 2.16 lakh) and the Royal Enfield Scram 440 (Rs 2.08 lakh - Rs 2.12 lakh).

    "description": "Alongside the latest 390 Adventure, KTM has also launched the lower-spec 390 Adventure X at Rs 2.91 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). This is the more road-biased and budget-friendly option to the full-fat 390 ADV.  Same engine, frame as 390 Adventure Runs on 19/17-inch alloy wheels Two colours offered - orange and white The 390 Adventure X is powered by the same engine and is housed in the same frame as the 390 Adventure. The peak output of 46hp and 39Nm remains unchanged here but the 390 ADV X weighs 1 kilo less, at 182kg and has a slightly lower perch, at 825mm.  While the overall styling is in line with the 390 Adventure, the X runs on 19/17-inch alloy wheels and its electronics suite is much simpler. Its suspension is also non-adjustable, although at 200mm/205mm (F/R), the travel here is the same as its elder sibling.   Having said that, the 2025 ADV X now comes with the same TFT display as the Adventure and the latest 200, 250 and 390 Duke models. Another change over the older bike is that the 2025 ADV X now comes standard with a bidirectional quickshifter.  At Rs 2.91 lakh, the 390 Adventure X is a substantial Rs 77,000 more affordable than the 390 Adventure and it sits squarely in the ballpark of the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 (R 2.85 lakh - Rs 2.98 lakh, ex-showroom, Chennai).  Also See: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure launched at Rs 3.68 lakh",
