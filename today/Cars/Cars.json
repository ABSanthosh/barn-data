    "title": "Why can't a mayor drive a Vauxhall Corsa?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-cant-mayor-drive-vauxhall-corsa",
    "description": "Jag limos aren’t cheap, but try getting out of a Corsa in a wool gown and heavy chain Would you feel the status of your borough were diminished if your mayor arrived at an event in a Vauxhall Corsa? That’s the argument reportedly put forward by Dudley Borough councillor Adam Aston, who is opposing the decision to sell off its official mayoral car and accompanying attendant – a move that will save it £60,000 a year. Local paper Dudley News has reported that the council has to save rather more than that. Millions, in fact, if it’s to avoid declaring itself effectively bankrupt, like Birmingham City Council recently did. And if this results in Dudley’s mayor, currently Hilary Bills (who declined to comment), having to take herself to appointments, so be it. This does inevitably mean there will be less pomp to accompany a Dudley mayoral arrival in the future, perhaps as the mayor parks around the corner and trudges down a multi-storey’s stairwell, patting their pockets to be sure they’ve remembered their keys and those gold chains (which, also as part of the savings drive, may actually be replicas), rather than being dropped off kerbside in a nice car. I get that this could be less optimal. Probably less convenient too. But while I’m usually contented to see a little bit of public money spent on ceremonial nonsense (it’s one of the things the world likes about Britain, after all), I find it hard to objectively fault the council’s decision on this. In the three years up to 2022, Dudley Council spent £30,168 running a mayoral Jaguar XF – more than most boroughs but by no means the highest. Plenty of councils reported having Jaguar XJs, Volvo S80s, Skoda Superbs and the like (even a Volkswagen Phaeton) permanently on their books, with leasing or purchase costs of up to £10,000 a year. If you haven’t got any money but the bins need emptying and the elderly need looking after, what are you going to do: cancel after-school clubs to make it harder for parents to go to work or flog the mayoral Lexus? Sure, it would be nice to have both, wouldn’t it? Lots of support for those who need it, plus a bit of ceremonial extravagance on the side, as you would think would be possible in the world’s fifth-richest country. But apparently there’s no money, as councils all over the country have spent all that they have, plus some more that they haven’t, some of which has gone on prestige cars. Realising that isn’t an outstanding look, plenty have already decided to put a stop on it. I’m normally very wary about how life gradually becomes more beige, more joyless, but even I can see how ‘occasional Corsa’ looks better than ‘permanent Jaguar’. But if arriving in a hired Corsa really is too mediocre a look for a mayor, I think I’ve got an answer that might keep happy both pomp enthusiasts and those desperate to watch over every bean a council spends: keeping or hiring a classic car. It’s still prestigious, entirely inoffensive and a sure way to spread joy, yet cheaper than spending five figures a year on leasing or buying a new car. I’m on the telly A new documentary has been made about the Hillman Imp by a friend of Autocar’s, Paul Coulter, an Imp owner and enthusiast who wants to tell more about the story of this 1960s economy saloon and, as importantly, the Linwood plant where it was made. Coulter interviews people who worked at the plant, both from management and the shop floor, to try to find out the real story behind why it all went wrong. He chats to me in it too, as well as Autocar’s picture editor and car designer, Ben Summerell-Youde, who imagines what an Imp would look like if it were designed today. Linwood, the Imp and Me is available to view on STV Player now.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/best-real-world-sports-cars-face-mc20-giulia-qv-a110",
    "description": "Each concurrently delivers a knockout product, so alike in character, in the dying days of the pure-ICE sports car Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Alpine aren’t the most consistent makers of brilliant performance cars, but when they’re on form the results are stellar As compound adjectives go, ‘seagull-shit-splattered’ is an unconventional one to concoct when describing the birth of an era-defining new performance car. But sometimes a bit of candour is just the ticket. In his excellent behind-the-scenes book Inside the Machine, David Twohig’s depiction of the guano-iced old Alpine competition workshops in Dieppe, and the scene that unfolds within one of them as, on a frigid winter’s morn, his team fires up an ugly Alpine A110 mule for the first time, is evocatively unvarnished and very entertaining. Just as striking is the wider chronology. This was in February 2015; only four months later, Alfa Romeo would whip the covers off a stunning new BMW M3 rival at the company’s smartly updated Arese headquarters north-west of Milan. Just four months on from that, Fiat-Chrysler would start the process of hawking its stake in Ferrari, a decision that eventually frees semi-forgotten Maserati to commit what had been regarded previously as an internecine act: the development of its own supercar. So 2015, then, was a rather a fine year for petrolheads treading a less Germanic path, and a great year for those who enjoy fast cars with less than iron-bound body control and that don’t grip the road with a Hulk Hogan handshake. Drink in the curves, scoops and fissures of the Maserati MC20, the Alpine A110 and the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio – all uncomplicatedly pretty in the Welsh sun – and you realise it is a remarkable sight. Had Fiat not decided on a Ferrari sell-off when it did; had Alfa not chosen to plough several billion euros into a blue-blood platform that would serve just two – Jesus, two – models; and had Carlos Tavares not persuaded the ‘other’ Carlos, Ghosn, to revive Alpine and remain steadfast as partner Caterham ran out of cash and scarpered, then this trio wouldn’t exist. And it would be a tragedy.  These lesser-spotted cars are, quirks and all, broadly superb to drive. More than that, as a troop they preach a different doctrine to the steely-eyed, ever-so-serious competition. It is what binds them, because they are spookily alike in their free-spirited, loose-limbed way of going down an interesting road. Honestly, such are the similarities they could be three models from the same manufacturer. Alfine Maseo, perhaps? So we have assembled them to celebrate this distinct character. It is a Last Supper, sort of. Having had a recent refresh (more power, new mechanical limited-slip diff, tweaked dampers), the Giulia QV retires this year, and the little A110 will be gone in 2026. If the nameplates reappear, they will be on cars that are electrified – read: heavier and less transparent. As for the Maserati, it’s a survivor. Outside the blue-chip realm of Gordon Murray’s T50 and co, this is the only supercar that doesn’t lug around a drive battery. These are likeably straightforward cars with compact turbocharged motors, rear-wheel drive and thoroughbred suspensions. And, of course, suspension rates so unctuously compliant they border on the tender, relative to their rivals. They’re cars designed to be at their best in the ugly, unpredictable real world; their aim is to impress the driver, not a stopwatch. The V6-fired Giulia Quadrifoglio was the vanguard of this… What to call it? The modern Latin sports car orthodoxy? It’s a big-hearted super-saloon with a sawn-off Maranello V8 in its nose and 190mph potential, and it glides from corner to corner with the beguiling ease of an E39 BMW M5. Back in 2016, when we first drove it, it was instantly different from any M car or AMG; today, it has lost a little ‘wow’ factor in straight-line speed and the damping doesn’t feel as clever as it once did, but its fundamental joy and individuality remains. And to think the Yanks get this car with three pedals… Never mind ‘like’ an E39 M5, that car in effect is an E39 M5. Enjoyment of the Giulia derives from the realisation that, even in a car that will unstick its rears with the casual aggression of a toddler ripping the lid off a Petits Filous, body movements need not be feared. Clearly it’s crucial those movements don’t tug contact patches all over the shop, especially with 513bhp at play – yes, that would make things a tad edgy. But in the Alfa it’s not something you need to worry about, even though the team behind this car also had the tenacity to marry this seemingly endless suspension travel with rapid, 11.8:1 steering. It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but show a QV a good B-road and it doesn’t morph into a soggy-bottomed, over-alcoholic, £80k tiramisu. Instead, it leans and flows and finds balance easily and everywhere. At first it flirts with nervousness, but this dissipates soon enough. Then the QV is simply superb company. The Alpine has since 2017 provided a similar service to the Boxster class. It’s an iconoclast, and, true, not everyone loves them. Deconstruct the A110 driving experience relative to a basic four-pot Boxster and there’s only one winner: the low-slung Porsche has more communicative steering, more grip, a better powertrain, better ergonomics and a better weight distribution. But the French car also has verve, sensitivity and a captivating sense of tininess the Boxster shows little interest in emulating. It would be easy to explain this away as a happy accident, on account of its 110kg or so weight advantage, narrower tyres and racier suspension (the Porsche uses MacPherson struts), but the way the A110 handles is clearly deliberate. And daring. Why so daring? Let’s boil it down. Alpine was already taking a mad risk in manufacturing an all-aluminium, mid-engined car and then offering it for about the price of a Volkswagen Golf R. It then gave the 1798cc motor only 248bhp and decided the steering should be almost aloofly calm and genteel. More risk. Finally, to tune the suspension to invite the driver to indulge in the sensation of mass moving? The thing is outright countercultural. And completely brilliant. Nobody makes a car like the A110 and, I suspect, nobody ever will again (except, perhaps, Wells Motors Cars – check out the Vertige). How can they? Even the Mk2 A110 itself will be an EV. The parallels between the Alpine and the MC20 are apparent: each is an enigmatic character, swimming against the current of its class; and they are less powerful than you might expect, yet both have pedigree constructions. Where the A110 has that full-aluminium monocoque, the Maserati is carbonfibre-tubbed – a technology Ferrari has yet to adopt for its mainline models. As with the Alpine, there is also an electric MC20 waiting in the wings, although, and unlike in the case of the A110, the MC20 ‘Folgore’ (expected to have 1200bhp or so – not a typo) and the 3.0-litre Nettuno V6-engined car here will co-exist for a period. It will be fascinating to compare the two on the same stretch of road – if, that is, Maserati allows such a test to happen. It may well choose not to. Maserati is having a torrid time shifting MC20s, and it isn’t just because, relative to the high asking price, the car is out-gunned and generally out-wowed by the Ferrari 296 GTB. It may also be because in those first few moments during dealership test drives – the so-called  50-yard handshake – and the ensuing miles during which human and machine establish a relationship, it also comes across as quite unruly: an unnervingly soft brake pedal; rather a large steering wheel guiding a faintly indirect rack; a woolly, nasal engine with some slack in what, in times past, would have been a throttle cable but is now the calibration of a by-wire actuator; and soft suspension with such extensive travel that the car’s flat belly sags almost to the road as you drop off speed bumps, before springing back up. It is odd, for sure. And it is not the pinpoint-precise supercar experience you’re expecting. But give the thing a moment, please. As with a bagpipe heinously striking up before unleashing Highland Cathedral on all in earshot, the MC20 requires some bedding in on the driver’s part. (As it happens, the blare of a short-piped Nettuno V6 is also bagpipe-loud.) The characteristics that make the Giulia and the A110 so easy to hop in to and gleefully blast away – light controls and that subtle sense of the body doing whatever it likes – engender caution in a 621bhp supercar. You also need to set the MC20 up just so: Sport mode, for its crisper powertrain response, but dial the dampers back to soft. You can always ramp them up later, when you’re into the flow. As you will be.    Once you have acclimatised to this big, bold Maserati, it is spectacular. As with the other two, it doesn’t beat the vagaries of the asphalt into submission but rather cushions them, working with them. A mid-corner ridge is not a fearful event but a point of interest; the steering is ever nonchalant and uncorrupted; the back axle is planted but not so much that the chassis won’t surf with a little over-rotation of the rear tyres (Corsa mode is your friend here). A fully lit MC20 emanates a Countach-esque butchness but is, deep down, something intrinsically deft and delicate. Crucially, it doesn’t strain to remain flat. Pitch, squat and roll are celebrated ingredients. It is, well, uncannily like an Alfa Romeo take on a super-sized A110. Surprising? Not remotely. Senior Alfa execs have unsubtly hinted the MC20 was originally meant to be a reborn 8C. Maserati top brass deny this at every opportunity with practised indignation, and we’ll never know the whole truth. Sergio Marchionne favoured a mid-engined 8C, but the idea faded with his death in 2018. All a bit Medici. In reality it could have been either Maserati or Alfa Romeo, and we should be thankful that at least one of these two storied car makers got to go and put its badge on a truly distinctive modern supercar. So, yes, it could have been either, but in reality you could argue it was, in fact, both. Fiat’s historical penchant for parts-sharing is well known (base Lancia Delta column stalks on a Ferrari 288 GTO is a classic), and it is alive and kicking here. MC20 and Giulia QV share steering wheels, gearshift paddles, plenty of controls and some dashboard electronics, even down to the fonts on the switchgear. On a deeper level, both steering racks have a similarly ethereal quality to their motion: the Alfa’s is a touch weightier, but both are gloss-smooth and somewhat detached in feel. Deeper still, for its front suspension the Giulia QV uses what Alfa calls a ‘double wishbone with semi-virtual steering axis’ set-up, which is one and a half wishbones in practice, said to maintain the contact patch particularly neatly. It’s an uncommon bit of engineering, but lo, there’s something very similar on an MC20. Which brings us to the human touch – the very masterminding of the mechanical personalities involved. The cross-pollination of personnel and ideas between Alfa Romeo and Maserati under the old FCA umbrella was at times constant and unimpeded. The same people who worked on Alfa Romeo’s Giorgio platform, and in particular the Quadrifoglio versions of the Giulia and its Stelvio SUV twin, often resurfaced on the MC20 project. They were once tasked with delivering a super-saloon that would take it to the Germans but which would go about things in its own way. That worked out well, so why not apply the same philosophy to a supercar, never mind the badge. One man stands out: Philippe Krief. Fresh from finishing Ferrari’s 458 Speciale, he led the semi-covert development of the Giorgio platform as Alfa’s technical director and therefore informed, to an extent, the character of the MC20. He has recently moved to another purveyor of fine performance cars, as chief technical officer. You may know which one. Yes, Alpine. In another twist, Tavares, once instrumental in reviving Alpine and now Stellantis’s top dog, recently sacked underperforming Maserati CEO Davide Grasso, replacing him with Santo Ficili, who will also lead… Alfa Romeo. Medici indeed. But forget back-stage machinations and focus on the fact these cars are here, now. For how many years did Alfa frustrate us by under-delivering on its potential? Same for Maserati. And Alpine, which lay dormant for decades. That each should concurrently deliver a knockout product, so alike in character, in the dying days of the pure-ICE sports car? A touch bittersweet.",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

For visitors, it’s a cornucopia of visual delights, featuring the best handcrafted machines that the scene has to offer. For custom bike builders, it’s the ultimate proving ground. But the HRCS (or ‘the Mooneyes show,’ as it’s commonly known) isn’t just an opportunity for solo builders and workshops to flex. Major OEMs have turned to it, and other shows, in recent years—punting their wares to a captive audience to prove just how customizable their bikes are. The standard at Mooneyes is sky-high—so if you’re going to show up, you’d better come in hot. Royal Enfield has the right idea. This year, they turned to regular Mooneyes award winner, Sureshot, to deliver a custom Royal Enfield Shotgun 650 like no other.…",

    "description": "Since they first hit the scene, Auto Fabrica has flirted with the concept of motorcycles as art pieces. The machines they build often feel like elegant concept bikes, but stop short of being so abstract that they become useless ornaments. This Ducati Scrambler 1100 embodies that philosophy. Labeled ‘T23,’ this is, remarkably, the first Ducati that the English workshop has customized. “We wanted to design and build something with a unique style,” says Bujar Muharremi, who runs Auto Fabrica with his brother, Gaz. “It was during the time when we were finishing our first bike with an integrated seat cover—Type 17—and wanted to really explore this idea on a slick concept-style build.” To give themselves a head start, Bujar and Gaz started with a 2024-model Ducati Scrambler 1100 Pro.…",

    "description": "Everything just has to be some form of SUV these days, right? And you know what – that’s just fine. If you want a sedan with lifted suspension, a curvy roof and a punchier engine, do it! It’s adding more sport to your life. If you want a lifted hatchback with boxy sides and a bit of cladding, go for it – it gives you greater utility. That’s S and U covered. However, if you’re an alumnus of the Old School – the type who believes that an SUV must have four-wheel drive, high ground clearance and tough underpinnings, that it must be able to climb mountains, ford streams and have ancestors that fought in actual wars – there are only a handful of SUVs on the planet that would fit the bill. And after years of trying, we finally have three of them together on the same loose clump of mud. They all pay homage to their legendary ancestors, some more directly than others. The Jeep Wrangler, Land Rover Defender and Mercedes G-Class are not rivals in the truest sense of the word. How could they be, with prices of Rs 72 lakh, Rs 1 crore, and Rs 2.5 crore, respectively? What they are, though, are the modern descendants of three of the most iconic 4x4s in history and are themselves pretty iconic in their own right. So, while we will compare how they perform on and off the road and what creature comforts each of them provides, we’re also going to see what makes each of them unique. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler off-roading  What better place for these three to start proving themselves than in the rough? Though each is good enough to be a benchmark for mud plugging, as proven in our Off-Road Day group test a couple of months ago, each also goes about it very differently. To this end, the Wrangler is the most focused on the task at hand; particularly in Rubicon guise, it is the most outright capable off-roader in the bunch. A lot of that is down to its standard mud-terrain (M/T) tyres that sink their sipes into the loosest of surfaces to pull the Jeep out of places lesser SUVs would need a winch for. Then there are the disconnecting sway bars that turn it from a rhino to a rock crab, giving it articulation that no stock SUV on the planet can match. There is some electronic assistance, too, including the ability to choose your hill descent speed, but the Wrangler experience is a largely mechanical and analogue one. As you’ll see later, you pay the price for this on the road, but to buy purely as an off-roader, the Rubicon is the way to go. Rubicon’s tenacious grip and articulation are second to none. (R) Tactile and colourful off-road controls gamify the experience. At the very opposite extreme is the Defender, which almost feels too nice to take off-road. It’s the furthest removed from its utilitarian forebear, ditching the tough ladder-frame chassis and rigid suspension for a monocoque and air springs. Instead of levers and knobs, you engage the hardware with light taps of a button or via the touchscreen. The locking diffs, ride height and traction control are managed by computer and drive modes, and such a level of autonomy in off-roading can be daunting at first. Once you get used to it, it’s remarkably capable, though perhaps not to the unstoppable level the Wrangler is. The electronics can often take a moment to figure things out, but once the algorithm deploys, it takes the effort out of off-roading. It truly is plush through the mush, though for off-roading enthusiasts, it could be a bit anticlimactic. Defender has serious hardware but all controlled by software. Sometimes, it takes a moment to read the surface but soon gets you out of trouble. There’s nothing anticlimactic about the G-Wagen, which is an occasion on four wheels. There’s a weighty, mechanical invincibility to the way it off-roads that sets it apart from the others. Having the most powerful engine here – a 3.0-litre diesel with 700Nm – certainly helps, and you get the sense it can just muscle its way out of a tricky situation. You rarely have to lock any more than the centre differential – done via the now-iconic three switches on the dash – but if you lock all three, it will twist the very Earth beneath you. It can feel a bit top-heavy (and heavy in general) through some hairier obstacles, but chances are you will give up a lot sooner than it will. G-Wagen takes a ‘pummel everything into submission’ approach. And once all three diffs are locked, nothing can stop it. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler on-road manners  Let’s face it, though. Any of these cars will be used more on the tarmac than off it, but even if you’re buying one of these to only go off-roading, you still have to get to the mud via the road. And while they’re all pretty incredible in the muck, out on the road, it’s a different story. It takes a certain amount of commitment to choose a Wrangler and even more so to choose the Rubicon, which, despite its best efforts at modernity in 2024, feels the most compromised on the road. At any given time, there are at least three different rattles in the cabin, the footwell is tiny with no dead pedal, and wind (and sometimes water) enters via gaps in the bodywork. And all that’s before you get to the M/T tyres and rigid-axle suspension, which together make for a less-than-pleasant on-road experience. Tyre roar is ever present, getting worse the faster you go, and the ride quality is lumpy at best and crashy at worst. That aside, you’ll have little to complain about when it comes to the powertrain, which, though a little boomy, feels strong enough for this car. Another big surprise is the steering, which feels light and affords the Jeep impressive manoeuvrability. While all three are incredible in the muck, they will be used more on the tarmac than off it.  It’s not a surprise that the Defender is the best-behaved on the road. Its platform, after all, is based on the previous Range Rover’s, and with cushy adaptive air suspension, it rides like a dream. It’s also worth pointing out that it gives you the most choice – three body lengths, six seating configurations and five engines. This 300hp, 2.0-litre petrol is the smallest, though it doesn’t feel inadequate; you can also have a diesel or even a 635hp V8, with a corresponding increase in price, of course. It’s the best handling, too, with progressive steering and decent body control, especially if you put it in its Dynamic mode. It’s no sports SUV, but its monocoque setup makes it far more agreeable going fast around corners than the other two. Once again, the G-Wagen falls neatly between the other two. Yet, it is a force to be reckoned with, stronger than either of them. Though it has a ladder-frame chassis, it’s not as fidgety as the Wrangler but also nowhere as smooth as the Defender (or any other Mercedes SUV, for that matter). It doesn’t so much ride over bumps and potholes as it forces them to bend to its will. The seating position feels the tallest and most upright, perfect for lording over lesser vehicles. Its straight-six diesel is surprisingly smooth and easily the strongest, and yes, there’s the 585hp V8 AMG should you want more poke still. There are drive modes to unlock a bit more responsiveness, though they make little difference to the ride. No, it’s not a handler, though it has to be said it feels very stable at high speeds, almost as much as the air-sprung Defender. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler design, interior and features To a layperson, the G-Wagen may as well be the same one that debuted in the late 1970s; such is its devotion to its original look. The truth is, this is an all-new generation that debuted in 2018, which, though still quite traditional under the skin, has seen the benefit of some modern tech. This includes Mercedes’ dual-screen infotainment system, although not the newest MBUX software and not even a touchscreen – these will come with a facelift next year. Quality and craftsmanship, however, are where you feel your money’s been spent, with lashings of contrast-stitched leather, metallic trim and carbon-fibre inserts – though I suspect some of these are optional extras; go figure. The Adventure Edition does add a bit of visual drama with mud flaps, a roof rack and a ladder, but even without this, the G has a uniquely towering presence. No shortage of bling, and quality is excellent. Retains an old-school feel. But, rear-seat comfort is not up to big luxury SUV standards. The other two aren’t far behind, mind you, and the Defender, especially – with its different body styles and exterior specifications – likes to let everyone know you’ve arrived. Yes, it looks a little like the original, but modern renditions of the original’s signature motifs – round headlamps, small tail-lamps and the roof-mounted ‘safari windows’ – are nice retro callbacks. On the inside, quality might be a little shy of the Mercedes, especially some of the plasticky switchgear, but it’s still ‘luxury-car’ good. And like on the outside, it does a modern interpretation of the classic cabin and offers loads of practical storage. It’s big on tech, too, with the latest Pivi Pro touchscreen being particularly slick to use, but they’ve helpfully kept some physical buttons in to make things easier to operate in the rough. The most practical, comfy and well-thought-out interior – front seat or back. Tech feels the most modern, and features list is long. Despite debuting a slick new 12.3-inch touchscreen, the Jeep has plenty of physical controls, too. In fact, it has a fun, almost toy-like dashboard layout that makes the other two look staid in comparison. There are lashings of red trim, fun iconography and plenty of Easter eggs littered around the cabin, and it suits its ‘off-road plaything’ personality well. Quality is still rather good, actually, and there’s even ADAS and a nice sound system, despite the fact that the doors and roof can be removed entirely. As a result, yes, they don’t shut (or shut the world out) in the same way the sophisticated Defender or vault-like G-Class do, but it’s all part of this SUV’s recreational nature. Quality and features impressive in an interior that can be stripped apart and hosed down. Rear seat low, firm and basic, to say the least. They all have large boots that can easily swallow up a couple of drinks coolers and weekend bags, with the Defender 110 getting an optional pair of small third-row jump seats that fold away. Of course, you can opt for the 90 or 130 versions if you want a more compact SUV or more seating space, respectively. Speaking of, the Defender’s second-row seats are the best, with the most space and the best comfort. The Mercedes feels comfy enough but too upright, while the Jeep seat feels low to the ground with not enough padding or support. Defender vs G Class vs Wrangler verdict They’re not rivals, so we don’t have to pick a winner, right? Well, yes and no. While their prices aim them at different buyers, there could be some overlap – perhaps if you could afford them all. They are united by their all-conquering abilities off-road, and each has a presence and desirability that would make anyone proud to park them in their driveway. But, since each has carved out its own rut, let’s see which one’s best at what. The Jeep makes some compromises to comfort in its quest to be the ultimate off-roader, and though there is a more user-friendly ‘Unlimited’ version, if you’re getting a Wrangler, it’s really the tough-as-nails Rubicon that you want. Thanks to local assembly, it comes at a (relatively) reasonable price, and for that, you get the greatest stock 4x4 in the world! How about that? If you feel an SUV should be able to ford streams, climb rocks and fight wars, these are the SUVs for you. The Gentleman’s Express that is the Land Rover Defender is more concerned that your tea doesn’t spill as you’re cresting that rock face. It’s determined to make off-roading as comfy and effortless as possible, and to that end, it feels more like it was designed to save you from a sticky situation rather than go out in pursuit of one, as the Wrangler might. Moreover, it’s the best one for the road, which, let’s face it, is where any of these cars will spend most of their time. If we’re talking strictly in superlatives, the G-Wagen is the one to go for. It does off-road well, on-road well enough, and absolutely kills it in the desirability stakes. Without forgetting its tough roots, it has managed to feel sufficiently plush on the inside, too. No wonder it’s the subject of so many rap songs. But we’d be remiss not to call out that inflated price, which, only a few years ago, was a full Rs 1 crore less! Inflation is one thing, but this feels like a cynical ‘but hey, if there are willing customers, why not!’ On balance, then, it’s the Defender that gets our vote. It does everything extremely well and nothing too badly, and best of all, it gives you so many options to make it your own. And all this at a relatively reasonable price that’s bang at the heart of the big luxury SUV market, and you can see why it’s JLR’s bestselling product in India by far.

    "description": "Because the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is similar in size to a Tata Harrier, it is too big for my cramped residential parking space, which means I can’t use it as a daily driver. So, ever since this EV entered the Autocar India long term fleet, I’ve been yearning to spend time with it. And after many months, I finally got an opportunity – a weekend getaway to Aamby Valley City, a holiday township, located around 125km away from Mumbai. Since I’ve tested this Hyundai EV extensively, its combined range of 457km made me very confident that the Ioniq 5’s battery would have enough juice for the round trip and still be left with sufficient charge.  “It looks futuristic. Nice colour. It is so spacious.” These were some of the remarks by my wife and friends, who were totally blown away by the Ioniq 5. With a fully charged battery, a boot full of luggage, and three very excited passengers, we set off. Since the intent wasn’t to maximise range, I drove in ‘Normal’ mode for the most part, and switched to ‘Sport’ mode on a few occasions. The state of charge (SoC) dropped at a gradual pace on smooth highways; however, it was the 40 kilometres of the hilly roads that took a heavier toll on its battery. By the time we reached our destination, battery level had dropped to 48 percent. This was possibly the first time I second-guessed my belief in its range. A highway range of around 400km is possible without trying too hard. Throughout our drive, my passengers couldn’t stop praising the sheer space available, its seat comfort, and even its enormous glass roof. They also utilised the multiple storage areas to stow snacks, chocolates and beverages, and the area beneath the front central armrest is so large that it easily swallowed a handbag. An episode of a sudden downpour, which left us drenched in minutes, also made us understand and appreciate the importance of heated front and rear seats. Rear passengers, however, were quick to highlight the soft music volume from the rear speakers, a complaint many Hyundai owners have with their Bose audio systems. Also, I discovered that in low light, rainy conditions, its 360-degree camera display is almost unusable. Over the two days we spent in Aamby Valley City, we drove within the township a fair bit. And the SoC fell by another 10 percent. I would be lying if I said that range anxiety hadn’t kicked in while exiting Aamby Valley’s gate on the way back home, but since our return journey involved a fair bit of downhill driving, I was hopeful that we’d still make it with enough charge left. Sound output from its rear BOSE speakers is too soft. With no wireless Android Auto on offer (only wired), my phone was connected to the car’s infotainment via Bluetooth, so I hadn’t checked traffic or the estimated arrival time on Google Maps before leaving. Who knew this negligence on my part was going to be the biggest mistake of our trip?  None of us anticipated the heavy influx of tourists, merely a few kilometres away from Aamby Valley. Visitors had flocked to witness the Karvi flowers, which bloom once every seven or eight years and cover the hills of the western ghats in a spectacular blueish-purple blanket. As a result, the narrow two-lane road was jam-packed. Vehicles were parked haphazardly, cars had broken down, and all the usual chaos caused due to the indiscipline and callousness of road users had resulted in traffic coming to a grinding halt. So bad was the jam that there was a point where we were stuck in the same spot for a little over 2 hours. Furthermore, it took us a nightmarish 5 hours to cover a distance of 25km (Aamby Valley city to Lonavala). No kidding! Super comfy front seats with ottomans, heating and cooling. Mercifully, we were in the lap of luxury, sitting in the comfort of an air-conditioned cabin, with ventilated seats on and the music playing; the best part was that all this didn’t have a drastic effect on the battery either. Once the road opened up, the same uphill ghat which sapped battery power, helped conserve energy with the help of regenerative braking on the way down, and the SoC had barely dropped by 5 percent, to 33 percent, in the 6.5 hours it took to reach the flat section of the Pune-Mumbai expressway. The remainder of our journey was uneventful. We reached Mumbai after covering a total distance of 342km, with 15 percent SoC and still an estimated range of 67km to spare. This means that despite the thick traffic jam and the steep ghat sections, the Ioniq 5 is easily capable of delivering 400km of highway range on a single charge, that too rather effortlessly.  Large storage areas all around, including a big boot and a frunk. After living with the car and gathering opinions and comments from friends and family, I can conclude that this Hyundai isn’t for those seeking snob value, which German marques exert at this price point. But look beyond its badge and the Ioniq 5 is genuinely a fantastic, well-rounded and luxurious car that happens to be an EV; one that I’ll wholehartedly recommend this side of Rs 1 crore.

    "description": "Kia India is all set to reveal the Syros, its all-new compact SUV on December 19. Ahead of its global debut, we can confirm that the Syros will go on sale in January with not one but two engine options.  Syros will come with a 1.0-liter turbo petrol engine 1.5-liter diesel will also be sold alongside Deliveries likely to start by late January 2025 Syros to be fifth Kia model with a diesel engine While most carmakers are shying away from introducing new diesel-powered models, Kia India seems to be bucking the trend by launching its fifth product in India with the diesel engine. The Syros will come with the tried and tested 1.5-litre diesel engine that powers many Kia and Hyundai models in the country. This engine delivers 115hp and 250Nm of torque and sees duty in the Sonet, Venue, Seltos, Carens, Creta and the Alcazar in our market. As for gearbox options, the Syros diesel will come with a six-speed manual and a six-speed torque convertor automatic just like the one seen on the Sonet.  Syros will also come with a 1.0 turbo petrol The Syros will also come with a 1.0-liter turbo petrol unit good for 120 hp and 172Nm. It will come with a manual as well as a 7-speed DCT automatic gearbox. However, the Syros will not get the naturally aspirated 1.2-litre petrol engine that's available on the Sonet. This may result in a relatively high starting price, but that's also in keeping with the Syros' more premium positioning over the Sonet.  Syros launch and delivery timeline The Kia Syros will see a global debut on December 19. Sources tell us that a price announcement could take place in January, likely at the Bharat Mobility Show where the SUV will be shown for the first time to the general public. Expect Kia to start delivering the Syros to customers by late January or early February next year.

    "description": "At a time when several OEMs are pushing for continued government support in the form of demand incentives for faster electric vehicle adoption, Honda Motorcycle \u0026 Scooter India (HMSI) is developing its EV portfolio in such a way that the product remains sustainable and its prices are competitive even without government subsidies.  Activa e: and QC1 are the first set of electric two-wheelers by HMSI While Activa e: has removable batteries, QC1 has a fixed battery Bookings for both these e-scooters will start in January Honda Activa e:, QC1 pricing to be revealed next year “We developed our products, keeping aside any kind of subsidy. We develop everything without any government intervention in terms of our products. Our pricing strategy will not be dependent on any government subsidies,” said Yogesh Mathur, director for sales and marketing at HMSI, while launching the company’s first set of electric two-wheelers. Government subsidies in the form of demand incentives and waiver of registration fees have been very instrumental in driving the early-stage adoption of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers. The Centre has been providing incentives since 2015 through FAME, EMPS and PM E-Drive schemes, and several OEMs have been saying that subsidies need to be continued for the industry’s sustained growth.  Earlier this year, Hero MotoCorp CEO Niranjan Gupta said the EV market is still in its early stages, and he believed that subsidies will be necessary for a while to help the industry grow. Once it reaches a point where it can sustain itself financially, subsidies can be gradually reduced, he had said. Also See: Honda QC1 electric scooter revealed alongside Activa e: Honda has introduced the Activa e: and QC1 as the first set of its electric two-wheelers for the Indian market. Activa e: comes with a swappable battery solution, and the QC1 has a fixed battery. The company has yet to announce the pricing for both models.  Currently, the government’s 2-year PM E-Drive scheme provides a subsidy of Rs 5,000 per kWh to electric two-wheelers with fixed batteries, subject to a cap of Rs 10,000 per vehicle. The subsidy will be tapered down to Rs 2,500 per kWh with a cap of Rs 5,000 per vehicle from April 2025. Senior government officials said the incentives are unlikely to be extended beyond FY2026.  “We will start the booking for both the models in January. At that time, we will be announcing the price because we need to gauge in terms of the response from the market and price it accordingly. But the pricing will be affordable,” he said.

His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
