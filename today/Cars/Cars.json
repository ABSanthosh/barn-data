    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/snow-slouch-2025-mercedes-benz-cla-ev-vs-alps",
    "description": "The most important new Mercedes model in years is just months away – and we've been out for a ride The Austrian ski resort of Hochgurgl is 2150 metres above sea level - roughly equivalent to two Mount Snowdons or nearly three Burj Khalifas. When we visit in early December, temperatures on the exposed, wind-chilled summit of the road that winds up from here and across the Italian border – usually closed for winter – have reached a balmy peak of -15dec C by mid-morning.  The wind is unforgivingly biting and the road completely covered in thick, heavily compacted snow. There are darker patches that you might mistake for the safe, grippy refuge of uncovered Tarmac, but more fool he who seeks traction on this blackest of black ice.  We’re here partly because “driving on this road is cool”, admits Mercedes-Benz CLA project leader Oliver Zolke as he casually lets the back step out midway through a particularly icy hairpin, but primarily because it’s the best environment for showing off three defining characteristics of the newly electric saloon: \"The ability of the recuperation, the traction and uphill acceleration, and the softness of the suspension”. From the passenger seat, the third-generation CLA feels to all intents and purposes finished. Camouflage cloaks the finer design details outside and the obligatory black bedsheet shields the dashboard from view, but Zolke says it’s “99% there” ahead of an unveiling in March and a launch around summer, with just “some homework” to do on the software and user interface. Even with much still left to the imagination, it’s clear just how closely this car will be to the pleasingly proportioned concept from last year - right down to the full-width digital display we can see peeking through the gaps in the sheeting. For better or worse.  Our test car is the range-topping four-wheel-drive model (Mercedes-Benz CLA 4Matic with EQ Technology, to give its full name), equipped with a 268bhp motor on the rear axle and another with 107bhp at the front. Mercedes has yet to confirm a combined output, but bank on around 375bhp, which should give it a slight accelerative edge over the Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD and the dual-motor Hyundai Ioniq 6.  This is one of two electric powertrains being introduced for the next-generation CLA, which is described as the first car of the ‘EV 2.0’ era for Mercedes, so dramatically different is it from the current EQE and EQS. The other forgoes the front motor for a smaller list price (expect low-£40,000s for the version with the smaller 58kWh LFP battery) and a higher maximum range of somewhere around 440 miles from the 85kWh NMC pack.  There will also be a combustion version, pairing a 1.5-litre petrol four-cylinder engine with a small electric motor in the gearbox for up to 188bhp and claimed \"diesel levels of efficiency\". It's due around six months after the EV, towards the end of 2025.  The range-topping EV certainly feels brisk enough, even on this glassy terrain, when Zolke floors it from a standstill, the lack of scrabbling and sliding off the line testament to the advanced stage of development this all-new powertrain is at - although potentially also the legally mandated chunky winter tyres that our mule is wearing…  A long straight section of the otherwise ceaselessly meandering Timmelsjoch pass provides the opportunity to briefly exploit the CLA’s full reserves, and we surge quickly and confidently to north of 60mph, which wouldn’t feel especially rapid but for the unnerving sense of detachment that comes from having such limited reference points. With the roadside largely indistinguishable from the blacktop and no fixed landmarks flicking past the window, we might as well be doing 150mph, or 20mph.  Either way, the CLA is unflustered. I did the same thing in the same place a few minutes previously in a Mercedes-AMG C63 and, even allowing for the assistance of 4WD and winter tyres, found myself making constant small corrections to my line in order to keep the nose pointing the right way. Zolke’s arms remain rigid by comparison: “There’s not much work to do from the driver’s seat,” he remarks, the car tracking straight and true with no perceptible directional input from either man or machine.  Zolke maintains his relaxed demeanour as a tight right-hander approaches, carrying our cruising speed well beyond the point at which I would have started bleeding off the pace. As the apex comes into focus, he lifts off the accelerator but leaves the brake pedal alone to demonstrate the efficacy of the regenerative deceleration, which can send power back to the battery at speeds of up to 200kW.  \"There's no need to do any mechanical braking\" in D mode, Zolke explains. It would be more efficient in terms of energy usage, but \"more smooth is the recuperation, as you don't feel it\". To demonstrate the contrast, he gives the left pedal a good stab and our conversation is interrupted by the noisy and juddering intervention of the ABS, which despite its best efforts is unable to bring the car’s speed down any quicker than the motors. The 4Matic model has an advantage here, because the second motor on the front axle boosts the maximum regeneration rate, but the rear-driven CLA will also be able to stop with no physical brake input. \"And that's more or less a side effect of efficiency. We didn't do it for these conditions; we did it to get maximum energy back from the car,\" says Zolke. Judging the suppleness of the chassis is trickier, given the tyres don’t really come into direct contact with the road itself during our time in the car, but the fact that I’m able to chat with Zolke while simultaneously writing in my notebook on one of Europe’s most challenging roads is probably an indication of its composure. Unlike the bigger electric Mercs, the CLA will be exclusively coil-sprung, but with optional adaptive dampers for greater control over the suspension characteristics - as with the BMW i4 and Tesla Model 3. Beyond its dynamic credentials and straight-line performance, the CLA is aiming to steal sales from its rivals with a claimed cruising efficiency of 5.18mpkWh - giving it long-distance abilities that it has proven by breaking the record for the longest distance travelled by an EV in 24 hours: 2410 miles around Italy’s Nardò high speed ring. Minimising power wastage at a cruise is crucial to attaining that figure, but being able to charge at up to 320kW dramatically reduces time spent idle. Zolke acknowledges that it's a big ask to marry segment-leading efficiency (Mercedes loftily refers to the CLA as “the one-litre car of the efficiency age”) with highly competent dynamics and engagement, but \"the biggest challenge of the project\" was instilling the new saloon with all those attributes while also keeping it tightly proportioned and low to the ground. He explained that Mercedes' focus for EVs has so far been focused on 'higher' – both taller and more premium-focused – model lines, because of the cost and bulk of EV batteries, but as both of them come down, lower ride heights become possible. Nonetheless, Zolke said, there was a paradox to address: \"The challenge was the height of the car, because we need space for the battery underneath but to keep the height comparable to the predecessor for styling, you don't want to have it too high – also for aerodynamics.” Even with the car still heavily camouflaged, it's clear that the CLA is a close proportional match to its predecessor, and the seating position feels roughly as low-slung as it would in a petrol saloon. Comparing the two with each other – and with their respective rivals – post-launch will give a clearer picture, but the early signs point to the new CLA being a remarkably uncompromised all-rounder.",

    "description": "Audi Q8 E-tron was heavily updated in 2022 Factory currently builds the Audi Q8 E-tron; it's successor is tipped to be produced in Mexico Audi will close its Brussels plant after the German car maker was unable to find a buyer. The factory, which will shut 28 February, currently builds the Q8 E-tron electric SUV, again sparking the question that Audi could end its production earlier than planned. Its successor is tipped to be produced in Mexico. “The decision to close the Brussels factory is painful,” Audi’s production boss Gerd Walker said, reports Reuters. “Personally, it was the toughest decision I have ever had to make in my professional career.” Audi was said to be in talks with a number of car makers over potentially buying the plant; Belgian media reported that Chinese EV maker Nio was the front runner; its CEO William Li denied this. However an Audi spokesperson confirmed in November that talks had broken down, leaving the plant’s closure inevitable. This brings into question the future of the current generation Q8 E-tron. Originally known just as the E-tron, Audi’s first series-production electric car went into production in 2018 and was heavily updated in 2022 with a new name, tweaked styling and a much larger battery. It was expected to remain in production until around the middle of the decade as the flagship for an electric SUV line-up that now also includes the smaller Q4 E-tron and mid-sized Q6 E-tron. In July, Audi said that a \"global decline in customer orders in the electric luxury-class segment\" threatened the large SUV's viability. Audi noted the drop in demand for the Q8 E-tron is \"segment specific\" and has not indicated that any of its other EVs are affected.  It says the \"ramp-up of new models on the [EV-specific] Premium Platform Electric\", including the new Q6 E-tron, is one factor in the diminishing popularity of the Q8 E-tron, which is based on an adapted version of the Volkswagen Group's ubiquitous MLB architecture. The similarly sized, combustion-powered Audi Q8 is built in Bratislava, Slovakia, and is unaffected by the announcement.  While Audi has not given any sales figures, the Brussels plant produced just 53,555 examples of the Q8 E-tron and its Sportback sibling in 2023, around half the number of Q4 E-trons that were built in Zwickau, Germany. Audi says it also faced \"long-standing structural challenges\" at the Brussels plant. Its location close to the city centre made restructuring unfeasible with greater logistical costs associated with deliveries and shipments compared with other factories located outside of cities",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "description": "Cast your mind back to early 2017, when Mercedes-Benz India did a mic drop and revealed the long-wheelbase E-Class for India. We all knew instantly that it would change the game, and it did. Yes, it was more expensive than rivals, but that didn’t matter to Indian buyers, who just lapped it up, making it the bestselling car in its segment by a long shot. Rivals responded in different ways, but none were able to stem the E’s mighty tide. Now, as we move into the next generation, BMW has boldly followed down that path, replacing its 5 Series and 6 Series GT with one model – the 5 Series LWB. It’s an expensive path, mind you, requiring a lot of investment from each brand, as ours is the only right-hand-drive market in the world to sell them; they’re not just made in India, they’re made for India. And as luck and lifecycles would have it, the launch of the 5 Series L (code: G68) has coincided nicely with that of the new-generation E-Class LWB (code: V214), which, of course, is going to defend its predecessor’s well-manicured turf. Its traditional rivals – the A6, the S90 and the ES – remain, of course, but the battle of the boss seats is really between these two. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series rear seats Recline function, wraparound ambient lighting and boss mode give the E-Class a proper business-class feel. So, let’s start right there. What’s common in both cars is a ridiculous amount of rear legroom and the fact they’re best for two; a middle passenger has to deal with a big transmission tunnel and raised centre cushion. But from there on, they do things differently. The 5 Series’ 110mm stretch is reflected in its massive doors that also have huge windows attached. The E-Class, as before, has Merc’s ‘Maybach’ doors, in which the quarter glass is fixed to the bodywork, and the door itself – soft-close, incidentally – is smaller. Each has its benefits and drawbacks; the BMW is easier to get in and out of (also helped by a higher seat) thanks to the wider opening, but the doors are a pain to open in tight spaces. The Mercedes doesn’t have this problem and also gives you some privacy as you can hide behind the C-pillar, but then you have to climb around this pillar and lower yourself into the seat. Softer seat cushioning, more room, but no recline in the BMW. Aftermarket sunblinds are poorly executed. You sink into the 5 Series’ seat thanks to its thicker, softer cushioning, both for the base and backrest, with plush outer-side bolstering that hugs you in place. They’ve chosen an up-tilted seat base angle for better support and a fixed backrest angle, rear set at 31 degrees to lay your spine into. The huge fixed glass roof – in combination with the large windows – makes the cabin feel airy. But, while there is a powered shade for the overhead glass, there are no window shades, nor one for the rear windscreen, which is a huge miss. As a quick fix, BMW has fit removable aftermarket shade panels, but their execution is basic. And should you have to remove them to enjoy the view outside or to open the window, they will just sit in the cabin with you. Powered seat and blind controls elevate E-Class’ rear cabin. The E-Class’ seat cushioning might not be quite as soft as the 5’s, but on every other front, it knocks it out of the park. For one, it gets sunshades not only on both rear windows but on the rear windscreen, too, and all are powered and operable from either rear door. Then, there’s the band of ambient lighting that wraps around the rear seats, enveloping you in a glow of your chosen colour. But the real draw is that both seats have a powered recline (up to a generous 36 degrees), as well as a powered seat base extension for better thigh support. All this makes travelling in the E-Class feel like a business-class flight journey. You can even move the front passenger seat forward from back here. In the BMW, your driver has to do that for you via the touchscreen. BMW’s big fixed glass gives better sense of airiness. It’s clear then, while the 5 Series has a slight edge on seat softness and knee room, it’s the E-Class that really pampers you with a more special back-seat experience. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series features Both back seats have the expected set of amenities – four-zone climate control, USB ports, multiple AC vents, cup holders and wireless chargers in the armrests. While both get sunroofs, the Mercedes, as ever, uses a split dual-pane arrangement where only the front glass opens. The BMW, instead, has one large fixed glass and ultimately is the one that makes the cabin feel airier. Though neither gets a rear entertainment system, the BMW does at least offer an accessory for mounting your own device onto the back of the front seat. Merc ‘Superscreen’ with crisp displays is a big draw; third screen adds to the wow factor. Unusually, neither car offers heated or ventilated seats in the back, which feels like a miss when so much effort was expended in stretching them, and in both, all the fancy tech is at the front. For instance, while both cars offer tremendous-sounding, ultra-high-end audio systems, the Merc’sBurmester 4D system has exciters in the front seats that thump to the beat. The Bimmer has ventilated front seats, meanwhile. Similarly, both cars have selfie cameras up front, and while the BMW’s is mainly for the anti-theft system, the Mercedes’ lets the driver do video calls; so, why not in the back? BMW dash is clean but plain; helpful shortcut keys on centre console to access favourite functions. At the front of the E-Class, you can’t miss the ‘Superscreen’, which effectively replaces the dash with screens under a glass pane, and though it means little for those at the back, its wow factor alone elevates it above the 5 Series. All three screens are crisp, vivid and well laid out, and even though the passenger-side screen feels redundant and gimmicky, it’s all part of the occasion. As ever, they are quick and smooth to operate, but the downside is the whole dashboard is easily covered in fingerprints, dust and reflections. As with many modern cars, most functions have now moved away from buttons and into the screen. But what’s particularly annoying is that the AC fan and temperature, unlike the C and S-Class, now require two steps to adjust instead of one. They’ve also given it digital AC vents that can auto adjust based on presets in – you guessed it – the touchscreen, but luckily, they can also be used manually. Merc dials classy, easier to read on the go. The BMW’s AC vents are also technically digital in that you adjust them from electronic toggles placed lower in the dash, but the frustration here is that you can’t see what you’re adjusting. That’s because the vents are concealed behind the ‘interaction bar’, a contextual strip of crystalline LED lighting that flows across the dash and into the doors. Contextual because it changes colour with drive modes and emergency warnings and even has some touch controls built into it. Though the result is a clean, minimalist look, it feels quite ordinary next to the Merc. The 5 Series has a more conventional pair of screens, laid out in a curved array stacked on top of the dash. These are also good-looking and responsive, though we’d have liked a straightforward ‘dial’ option for the driver’s display; the futuristic aesthetic isn’t very intuitive. 5 Series gets an optional tablet holder. Quality in both cars is excellent and a step up from that of their predecessors, and each offers a choice of upholstery colours – cream, black or brown in the Mercedes, and brown on grey or blue on black in the BMW. The front seats are generous in both cars, with plenty of adjustment and soft neck cushions, but the 5 Series has a slight edge again with its softer cushioning. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series performance So, it’s a great place for your chauffeur, too, but what do they have to work with under these cars’ bonnets? Today, we’re driving the E 200 and the 530Li, which are both mild-hybrid 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol engines. Mercedes offers a four-cylinder diesel and a spicier six-cylinder petrol, too, and while we’re still to see any other engines in the BMW, there is the hot 600hp i5 EV. Back to the powertrains at hand, the Merc’s engine is now up to 204hp and 320Nm of torque, aided by a generous 23hp and 205Nm of electric boost. As with previous versions, it feels linear in its power delivery, with more than enough pep for sudden overtakes should you need them. There is a Sport mode, but it only makes a marginal difference. As before, the 9-speed gearbox can trip up and hunt for gears at crawling speeds, but in rare high-rev situations, and while very refined in isolation, engine noise creeps in sooner than in the 5 Series. The BMW also has much stronger performance; its engine produces a headier 258hp and 400Nm. And though its e-boost is considerably less, at just 11hp and 25Nm, you can never tell while driving it. In fact, apart from a Sport drive mode, the gearbox has its own sport mode, and then there’s the boost function, unlocked by holding down the left paddle shifter. With all these engaged, prepare for some very un-limo-like performance, the 530Li rocketing to 100kph in our tests in just 6.45 seconds – nearly 2 seconds quicker than the E 200. However, disarm all these modes, and it can do smooth and docile as well, with its ZF 8-speed gearbox handling matters better than the E’s 9-speed unit. The real surprise comes in ride quality. Neither car has air suspension or even adaptive dampers, but they both ride well, and despite their 3m-plus wheelbases, there’s enough ground clearance to get over most speed breakers without making contact. The E-Class feels a bit more tied down through corners and also at expressway speeds, but show it an uneven surface, and you’ll find considerable movement in the cabin, which spoils the otherwise serene experience. BMW’s ride has a softer edge over bumps. In an unexpected role reversal, it’s the 5 Series that has the better ride. Not only is it softer-edged over bumps, it’s more refined, too, letting in less road and tyre noise. And yet, it maintains its composure well at high speeds and is far more engaging through the corners, should you be driving yourself. The E-Class has a well-calibrated and accurate steering, but the 5’s is lighter at low speeds. It’s nowhere near as sharp to drive as its short-wheelbase predecessors, but for something this large, the long-wheelbase 5 Series’ breadth of dynamic ability is impressive. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series design There has been much talk about the way both these cars look, good and bad, and their design philosophies couldn’t be more different. The 5 Series has some seriously cool details, like its large, tipped-forward (and illuminated) grille, peeled-back adaptive LED headlamps with blue accents, sharp creases, slim LED tail-lamps and sporty bumpers. The trouble is, they don’t come together well on the bulky, amorphous and disproportionate sedan, and the aggressive M Sport styling kit feels particularly out of place here. 4cyl E-Class misses projector, adaptive lamps. The perfect example is the wheels, which have a sporty design on their own, but thanks to their deep-dish look, chunky rubber and the vast metal surface they sit under, they look tiny. Fun fact: The E-Class uses the exact same size of wheel and tyre – 225/55 R18, but you’d never guess by looking at them. It’s because of a clever dual-tone design that makes them visually larger, and the wheel arch gap is smaller. Massive doors cumbersome in tight spaces. Moreover, the Merc is a much better-proportioned limousine that has retained a proper three-box shape, giving it a regal stance on the road. There are some overdone details, like the black grille surround and flashy three-pointed-star tail-lamps, but they aren’t enough to detract from the overall classy look, nor are the headlamps that don’t get projector elements. It may be subjective, but we think the Mercedes has won the beauty contest here. Mercedes E-Class vs BMW 5 Series price and verdict Going into this test, we thought it would be a walkover for the E-Class, but it ended up being closer than anticipated, and that’s largely down to the 5 Series’ better-sorted mechanical package, which only a back-to-back drive could reveal. Apart from being quicker and more fun to drive, traits important to the chauffeur-driven impressed, too, like refinement, ride quality, smoothness, seat comfort and space. And that’s before the Rs 5.6 lakh price advantage it has on the Merc. 5 Series’ powertrain is not just more powerful but also smoother and more refined. But then, a price premium has never stopped people from thronging to the E-Class before, has it? And this time, the package has only gotten better. Where the Merc lags behind the BMW, it does so only by small margins, but where it gets ahead, it does so in style and delivers a tremendous feel-good factor. It can be found in the soft-close doors, the chauffeur package, the C-pillar that you hide behind, the pop-out door handles, the powered blinds, and yes, even the big touchscreen dashboard. Most of all, though, it’s in the way the back seat makes you feel like you’ve got your money’s worth, mainly down to the reclining backrest and extending squab, and also the grandeur it delivers with its wraparound ambient lighting. To sum up, BMW has put up a worthy challenge with this new 5 Series, and it’s worth your consideration. But it’s clear Mercedes has used eight years of the previous E-Class LWB dominance to study its customers and hone in on what matters most, and has thus delivered the better car.

    "description": "\"It’s fat, it’s slow, it’s a plug-in hybrid, it’s got an EV mode,\" they said. \"Is it even an M5,\" they asked? Yes, the new seventh-gen F90 M5 has attracted a lot of criticism, but naysayers also forget that this is the most powerful M5 ever built. And, unlike a few of its compatriots, going hybrid hasn’t sacrificed some of its cylinders. So, is this really an M5 then? We got to spend some time behind the wheel at the Buddh F1 circuit to try and figure out just that. BMW M5 engine and performance Let’s begin with the heart of the matter. The good news here is that while the new M5 is a hybrid, the engine is still the 4.4 litre V8. Let’s not forget the recently updated Mercedes AMG C 63 went hybrid, too, but it lost four of its eight cylinders. In the M5’s case, it’s added on a 197hp, 280Nm motor powered by an 18.6kW lithium-ion battery. Together with the 585hp, 750Nm V8, total system output stands at an impressive 727hp and 1,000Nm; hence, the most powerful M5 ever built. Acceleration is always instant thanks to the electric system. Sure, folks have called this M5 slow and that’s driven by the fact that at a claimed 0-100kph time of 3.5 seconds is a smidgen slower off the blocks than the previous car's 3.4-second claim. But you really can’t tell unless, perhaps, you drove them back-to-back. But leave the standing start aside and it's brilliant on the move – mash down on the throttle and off you go in an instant, with the electric system filling in nicely while the turbo spools up. Down the start-finish as well as the back straight, it was ridiculous seeing how quickly I was reeling in the XM, our lead car. I had to lift off each time. BMW M5 handling So it’s quick, now to figure out the issue of its weight. Coming in at just under 2.5 tonnes, the M5 is very heavy – remember, it’s got all-wheel-drive, has retained the V8 and added a motor and battery. But modern chassis systems do wonders at melting away fat. Sure, the M5 provides ample grip and good body control, but you do feel the weight. Especially out here on a race track where you’re coming in faster, braking later and going around a bend far quicker than you would on a public road. It’s not light on its feet, you feel the amount of mass you’re shifting, and the brakes feel like they are hard at work. But a point to note here, this press car had already done five sets of hard laps before this. Dynamically, on the whole, it will certainly feel better in the real world, so I can’t wait to drive it there. It does feel its weight in the corners. As with every modern car, there’s loads you can do with the electronics. Forget drive modes, you can adjust the suspension, the 8-speed gearbox’s shifts, the steering, brakes and the 4WD system, and it also has a 2WD mode. With just two laps, there was no time to work with the setup so I just left it in the sportiest settings. I tried rear-wheel-drive mode for a brief moment and the tail happily obliged with a little lean before ESP kicked in. BMW M5 interiors Besides the many controls for the chassis, there’s the M1 and M2 shortcut buttons on the steering that call up configurations of your choice. M cars can also be specified with the M Drive Professional option – which brings in a ‘Boost’ mode activated via a long pull on the left paddle – and ‘Track’ mode, which deactivates electronic nannies. You also get sport seats, which were quite wide for my narrow frame. Other M-specific bits include an Anthracite headliner and M-specific ambient lighting. Steering-mounted controls for chassis finished in red add to the sporty ambience. M5s also come with a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Diamond surround sound system with 18 speakers. Apart from the sound of the mighty V8, the music system also amplifies the sound by piping it in via the speakers. Other bits are familiar BMW, so you have the crystal dial for the central controller and the single-piece, curved glass panel, which houses a 12.3-inch instrument display and a 14.9-inch touchscreen. BMW M5 exterior Unlike the regular 5 Series that's available in India only in long wheelbase (3,105mm) format, the M version uses the regular 3,006mm wheelbase, so that's an obvious way to tell them apart. India-spec 5 Series' wheelbase is a noticeable 99mm longer than the M5. Furthermore, you get M-specific bits all around, like a massive bumper and air intakes lower down, an air splitter finished in carbon fibre if you opt for the carbon pack. The pack also adds carbon on the roof, rear view mirrors, rear spoiler and rear diffuser. Interestingly, the front grille, whose profile is illuminated, has a significant portion closed off, much like you’d see on an EV. At the rear, quad exhaust pipes and a massive two-section diffuser announce this car’s sporty side. BMW M5 price and verdict The M5 is priced at Rs 1.99 crore, ex-showroom, which is a significant mark up over the previous car’s Rs 1.62 crore. But it’s also just Rs 4 lakh over the sporty Mercedes-AMG C 63 (Rs 1.95 crore), which though a hybrid, uses a smaller 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine. So is the new M5 worth the sticker price? We’ll know after a full review out on the road. But to answer the big question everyone’s been asking: is this an M5? The answer is yes. It’s not the greatest in its long line of ancestors, but an M5 it surely is.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz is gearing up to launch the EQS 450 SUV and G 580 with EQ technology on January 9. The latter will be a CKD offering, and incidentally, India is the first market outside the US to assemble the EQS SUV. Mercedes EQS 580 SUV and Maybach EQS 680 SUV launched in September The EQS 450 shares its 122kWh battery with the Maybach EQS 680 Current EQS 580 has a range of 809km Mercedes EQS 450 battery specs The 450 will be the second variant in the EQS SUV line-up (excluding the Maybach) and will be available as a 5-seater. It will be powered by the same 122kWh battery pack used in the 7-seater EQS 580 4Matic SUV (544hp, 858Nm). This is by far the country’s largest claimed cell capacity for any passenger EV. The battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 31 minutes using a 200kW DC charger. For reference, the EQA and EQE SUVs are run by 70.5kWh and 90.5kWh batteries, respectively. Mercedes EQS 450 exterior, interior details This entry-level EQS SUV continues to have a familiar design with a blanked-off grille that extends into the lower section of the front bumper. The LED headlamps are bridged by a light bar running across the nose. Its overall aerodynamic silhouette resembles the EQS 580 but the design of the 21-inch alloy wheel has been refreshed. Inside, seats with crafted covers are standard and it gets exclusive features like Energising Air Control Plus. It is likely to borrow the 56-inch Hyperscreen setup – 12.3-inch instrument cluster and front passenger screen and a 17.7-inch touchscreen infotainment. It is also likely to include twin 11.6-inch rear entertainment screens, a 5-speaker Burmester audio system, 360-degree camera, 5-zone automatic climate control, soft close doors, puddle lamps and illuminated running boards. As for the safety bundle, expect Level 2 ADAS, 9 airbags, and more.  Mercedes EQS 450 price The Mercedes EQS 450 SUV is designed for buyers seeking extra cabin space, especially the chauffeur-driven. It remains to be seen how Mercedes will price it, as it will be placed between the Rs 1.59 crore EQE and the Rs 1.61 crore EQS SUVs (both prices on road, Mumbai).

    "description": "Maruti’s flagship SUV, the Grand Vitara, has surpassed the 2.5 lakh unit sales mark since its launch on September 26, 2022. It was the fastest in the midsize SUV segment to reach the 1,00,000 and 2,00,000 unit sales milestones. Grand Vitara gets petrol mild-hybrid, strong-hybrid and CNG options Sales had surpassed 2 lakh units in July this year It is a badge-engineered product based on the Toyota Hyryder Grand Vitara is the bestselling Nexa SUV The Grand Vitara SUV currently accounts for 17 percent of Maruti Suzuki’s UV sales from April to November 2024 and is the second Nexa SUV model after the Fronx in the current fiscal. Since its launch, the SUV achieved cumulative wholesales of 2,50,000 units by November 2024, with 10,148 units sold that month. The premium midsize SUV, which surpassed the 2,00,000-unit sales milestone in early July 2024, took a little over four months to reach an additional 50,000 units. In the process, the Grand Vitara, which is retailed from Maruti Suzuki’s premium Nexa sales channel, has become the bestselling Nexa SUV in cumulative sales, with 12,589 units ahead of the Fronx compact SUV (2,39,877 units), which was launched in April 2023.  As per the latest industry data, the Grand Vitara has clocked total sales of 2,52,466 units, including 79,982 units in the April-November 2024 period. The Grand Vitara becomes the fastest midsize SUV to achieve the 2,50,000-unit milestone, in line with its 2,00,000 sales in 22 months, bettering the Hyundai Creta, which took 25 months to reach the same milestone. The popular Maruti SUV was also the fastest in the midsize SUV segment to hit the 1,00,000-unit mark, taking just 12 months from its market entry.  Grand Vitara powertrain highlights The highlight of the Grand Vitara is its two engine options, which it shares with the Toyota Hyryder. The proven 103hp, 1.5-litre K15C petrol mild-hybrid engine, also used in several Maruti Suzuki models (Brezza, Ertiga, XL6), is paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. There’s also the Toyota-sourced 92hp, 1.5-litre, three-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine paired with an electric motor that develops 79hp and 141Nm of torque. Combined, the hybrid powertrain produces 116hp and is paired with an e-CVT gearbox. Maruti claims an efficiency of 27.97kpl for this powertrain. The Grand Vitara, available in 12 variants, is priced starting at Rs 10.99 lakh for the base Sigma variant and goes up to Rs 19.93 lakh for the top-end Alpha+ variant.
