    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/what-would-happen-if-we-all-stopped-buying-new-cars",
    "description": "UK buyers will spend an estimated £80 billion on new cars this year What if we didn’t buy any new cars for a year? That’s a thought experiment suggested by Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, writing to the Financial Times recently.  Oswald used data from the RAC Foundation and Autocar to estimate that UK buyers will spend £80 billion on new cars this year. Which is, technically speaking, a shedload of money. Relatively, we won’t spend vastly greater sums on public services like education (£110bn) or health and social care (£190bn) – both public expenditures that the government may be looking to trim. Will we really spend that much on cars? Possibly. We’d need to buy two million at £40k a pop to total £80bn. We bought (or registered) 1.9 million last year. But for the purposes of the experiment, it doesn’t really matter if it’s a bit over or under: it’s still a ton of money. What would happen, wondered Oswald, if we reviewed our private spending as we do public spending, so thoroughly in fact that we bought no new cars at all this year? “How much harm would that do to our citizens?” he asked. I suppose the first thing to consider would be the practical harm. It would put thousands of people out of jobs, and a significant part of that £80bn will be tax, with VAT into double-digit billions and another chunk again from first registration fees (which vary dependent on CO2 emissions), plus the Expensive Car Supplement for cars costing over £40k. The Treasury could lose £15bn or more before one even considers a drop in corporation and income taxes and an additional spend on benefits. I suspect Rachel Reeves would prefer this thought experiment to remain exactly that. But the esteemed prof is, I think, more curious about what it would do to our overall happiness. “Humans are dragged into harmful ‘keeping-up-with-the-Joneses’ status races,” he wrote. The implication is that we might feel better if we gave up those and looked after one another more. Enthusiasts don’t buy cars as status symbols, but I don’t think it’s controversial to accept that people do. I’ve had friends and acquaintances ask what car they should buy next while in the same breath telling me how much they like the car they own now. So maybe keep that? Still, I think it’s curious how often cars are the obvious target when people look at status-driven buying behaviours. I understand that cars are expensive, but we don’t have the same discussions about conservatories, cockapoos or chips, and you can’t even use those to get to work or visit your gran. What’s also striking is that how many cars we buy seems inextricably linked to the country’s prosperity. A large new car market is perceived as a marker of a healthy economy, in a way that isn’t true of, say, toasters. Those we buy when we need them. Cars, meanwhile, we buy because the finance term is coming to an end and the cambelt will soon need changing, or the company decides it’s time you deserved something shinier to keep you working there, so off it goes to be replaced by something  a bit better than the neighbours have. But, as Oswald noted, “modern cars have an enormously long life and are relatively inexpensive to maintain”, so even if we paused buying, we would still be able to get places. And his point about longevity is true. At least it is for now. But, I wonder, in times of £1800 headlight clusters, multiple electronic control units to let cars meet emissions and safety rules at a cost of thousands a time and what often just generally feels like an inbuilt obsolescence, for how long cars will remain cheap to maintain into their later life. We buy enough cars when they’re affordable to fix; how many will we get through when driving into a pheasant writes off an older one? I don’t think the optimum number of cars for us to buy is none, and this is something that will stay only a thought. But if we didn’t buy quite so many and more were simpler and designed to stay affordable, I don’t think that would be a bad thing.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/true-ford-mapping-blue-ovals-uk-past-explorer",
    "description": "There's enough Ford magic to make the origins of its platform a moot point We trace the American car giant's UK past in the electric Explorer to see if this VW-based EV still feels like a Ford It was a bright, beautiful April Fool’s Day. At 6.30am, a magnificent golden orb lit the eastern horizon with a brilliance we probably won’t see more than a dozen times this year. The breeze was sweet and the air so clear you could practically see blades of grass on the horizon. Despite the beleaguered state of the retail motor industry, the news feeds were already filling with car companies’ traditional April Fool spoofs: a free tattoo for every new Volkswagen owner, BMW to launch an off-road version of the M2 – that sort of thing. And in Manchester, the Volkswagen ID 4 in which I was about to cross the country had turned into a Ford. To be fair, we’ve known for years that Ford was basing its first all-European electric cars – the Explorer and the Capri – on the VW Group’s excellent and well-proven MEB platform, the same component set used to underpin the ID 3 and ID 4. This was undoubtedly a pragmatic decision, given that Ford urgently needs to do better in the European EV race. And despite a nine-month production delay, the project is turning into a modest – if not yet profitable – success. Selfishly speaking, Ford’s MEB decision didn’t suit me. Outside the limits of the impartiality needed to be a fair-minded road tester, I’m a Ford fan: my grandfather was a pioneering Ford dealer in the Australian bush, we had lots of family Fords and my first new car was a Cortina 1600E. My view of Ford is that it may make everyman cars, but it also does things first – such as the life-changing Model T, the first affordable V8, unitary steel construction, MacPherson struts, the original Mustang, the GT40, the first ‘computer-designed’ Cortina, all those fast Escorts and much, much more. I simply didn’t enjoy the notion of a me-too European Ford based on a rival manufacturer’s mainstream product. Especially a Volkswagen. After all, it’s not so long since the glorious, game-changing Ford Focus was forcing all comers – and most prominently Ferdinand Piëch’s Mk5 VW Golf – to ride, steer and handle better to meet a much-elevated industry standard. When James Attwood’s 2025 Ford Explorer long-termer – a £50k, two-wheel-drive long-range model – arrived a few weeks ago, it became clear it was high time for me to get over myself. Especially since Attwood had pronounced it a good machine, distinct from the various VW Group models with the same underpinnings. A workable plan seemed to be to immerse the Explorer – and myself – in as much Ford heritage as we could find in a day, to see how well it fitted. Or how well it didn’t. The simple plan was to take it on a day-long journey starting at Trafford Park, Manchester, where Henry Ford made 300,000 Model Ts for his first 20 years of British business from 1911, before moving to Dagenham in the early 1930s and turning the Manchester place over to the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines during the war years. From there, we would roll across the country to Ford’s heritage centre at Daventry, to associate the Explorer with as many of its ancestors as possible under the eye of curator Len Keen. Then we’d continue south-east to Dunton, the research centre that nowadays doubles as Ford’s British HQ, ending our journey beside a statue of the founder, Old Henry, erected at Dagenham in 1944 and now overlooking Dunton’s main entrance. This drive would be typically British: plenty of motorway, plenty of potholes, some sinuous A- and B-roads and some recharging episodes, with all the parking and service area manoeuvring this involved. Photographer Jack and I arrived in Manchester the night before our journey was to begin, hoping that an unsuccessful meeting with a steam-driven 22kW Geniepoint charger outside our otherwise-comfortable Trafford hotel wasn’t an omen of things to follow.  For no good reason it wouldn’t function, which meant our journey couldn’t begin with a full tank, as it were. One thing the hotel did have, bizarrely, was a parking line of about a dozen used, obviously recently imported Yankee cars for sale via eBay. Evidently the vendor was using the hotel car park for selling. We photographed our Explorer beside a US-market Explorer of a very different persuasion, wondering at Ford’s tendency to spread familiar names over models of different characters and layouts. Before departure the following morning, I rang the Geniepoint helpline to report the charger failure on behalf of other arriving hopefuls, to be greeted by a polite woman with a voice full of concern, who reset the charger there and then. I watched it click into action, but its charge rate was too slow to justify our waiting. Still, it was a good sign: even when you’re talking duff chargers, EV life is getting better. The only sign these days of Ford’s former presence at Trafford Park is a blue plaque in one of the many entrance halls of the Trafford Centre, a staggeringly huge and spacious multi-storey mall of satisfyingly appropriate American influence. We found and read the plaques, then jumped back in the car and headed hot-foot for the open road, hooking up after a mile or two with the M6 motorway. Our immediate destination, 40 miles on, was the Sandbach service area and a reassuring bank of a dozen Instavolt chargers that converted our 35% of battery capacity to 85% at a rate of 85kW in the time it took us to drink a couple of cappuccinos. It was pricey, mind, at 89p per kWh. Ford’s Daventry heritage base – also a massive parts store and the site of the Henry Ford Academy where technicians further their skills – was now an easy 92 miles away. The car was doing unobtrusively well. It turns out to be a composed cruiser with long-distance seats and sweet steering that’s notably accurate at the straight-ahead and thus not tiring for longer journeys. There’s not much road noise on smooth stuff but, like many German-developed cars, it gets noisy on the coarse surfaces that are much more prevalent here in the UK than they are elsewhere in Europe. We cruised at around 70mph on the speedo (knock off 2mph for built-in error) because we soon established that at this speed, with a little care, you could turn 3.5mpkWh – the claimed WLTP figure; cruising just a shade quicker caused the figure to fall to 3.1-3.2mpkWh. You become aware of the exponential rise of aero drag with speed so much sooner in an EV than you do in a petrol car. A slightly lower speed and consequent better consumption can add 10-15 miles to the range you get from a 50kW charge while making no important difference to your journey time (this point proved by my own assiduous observations of sat-nav arrival predictions). I was clocking such esoterics as Jack drove, proving himself expert at seeing interesting traffic (“Did you spot that new Corvette?”), which added a lot to the interest of our progress. With miles, the Ford grew on us both. It seemed supple and comfortable, and we negated the sometime road noise by raising our voices when necessary. Neither of us was truly expert on how this chassis compared with a VW version, but our background impression (confirmed later by Attwood) was that the ride was a bit softer yet well damped and composed. This was another good Ford sign. So was the styling: I was liking the blocky, well-proportioned shape. We stayed an hour in Daventry, mainly because Len Keen and his two technician colleagues, Chris and Andy, were so welcoming. The Ford heritage collection brilliantly combines perfect examples of ordinary models with hero cars driven by Hannu Mikkola, Roger Clark and a dozen other road and track stars. They also continue to preserve the Autocar-badged M-Sport Fiesta ST in which then staffer Chris Harris won his class in Wales Rally GB 20 years ago (which had an echo for me; I watched him do it). Photographer Jack, compact of build, amused us with his claim to be the one bloke in our group who could perfectly fit Ford’s beautiful silver GT40, the road-going model with wire wheels and three-eared knock-offs, that was sized for Walter Hayes, the legendary communications chief whose determination and strong influence with the Ford family led to the creation of the Ford DFV racing V8, surely the most successful Formula 1 engine in history. On we drove through the afternoon towards Dunton in Essex, spearing east from Daventry on the evocative A45 that links half a dozen defunct British car factories (including Jaguar at Browns Lane and various British Leyland places south of Coventry). This road also doubled for a while as a test track for 1950s Le Mans Jaguars. One story has it that Jag founder Sir William Lyons well understood the need for fast shakedowns on weekdays, but frowned on the idea of high-speed testing on a Sunday… As we drove, this Ford was taking hold of me. Its composure was starting to remind me of Parry-Jones-era Fords, one of which (a Mondeo) I’d driven quite a lot just a few weeks before. This felt like a European Ford, which is a compliment. In particular it was different in composure terms from the US-developed Ford Mustang Mach-E, whose engineers have just about managed to tame a pitching motion in steady-state cruising, after years of trying. This EV had overtones of Ford’s European golden age. At Dunton, Henry Ford was waiting. We arrived just before knock-off time at 4pm, which means the cornering shots we did on the entrance roundabout (see above) were a bit unhelpful to the departing workforce. In all, we notched 230 miles at an average speed of 54mph, consuming power at 3.5mpkWh – a very decent performance. The car’s economy and its real-world range were honest figures, in line with the maker’s claims. Best of all it felt and looked like a Ford, and not a Volkswagen. In one enjoyable day, the ghosts were laid to rest.",

    "description": "The Ducati Scrambler 1100 is not long for this world. Rather than update its aging engine (originally borrowed from the Monster 1100) to meet ever-stricter European emissions regulations, Ducati is dropping it from its portfolio altogether. The odds were stacked against the Ducati Scrambler 1100 from the get-go. It offers less power than most of its competitors for the same, or more, money. And the fact that it inherited the goofy ‘Scrambler’ moniker from the more established Ducati Scrambler 800 when it barely resembles one, hasn’t helped. As far as we’re concerned, the Scrambler 1100 got a raw deal. It has a lot going for it in the looks department, its air-cooled mill feels wonderfully retro, and it’s a delight to ride.…",

    "description": "The Honda Activa is the single largest selling scooter in India and has unmatched brand recognition in our market. Yet, when the Activa e: debuted, because of some crucial misses, it didn't strike the right chord. The reason I bring this up is that we are about to discuss the Suzuki e-Access, which is another Japanese electric scooter bearing a badge that's well established in India. So, has Suzuki succeeded where its Japanese compatriot hasn't?  Suzuki e Access design and colours e Access has an unusual design and comes in three colours One glance at the e-Access will tell you that Suzuki has thrown the family scooter design rulebook out the window. Depending on who you are, that will be a good or bad thing. I think the e-Access looks a lot better in the flesh than in pictures, although that double ‘duck bill’ front end will be an acquired taste. Love it or hate it, this unconventional design will help it stand out on the road from the sea of family scooters. The e-Access can be had in three colours – black/red, green/silver and white/silver. The e-Access has a rather unconventional design. Suzuki e Access battery and range, charging time e Access uses an LFP battery with 95km claimed range Another area where Suzuki has gone down a different route than every other well-known electric scooter on sale is the e-Access’ battery chemistry. It uses an LFP (Lithium Ferrous Phosphate) battery in a market dominated by NCM (Nickel Cobalt Manganese) batteries. The two sides of that coin are that while LFP batteries are safer and longer lasting, they cannot match a similarly sized NCM battery in terms of energy density.  The fast charger can top up the e-Access' battery in just over 2 hours. Therefore, it's not surprising that Suzuki claims a 95km certified range from the e-Access' 3kWh battery, roughly 20 percent less than the equivalent e scooter using an NCM battery. Suzuki will supply a 600-watt portable charger, which takes 6 hours 20 minutes to top up said battery from flat to full. The company also says that it is going to set up fast charging stations at all its outlets this year itself. Using that charger will fully charge the battery in just 2 hours 12 minutes. Suzuki e Access features It is a decently feature-rich offering  Coming to the features front, while the e-Access has the usual gaffe of smart features (accessible via pairing your smartphone to the 4.2-inch TFT dash), three riding modes (Eco, Ride A and Ride B), a USB charging port and the like, I'd like to give a special mention to a very intuitive feature. The scooter’s seat stays open in the position you leave it unassisted (a la Bajaj Chetak), which is a very handy thing if you've got both your hands full. The seat stays open unassisted. The trouble is that the under-seat storage area on the e-Access can hold just 17 litres – about half the size of most other rivals. In fact, even the latest-gen petrol Access has a bigger boot than the e-Access. Missed opportunity, Suzuki. The 4.2-inch colour TFT display is bright and well-laid out, but the bezels are rather large. Suzuki e Access ride and handling It is a surefooted and predictable handler But where the company has played to its strengths are in the way the e-Access behaves once you start riding. We were given just 45 minutes on a go kart track, so our learnings aren't the most comprehensive. Even so, this thing showed real promise. It is a sure-footed and predictable handler but isn't energetic. While it isn't as energetic a handler as an Ather 450, our experience so far suggests that the e-Access is flickable enough that slicing your way through dense city traffic won't be an issue. Performance is also measured and calm, with a gentle and progressive build of power that will be welcoming for both newer riders and the average scooter user. Be warned though, if you're expecting a zippy EV experience, you may want to look elsewhere. 17-litre boot is much smaller than other EVs in this class. Suzuki e Access ride modes, regenrative braking Ride modes are well thought-out but switching between them isn't straightforward That being said, Suzuki has thought out the ride modes very well and you can easily bop around town even in Eco, which limits you to 55kph. However, Suzuki has needlessly complicated switching between the three modes. You can switch from Eco to either Ride A or Ride B on the move, but you can't switch between Ride A and Ride B while riding. Before you set off, you must program what Ride mode you'd like to switch to from Eco, and to change that, you'll need to stop again. Toggling between the riding modes should've been a more straightforward experience. Suzuki says this was done so that riders don’t get caught off-guard with the differing regenerative braking settings between Ride A and Ride B. To be honest, we think the difference isn’t that big and this seems like an unnecessary complication on an otherwise straightforward scooter.  Seating comfort seems to be bang on with a very neutral rider’s triangle complemented by a spacious, well-padded seat. We only went over a few plastic composite speed breakers placed on the track in our stint with it, so it's hard to pass a definitive verdict on suspension comfort. But the e-Access felt like it was ironing out a lot of the jolt. Suzuki e Access price expectation and verdict It's a well-engineered and thoughtful scooter, although pricing is a question mark So far, it's the typical Suzuki story. It's a practical, well thought-out and high-quality machine, which is what most potential customers are looking for. So that's half the battle won. The problem is, since Suzuki hasn't revealed the price (or so much as given a hint about it), summing this rather likable e-scooter up is something we'll reserve for another day. The e-Access is a sorted package, but its pricing will determine its success. However, if Suzuki does manage to price it sensibly (around the Rs 1.20 lakh ballpark, ex-showroom), then I think the e-Access will find takers as it is a no-nonsense and practical offering that comes from a steadfast Japanese brand that's known for its reliability the world over.

    "description": "The premium electric vehicles (EV) space has really begun to heat up. While there weren’t any options between the Rs 25 lakh MG ZS EV and the Rs 1 crore Mercedes EQC earlier, now there are as many as six EVs priced around Rs 50 lakh on sale. Of these, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the recently launched BYD Sealion 7 and the locally made BMW iX1 LWB appear to be the most compelling. We brought the three together and put them through our real-world tests to see which one deserves a spot in your garage. All three EVs measure over 4.6 metres in length, over 1.8 metres in width and have a 2.8-metre or longer wheelbase. The BYD is the longest and the widest, the BMW is the tallest, and the Hyundai trumps the other two in wheelbase length. As for their underpinnings, the BYD and Hyundai have born-electric platforms, which allow for better packaging and interior space. As such, these two feature a properly usable frunk (front trunk), which the ICE-to-EV converted BMW lacks.

The Ioniq 5 takes the shape of a large hatchback; the iX1 is more like a traditional SUV, while the Sealion 7 looks like a coupé-SUV. It really depends on which style you prefer, but all of them stand out in their own way with distinctive design elements. The Ioniq 5 has a neo-retro look with sharp cuts and creases and unique multi-spoke, dual-tone alloys, and I particularly like the rectangular lighting elements. In contrast, the Sealion 7 has a more rounded design that goes with BYD’s family look. It does look large and ungainly from the front, but the large alloys and the tapering roofline add some flair. At the rear, there’s a connected lighting element, which has some nice details. The BMW is the most conventional by far and has that upright stance of an SUV. It features BMW’s signature kidney grille, which appears a bit too large, as do the LED headlights. Its side profile does not look the most proportionate, thanks to the longer wheelbase and the smaller 18-inch wheels; the rear is quite similar to the standard X1, with large, L-shaped LED tail-lamps. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB interior space and comfort The Sealion 7’s interior is superbly finished and loaded with tech, but the instrument cluster is cluttered. All three EVs have distinct identities inside the cabin as well. Starting with the Sealion 7, you’re greeted with a relatively conventional-looking dashboard, which houses the screens for the touchscreen infotainment system and the driver’s display. The 15.6-inch touchscreen, in typical BYD fashion, can change orientation from landscape to portrait, is very slick to operate, has high-res graphics, and even gets an updated UI over its siblings. This screen controls most of the car’s functions, but it’s nice that there are some physical controls in the centre console and a neat trick to adjust the AC without going into the sub-menus. All you have to do is swipe on the screen with three fingers from left to right for fan speed and from top to bottom for the temperature. Tinted glass at the back helps keep the Sealion 7 cool. The driver’s display, too, is high-res, but it appears very cluttered, and a lot of the important info appears small. But you have to commend BYD for the superb material quality and fit-and-finish, which feel on par with European luxury brands. The BYD's high-res 360-degree camera is one of the best. In the centre console, you get two wireless charging pads and two cup holders; there’s even some storage space below the console. The front seats feature ventilation, have just the right amount of cushioning and are very comfortable for occupants of all sizes. At the back, too, the seats feel plush and can be reclined; there’s loads of space, particularly legroom. The large windows and the glass roof elevate the sense of space. BYD’s 500-litre boot can fit in a lot. BYD has also packed the Sealion 7 with features like wireless smartphone integration, a 12-speaker Dynaudio music system, powered front seats, auto headlamps and wipers, a gesture-controlled and powered tailgate, dynamic ambient lighting, and much more. As for safety, there are 11 airbags, including one between the front seats and two for the rear side bolsters. There’s also Level 2 ADAS, a crisp 360-degree camera, and a driver-attention monitor, which is way too sensitive – even briefly glancing at the touchscreen generates a warning. The Sealion 7’s rear seat is big on space and feels the plushest. As for the new iX1 LWB, it has the same dash design as the ICE-powered X1 and the iX1 xDrive30, with a large, curved display that includes the infotainment touchscreen and the instrument panel. There are large, horizontal AC vents on the passenger side of the dash and under the screen, below which a sizeable wireless charging pad is located. The centre console extends from the centre armrest and houses some of the car’s key functions. The screens, while high in resolution, are too complicated tonavigate initially and on the go. While the fit and finish are great, some materials lower in the cabin are hard and scratchy. The steering is typically BMW with a chunky rim; the touchscreen has swallowed too many controls, and the UI is confusing. The front seats are supportive, but larger passengers may find them narrow, and they don’t have ventilation, which the other two EVs provide. The cushioning is firmer than the BYD’s. While the seats may not seem as comfortable initially, you’ll feel the cushioning is well-judged the longer you spend time in them. It’s at the rear where you get to experience the benefits of a long wheelbase. Though you are seated quite low and in a bit of a knees-up position because of the underfloor battery, you get acres of legroom; the seat base is longer by 15mm, and the backrest can be reclined up to 28.5 degrees, all of which make it more comfortable than the standard wheelbase version of the iX1. Compared to the BYD, though, the BMW feels narrower inside, and the backrest cushioning is on the firmer side. What also would’ve added to the comfort is rear sun blinds, which are also missing in the BYD. The iX1 has the most legroom but doesn’t get sunshades. The BMW is the least feature-rich EV here, but it still gets stuff like a large panoramic glass roof, ambient lighting, auto LED headlamps, connected tech, a smartphone-enabled key, leather upholstery, eight airbags and Level 2 ADAS tech. BMW’s 490-litre boot is the smallest here. Now, let’s come to the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Step inside it, and you get a great sense of space, thanks to the massive glass area, light colours, flat floor and the absence of a traditional centre console. Hyundai has used recycled and sustainable materials inside, and what’s great is that the fit and finish, as well as the touch and feel of bits, are top-notch. However, the white upholstery stains very easily, as you’d typically expect. The Hyundai's cabin is well-finished, logically laid out and big on practicality; UI is the easiest to use. Headlining the dash are two 12.3-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment. These displays are crisp and easy to read, and the UI is easier to understand and navigate than that of the other two. The steering is a 2-spoke unit that houses a round drive-mode selector, while the drive-selector stalk is beneath the headlamp stalk. Uniquely, the entire centre console slides front and back to tailor the space and access. There are also plenty of storage spaces, such as a huge drawer in place of the glove box, large door bins and the centre console itself. The Ioniq 5's front seats are cooled, heated and get ottomans. The front seats are broad and supremely comfortable, with soft cushioning and plenty of electric adjustments, including extendable leg rests, and they can be configured into a comfy lounger. They also have ventilation and heating. The rear seats, though not as comfy as the ones in front, are easily wide enough for three adults, with the outer two seats featuring heating and electric adjustment. However, you are seated in a knees-up position due to the battery under the floor. The Hyundai's rear seats are wide enough for three, but you’re seated in a knees-up position. The Ioniq 5 also packs in a panoramic fixed glass roof, an 8-speaker Bose sound system, a 360-degree parking camera, dual-zone climate control, an electric boot, ESP, six airbags and ADAS. Wired smartphone integration is a downer, though.

The Sealion 7 has an all-wheel drive (there is also an RWD version), the Ioniq 5 is rear-wheel drive and, rather unconventionally, it’s the BMW that’s front-wheel drive. The BYD, in this dual-motor Performance guise, also has a clear advantage in terms of output (530hp/690Nm), followed by the Hyundai (217hp/350Nm) and the BMW (204hp/250Nm). And this is reflected in the performance figures. The Sealion 7 Performance makes the 0-100kph sprint in a brisk 4.43 seconds, compared to the Ioniq’s 7.48 seconds and the iX1’s 11.30 seconds. It’s the same story in rolling acceleration, with the BYD comfortably outperforming its rivals. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how these feel like to drive, one thing each of them does admirably well is delivering power in a linear manner, unlike EVs of old, which served up all of their performance in one big chunk right from the get-go. All three also get drive modes, which affect throttle sensitivity, power delivery and range. Let’s start with the BYD, which easily feels the quickest of the lot. What’s nice is that it is able to put its power down in a tidy manner, thanks to the AWD system. On the move, you’ll also appreciate how smooth and progressive the power delivery is. And while the powertrain is silent, you will start to hear more of the outside world as you get closer to triple-digit speeds despite it featuring double-glazed front windows. Similarly, in the Hyundai, you don’t get that neck-snapping acceleration; the power delivery is nice and smooth. But that’s not to say that you’ll feel a lack of performance, as the Ioniq 5 feels sprightly in the Sport mode. The throttle modulation has also been judged very well, and it feels like a normal ICE car to drive. What’s also nice is that suspension, road and tyre noises barely disrupt the silence of the cabin. The BMW, by far, feels the most relaxed out of the trio, and while it packs over 200hp, given the weight it has to haul around, it can leave you wanting more, like when you want to make a quick overtake. As it has a front-wheel drive, there’s also some torque steer to contend with when driven flat out. As for sound insulation, it isn’t as quiet on the move as the Ioniq but fares better than the Sealion 7.

The Sealion 7 has an 82.56kWh unit with BYD’s blade cell LFP battery technology. The Ioniq 5 has the second-largest battery pack at 72.6kWh, and the BMW has the smallest at 66.4kWh; these two use the NMC battery chemistry. However, the Ioniq 5 has the highest claimed range of 631km, followed by the Sealion 7 (542km) and the iX1 (531km). In our real-world range test, the Ioniq 5 came out on top with a calculated overall range of 457km, significantly higher than the other two. The iX1 LWB had a 398km range, and given the extra power, the BYD delivered the least range of 371km. And, as is the case with most EVs, all three were more efficient in the city cycle, where they can recuperate more energy.  The move to the long wheelbase has come at the cost of some agility. All three get multiple regen braking modes, but the BMW has an advantage here with four modes; the Hyundai gets three, while the BYD has only two. One must note that the BMW also has an adaptive regen mode, but it’s not very intuitive, and the Hyundai is the only one in which you can turn off regen, allowing for free coasting. However, the BMW’s mode controls are baked into the touchscreen, making it tedious to change them on the move, and it’s also the most aggressive of the lot. On the other hand, the BYD feels the least aggressive, even in its ‘High’ mode. It’s the Hyundai’s regen that is best tuned, with a natural feel in the lower level, and you can even adjust levels or turn it off via paddle shifters. Also, the iX1 and the Ioniq 5 are capable of one-pedal driving. Despite huge 20-inch alloys, the ride is supple. The Ioniq 5 is the clear winner when it comes to charging speeds, as it is capable of DC fast charging at speeds of up to 350kW, which is enough to take it from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. The BYD can be charged up to 150kW on a DC fast charger. Both these are also capable of V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2L (vehicle-to-load) functions, wherein they can charge other EVs and power/charge other devices. The BMW can be fast-charged up to 130kW. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB ride comfort and handling As for ride and handling, the Sealion 7 has a hint of firmness to its ride, but it manages to deal with road imperfections fairly well. The 20-inch wheels on this AWD version are a fly in the ointment, making it feel crashy over bumps. Given its mass and high centre of gravity, the BYD rolls a fair bit around bends, and its steering feels a little too quick. Smaller 18-inch wheels help give it a cushy ride. The Ioniq 5 feels planted at all speeds, and you’ll like the maturity with which it drives. The steering is direct and has a good heft, but it doesn’t feel sporty to drive, which is fine given its focus on comfort. And despite sitting on those large 20-inch alloys, the ride feels comfy and well-damped, and the Ioniq 5 deals with the rough stuff fairly well. There are some minor vertical movements over expansion joints, but it feels well-controlled. Meanwhile, the long wheelbase has affected the BMW iX1’s handling just as you’d expect. It doesn’t feel as agile as the regular wheelbase, dual-motor iX1 xDrive30, but it still grips corners admirably well with little body roll to speak of. The ride quality, like in most BMWs lately, is excellent. It feels very absorbent and does a good job of making the iX1 feel composed over most surfaces. BYD Sealion 7 vs Hyundai Ioniq 5 vs BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The iX1, which has BMW’s badge value to bank on, has plenty of space at the back and is very attractively priced at Rs 49 lakh; dynamically, it’s the best here. But it has its shortcomings – it isn’t as equipped as the others; the infotainment system is unnecessarily complex and has swallowed a lot of key functions; the rear-seat backrest cushioning is firm, and certain plastics lower in the cabin feel out of place on a BMW. Now let’s sum up the Sealion 7. It is BYD’s most rounded offering in India yet and has everything we love about the Seal sedan in a more practical package. The interior quality and fit-and-finish are top-notch; it’s got all the tech and features you need, a comfortable backseat, and the most powerful drivetrain that’s quite smooth. It’s also the only one here with all-wheel drive (Rs 54.90 lakh), though there’s an RWD version with a higher claimed range of 567km but a lower output (310hp, 380Nm) and a price tag of Rs 48.90 lakh, which is still more expensive than the Hyundai and with a lower promised range. The Sealion 7 loses ground in its real-world range, which is the lowest, and it isn’t as well-rounded in many specific matters – the sound levels inside the cabin are high, the ride isn’t as plush, and the driver’s display is cluttered. And then, there’s BYD’s relative lack of an aftersales network. And this brings us to the winner, the Hyundai Ioniq 5. It standsout as the most approachable and well-rounded package. The cabin is spacious, the seats are very comfy and unique, and the infotainment is easy to navigate. The Ioniq 5 is also the most natural to drive, has the best real-world range and can charge at the fastest pace. To top it off, it’s the most affordable, too, at Rs 46 lakh. It’s no wonder then that the Ioniq 5 won our Car of the Year 2024 award and this comparison, too.

    "description": "Kia has introduced the third model year update for its all-electric EV9 SUV flagship in the US. In addition to improved range for select 2026 EV9 variants, a new Nightfall Edition featuring both exterior and interior, and performance upgrades is also on offer.  Kia EV9 Nightfall Edition features a Boost mode for extra torque output The electric SUV is sold in four variants in the US; India gets only the fully-loaded GT-Line trim 2026 Kia EV9 range details Up to 16.1km range added While the Kia EV9 in India is available only in the top-spec GT-Line, it's also sold in Land, Wind, Light LR and Light SR trims in America. Of these, the updated EV9 GT-Line sees the biggest improvement in range, up 16.1km to 451km (brand estimated; the official US EPA test cycle figure may vary). For reference, Kia claims a 561km range with the EV9 on the Indian ARAI test cycle. The Land and Wind variants note a 4.82km jump at 455km, while the Light LR settles with a tiny 1.6km jump at 491km. The Light SR variant comes with a 76.1kWh battery pack, whereas, the rest get a 99.8kWh unit. 2026 Kia EV9 Nightfall Edition Blacked-out exterior bits, Boost mode adds 100Nm torque Exclusive to the second-from-top EV9 Land variant, the all-new Nightfall Edition applies a black treatment to the 20-inch wheels and exterior badges. Despite the dark-themed bits, this isn't a usual 'Black Edition' we are used to seeing in India as it adds a Roadrider Brown colour instead of black. As for the interior, the black theme extends to the dashboard, and both the six and seven-seater EV9 models get Nightfall Edition-specific stitching patterns. The Nightfall Edition also has a Boost mode which increases the EV9 Land trim's torque by 100Nm to 700Nm, matching the GT-Line top model's torque output.

    "description": "Jeep has revealed the first official images of the next-gen Cherokee ahead of its full debut later this year. Marking the return of the Cherokee nameplate - discontinued in 2023 after a decade-long production run - the SUV will slot between the Compass and Grand Cherokee in Jeep’s global line-up. New-gen Jeep Cherokee breaks cover with new design language Hybrid powertrain confirmed for the new Cherokee; petrol and EV versions likely coming too Jeep will fully reveal the new Cherokee later in 2025, with global launch set for 2026 New Jeep Cherokee design details The new-gen Cherokee adheres to Jeep’s latest design language - also seen on the recently-revealed third-gen Compass. Up front, the new Cherokee gets the hallmark Jeep seven-slot grille, flanked by large rectangular headlights with extended sections for the indicators. The front bumper features an abundance of black plastic cladding, with an air dam at the bottom and silver inserts on either side. Moving to the side reveals new alloy wheels, more plastic cladding, ‘Cherokee’ lettering on the front doors, and a blacked-out roof and pillars. Jeep has not released any images of the new Cherokee’s rear end, but it’s expected to prominently feature a large rectangular light bar, much like that of the latest Compass. Interior and features yet to be fully revealed Jeep also looks to be saving interior shots of the new Cherokee for the SUV’s full reveal later in the year. Despite that, the Cherokee expected to include a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, three-spoke flat-bottomed steering wheel, all-digital instrument cluster, and a recessed touchbar for the climate controls. New Jeep Cherokee powertrains Hybrid setup confirmed The new Cherokee leverages Stellantis’ new STLA Large platform, which allows for hybrid, petrol, and all-electric configurations. Jeep has only confirmed a hybrid powertrain for the Cherokee right now, with precise details under wraps. Pure-petrol and EV versions will likely join the Cherokee line-up as well. The latter powertrain could share its mechanicals with the Wagoneer S electric SUV - a 100kWh battery, dual-motor setup. However, the output will expectedly be lower than the Wagoneer S' 600hp. Coming to the petrol Cherokee, it could use a version of Jeep’s 3.0-litre ‘Hurricane’ twin-turbo inline-6 engine, which develops 548hp and 707Nm in its most potent state of tune. New Jeep Cherokee launch details Launching in 2026 for overseas markets As mentioned previously, the new Jeep Cherokee will be fully unveiled later in 2025, with global market launches expected to begin in 2026. An India launch for the new Cherokee is unlikely. Also see: Jeep Wrangler Willys ’41 Edition sold out in India Jeep Compass Sandstorm Edition launched at Rs 19.49 lakh",
