    "description": "The Royal Enfield Hunter 350’s recent update has made significant improvements to its appeal, which means it's now time to ask where it stacks up against the competition. Its strongest rival is another neo-retro roadster with a British badge and a similar price point that’s aiming straight at the Hunter buyer. The Triumph Speed T4 could be considered as the Speed 400’s lesser sibling, but its reduced performance brought along increased tractability and better city manners, which makes for a fine fit for this kind of a motorcycle. With its recent price revision, the Triumph Speed T4 now costs just Rs 21,000 more than the top Hunter and that makes this a very valid comparison review Royal Enfield Hunter 350 vs Triumph Speed T4 design and features Handsome modern classic lines with good quality levels Both motorcycles wear clean, classic lines and when parked side by side, they do look quite similar, especially since both our test bikes have similar colour schemes. Both have round LED headlamps, slim 13-litre teardrop shaped fuel tanks and clean tail sections. While the Triumph here has a black finish for the exhaust, the bike is now shipped with a more classy looking brushed stainless steel finish. Both bikes have semi-digital instrument consoles as well and the top Hunter models come with RE’s Tripper navigation display. This is a small circular TFT display that shows simple arrow based navigation assists when connected to the RE app and it doubles up as a clock when not in use. Fit and finish on both bikes are commendable and both will leave you with a happy feeling about the quality you get for the money paid. Neither of the two are large bikes by any means, however, the Hunter does come across as slightly smaller. This can be felt in the seat heights which is at 790mm on the Hunter and 806mm on the Speed. For shorter riders, this can make a crucial difference. There’s only a one kg difference between the two on paper, but the Triumph manages to feel noticeably lighter on the move. Where the RE claws back some advantage is that it has a tighter turning radius. Both are reasonably spacious even for larger riders, but tall folk will find the knee bend on the Triumph a little more comfortable thanks to the taller seat. If carrying a pillion is important, the Triumph does a little better here too, in terms of the space, seat comfort and grab handles.

However, there is one area of great difference and that is the engine. The Triumph’s liquid cooled single cylinder makes 31hp and 36Nm which are both leaps ahead of the RE’s 20.2hp and 27Nm, and it shows in our performance tests. The Triumph’s 0-100 time of 8.08s is nearly half of what it takes the Hunter to hit the same speed. Effectively, the Triumph can easily leave the Hunter behind in pretty much any situation and any gear should you whack the throttle open.   It's not like this is anything new and pretty much any motorcycle at a similar price point will outrun an RE, but the difference here is that the Triumph manages to also retain a decent sense of character in its sound and tractable nature. Essentially, this engine makes for a nice fit with what kind of bike the Speed T4 is trying to be - even over the more powerful engine in the Speed 400.   To be fair, the Hunter comfortably keeps pace with the Triumph within the city and all of us who rode them unanimously agreed that it was the more engaging engine. The Hunter’s slower thump, meaty low-end torque and delightful sound with that occasional pop from the exhaust make it a very endearing engine to live with inside the city. The T4’s fueling is good, but the RE’s is even better and its new slip and assist clutch is now just as light as the Triumph’s. While RE’s five speed transmission has one less gear, it has a more slick and precise shift action. Up to about 80kph, the Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable bike to ride. While it can hold a steady 90-100kph with nearly no vibrations to be felt, there’s not a lot more performance in reserve. This means highway overtakes need some planning and if you intend to do a lot of highway riding, the Triumph will be the better choice. Remarkably, the Triumph manages to give you all this extra performance while still consuming about the same amount of fuel in our tests.

With its latest update, it has gone from being uncomfortably stiff to pleasantly pliant. It handles potholes and bad roads without hammering the rider’s back like it used to and we found that ride comfort was better than the Triumph. The T4 is not bad over broken surfaces, but if you hit bumps at higher speeds the suspension feels a little underdamped and doesn’t cope as well as the Hunter’s.   It’s a similar story with the handling, where the Hunter has a more planted, confidence-inspiring feeling when leaned over that hasn’t been compromised with its new suspension. In comparison the Triumph chassis gets a little more disturbed by things like central white lines in the road and its MRF tyres weren’t as good as the Hunter’s Ceats in wet conditions.   The Hunter produced slightly shorter braking distances in our tests but that was likely due to the ABS intrusion being a little higher on the Speed. In general riding conditions, the Triumph’s brakes have noticeably better bite and feel than the Hunter’s front disc which is rather wooden and needs a full handful of the lever for strong braking.

If you are someone who has no particular need for performance, you will probably enjoy the Hunter more and the price savings will simply be a bonus on top. However, with a price of over Rs 2 lakh on road, these bikes aren’t cheap and they are likely to be someone’s first premium motorcycle purchase. With that in mind, it’s impossible to ignore just how much more performance the Triumph is giving you while still retaining the engaging and easy going nature a bike like this should have - and that’s why it’s our winner here.

    "description": "Moni has overseen the aero development of every Audi since 2012 Inside Audi’s secret wind tunnel, Dr. Moni Islam reveals what's next for aero design Welcome to part two of our exclusive four-part interview series, where we’re endeavouring to find out what Audi’s iconic slogan – Vorsprung durch Technik, or progress through technology – means to the people at the forefront of Audi design and engineering. Here we venture inside Audi’s state-of-the-art, top-secret windtunnel in Ingolstadt, Germany, to sit down with head of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics, Dr. Moni Islam. Also in the series: Exterior design extraordinaire Frank Lamberty; lighting expert Christoph Häußinger; and interior designer Ramon Bäurle. Discover the all-electric Audi e-tron range Introduce yourself and what you do... I’m Dr. Moni Islam and I’m the head of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics development, which means in practice that I have several different tasks. On the one hand, I’m responsible for overseeing the development process for these two technical disciplines for all Audi production vehicles from their initial conception all the way up to the start of production. On the other hand, I’m responsible for ensuring that in my department we work with the relevant technologies and processes that enable top-class results. What’s your personal interpretation of Vorsprung durch Technik? For me personally, Vorsprung durch Technik means pushing the boundaries of technological innovation to do something that hasn’t been done before. As an engineer, I like to do things that are new and difficult, and I find it really cool to do things that others can’t do or haven’t done before. Being able to do this here is what first brought me to Audi many years ago. Which project have you been most proud of at Audi? One that you think channels the Vorsprung durch Technik spirit. I think it would be a project that wasn’t so much in the public limelight, but had a very big impact on the way the industry works in our technical discipline. A number of years ago we worked on developing a groundbreaking new software technology for aerodynamics simulations, which gave us a significant advantage in accuracy and flexibility. People thought it couldn’t be done, so when we went public with it, it took the entire industry by surprise, because we showed that it was in fact possible, and we were the first team to achieve this globally. Aerodynamic innovation has been at the very heart of Audi’s Vorsprung durch Technik philosophy for more than 50 years. Which models throughout Audi’s history brought the biggest steps forward in aero design and efficiency? There is no doubt that the Audi 100 in 1982 and the Audi A2 in 1999 were the two biggest innovators in the world of combustion-engine vehicles. Both were driven by the need to significantly improve fuel consumption and so their design was fundamentally aero-driven.   At the time, the very streamlined greenhouse, the flush glazing, and the aerodynamically optimised body trim of the Audi 100 were quite revolutionary in automobile design. The A2 also pushed the boundaries of car design with its proportions based on the work of Wunibald Kamm, and its optimised underbody and wheels. Now that we’ve entered the era of EVs, I am very impressed by what we achieved with our e-tron GT and A6 e-tron. In a very general sense, I’m proud that we were able to demonstrate with these two vehicles that there is no fundamental incompatibility between top-notch aerodynamics and progressive, eye-catching design. In the case of the e-tron GT, we were able to make use of active vehicle components to achieve outstanding aerodynamics results, while the A6 e-tron makes use of a vast number of detailed engineering solutions to reach its optimum. On that note, what inherent advantages does electrification bring to the worlds of aerodynamic design and efficiency? And what about disadvantages? How is Audi overcoming these? Electrification has given a huge boost to us aerodynamicists, because efficiency is now of such paramount importance, and in real-world driving, aerodynamic drag is the dominant driving resistance. And because driving range is so important to our customers, it becomes financially viable for us to include technical measures in the vehicle that reduce its drag that wouldn’t previously have been possible. In terms of the vehicle concept, electric vehicles have a number of significant advantages for us. First, there’s the completely closed and flat underbody, which is really an aerodynamicist’s dream. Then, because the electric powertrain is so efficient, the cooling-air requirements while driving are far easier to deal with than in combustion engines.  The biggest disadvantage for the vehicle’s aerodynamics derives from the size and weight of the battery. These create the necessity for large, wide wheels, which present us with a very big challenge, while also increasing the frontal area of the vehicle. In the case of the former, we now place considerable effort in the aerodynamic optimisation of wheels and tyres and generally offer our customers a variety of aero wheels in our new cars. We do this together with our exterior designers, so these wheels are really very aesthetically attractive, not just efficient! Why is aerodynamic efficiency so important for drivers, especially in the electric era? For many if not most people, aerodynamics is something very abstract, perhaps because it deals with complex physics and mathematics, but likely also because one can’t see its effect frequently in everyday life. As I mentioned earlier, as a driver of an all-electric Audi e-tron you can feel the effects of aerodynamic optimisation by virtue of options like the aero wheels or the air suspension and the effect that they have on improving the vehicle’s driving range and energy consumption.  More generally though, the large driving range that a vehicle like the A6 e-tron enables is a direct consequence of the vehicle’s top-class aerodynamics. But our innovation as aerodynamicists also has other consequences: One of the goals of our work is to come up with technical solutions that give our exterior designers as much freedom as possible to realise progressive aesthetics of the vehicle. So we work on optimising areas of the vehicle that aren’t immediately visible, like the cooling-air intake or the underbody, or we create technical solutions together which work for both of us, like attractive aero wheels. And last but not least, we also spend a lot of time on optimising the aeroacoustics, which our customers directly experience as very low wind noise when they travel in an Audi. What advances in wind tunnel and computer-aided design technology is Audi making to ensure its cars are at the cutting-edge of aerodynamic design? I’m very thankful for the fact that we have excellent tools at our disposal to work with here at Audi. Our wind tunnel was the first automotive wind tunnel to combine full ground simulation for aerodynamics with top-class aeroacoustics functionality, some of which was even patented by us. It has now been in operation for 25 years, and because we not only work here, but run and maintain the facility ourselves, we have built up a treasure trove of expertise that is really irreplaceable. A very important recent booster for productivity and accuracy in our work in the wind tunnel has been the advent of rapid-prototyping technology, also known as 3D printing. It’s been in use in Formula 1 development for quite some time, but now it’s a standard for us as well… And, it has really raised the bar for our other key tool, computer simulation, because our wind-tunnel tests have made a big leap in accuracy and efficiency. To give you a feel for what magnitude of computing resources we work with, we have 60,000 processor cores at our disposal, and last year we ran simulations totalling nearly 300 million CPU-hours. For the A6 e-tron alone we did more than 3000 simulations to optimise the shape and supplement our wind-tunnel tests. Modern aerodynamics development is in my view inconceivable without using computer simulations and wind-tunnel testing hand in hand. The Audi A6 e-tron is the most aerodynamic car Audi has ever created. How has this been achieved? Probably the most visible aerodynamic highlight is the optional virtual wing mirror, which is in its second generation on the A6 e-tron. Already in the WLTP certification cycle it results in about four miles more driving range, but over longer distances at constant speeds it offers an even greater advantage. The active inlet shutters offer dynamic control of the cooling-air flow tailored to the needs of the vehicle’s thermal management system and thereby create an optimum for the flow of air through the vehicle. The optional air suspension also improves the vehicle’s aerodynamics, by lowering its ride height during motorway driving. Everything else in the vehicle’s aerodynamics has to do with the many, many details of the aerodynamic design – ranging from the design of the rear diffuser in the underbody to the details of the tyre design. It’s only through the cumulative effect of all these details, and the optimisation of their interaction with each other, that we were able to reach the spectacularly low drag coefficient of 0.21. Where do you think Vorsprung durch Technik will take Audi in the future? For us aerodynamicists, I think Vorsprung durch Technik will lead us towards cutting-edge analysis and development methods, like artificial intelligence and even more computer simulations.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bold-new-logo-range-rover-brand-gears-first-ev",
    "description": "First bespoke emblem for 55-year-old luxury brand as JLR advances 'House of Brands' strategy JLR has revealed a bold new logo for the Range Rover brand, as it prepares to launch the luxury SUV marque's first electric model later this year. Appearing in a recent presentation to investors, the new emblem – featuring a pair of Rs in the brand's trademark minimalist, wide-set font – is the first designed for Range Rover since it launched its original car in 1970.  JLR told Autocar, however, that the new badge is not intended to replace the spelled-out 'Range Rover' script that has adorned the front and rear of each Range Rover model since the brand's launch.  \"The Range Rover Motif has been developed as a smaller symbol for where our familiar Range Rover device mark does not fit, such as on a label or as part of a repeating pattern, and within event spaces where an emblem is more appropriate,\" it said.  Range Rover has been split out as one of four JLR sub-brands – alongside Jaguar, Discovery and Defender – as part of the company's House of Brands strategy, wherein each of those four model lines is operated as its own business, with their own bespoke branding, positioning and marketing strategies. Jaguar has already revealed its new-era branding as part of the Type 00 concept unveiling, but Defender and Discovery have yet to receive their own bespoke badges.  As part of this strategy, the Land Rover name will take on a new role as a 'trust mark', the company has said, meaning it will continue to be used in reference to the drivetrains and technology in the company's SUVs but will no longer be pitched so overtly as the parent marque. Nonetheless, CEO Adrian Mardell has previously emphasised that Land Rover will remain an integral part of JLR's operations and its name will continue to feature on the cars. \"I really want to reiterate and put this on record that the Land Rover mark will remain,\" he said, following the unveiling of the House of Brands strategy.  \"Among its many attributes, Land Rover is rightly synonymous with off-road credentials, with technology capabilities, with significant and huge safety features. It is still integral to our business. It will remain visible on our vehicles. It will remain on our websites, in social media and at our retail sites.\" Range Rover's new motif, then, is unlikely to replace the offset Land Rover oval that has been a distinguishing feature of every Range Rover model since the original.  The logo was revealed alongside a dedicated 'Range Rover pattern' (below) - a checkered design that includes the new 'R' design as a central element. It is unclear how this will be used, but one possibility is that the pattern is used prominently on Range Rovers – perhaps for the grille or interior upholstery – as a means of differentiating the cars from more mainstream Land Rover models.",

The duo’s aura of sublime simplicity is complemented by a monochromatic wardrobe, consisting of black suits, ties, fedora hats, and Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. Even after dark, the Ray-Bans took what could be a plain, G-man appearance to the epitome of cool. For motorcycle riders, sunglasses aren’t just an expression of style. They can be essential for protecting your eyes from wind and debris, not to mention reducing glare and increasing visibility in challenging light situations. And yeah, they can also make you look cool, but not every pair of shades will make the cut on the open road.…",

    "description": "Five years after its debut in India, the BMW 2 Series is being replaced by a newer, second-generation model. Like its predecessor, it’s high on style and design, but there are a few caveats – most notably, a new downsized engine. Can it still deliver the best of BMW in a compact and stylish package? BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: exterior design and engineering 9/10 Design remains its calling card, with sharp looks and increased dimensions. Based on the same UKL2 platform as before, which underpins BMW’s front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive cars, the new F74 2 Series Gran Coupe has grown in size. Although the wheelbase remains unchanged, length, width and height have all increased. Styling is sharp and eye-catching, but it’s less polarising compared to its BMW peers. At the front, it features a shark-nose profile, with a bonnet that swoops down and a bumper that angles upward, giving it a distinct shark-snout appearance. Redesigned adaptive headlamps are sleeker and have new LED DRLs.  The adaptive LED headlamps have been redesigned, and since this is the M Sport version, the bumpers sport sharp cuts and blacked-out elements. The modestly sized grille is now backlit, highlighting its signature look at night. From the side, the car appears more proportionate, thanks in part to the striking 18-inch wheels. While the wheel size remains the same, the tyre profile has increased from a 40 to a 45 section, slightly raising the overall height and boosting ground clearance to around 165mm. The rear has a clean design, devoid of a spoiler or exposed exhaust tips.  The swooping coupe roofline remains as stunning as ever, and the iconic Hofmeister kink has been subtly updated with the numeric ‘2’ embossed within. As before, the Gran Coupe features frameless doors for added style. At the rear, the design is more subdued, with simple individual LED tail-lamps and a clean overall look – no ducktail spoiler, no exposed exhaust tips. Overall, the sleek design is exactly what you’d expect from a Gran Coupe. BMW has played it safe here, avoiding the polarising look seen on some of its other models. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Interior Space and Comfort 6/10 Focused and minimalist interior, but rear seat space is disappointing. The interior follows the minimalist theme found in modern BMWs. The dashboard is largely devoid of physical buttons, integrating most functions into the touchscreen. The padded dash feels plush, and ‘M’ stitching adds a touch of flair. Ambient lighting beneath the AC vents change colour – red when you increase the temperature, blue when you decrease it. Dashboard design is minimalistic and sporty with lots of soft touch materials The curved glass panel merging the infotainment and instrument cluster is angled towards the driver. Though responsive and slick, the touchscreen interface is not very user-friendly. Even basic functions like adjusting the AC demand too much attention. Below the screen, there’s a wireless charger, two cup holders, and some space to store small items. The centre console houses a cluster of buttons for quick access to the gear selector, drive modes and camera. The front seats are sporty, with firm bolsters and adjustable under-thigh support for both driver and passenger. The M Sport steering wheel is chunky and adds a sporty touch. The driver’s cockpit remains a highlight for enthusiasts. Rear seat space is cramped, especially the headroom. Rear seat space continues to be a drawback. The coupe-like roofline reduces headroom, and the unchanged wheelbase limits kneeroom. Passengers over six feet will find it cramped. While rear AC vents and a panoramic sunroof help open up the cabin, it’s still not comfortable enough for long journeys. If the dark mocha interior feels too sombre, a brighter upholstery option is available to enhance the sense of space. 430-litre boot houses a space-saver spare wheel under the floor.  Boot space stands at 430 litres. The 2 Series no longer comes with run-flat tyres, so a space-saver spare wheel is stored under the boot floor. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Features and Safety 8/10 Decent equipment, but some basic features are missing. With most functions integrated into the touchscreen, better usability would have helped. There’s wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a crisp 360-degree camera and automatic parking. Drive modes change the car’s theme and setup, while safety and assist systems are helpful for highway driving. Thankfully, in erratic city traffic, these systems can be switched off manually. New Digital Key feature allows several functions to be controlled via your phone.  Safety features include Lane Keep Assist, autonomous emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. However, some basic features like ventilated seats, rear blinds and adaptive cruise control are missing. A new feature is the Digital Key, which allows remote control of basic functions such as lock/unlock, cabin pre-cooling, and boot access – all via smartphone – and can be shared with up to five users. There’s also a roof-mounted camera that can record video and photos, exportable to your phone. Roof-mounted interior camera can be used to record both photos and videos.    BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Performance and Refinement 6/10 Downsized engine not up to par; performance and refinement are average. The biggest change in the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is the updated powertrain. The 1.5-litre, 3-cylinder turbo-petrol engine makes 156hp and 230Nm – comparable to midsize sedans like the Hyundai Verna Turbo. 1.5-litre, 3-cyl turbo-petrol engine makes 156hp and 230Nm At idle, vibrations are felt through the steering and seats. It smoothens out once in motion, but acceleration isn’t particularly exciting. Power delivery is linear, and the engine becomes audible past 4,000 rpm; not coarse, but not sporty either. Switching to ‘Sport’ mode improves throttle response slightly, but not enough. With its sporty seating and BMW badge, you’d expect more punch, but it’s lacking. There is a ‘Boost’ mode, similar to larger BMWs, but since it lacks a 48V mild-hybrid system, it doesn’t add power. Instead, it tweaks the gearing electronically for quicker torque delivery, aiding overtakes; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds. Performance is progressive, not sporty; 0-100kph takes 8.6 seconds  The 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox performs well – smooth, quick and responsive through paddle shifters. It won’t hold gears indefinitely, but it doesn’t upshift too early either. Sedate driving suits the 2 Series best. The chassis, gearbox and suspension could easily handle more power. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218 Mileage 8/10 No diesel option, but smaller engine promises better efficiency. We couldn't conduct a full Autocar fuel test during the first drive, but BMW claims 16.35kpl. Unlike the previous generation, there is no diesel option – so the small-displacement petrol engine is the only contributor to efficiency. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Ride Comfort and Handling 8/10 Stiff suspension helps handling, but low-speed ride suffers. The handling is where the 2 Series redeems itself. Despite the lack of power, BMW has worked its magic on the chassis, steering and suspension. Dampers have been reworked, and tweaks to the front axle – like changes to the caster angle – enhance agility. Wider tyres also help grip, but apart from minor torque steer, the handling is sharp and engaging. It lacks pace, but redeems itself with agile handling.  Bends and twisties are enjoyable, and while it lacks straight-line speed, it shines in corners. The downside is ride quality. The stiff suspension is great for spirited driving but poor on city roads. Thuds from bumps and potholes are pronounced, and the ride lacks the comfort expected in daily use. Still, it feels like a BMW from behind the wheel – even though its front-wheel drive. BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe 218: Price and Verdict 7/10 A style statement with badge value, but lacking in substance. Upon launch, it is expected to be priced between Rs 50-52 lakh (ex-showroom). The biggest challenge for the new 2 Series Gran Coupe is convincing buyers there’s more to it than looks. Prices aren’t out yet, but it’s expected to cost around Rs 50 lakh-52 lakh, making it the entry point to the BMW brand. While it scores high on style, features and handling, it falls short on comfort, practicality and engine performance. That said, if you’re after design, tech, agility and the BMW badge, it still holds strong appeal.

MG Select showrooms will not carry regular MG products M9, Cyberster launch dates still unknown MG Select: what is it? This new showroom offers a distinct look and experience, setting it apart from MG’s conventional outlets.

MG Select vehicle launches The MG Cyberster and M9 will be on display at the showroom. The models, however, are not yet on sale. The Thane location is the first of 14 MG Select showrooms planned to open across India by the end of September 2025. Interestingly, MG Select has launched ahead of the official availability of its models. The M9 electric MPV’s prices are yet to be announced, although it has already been reviewed by journalists. For the Cyberster, which made its India debut in March 2024, MG revealed key specifications including battery, range, and powertrain details for the country-specific model, though its official launch date is still unknown.

    "description": "Bentley has revealed a dramatic, high-riding limousine concept previewing the brand’s future design language for the EV era. Dubbed the EXP 15, this does not preview a specific model per se, but design details from this concept could make it to future production Bentley EVs. It’s strictly a design exercise, but one that completely discards traditional Bentley design cues seen on the existing models. EXP 15 concept is merely a design study Features a 3-door body with three interior seats Also debuts Bentley new logo Measuring 5.4meters in length, the EXP 15 straddles the boundaries between a sedan, an SUV and a grand tourer. The proportions are imposing, and it takes inspiration from one of the earliest Bentley GT cars – the 1928 Speed Six with bodywork by coachbuilder Gurney Nutting, more popularly known as the Bentley Blue Train. This car has an interesting story, go Google it. Bentley EXP 15 concept exterior design When viewed head-on, it almost does not appear like a Bentley at all and is a bit ostentatious, if you will. The iconic circular headlights are gone, and instead, there are new slimline vertical LED units. Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar UK, newly appointed design director Robin Page said, “The point is to make a bit of a bang”. Sounds very Jaguar-like. One detail that has been retained, though, is the diamond motif for the grille, of course, sealed off and backlit here. The other defining design element is the very upright face, which Page says is inspired by the heritage cars “which had a strong vertical element.” The endless bonnet line is a key feature, too, and what’s really cool about the long bonnet is that it houses a luggage compartment that’s accessed via side-hinged panels on the top. The new Bentley logo, concealed in a glass casing, and the Flying B motif have also been tweaked. In profile is where the monolithic design of the EXP 15 is most apparent. It’s high-riding and has a cab-rear silhouette and heavily accentuated rear arches. This being a concept, there are cameras for mirrors, striking dual-tone wheels with aero blades, and an air vent aft of the front fender with a two-part illuminated LED strip. The window line, in particular, is again a hark back to the Speed Six, with Page describing it as a “direct lift”. At the rear, again, all traditional Bentley design elements, including the beautiful oval tail-lamps, have been sacrificed for a look that could belong to any EV concept, frankly. The C-shaped LED strips for the tail-lights look generic, but what looks cool is the two-part spoiler with movable aero flaps. Bentley EXP 15 concept interior design Getting inside the EXP 15 is an interesting affair because it’s not a traditional 4-door coupe. It’s only a 3-door model, as the rear door on the driver’s side has been given a complete miss. And likewise, on the inside, there are only three seats because the front passenger seat has been eliminated – all these quirks because Bentley says its passengers “prefer either driving themselves or [to] lounge at the back.” The space vacated by the front passenger seat can instead be used to mount a cradle for one’s pets. Yes, Bentley has even designed a bespoke dog carrier to fit that spot. If that’s not indulgent enough, the rear seats even swivel out 90 degrees when the rear-hinged rear door opens, for a more “elegant exit”. Even the central section of the roof opens up when parked, so that passengers can stand before getting out. The concept also has picnic seats and a champagne cooler in the tailgate. As for the dashboard itself, Bentley’s signature winged design has been retained with some repositioning and reinterpretation of the screens. The instrument cluster is just a slim digital band; there’s a screen on the passenger side, too, and at the centre, there’s a small digital display that displays the state of charge, among other functions. But the real highlight is that there are plenty of physical buttons and dials on the centre console, the steering wheel and even the door pads. Page said, “We’re finding that, especially at our end of the market, people are a bit bored with full-digital screens. What makes us premium is to keep a good level of mechanical detailing that the others can’t do.” Thankfully, logic finally seems to be prevailing.  Bentley EXP 15 concept technical details The EXP 15 is strictly a concept for now, and no battery, power or range details have been revealed. And given its brick-like shape, aerodynamic efficiency doesn’t seem too much of a concern either. Page even remarked, “We’re finding that there’s a sweet spot in terms of range. Our customers are basically telling us that 300-350 miles is that sweet spot. Beyond that, they’ll use the private jet.” Range and efficiency are concerns for more pedestrian EVs, perhaps. It's not unusual to see such outlandish concepts, especially from luxury carmakers, as they try to reinvent themselves for the EV era. The Jaguar Type 00 was a classic example. However, as a pure design showcase coming from a very traditional British marque, the EXP 15 concept does seem to lack some character and even appears almost Chinese-like. Before giving the green light, though, Bentley will closely monitor reaction to the EXP 15 concept in order to gauge the viability of offering a high-riding sedan in this vein. After all, this is meant to reimagine the dying sedan breed for the future. Meanwhile, the first all-electric Bentley, which will be in an SUV body style, is due for a debut sometime in 2026, and it remains to be seen how much and which of these design elements will finally make it to production. The upcoming Bentley EV will not replace any existing model, but it will slot in a place now left empty by the Mulsanne limousine.
