    "description": "This 1946 Ford Deluxe coupe was refurbished around 2014 by its reported second owner with work that involved installing a 1951 Mercury 8BA 255ci flathead V8, repainting the body in metallic gray, fitting 1946 Ford Sportsman taillights, omitting the exterior trim, and retrimming the gray interior. Equipment includes a three-speed manual transmission, Edelbrock cylinder heads, an Offenhauser intake manifold, dual Edelbrock 94 carburetors, electric and mechanical fuel pumps, a 12-volt electrical system, dual exhaust, red-painted 15” steel wheels, hubcaps and trim rings, whitewall tires, a cowl vent, and lap belts. The seller purchased the vehicle in 2016 and subsequently converted it to PerTronix electronic ignition, rebuilt the carburetors, and replaced the coil, battery, starter, and mechanical fuel pump. In preparation for the sale, the radiator was serviced, the spark plugs were replaced, the oil was changed, and the brake shoes were adjusted. This modified Ford is now offered with partial service records, car-show awards, spare parts, an owner's manual, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

    "description": "Last year, Ultraviolette introduced the updated F77 Mach 2, bringing subtle design tweaks, new features, and drivetrain improvements. However, many riders wanted a more comfortable  setup, especially since most F77 owners primarily rode within city limits. Enter the F77 Super Street—a refined version of the Mach 2 with adjusted ergonomics and minor design changes. So, is the Super Street the better choice among the F77 models? Absolutely. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street design updates The Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2 has always been a striking machine, and the Super Street stays true to that design. Visually and feature-wise, it remains largely unchanged from the Mach 2, with no exclusive new additions. However, it does come in four new colors, though distinguishing between the two models requires a sharp eye. The most noticeable differences are the taller, wider handlebar and a redesigned headlight cowl. The rider footpegs remain the same as before and the company says this is done to maintain some sense of aggression with the ergonomics. Feature-wise, everything carries over, including 9 levels of regen, 3 levels of traction control, and dynamic stability control as standard on both variants. Ultraviolette also claims that the new headlight cowl improves aerodynamics by 15-20 percent compared to the Mach 2. It continues to get the same 5-inch TFT that is now slightly more inclined offering better legibility. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street ride and handling Despite weighing in at 207kg, the F77 Super Street’s ergonomic tweaks have made it a more manageable machine. Compared to the Mach 2, it feels noticeably easier to maneuver at low speeds, making urban riding less demanding. That said, its weight is still apparent when lifting it off the stand or pushing it around at parking speeds. While the more relaxed riding position offers some clear improvement in comfort, it doesn’t drastically alter the overall experience. The suspension setup remains unchanged and is carried over from the Mach 2. However, the new handlebar design reduces weight over the front fork, allowing for slightly more usable suspension travel.  Our test ride was limited to a go-kart track and well-paved backroads, but on the occasional rough patch, the Super Street felt a bit more forgiving. Although, this might just be because there’s less load on your wrists and back. Handling remains sharp, and through a series of corners, the bike is just as engaging as before. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street performance and braking Like the Ultraviolette F77 Mach 2, the new F77 Super Street is available in two variants. The base model features a 7.1kWh battery, delivering 36.2hp and 90Nm of torque, with an IDC range of 211km. The top-spec F77 Super Street Recon, which we rode, comes with a larger 10.3kWh battery, delivering 40hp and 100Nm of torque, while offering an impressive 323km IDC range. Riding the Super Street is a unique experience, with ample torque always available on demand. On a tight and technical track like the one we tested on, the throttle felt precise and easy to modulate. With the highest level of regenerative braking engaged, I found myself rarely using the brakes, allowing for a smooth and fast-paced flow through corners. Braking performance is commendable, though the only drawback I noticed was the bike’s weight under heavy braking. Ultraviolette F77 Super Street verdict The F77 Mach 2 is an exciting machine but demands more from the rider due to its aggressive ergonomics. In contrast, the F77 Super Street retains all the best aspects of the Mach 2 while offering a more accessible ride with its relaxed ergonomics.  A clear representation of the difference in ergonomics between the F77 Mach 2 and Super Street. Considering it comes at essentially the same price as its sibling, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking to step up to an electric motorcycle that’s both fun and engaging but also reasonably comfy for city riding.

The stars aligned when a customer approached them to create a slick Honda CB500F café racer for short rides and events. “The client wanted a Honda Four that maintained some original aspects, such as the mechanical aspects and the tank,” says shop boss Bruno Costa. “But they also wanted a more modern, aggressive design.” The Honda Four they chose was a 1974 Honda CB500F—a veritable pillar of the café racer world.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/208-2012-2019",
    "description": "Peugeot's charming and roomy supermini can now be had for less than £1000 - should you take the plunge? The Peugeot 208 sparked a revival for the French marque in the supermini class, where it had failed to capture the attention of European buyers with its drab and dreary 207 predecessor.Finally, here was a small Peugeot that majored on style, space and economy while also exuding a sense of desirability. It signalled a return to form for the brand whose era-defining 205 and popular 206 had historically given it the, ahem, lion’s share of the small car market.But why opt for a Mk1 208 when there are clear class leaders in the shape of the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo? Well, start with the fact that you can pick one up for the bargain price of £800…While the 208’s skin, cabin and engines were all-new, it inherited the 207’s dated PF1 platform, and it wasn’t the 205-emulating supermini we dreamed of in dynamic terms.That said, the funky 208 is a far nicer car to pilot around town than its predecessor. The heft and stodge that tarnished the 207 are absent, and in most settings it rides well. It steers accurately and, even though it’s lighter than its predecessor, it’s refined and well isolated.Sure, it can sometimes struggle to absorb medium-sized lumps and bumps, and it doesn’t offer the same level of driver entertainment as a Fiesta, but don’t let a lack of chuckability deter you from the 208.It’s a very easy and generally comfortable car to cruise along in.The 208 was the first Peugeot to feature the firm’s Puretech three-cylinder engines. The 68bhp 1.0-litre and 82bhp 1.2-litre units deliver on the economy front with around 45-50mpg in the real world, but their lack of gusto means they’re best suited to urban environments.If you want your 208 to be more of an all-rounder that can handle motorway trips, the 108bhp turbocharged 1.2-litre triple brings both economy and performance.But while the peppy three-pot is a decent choice on the face of it, it’s plagued by reliability issues because it uses a wet belt rather than a timing chain.The wet belt runs through the engine oil and it degrades over time, with bits of rubber clogging the oil pick-up, which causes the engine to fail.It can also suffer from oil starvation due to faulty piston rings, which are responsible for allowing oil to pass into the cylinders. Peugeot’s parent firm, Stellantis, rolled out an extended 10-year warranty for the 1.2 Puretech, but it is subject to conditions relating to servicing.For reference, replacing the wet belt can cost around £600.With this in mind, we would turn instead to either the more robust 95bhp 1.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engine or the peppier, albeit slightly less efficient, 154bhp 1.6-litre turbo petrol. If you need a diesel for motorway trekking, stick with the 1.6-litre HDi.It’s punchy and sophisticated and will return around 55mpg.Inside, the 208 offers significantly better perceived quality and technology than the 207, with plenty of satin-finished elements, a neat-looking infotainment screen and Peugeot’s sporty i-Cockpit arrangement.The cabin is pleasant and airy, despite some hard plastics around your knees and on the doors. And for a supermini, there’s plenty of head and leg room for adults in the front and rear.We would put our money into an Allure, an Allure Premium or, better still, a GT-Line model as these have generous amounts of kit. Many supermini buyers will have their minds set on front-runners like the Fiesta and Polo, but with the right engine and trim, the stylish 208 is a steal at just under £1000.So we wouldn’t criticise anyone for taking a left-field approach and going for this keenly priced French fancy instead of the ordinary superminis we see every day.",

    "description": "It’s akin to landing a dream job you lied through your teeth to get. You walk in on day one, staring down a pile of responsibilities you aren’t remotely qualified for. The job? Managing a car with a 1.5-liter turbo engine running around 2 bar of boost mounted where the groceries used to go. No airbag, no abs, no training wheels. Just figure it out before you get fired or, in this case, sent backward through a guardrail. Your new boss, (who ignores OSHA and HR) the Renault R5 Maxi Turbo, expects results.  Juan Carlos Fernandez knows what it’s like to start from nothing. In 1963, his family fled Cuba with an infant Juan in tow, leaving behind their home, their belongings, everything they had ever known. They landed in Puerto Rico with no roadmap, just the need to survive. His parents worked tirelessly to rebuild, instilling in him the kind of work ethic that doesn’t ask for shortcuts. By the time he was a teenager, cars had his full attention. His cousins were in the auto business, and he scraped together whatever he could to buy his first car, a $200 project. One car turned into two. Two turned into three. The hustle never stopped. If he needed more money, he worked harder. Decades later, that drive turned into Ferco Motors, the dealership he owns today.  A friend once told him the R5 was “so ugly it’s beautiful,” but to Juan, it was just beautiful. It had character, presence, and the kind of raw, unfiltered driving experience that modern cars have lost. It wasn’t built for straight-line speed or effortless performance, it was built to be driven hard, to demand something from the driver. And that’s exactly what drew him to it. The R5 is a product of Renault’s obsession with Group B, the golden era of rally racing where manufacturers built the most extreme machines they could get away with. The FIA required manufacturers to build a limited number of road-going versions to compete, and Renault’s answer was to take their humble economy hatch and reimagine it into something wild. At risk of boiling things down, and for the sake of brevity we’ll just say the engine was moved to the back, the body was widened, and the power was turned up The result was the R5 Turbo. That car made its competition debut in 1980 at the Tour de Corse, a rally known for its tight, twisting tarmac stages. French driver Jean Ragnotti piloted the car and, despite being up against much more developed machines, showed its potential. The real breakthrough came the following year when Ragnotti drove the R5 Turbo to an outright victory at the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally. It was undoubtedly good, but... was more possible?       Enter the R5 Maxi Turbo, the ultimate version, the final boss. It was built to compete with the Audi Quattro and the Peugeot 205 T16. Definitely a tough crowd. Renault brought in Bozian Racing, a French motorsport engineering firm known for squeezing every last drop of performance out of small-displacement engines. In this case they pulled 350 horsepower out of Renaults 1.5L engine. They made the car stiffer, and increased the work aerodynamics were doing.  It had some success in competition, and proved its mettle on tarmac, but as all-wheel-drive rivals took over, its time on the dirt and in the spotlight, faded.  Juan’s R5 wasn’t perfect when he bought it. It had been sitting, neglected, and the first drive was a disappointment. No boost, a failing clutch, just a reminder that even the greats need work, and time spares no one, and no thing. But with the right expertise, the right people, and a lot of effort, it came back to life, a worthy tribute to the Group B legend.  Juan Carlos Fernandez didn’t get here by taking the easy way. He came from nothing, worked for everything, and never asked for a shortcut. The R5 doesn’t give one either. It just wants you to show up for work. Continue...",

    "title": "Is This The New Le Mans Golden Age We've Been Waiting For?",
    "link": "",
    "description": "History Repeating: A New Golden Age for Le Mans Shines Brighter Than Ever The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the world’s most famous sports car race, and since its inaugural edition in 1923, the legendary event has seen fluctuating levels of manufacturer competition. Today, however, we are witnessing an unprecedented resurgence, as three iconic marques—each with a rich legacy of success—are set to join the already stacked grid of Alpine, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota in the battle for overall victory. Aston Martin will debut its radical Valkyrie hypercar this year, while Genesis—the luxury division of Hyundai—will enter the fray in 2026, embarking on a new motorsport chapter. Meanwhile, Ford recently announced a factory-backed return in 2027, and insiders suggest that McLaren is preparing to follow suit. A joint McLaren-Ford entry, reminiscent of their final Formula 1 season together in 1993 with Ayrton Senna, was initially explored but ultimately abandoned. However, McLaren’s announcement of a long-awaited return could be perfectly timed for the 30th anniversary of its stunning 1995 Le Mans victory. Watch this space! Aston Martin: A Lone Overall Victory, But a Storied Le Mans History Aston Martin returns to Le Mans with unfinished business. The British marque’s only overall win came in 1959, when Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori piloted a DBR1/300 to victory in a grueling race of attrition. Shelby, battling dysentery and carrying a nitroglycerin capsule under his tongue for heart issues, and Salvadori, who drove for 14 hours despite suffering from the flu, emerged victorious ahead of the sister Aston Martin of Maurice Trintignant and Paul Frère. Ferrari finished third, while Porsche endured its worst-ever showing, with all its cars failing to finish. Aston Martin first entered Le Mans in 1928, running nearly every edition until it shifted focus to a less-than-successful Formula 1 campaign. However, it found further glory in GT racing, winning the GT1 class in 2007 and 2008 with the DBR9, famously defeating Corvette in fierce head-to-head battles. The brand's most thrilling modern Le Mans moment came in 2017, when its Vantage GTE snatched victory from a faltering Corvette C7.R in the race’s dying minutes. Now, in 2025, Aston Martin steps back into the top class with the V12-powered Valkyrie—a road-going hypercar developed in collaboration with Formula 1 aerodynamicist genius Adrian Newey. Among its fiercest rivals? Ferrari, winners of the past two Le Mans editions with the 499P hypercar, and Porsche, the reigning World Endurance champions with a factory-backed effort led by motorsport legend Roger Penske. Ford: Iconic GT40 Dominance and a Triumphant Return Ford’s Le Mans legacy was immortalized in the 2019 film Ford v Ferrari, which dramatized Henry Ford II’s personal vendetta against Enzo Ferrari after a failed acquisition deal. Determined to exact revenge, Ford assembled an all-star team led by Carroll Shelby (yes, the ’59 winner with Aston, who was now focused on running the cars) and star driver Ken Miles, and together they steered the GT40 into a race-winning machine. In 1966, Ford famously secured a 1-2-3 sweep, though a controversial staged finish saw Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon take the victory over the Miles/Denny Hulme entry. Tragically, Miles was killed testing the car’s successor (The ‘J-Car’ which became the GT40 MkIV) but his legacy was assured. The GT40’s dominance continued, with Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt winning in 1967—an event best remembered for Gurney’s spontaneous invention of the champagne-spraying podium celebration. The Gulf-liveried GT40 of Pedro Rodríguez and Lucien Bianchi triumphed in 1968, followed by Jacky Ickx’s legendary 1969 victory, where he deliberately walked to his car at the start in protest of the traditional sprint start, only to deliver a masterclass in racecraft by winning the race by a mere 120 meters. Ford returned to Le Mans in 2016, celebrating the 50th anniversary of its historic first victory by winning the GTE-Pro class with the modern GT, in a program managed by Chip Ganassi Racing. McLaren: The Shock 1995 Victory That Defined Its Hypercar Legacy This June is McLaren’s 30th anniversary of its jaw-dropping victory in 1995, when its F1 GTR won on debut in dramatic fashion. In tasting a sweet victory the Woking-based brand, which was better-known for its Formula 1 success, scored four of the top five positions, with only the second-placed Courage C34 prototype, that included racing legends Mario Andretti and Bob Wollek, putting up a fight. The destiny of the race win was transformed in the closing stages, as the race-leading Harrods McLaren, run by David Price, suffered gear selection problems. This writer just happened to be in pits with two hours to go when Wallace alighted and handed over to Derek Bell, and I only realized something was amiss when he insisted on briefing Bell at length before Derek climbed in, delaying the car’s departure. When it was eventually released, instinct told me to tail Andy into the garage (a journalist’s life was far easier in those days!) where he exclaimed to Price “It’s f*cked, Dave! The gearbox is completely f*cked! I’ve told Derek to leave it in sixth”. This led to a lot more swearing from Price, with whom I developed a warm friendship in years to come but, on that day, I was one of many in the vicinity who was told in no uncertain terms where to go, as he vented the frustration of losing a Le Mans victory in such cruel circumstances. That handed victory to the Lanzante-run Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing team’s lineup of JJ Lehto (who starred in wet conditions in the night), Yannick Dalmas \u0026 Masanori Sekiya. That team had solved the McLaren’s delicate gear linkage issue, which affected many of its entries, by repeatedly spraying it with WD40 at each pitstop. That helped it to win by a lap. While that remains McLaren’s sole success at Le Mans, its modern-day road cars, like the P1 and recently-launched W1, take huge inspiration from the endurance racing heritage established by the F1 GTR. The Future of Le Mans’ Golden Era Success at Le Mans cements a manufacturer’s place in motorsport history and leaves a lasting imprint on its brand identity. The race’s influence extends beyond the track, shaping the development of the world’s most celebrated hypercars. No wonder that so many marques are signing up for this current golden age of sports car racing. Continue...",

    "description": "Hyundai has revamped the line-up of its smallest SUV, the Exter, for 2025, introducing a new trim, adding more features to existing trims and rejigging the CNG options. The Exter’s price continues to start from Rs 6 lakh for the base EX variant but now goes up to Rs 9.53 lakh for the new top-spec SX Tech dual-cylinder CNG variant. Hyundai Exter SX Tech gets features like keyless entry and go, auto AC Updated Exter S and S+ variants get 8-inch touchscreen, rear camera Exter CNG now available in S Executive, S+ Executive and SX Tech trims   Hyundai Exter SX Tech trim and features explained The new Exter SX Tech trim slots below the top-spec SX(O) and SX(O) Connect trims and is available in petrol-manual, petrol-AMT and CNG-manual forms. Its feature highlights include keyless entry and go, a dashcam with front and rear cameras, a sunroof, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, an automatic climate control system and projector headlamps. However, it misses out on features such as ambient lighting, a wireless smartphone charger, leatherette upholstery, a cooled glove box and a rear wiper, which are present in the SX(O) trim. The SX Tech costs about Rs 44,000 less than the SX(O). Hyundai Exter S and S+ trims and feature updates explained The mid-spec Exter S trim, whose prices have increased by about Rs 15,000, now gets more safety features, such as a rear camera, electronic stability control, vehicle stability management and hill-start assist. Other additions include 15-inch dual-tone wheel covers and an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which have also been introduced in the S+ trim.   Like the S trim, the S+ also gets a rear camera now, besides a sunroof, rear AC vents and power adjust for the outside rearview mirrors. The Exter S+ variants now cost up to Rs 13,000 more than before.   2025 Hyundai Exter CNG variants The Exter CNG range starts with the single-cylinder S Executive variant; a dual-cylinder version is available at a Rs 8,000 premium. The prices are higher than the variants they replace (S CNG and S Duo CNG) by Rs 4,000. The top-spec Exter CNG variant is now the SX Tech, which costs Rs 5,000 more than the previous range-topper, the Exter CNG SX Dual Knight. It should be noted that other than S, all Exter CNG variants get the dual-cylinder setup that was introduced in July last year.
