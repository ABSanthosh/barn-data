In the motorcycle world, it could be a headlight bucket, paint chip or a set of old bias ply tires. For builder Bret Crandell it was something as simple as a 1977 Florida State Inspection sticker that set the tone for his 1966 BMW R50/2 build. While he sought to honor the life his project bike had already lived, the barn-find Beemer proved to be the perfect canvas for a few of his racier ideas as well. Bret hails from Flint, Michigan, which he affectionately calls ‘a post-industrial wasteland city,’ and, he recently quit his full-time gig at Chrysler to pursue his passion.

    "description": "The motorcycle world was in the midst of an arms race in the early 1970s. Performance was king, and manufacturers were locked in a battle to build the fastest, most exhilarating machines for petrol-crazed riders. Honda had just dropped the CB750, a smooth, sophisticated four-cylinder revolution that brought superbike power to the masses. Yamaha was refining its two-stroke RD series and Suzuki had its triple-cylinder weapon in the form of the GT750—AKA the ‘Water Buffalo.’ Kawasaki wasn’t as interested in refinement. Beat to the punch on the four-cylinder, Kawasaki bet everything on two-stroke performance and set out to build the fastest bike the world had ever seen—something that would leave the competition coughing in a haze of blue smoke. The pinnacle of this effort was the 1972 Kawasaki H2 Mach IV, a 750 cc, three-cylinder two-stroke that redefined what speed meant on two wheels and permanently altered the course of the superbike segment.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/renault-5-vs-ford-capri-when-do-retro-cars-hit-mark",
    "description": "Reprising an old nameplate is nothing new and has proven successful for brands like Renault To nobody’s great surprise, the other day the Renault 5 and Alpine A290 jointly won the 2025 Car of the Year award (the original and still the best of the big international car awards thingies). I haven’t driven the regular model, but I have driven the performance variant and enjoyed it very much. A friend of a relative has decided to order one on the back of my review, so I hope I wasn’t wrong. Anyway, what also appealed to them about the 5/A290 is the treatment that Renault has given this car, resurrecting not just a famous name but also the looks to go with it. In the face of huge competition not just from traditional rivals but also a surging Chinese car industry, it’s a trick that has been recommended by marketers and brewing for a while. The idea is to remind customers that one has been making cars for a long time and is particularly good at it, so this is a model you can trust. Hence if you remember the 5 from the first time around, you will have a slightly warm, fuzzy feeling towards the new one already. China’s SAIC bought and uses the MG brand here for precisely that reason, but applying the heritage trick to a particular model is an advantage that young car makers can’t mimic. For some customers and in market research clinics, maybe it doesn’t register, but there are enough new Fiat 500s and Minis on the road to suggest it’s a strategy that works. It’s almost a surprise to me that more car makers don’t do it more often – but then I talk to some designers and realise why. They think it’s clear that you don’t progress in life by looking backwards, that the world moves ever onwards and they didn’t become designers or creatives for a living to just redraw something somebody did 30 years ago. Many, many designers are allergic to retro. They would rather create icons than recreate them. Think of bands that don’t like playing their early hits, and they even wrote them. I get it. But at a point, if it’s clear that it will be what customers want, because it confers a sense of familiarity and trust or nostalgia, it takes dispassionate leadership to say: “Suck it up, team, and get on with it.” (I’m not suggesting this is what happened at Renault, by the way; the designers there might have all loved the idea from the outset.) And in Renault’s case, on early showing of interest, it looks like it will pay off. Less convincing is the approach of Ford, a company I worry about. It has found making money out of cars in Europe difficult in the past, which has bothered it less than it might other manufacturers, because it sells so many vans here (it’s our biggest light commercial vehicle provider). If it wasn’t for the cars living alongside them, it wouldn’t be able to utilise economies of scale to make the overall operation profitable. Cars and vans have fed happily alongside each other. But the cars have to make a contribution and, particularly in the UK, where Ford has been under-equipped to cope with the zero-emission vehicle mandate, I wonder how bad the situation is. Ford has half of the retro idea right, by bringing back a classic name, but for me and I think a lot of the buying public, it’s not hitting the mark without a fitting product attached to it. How much would you like an actual Capri that looked the bomb – a drop-dead update of the classic coupé? Yes, me too. But something called a Capri, a Mustang or an Explorer or whatever that doesn’t have killer looks and does the same kind of thing and looks as normal and unfamiliar as any number of other models and, well, what’s the hook? Why would I be interested, beyond thinking that this wasn’t what the name was designed for? If I were Ford, or indeed another established car maker in the squeezed middle, I would swallow my pride, find a big name from my back catalogue and attach the right looks to it.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/porsche/911-gt3-2017-2021",
    "description": "Now that it has dropped in price to more accessible levels, is it time to invest in a 911 GT3 before it becomes a modern classic? The 911 GT3 released in 2017 is heralded as one of Porsche’s greatest hits and it still quickens pulses and turns heads today.So high was demand when it was new that you could not get your hands on a 991.2 (Porsche speak for the facelifted seventh-generation 911) GT3 for love nor money.Some buyers cashed in and immediately flipped their cars to make a profit, so many GT3s quickly reappeared on sale – but for around £50,000 to £70,000 more than their list price.It’s easy to see why demand outstripped supply: this sports car delivers unwavering grip, poise and balance, both on track and off it. But now that it has dropped in price to more accessible levels, is it time to invest in a GT3 before it becomes a modern classic?Cast a cursory glance at this limbered-up 911 and you would be forgiven for mistaking it for its predecessor.A light nip and tuck to the front and rear bumpers are the only visual changes, but peel back the skin and you will see we are dealing with a very different beast.Nestled in the shadow of that hulking rear wing is a 4.0-litre flat-six engine rather than a 3.8-litre one.The swap was made to address the reliability issue that plagued the pre-facelift ‘991.1’ and it’s a key reason why you should find the extra dosh for a post-2017 model.The 4.0-litre lump isn’t just a carryover from the GT3 RS or spellbinding 911 R, either. It is a motorsport-derived 911 Cup car engine with new crankshaft, pistons, liners and bigger seals.The bigger motor also ditches its predecessor’s hydraulic valve lifters, which, in combination with the other mods, means it can spin more freely – all the way to a screaming 9000rpm redline.Peak power comes in at 8250rpm, so you have to work it quite hard, but how you get up there is your choice: you can have a snappy seven-speed PDK or a sensationally tactile six-speed manual gearbox.The quicker acceleration on offer with the auto makes more sense if you’re an avid track-day driver. But for the complete GT3 experience, it has to be the more engaging manual, which is also slightly lighter and gets a conventional limited-slip differential for an extra hit of playfulness.Your choice of brakes also depends on your GT3’s intended use: carbon-ceramics are best for road driving as they’re lighter, but track cars should have steel items because they’re cheaper to replace.And if you don’t want some of the car’s racier cues, then you might wish to consider the more reserved Touring version, which features a GTS-style hidden rear spoiler instead of a fixed wing.Around 50 right-hand-drive Tourings made their way to the UK so they’re exceptionally rare and command a hefty premium over the bewinged car.But if your heart is set on a Touring, performance car specialist Litchfield can convert a standard GT3 into one using Porsche-approved parts for just under £18,000 – a relative bargain considering the £200k you would have to fork out for a factory car.The cabin of the GT3 is pure motorsport. Slide into the 918-style bucket seat of a car fitted with the Clubsport package (which also added a roll-cage, harness and fire extinguisher) and you are swaddled in carbonfibre and Alcantara trimmings.Tourings, meanwhile, are a little more luxurious, with mostly leather-trimmed elements and Comfort seats.There are plenty of Clubsport models in the classifieds, but bear in mind that the cage takes up valuable luggage space, which you may want to use.Yes, the GT3 is the sort of sports car that you can drive to the Nürburgring and set a killer lap time, and then carry on to the south of France for a holiday without breaking a sweat.",

    "title": "GLORY RESTORED: Chasing the Alpine Dream",
    "link": "",
    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The Mercedes-AMG G 63 is the madcap of the automotive world. How else would you describe a boxy 4x4 ladder-frame chassis SUV with not one, not two, but three differential locks and one that also runs on performance tyres to complement a fire-breathing engine? It’s a marriage of very different worlds that somehow works. Mercedes AMG G 63 performance and powertrain It gets a few updates for 2024 and beyond to make it comfier, sportier and, ahem, more politically correct, too. The last bit is courtesy of a new 48V mild-hybrid system. It adds in 22hp, but even when it’s giving its all, it’s merely playing a supporting role to the 585hp, 850Nm, 4.0-litre V8 twin-turbo petrol engine. The engine is relentless in its build of power, and the big power yields big performance. It’s got a 220kph top speed, and we managed a 4.6-second 0-100kph time. Nuts for something as big as a one-bedroom flat and as heavy and aerodynamic as a bank vault. Making the acceleration figure possible is the launch control, which is among the new additions to the G 63. The way the G 63 squats in preparation for launch and then takes off is a sight to behold. What’s also so integral to the G 63 experience is the way it sounds. Those quad exhausts, two on each side, will have you break into a laugh every time you press down on the accelerator pedal. There’s this omnipresent woofle that grows into a growl when you go a bit faster, and then it just erupts when you let loose, letting out a roar a lion would be proud of. The 9-speed gearbox also wastes no time going up and down the gears as you please. In fact, you’ll often downshift just for the accompanying sound effect. Mercedes AMG G 63 ride and handling The G 63 hasn’t just learned to sprint but has taken some yoga lessons to become more agile, too. It handles well by G-Class standards, and that’s thanks to AMG’s new Active Ride Control Suspension. The system does away with physical anti-roll bars and replaces them with a network of hydraulic actuators that connect all four corners of the car and adjust the load settings depending on the driving input. Body control is hugely improved, and it doesn’t feel as top-heavy as older Gs. There’s good weight at the steering, too, and good enough connect. Still, the G 63 is no Urus, Cayenne or RS Q8 in the bends and won’t set records, but who cares? Of more relevance is the G 63’s ride comfort. It feels lumpy in a way you wouldn’t expect a luxury SUV to feel, and the G can’t hide the fact that there’s a ladder-frame chassis underneath. That being said, there’s also a toughness that you don’t get in any other model of this price. Also, as we established over our recent Off-road Day featuring a G 400 d, there’s little to stop a G-Class in the rough. This versatility is part of the G 63’s allure. Mercedes AMG G 63 exterior design No matter what the setting, the G 63 grabs eyeballs. It’s boxy, it’s classic, it’s cool. And I think you’ll agree, it can rock some bright colours. There are 37 colours to choose from, and you can get into the nitty-gritty of the finish for the grille or other embellishments on the SUV. Of course, there’s also a whole range of wheels to choose from, with sizes ranging between 20 and 22 inches. With 37 paint, 10 wheel and 4 trim pack options, no 2 G 63s should look the same. One of the new inclusions with this update is keyless entry. It was apparently a task to incorporate the functionality while retaining the old-school door handles. Ah, and I almost forgot, there are aero upgrades, too! Well, there are mini-spoilers around the A-pillar and the top of the windscreen, as well as a new slot at the rear wheel arch. Hey, at least they tried. Mercedes AMG G 63 interior and features The G 63 sits high off the ground, so you’ll have to use the footboard to pull yourself in. Not much has changed inside, but the centre screen is now a touchscreen. Yup, the G-Class never had a touchscreen before this. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is nice to use and also packs in wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Other changes include an off-road modes shortcut that gives easy access to the off-road menus as well as the ‘transparent bonnet’ function that gives a feed from under the car. It’s very helpful when you’re over uneven ground. New AMG steering is most notable change inside the updated G 63. Personalisation program allows you to spec the interior to your liking; for big money, of course. Do note, a lot of what you see inside this very car is part of the options list. The colour of the weave, the seat stitching, the finish to the panels and even the leather finish for the roof – you can spec your G to your liking, for big money, of course. And remember all those sounds I touched upon earlier that are very intrinsic to the AMG G 63 experience? Well, there’s a lot more, such as the thunk on door shut, the door locks that sound like a rifle being loaded, and the click of the air conditioning vents. The G 63 really feels like a military-grade tool that also does glamour well. Other highlights include 64-colour ambient lighting, a 360-degree camera and a fantastic 18-speaker Burmester sound system. Crisp and vibrant digital dials get multiple themes. ADAS is included, but the auto braking is too sensitive for our conditions, and you have to remember to switch it off every time you start the car. If you’re looking for the most spacious luxury SUV, the G-Class isn’t it. Yes, it is huge on the outside, and the legroom is more than adequate, but it is not as much as you’d expect from something that costs so much. Optional rear seat entertainment screens should help keep passengers at the back occupied. The G’s side hinge tailgate opens to reveal ample luggage space. Our test vehicle came specced with an optional cherry wood floor that would add another Rs 3.8 lakh to the tally.

It’s overpriced, the ride is lumpy for something so expensive, and space isn’t the best either. But you can’t think of a G 63 objectively. It’s loud, proud and mad fun. 12.3-inch central display is now a touchscreen. Also, before your CA dissuades you from dropping Rs 3.6 crore (ex-showroom, before options) on one, you should reason that a G 63 isn’t quite as depreciating an asset as other cars. New car prices are only on the rise (it cost Rs 2.15 crore at launch in 2018), and you’ll always have a ready buyer for your G 63 if you choose to sell. Get in line, though. The 120 AMG G 63s allocated to India for this year are already spoken for.

    "description": "But the performance from the engine, especially in the meaty midrange, is deeply satisfying, and often, with this car, I tended to plan intracity excursions just to be able to enjoy its performance to the fullest. It truly is an absolute delight on fast-flowing empty roads and is in sharp contrast to most other vehicles at this price point. That said, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed using the bright, clear and responsive touchscreen. Wireless Apple CarPlay gels perfectly with the unit; I find myself switching to Google Maps often nowadays to decide which route to take, and having the app one touch away really helps. And I love the clarity of the speakerphone on the move. It’s great to know that I can hear the person at the other end of the line clearly, and equally important is that I can be heard over the line perfectly. This is certainly not the case in many rival cars. Manual upshifts and downshifts hit the spot when you have the pedal down hard. Skoda’s Slavia has been in our long-term fleet ever since it went on sale in India. Initially, we had it in manual form, with that delicious six-speed elevating the driving experience considerably; we now have the twin-clutch automatic-equipped version in this slate grey shade – both powered by the 150hp 1.5 TSI engine. This Slavia, like the previous one, first and foremost does a convincing job of showcasing just how good a well-configured and engineered sedan can be, even in this age of the SUV. Add to that the luscious matte paint contrasted by those bright red LED tail-lights, and you have a car that draws more attention than any SUV I’ve driven recently. Sure, the matte paint needs extra care, and you have to instruct the person who washes your car to be extra careful not to scratch the surface when removing dried dirt and bird excrement. But the ice-cool look of the car more than makes up. Electrically adjustable front seats add comfort and convenience. Then, there’s the added practicality of the massive 521-litre boot, which can swallow enough luggage for five easily, and an SUV-like 179mm of ground clearance. You have to be careful when opening the boot and push the lid all the way back, or else it has a tendency to drop back down and knock you on the head. The convenience of the twin-clutch automatic did help as well, especially in traffic. I thoroughly enjoyed using the paddles on good driving roads, the quick shifts of the twin-clutch DSG massively contrasting other not-as-fun automatics, delivering a driving experience that can otherwise be had only on more expensive cars. However, the plastic paddles behind the wheel don’t feel well-built. In start-stop traffic, the gearbox tends to pause momentarily, which coincides with the zone where the turbo isn’t fully awake yet, making it worse. While the 1.5 TSI does deliver power, punch, performance and smoothness, it isn’t the most responsive engine and sounds a bit strained when wrung out. It certainly isn’t as rev-happy or as responsive at higher engine speeds as the smaller 1.0 TSI unit. The aircon isn't the most effective, especially on very hot summer days.  On the inside, powered seats prove to be a good upgrade. They make it so much easier to make small adjustments to my driving position, especially on long drives, where a slight change in seat angle or distance from the pedals can help take the pressure off your back. And cooled seats make quite a contribution, too. This is especially true in the summer months when getting into a hot car. Wish the aircon were more powerful. I had to lower the temperature setting and increase the fan speed when it got really hot outside, with the air-conditioning not coping as effortlessly in the summer heat due to a less powerful fixed-volume compressor. And then, despite some typically solidly built bits like the door pads and the glovebox, some parts on the dash, such as the vents and the screen’s shroud, seem to work themselves loose. What also helps is that the speakers go nice and loud; the audio system seems to be well-specified, and the subwoofer in the spare wheel adds some well-timed punch. Something that continues to infuriate is the digital instrument panel. The tachometer is shrouded once you are past 80kph, the odometer disappears if you are in cruise control mode, and the reset button for the trip is on the touchscreen. However, Skoda has made amends, with the instrument panel on recent cars showing the tachometer when the 80kph speed warning comes up. The boot lid needs to be pushed all the way, or else it closes again, often painfully. With the twin-clutch automatic not having a torque converter, which saps both power and efficiency at low speeds, the car delivered 15-17kpl on the highway and between 10kpl and 12kpl on a regular basis in the city. Summing up,the Slavia 1.5 automatic is a car that gets a double thumbs up because it does both practical transport and fun-to-drive all at once. Apart from not having ADAS, it is reasonably well-equipped, has a comfortable rear seat, gives you a good sense of security and has a 5-star safety rating. So, if you are looking for an SUV in the Rs 15-25 lakh space, make sure you also take a look at the Slavia.

    "description": "Before I start telling you about this unique-looking bag, I have a confession to make: I have organisational OCD and am a creature of habit. I can’t stand disarray of any sort when it comes to packing my belongings, and the way I pack follows the saying – ‘a place for everything, and everything in its place.’ That’s why the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag fits neatly into my life and has become my go-to bag for nearly everything over the past four months, from daily commutes to weekend trips and even shopping. Main pocket is quite deep. This bag is divided into three main compartments comprising an absolutely waterproof main compartment that holds seven litres, accompanied by two ancillary zippered ones that can hold a total of another seven. While seven litres may sound small, I have been able to fit two boxes containing my office lunch, a couple of t-shirts, and a 1-litre water bottle, with quite some room to spare. Kriega claims you can fit a 14-inch laptop into this compartment, but I’ve fit my colleague’s 15-inch one without hassle. Waist belt helps reduce load on your shoulder. Then, there are the two secondary zippered pockets, one larger than the other. Both appear quite slim at first glance, but as you’ll discover, this small bag is capable of holding much more than you think. The larger zippered pocket can hold a thick 500-page novel, a 750ml water bottle, a chunky power bank and my phone charger. In the smaller one, I usually have my old-fashioned leather wallet, sunscreen, a spare pair of spectacles, my Bluetooth earphones and house keys. As is evident, if you’re meticulous about how you pack your things, the Messenger Pro can swallow a lot. Total 14 litres of storage available. Since this is a sling bag, you get one main strap, which you sling across your torso, and anyone who has worn one will tell you that it can get a little uncomfortable on its own after some time. Thankfully, Kriega has also supplied a sturdy waist belt that alleviates most of the pressure from your shoulder. I’ve worn this bag all day for multiple days in a row, and I’m happy to report that you don’t feel any discomfort for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will start to feel some soreness, but you can always reverse the strap’s mounting to the other side and sling it on the opposite shoulder. At Rs 15,799, the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag is unquestionably a luxurious indulgence. That holds true even in the Kriega context because there are other similarly priced or more affordable backpacks from the same company that are more versatile, spacious and can even be equipped with a hydration bladder. So, to answer the all-important question: to buy or not to buy? The thing is, you’ve got to particularly want this form factor. I can confirm that it works well in an urban context while also being a bit of a unique style statement from a motorcycling perspective. But, if that’s not a particular priority, and if this is your first step into the world of Kriega, you will find some more versatile personal luggage-carrying options.

    "description": "The Union Budget is India's annual financial blueprint that steers the nation's economic direction. For the automotive sector, particularly MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises), this year’s budget holds special significance as the government has made a greater provision to push for EV and battery manufacturing. The incentives come in three key areas: Customs duty exemption on 35 capital goods for EV battery manufacturing Support for domestic manufacturing of motors, controllers and other components Integration of EV manufacturing with Clean Tech manufacturing program This budget continues its commitment to making India a hub for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing. A comprehensive Clean Tech manufacturing support program has been announced to improve domestic value addition in solar PV cells, EV batteries, motors and controllers. The initiative includes 35 additional capital goods for EV battery manufacturing being added to the exempted list. The focus extends to building the entire EV ecosystem, including support for battery recycling and creating charging infrastructure. Special emphasis is being placed on developing high-capacity batteries and promoting research in battery technology. For automotive MSMEs, which form the backbone of the component manufacturing ecosystem, budget provisions for working capital support, technology upgradation funds, and easier credit access are crucial for their survival and growth.
