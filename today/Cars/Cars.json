    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/hero-destini-125-road-test-review-435852#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Hero MotoCorp has recently faced turbulence in its sales numbers and market share. Part of the problem is that its overarching success lies in the 100-110cc commuter bike category, which has seen a declining trend in recent years. The other part is that none of its more recent, premium products – except for the Xtreme 125R – have set the sales charts on fire. The company is seeking to replicate that sort of success in the premium 125cc scooter segment as well, and the all-new Destini 125 is its first tool at chipping into that space. So, can this revamped Destini 125 help Hero on its journey towards a more premium identity? Hero Destini 125 design and features - 7/10 Has the basics covered but is lacking in some crucial areas The Destini 125 has a typical family scooter look (for the most part), with pleasing lines and a safe design. This holds true when you see the scooter from the front, but as your eyes snake their way to the back, you’ll notice that Hero has gone down an unconventional route when it comes to the tail-lamp and rear indicators. The tail-lamp is shaped like the letter H – an increasingly common signature across Hero products – and the turn signals are stacked on top of it. While there is no functional problem, this is a polarising design choice in a segment dominated by inoffensive designs.  Hero Destini 125 key specificationsHero Destini 125Kerb Weight115kgSeat Height770mmGround Clearance162mmFuel Tank capacity5.3 litresWheelbase1302mm A concealed fuel filler cap is an improvement, but the space to get your fingers around the cap is a little tight. Fit and finish is one area where Hero still has some ways to go. The indicator and horn buttons feel quite plasticky, the cover for the USB charging port feels flimsy, and the fuel filler lid’s panel doesn’t sit flush on the left side. Speaking of the fuel filler, the empty space around the lid is a little tight for those with larger hands, and tightening the cap once you’ve refuelled takes a little dexterity.  Lack of a brake lock clasp is a crucial miss on a gearless scooter; parking on a slope will necessitate some caution. It also misses out on a brake lock clasp, which is a must-have on a gearless scooter. The mirrors, while well-shaped, have rather short stalks, which means a quarter of your rear view is obstructed by your elbow. Another area where the Destini lags behind its rivals is storage capacity. While it has the basics covered, with a luggage hook on the front apron and a spacious cubby that can fit a 1-litre water bottle, its 19-litre underseat storage area is quite small. This is especially true in comparison to the TVS Jupiter models, which offer class-leading levels of boot space in the ICE scooter game.  A boot light is a nice feature to have, but the 19-litre underseat storage area is one of the smallest in this class. That’s not to say it’s devoid of features, and in addition to a side-stand cutoff, auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and a USB charger, you also have the option to pair your smartphone with the display. Once paired, you can receive turn-by-turn navigation prompts, as well as call and SMS alerts. While all of this is nice to have, the display has its oddities. For instance, the odometer and clock are hard to tell apart at a quick glance, and, on a sunny day, even at full brightness, the smaller digits on the screen are hard to make out. The digital LCD screen has some good features like turn-by-turn navigation, although it could be a little brighter. Hero Destini 125 ride and handling - 8/10 Overall comfort levels are quite high; it is a predictable handler One area where the Destini is a rather accomplished machine is in its ride comfort. The generously padded seat, spacious ergonomics, and plush suspension setup work together to make the Destini one of the most comfortable scooters around. We recently tested the newest Suzuki Access and TVS Jupiter 110, so with that fresh in our minds, we can report back that the suspension and seat comfort on the Destini feel superior to those of the aforementioned scooters.   Hero Destini 125 underpinningsHero Destini 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic fork / MonoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc / DrumTyres (F/R)90/90-12 / 100/80-12 The suspension absorbs most of what comes in the way very well and is among the best in this segment. With 12-inch wheels at both ends, the Destini is a sure-footed machine even at higher speeds, and the larger rear wheel also helps to some extent when going over bigger bumps. Being a family scooter, the Destini makes no pretences of being an energetic handler, and it prioritises stability over flickability.  Stopping performance is commensurate with rivals and the CBS works well, but the brakes are devoid of feel. As with other offerings in the class, the Destini gets combi-brakes, and while there is sufficient stopping power to be had, the brakes felt devoid of feel and always necessitated a firm pull when coming to a halt. Hero Destini 125 performance and fuel economy - 7/10 Fuel efficiency and performance are commendable, but refinement could improve At the first ride event last year, Hero told us that while the latest Destini uses the same engine block as the previous-gen model, the company had gone to great lengths to improve refinement, mileage, and reliability over a longer duration. While it has succeeded in some areas, there’s still some work to be done.  Hero Destini 125 performanceAcceleration0-40kph3.8s0-80kph16.07sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.97s30-70kph10.86s50-80kph10.62sBraking 60-0kph (in metres)18.53m We’ll begin with the positives. The Destini’s motor is quite punchy, and if you want to make a quick overtake in city traffic, a small to moderate throttle opening will get the job done. If your commute includes fast, flowing roads – like in Indian metro cities – the Destini can hold a 70kph cruise as well.  The 124.6cc engine is decently punchy and rather efficient, but its refinement levels could be better. Fuel economy is a big factor when purchasing a vehicle like this, and the Destini ticks that box nicely. In our tests, the scooter managed to deliver 58kpl (overall), which is quite close to Hero’s claim of 60kpl. A couple of factors are at play here. First, the engine’s punchy nature means you don’t need to wring its neck when making progress, thereby reducing wide-open throttle openings and aiding fuel economy. Second, Hero’s i3s start/stop tech cuts the engine off when you’re idling at a stoplight and helps save fuel.  With its wide and generously padded seat, plush suspension setup and neutral ergos, the Destini is one of the most comfortable scooters in its class. While the i3s system undoubtedly aids fuel efficiency, its execution has left us wanting. The procedure to restart the engine is to keep either brake lever pressed and hold the accelerator open until the engine turns over. All of this takes about 2-3 seconds, which may not sound like a lot, but after experiencing Suzuki and Yamaha’s seamless start/stop systems, Hero’s i3s feels slow-witted and cumbersome in impatient big-city traffic. Then there is also the fact that the Destini’s engine is considerably behind our refinement benchmark – the Suzuki Access – with a mild buzz felt at the handlebar and floorboard at various speeds.  Mirrors are well-shaped and smooth throughout, but the stalks are a little short; elbow obstructs the rear view. What was a more troubling issue was that our scooter’s engine started making a metallic rattling sound a few days into its 2-week stint with us. This occurrence would present itself when accelerating with a wide-open throttle from a standstill or from speeds under 20kph, and it would continue for a few seconds. This noise didn’t affect the performance of the scooter at all, but it was disconcerting nonetheless, especially on a vehicle that had barely crossed the 8,000km mark. We have reached out to Hero and will update the web version of this story once we discover what the issue was. Hero Destini 125 price and verdict - 7/10 It is now a better scooter, but still some distance away from the best in class In our time with it, we’ve discovered that the Destini 125 has strengths and weaknesses that are common across most Hero products. It is exceptionally comfortable, rather frugal, and backed by the company’s extensive retail sales network. At the same time, weaknesses such as fit and finish that leaves you wanting, and a lacklustre engine sour this package, especially now that the 125cc scooter class has some seriously impressive competitors.  The i3s start-stop system could be quicker in its operation. Ranging between Rs 81,850 and Rs 91,700 (ex-showroom, Delhi), it is priced on par with its rivals and doesn’t have the upper hand there either. Comfort and frugality are two big factors people look for in a scooter, and the Destini has those areas covered, but its shortcomings are enough to prevent it from rising to the top of the class.

    "description": "In a fiercely competitive segment, the Raida Carbonite gloves promise a blend of robust protection and everyday comfort. But having put them through their paces on Mumbai’s chaotic roads, allow me to delve into whether they live up to the promise. Straight out of the box, the quality of the stitching and materials is impressive for the price. The full-grain leather feels substantial, and the carbon-fibre knuckle protectors, alongside the rubberised plastic scaphoid shield, inspire a good degree of confidence.  The gloves feature pre-curved fingers and a neoprene wrist cuff, which contribute to a generally pleasant feel. Ventilation is adequate, with mesh panels on the thumb, index and middle fingers, and vented TPR protectors on the leather ring and pinky fingers. However, in Mumbai’s humid climate, you’ll inevitably feel sweat building on your palms, especially during prolonged stops.  A significant point of contention here is the fit. I consulted the online size chart and opted for the large size. However, I noted empty voids on top of the ring and pinky fingers. This slightly loose fit at the fingertips can reduce feel but won’t pose a risk while riding. I also experienced a distinct tugging sensation on the thumb during initial rides. While this improved as the gloves broke in over time, it still persists, albeit to a lesser degree.  Fit can be an issue, so it’s best to try them before buying. Finally, the touch-compatible fingertips are a feature many riders look for today. My experience, however, aligns with a known issue across many gloves. While they technically work, precise inputs are difficult. Don’t expect to compose messages or navigate intricate menus; they’re best for quick taps to answer calls or skip tracks. Despite the minor fit nuances and the expected heat build-up, the Raida Carbonite gloves offer a solid package of protection and decent comfort for the price. They are a good VFM option for urban commuters and occasional tourers, provided you find a size that fits your hands well.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/work-underway-tatas-uk-ev-battery-factory-ahead-2027-opening",
    "description": "Bridgwater factory will initially create batteries for JLR and Tata Motors; 40GWh capacity will be largest in Europe Work has begun in building what will become one of Europe’s largest EV battery factories - and the Somerset site is planned to open in 2027. It comes more than a year after the £4billion facility, owned by Agratas  – a battery subsidiary of JLR parent Tata Group – was given approval to be built on the site of a former World War Two bomb-making factory in Bridgwater. On Monday, the first steel frames of the main production building were erected, which Agratas hailed as a “major milestone”. All steel comes from British suppliers. Work on the next building is expected to start in the coming days, with the final foundations now being laid. Earl Wiggins, VP Manufacturing Operations at Agratas said it was a \"proud moment\" for the \"world-leading facility\", adding: “This is a facility that will play a huge role in the EV supply chain in the UK, and growth and innovation right here in Somerset will be at its heart.” This site milestone comes a week after the Government published its new Industrial Strategy, aimed at strengthening advanced manufacturing and supporting the development and growth of the battery sector. Industry Minister Sarah Jones MP said: “It’s great to see this milestone reached for Agratas’ gigafactory, which shows the huge growth potential for UK battery manufacturing.” Tata’s first battery factory outside of its Indian home market will be run by subsidiary Agratas and, with an eventual capacity of 40GWh, will be one of the largest such facilities in Europe.  That capacity alone is just under half of what the UK needs in order to cater to projected local electric vehicle production by 2030.  Autocar understands the site will be known as Agratas South West, but it remains unclear whether that holds any implications for future Agratas facilities in other parts of the country. The factory, which will create 4000 jobs, will initially make batteries for Tata Motors and JLR (formerly Jaguar Land Rover) – brands that sit under the Tata Group umbrella – before later expanding to produce cells for different applications, such as commercial vehicles, two-wheelers and energy storage solutions. Tata is looking locally to fill the 4000 jobs needed for its new gigafactory. There will also be thousands more created within the supply chain, it predicts, especially as a host of support businesses and technology companies will need to set up shop nearby. Cells made at the factory will be in the rectangular prismatic format, rather than the cylindrical shape preferred by BMW and Tesla, and Tata has already said that the cell chemistry can be adapted and changed as new advancements are made. Tata’s vote of confidence in the UK brings reassurance after a long period of uncertainty around the British industry’s preparedness for the EV era However, questions still remain over whether the country will be able to build enough batteries to sustain competitive levels of EV production. The Faraday Institute forecasts that the UK will need 100GWh of capacity by 2030, rising to 200GWh by 2040. But in addition to Tata’s 40GWh Somerset site, only Nissan supplier Envision has concrete plans to ramp up UK battery production, eventually taking its battery factory in Sunderland to an output of 38GWh. Tata’s Bridgwater site will be the biggest battery factory in Europe. LG is the only firm with plans to eclipse it over time, targeting a 70GWh expansion at its plant in Poland, which supplies packs to Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Renault and Volvo.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/autocar-awards/krief-engineering-guru-who-swapped-ferrari-renault",
    "description": "Why the 296 GTB engineer now wants to make mainstream cars fun It turns out there’s an 11-week lead on a half-hour audience with Philippe Krief. Surprised? Don’t be. In September last year, the man from Marseille became the Renault Group’s new chief technology officer. This would be a substantial professional endeavour even if the 60-year-old hadn’t, only the summer before, also left Ferrari and taken on the role of Alpine CEO. Somehow he does the two jobs side by side, each day scoped to the minute. It’s hardcore. Mr R\u0026D for vast Dacia, even more vast Renault and ‘vehicle as a service’ provider Mobilize is also on the hook for the resurgence of a brand some believe can, in the EV era, wield a degree of clout similar to that which Porsche amassed in the petrol age. So Krief is busy – but if you manage to pin him down, he makes for fascinating, steely company. It was obvious from the nervous energy of the comms staffers, with whom we were awaiting their CTO’s arrival in a grand exhibition space (replete with giant turntables) in the bowels of Renault’s Technocentre, that he comes with an aura. Not the full Tobias Moers – people weren’t profoundly intimidated, as was often the case when the ex-Aston Martin CEO was inbound – but a deep seriousness. Brows were furrowed, chatter was clipped, chairs were arranged and rearranged. Then he was among us, in a black turtleneck more car designer than camber-geometry tragic, five minutes early. So who is Philippe Krief, winner of this year’s Mundy Award for Engineering? A born engineer, for one thing. With high-flying execs the car bug is so often inherited, but neither of his folks worked in the industry, instead running a removals business. A successful one, admittedly – young Krief was rolling around in the back of DS Citroëns and had a soft spot for his father’s Peugeot 504 coupé (the Pininfarina one, he reminds me), so delectable metal was on the scene. But it wasn’t the impetus.  Engineering was the job he always wanted to do, “so I combined cars with my passion”, he says. Engineering was the desire, cars the vessel. The balance has since shifted, and Krief today can’t imagine engineering anything else. He says: “The thing I learned, and that I now know would be difficult not to have, is the soul you give to a car,” he says. “You can feel it when you test drive it.” I guess you can’t get quite the same kick from designing an MRI machine, or even an unmanned rocket. That soundbite is typical Krief talk. He speaks softly, authoritatively, in accented English, enunciating precisely as he describes engineering concepts and management structures, but then often expressing a sentiment that would sound twee coming from anyone else. It helps that ‘soul’ is very much his oeuvre, as anyone who has tried his back catalogue knows. You get the sense Krief is a unique proposition. On one hand the man is obsessed with quantitative approaches – “at the end of the day, what makes the car feel [special], even if it looks subjective, can be measured” – and he champions simulators, with their potential to do all the dogsbody bits of chassis development, driving down costs and freeing up talent. But he also firmly believes the human touch is non-negotiable if you’re going to create a sports car that is “completely harmonious in everything”.  In many ways he is perfectly suited to taking a romantic brand like Alpine forward into what is, technologically, still rather an unknown space. The extent of Krief’s uniqueness as a world-class chassis developer surely stems from his geographically varied and demanding career path. Part of the final year of an engineering degree was spent at Renault, developing early suspension simulation models. It was pioneering stuff in the ’80s – and perhaps useful preparation for today’s uncertain world. Next was Michelin, when tyre development was still a “trial and error process”. He talks fondly of his then-boss, who inspired him by “pushing some concepts that, in the company, he alone believed in”, but he had the data and the will to prove it to the doubters further up the corporate food chain. Then came a move to Japan, to help the French tyre maker win lucrative OEM contracts. There, Krief’s own delight in detail and fact was “enhanced by a factor of 1000” by the Japanese engineers. “They were so precise,” he says, “so willing to understand, so deep in the analysis.” One imagines the subsequent move to Italy, to head up chassis development for transverse Fiat platforms – everything from 147 GTA to Ducato – was something of a culture shock, although it undeniably gave Krief huge engineering breadth. Then Maranello. The low-speed back-axle jounce resistance of Fiat Doblos was swapped for the limit-handling characteristics of mid-engined supercars. Even today, Krief is best known for stitching together the dynamic canvas on which the 458 Speciale – one of the all-time great, exploitable supercars – imparts total joy on the driver. And yet perhaps his real magnum opus was what came next: Alfa Romeo’s Giorgio platform was a storied project completed largely in secret, and the resulting Giulia was an anti-BMW 3 Series, as the Alpine A110 is an anti-Porsche Cayman. Same mechanical brief but with a wonderfully fresh, lively approach. “We were asked to do the platform and first car in less than three years,” says Krief, “without any components from the Fiat world, and without any engineering [input] coming from Fiat, so we had to create a small team.” The beauty of the small team, as Krief puts it, is that no single person designs just the suspension bushes or the drop links and so on. “There are guys who think about the [entire] system,” he says. It’s an important way of working for Krief; it’s quite similar to the British school, and it’s something he not only sees and encourages in Alpine but which he is now inculcating on a deeper level across the entire Renault Group portfolio. “I needed to be sure that I agreed with the philosophy,” he says of his then potential switch from Ferrari to Alpine in 2023, after 25 years working in Italy that culminated in signing off on the plug-in hybrid Ferrari 296 GTB. “Now I’m too old to change, so when I was first contacted by Alpine, I thought about the challenge: to start from scratch, to develop a product in the electric [sphere] that will have the same attributes as the cars I have always developed and loved.” It was a compelling offer, and it drew the Frenchman home for, possibly, the last big job. Now the vision is coalescing. The A390 is here with its dual-motor rear axle and clever chassis electronics; prototypes feel promising. Next year, the existing A110 (not a Krief product, although it feels spookily like one) will retire. Its loss-leading replacement is due in 2027 and will introduce the Alpine Performance Platform, which will also underpin a roadster and a revived A310 2+2. A V6-engined supercar is also incoming. The goal in all cases will be to quantify attributes that made the cars on Krief’s CV so lovable then replicate them for EVs. A hard job, but not impossible. He says: “With a different architecture [to the petrol cars], with different weight and inertia, with higher-density motors, shorter response time, the [engineering method] will be different but the result will be the same: pleasure.”",

    "description": "The Skoda Slavia, in its Monte Carlo trim, has really been turning heads. Not because it’s new, but I guess in a jam full of SUVs, a sedan wearing bright red is quite the attention-grabber. Walking up to it makes me happy the moment I see it parked there, knowing that the 1.5 TSI engine will be a delight to drive. Oh, and on a side note, I just realised ‘jam’ would be an apt collective noun for a group of cars. The storage space under the front armrest is nice and deep. So far, I’ve used the Slavia only within the city, but with summer vacations on and traffic appreciably lighter, I’ve actually been able to enjoy clear roads, steady cruising, and decent fuel efficiency, too. I’ve managed an overall figure of about 8.5kpl over this past month – not bad for a petrol automatic in Mumbai, and I haven’t been driving with efficiency in mind. You can only have a dial display of the speedo or tacho, not both together. Rather, it’s been tempting to enjoy the 150hp and 250Nm of torque, which makes it responsive off the line and also allows you to take advantage of empty stretches of tarmac. It’s amazing how quickly you’ll be nudging the 70kph speed limit around town. Beyond outright speed, though, it’s the crisp nature of its power delivery that you will enjoy every time you dab the throttle, so don’t think of this as something you can only enjoy out on highways. Have to say, though, at very low speeds, it sometimes trips up between 1st and 2nd gear, typical of so many DSGs. Indented shelf cubby neatly creates two separate handy storage spaces. Another bit that annoys me – even though it’s a far smaller issue – is the instrument display. It’s customisable and has dials, but you can only call up a speedo or a tacho dial, not both at the same time. And while I’m on about stuff I don’t like, let’s talk air conditioning. The VW Group’s India 2.0 cars were known to have subpar ACs, and while this one is just about holding up against the summer, every now and then, you will need to tweak the temperature or fan speed, and those touch controls are fiddly to use. The indentation does help, but it’s hard to get a precise change in temperature or fan speed, and you need to look down to confirm just how much has changed. Console slot should have been deeper to easily store the key fob. Such a contrast to the steering-mounted audio controls. The track selection buttons fall into hand easily, and the volume scroll wheel is simply a delight to use: quick, easy, and with a nice tactile feel as well. It’s a familiar Skoda, and it’s nice to see these on the India 2.0 cars too. Speaking of familiar Skoda traits, there’s a ‘simply clever’ bit I really like and put to use every day; the centre console cubby has an indented shelf design that creates two spaces within and neatly holds my phone on the wireless charging mat and my wallet in the space ahead. And while I’m on about storage, the boot is pretty handy, too, at 521 litres. That’s around what some SUVs offer. So, if plans materialise, I’ll be off to Goa soon, and after a raft of SUVs, I think it’s this sedan I’ll take this time around.

    "description": "The compact SUV segment continues to grow, and the latest entrant in this tightly contested space is the Skoda Kylaq. It offers everything we liked about the Skoda Kushaq in a smaller and more affordable package, so the question is: how does it stack up against the winner of our last compact SUV comparison, the Mahindra XUV 3XO? Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO exterior design and engineering Kylaq looks proportionate and mature, while the 3XO is distinctive. Let’s start with the way they look. Both models measure just under 4m in length, but the Kylaq looks more proportionate. The wide signature front grille, split headlamps and chunky bumper work well to give the Skoda a good presence. Around the side, the 17-inch alloys, chunky cladding and roof rails add some flavour, while the faux scuff plate at the back gives it an outdoorsy look. However, the small square tail-lights make it appear more like a hatchback rather than a crossover. XUV 3XO styling may not appeal to everyone In comparison, the 3XO’s tail looks abruptly cut off, as it’s based on the 4m+ Ssangyong Tivoli. Like newer Mahindras, the 3XO has a polarising design, to say the least. Vertically oriented headlights, C-shaped daytime running lamps and a sharply cut bumper lend the 3XO its distinctive face. Like the Skoda, the Mahindra also gets 17-inch rims, body cladding and roof rails to further its SUV look. The rear is characterised by a full-width LED light bar and a chunky bumper. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO specificationsKylaqXUV 3XOLength (mm)3,9953,990Width (mm)1,7831,821Height (mm)1,6191,647Wheelbase (mm)2,5662,600Boot capacity (litres)360295Ground clearance (mm)189201Tyre size205/55 R17215/55 R17Engine3 cyls, 999cc, turbo-petrol3cyl, 1197cc, turbo-petrolPower115hp at 5000-5500rpm131hp at 5000rpmTorque178Nm at 1750-4000rpm230Nm at 1500-2500rpmGearbox6-speed torque converter auto6-speed torque converter auto Overall, the XUV does appear to be the more substantial of the two, given that it’s the widest and has the longest wheelbase in the segment. The XUV also has the advantage of 201mm ground clearance; the Kylaq’s is 189mm. However, the Skoda does have an edge when it comes to boot space, measuring 360 litres up to the parcel shelf, while the Mahindra has a 295-litre capacity. Both can also be expanded further thanks to split-folding rear seats, though the Skoda has a deeper boot. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO interior space and comfort Kylaq interior is built tough, but all-black scheme detract from sense of space All-black theme with green trim gives Kylaq cabin a sporty vibe; quality is solid. These two also take a different approach on the inside. The Kylaq, as expected, closely resembles the Kushaq, with shared elements like the high-quality, 2-spoke steering wheel, digital instrument cluster and touch-based panel for climate control. However, Skoda has added some flash value by giving it olive green inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia. Overall, the design is clean and uncluttered and has a solid build, which is only furthered by the reassuring ‘thud’ you get when closing the doors. It has a dual-tone theme, but the black upholstery can make you feel hemmed in, especially when compared to the XUV. It has a practical interior, too, with large doorbins, plenty of cubbies, and some typically Skoda ‘Simply Clever’ touches like the phone slots on the front seatbacks, a ticket holder on the windshield, and more. Headroom and kneeroom are decent, but it’s only wide enough for two. The Kylaq’s front seats are better in this company, given that they offer better support and feature electric adjustment and ventilation. But in terms of the backseat, it falls behind the Mahindra. It has an adequate amount of legroom and headroom for average-sized adults, but the narrow cabin and the seat contouring mean it is best suited for two passengers. Rear occupants get their own AC vents, Type-C charging ports, adjustable headrests and a centre armrest with cupholders. XUV 3XO cabin feels airier and more premium Looks and feels more premium, thanks to soft-touch materials and light upholstery. In comparison, the XUV 3XO’s interior looks and feels more upmarket. The light-coloured upholstery uplifts the space, as does the panoramic sunroof, but the ivory seats will be challenging to keep clean. Top-spec versions get a soft-touch finish on the dash; there’s a generous use of gloss black, and elements like the steering wheel, window switches and light/wiper stalks feel top-notch. It’s also nice that the XUV gets physical buttons and knobs for the dual-zone climate control. Like the Kylaq, the 3XO has plenty of storage spaces in the cabin, with large doorbins, a good-sized cooled glove box, and more. XUV 3XO's rear seat has more room and can comfortably fit three adults. You’ll appreciate the view you get out of the cabin from the XUV, and the bonnet flares give you the feeling that you’re driving an SUV. The front seats, even though they’re well-cushioned, aren’t as accommodating as the Kylaq’s, and you’ll also miss that you don’t get electric adjustment or ventilation. But it’s at the rear where the Mahindra has the most evident advantage. Owing to its width, three adults can sit comfortably in the XUV, and the long wheelbase means that legroom is plenty, too. If anything, accommodating the mechanism for the sunroof has eaten into headroom, but that’ll only be an issue for those taller than 6 feet. Amenities at the back include AC vents, a centre armrest with cupholders, a 12V port and a USB Type-C charger.

Common features include LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, a sunroof, a wireless charger, a digital instrument cluster, a touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone integration, leatherette upholstery, auto climate control, six airbags, traction control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Commendably, both the Kylaq and XUV 3XO have a 5-star BNCAP rating. However, they both have features unique to them as well. Kylaq one-ups XUV 3XO with powered and ventilated front seats Ventilated front seats unique to the Kylaq. The Kylaq’s front seats have ventilation and power adjustment, which the XUV lacks, and we found the output from the Skoda’s 4-speaker and 2-tweeter audio system to be more consistent. The Skoda makes do with smaller 10-inch and 8-inch screens for the infotainment and cluster, respectively. However, its screen features a newer UI compared to its stablemates, and on the whole, this system is slick and has good graphics. XUV 3XO gets Level 2 ADAS, 360-degree camera, rear disc brakes, and more 3XO’s panoramic sunroof will be a big draw. Coming to the XUV 3XO, the AX7 L featured here gets a larger panoramic sunroof, larger 10.25-inch screens, an electronic parking brake, a 360-degree camera, more connected tech, a 7-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, rear disc brakes, and Level 2 ADAS (blind-spot monitor, autonomous emergency braking, lane-keep assist, and more) over the Kylaq’s range-topping Prestige variant. The ADAS features work well on a clearly marked road and can be switched off completely, too, should you want to. I found the blind-spot monitor, which appears in the instrument cluster, to be particularly useful. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performance and refinement Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO performanceAccelerationKylaqXUV 3XO0-20kph (seconds)1.471.370-40kph (seconds)2.972.780-60kph (seconds)5.134.720-80kph (seconds)7.977.610-100kph (seconds)11.6911.050-120kph (seconds)16.0215.7420-80kph (seconds)6.386.3840-100kph (seconds)8.728.11 Now, on to the driving bits. Both SUVs are powered by a 3-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo-petrol engine, but they vary in displacement and output. The Kylaq has a smaller 1.0-litre unit that puts out 115hp and 178Nm, while the 3XO’s larger 1.2-litre motor produces 131hp and 230Nm. Both versions tested were paired with the same Aisin-sourced 6-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. 131hp 1.2L mill feels strong throughout rev range. Given the difference in output, the Mahindra is naturally quicker in a sprint to 100kph, completing it in 11.05sec to the Kylaq’s 11.69sec. The Skoda claws back in the 20-80kph run, posting an identical time of 6.38sec, but it is marginally slower in the 40-100kph run. Skoda 1.0 TSI feels stronger than expected 115hp 1.0 TSI engine punches above its weight. The Kylaq’s engine is slightly slower to respond at low speeds, and that’s something you’ll have to get used to in city driving. But then on, power delivery becomes smooth and progress easy. The TSI engine punches above its weight and feels significantly stronger than its cubic capacity would have you believe. And that’s most evident in the mid-range. What helps make the most of the mid-range are the paddle shifters, which add to the engagement. And even in fully automatic mode, the gearbox does its job rather smoothly. In isolation, the Kylaq’s engine is refined, but it is the noisier unit in comparison. XUV 3XO feels punchier at low speeds The XUV 3XO has a significant power and torque advantage, and you feel as much from the get-go. Drive modes also help fine-tune the experience. Just as you start out, you’ll feel that the XUV 3XO is more responsive at low speeds. However, you have to be mindful – at least in city driving conditions – that it’s better in Zip mode, where power delivery is the smoothest. If you’re in Zap or Zoom mode, you will find that the engine bunches up its power quite early in the rev range. And you don’t want that when you’re in very tight moving conditions. Modes alter response and steering weight. Of course, when the road opens up, you’d want to switch to Zap or Zoom mode, which will have the engine breathe freer and feel different in its power delivery. While the Kylaq’s engine is the strongest in the mid-range, the XUV’s mill feels strong throughout. So, right from low revs, it’s more alert and responsive, and even in the mid-range, there is a constant and steady stream of power. You don’t have to work the engine to get the best out of it. Paddle shifters add to the Kylaq's drive experience. The 3XO is quick and fun, but you will miss paddle shifters. Gear shifts via the lever are responsive enough, though. What’s remarkable is the Mahindra engine’s refinement. Even when revved hard, it doesn’t thrum like you’d expect a 3-cylinder unit to. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO fuel efficiency XUV 3XO was more frugal in our testing Kylaq returned a better mileage on the highway, while the XUV 3XO sipped less fuel in the city. Coming to the important topic of fuel efficiency, we put the two cars through our test loops in Mumbai city as well as on the highway. And it’s the XUV that delivered a higher figure of 9.9kpl in town. The SUV’s auto stop/start keeps the engine off for longer durations, which could have helped the economy. The Kylaq managed 8.7kpl in the city, but it did edge past on the highway, delivering 13.3kpl to the XUV 3XO’s 13kpl figure.

The Kylaq doesn’t get steering modes like the XUV 3XO, and in general, it has a lighter steering wheel, but it’s nice and smooth, and you can have great fun in the corners. You also get the feeling that this chassis could actually take on a larger, more powerful engine, maybe the 1.5 TSI for a Kylaq RS? When cruising on the highway, the Kylaq drives like a bigger car, but over undulations, there is more up-and-down movement than you get in the 3XO. And if you talk specifically in comparison to the 3XO’s ride comfort, the Kylaq is more absorbent at lower speeds, and over bumps and potholes, you’ll sense that there’s a bit more wheel travel as well. XUV 3XO's driving modes noticeably affect steering feel. The XUV 3XO, too, feels fun to drive on a twisty road. Notably, its drive modes also change steering weight progressively. You get a good feeling of control at the steering wheel, but the standout element is the grip that you experience around corners. So, you can carry a lot of speed with a great deal of confidence. At higher speeds, the 3XO feels poised and composed, and you can attribute that to the relatively flatter ride than the Kylaq. On the flip side, the low-speed ride is a bit firmer than the Skoda, but not to the extent of being a dealbreaker. Skoda Kylaq vs Mahindra XUV 3XO price and verdict Both compact SUVs trade blows on the price front They're close in terms of driving experience, but the Mahindra feels like a more complete package. In terms of pricing, the Skoda Kylaq and Mahindra XUV 3XO are about at par for comparable trim levels. The fully loaded XUV 3XO AX7 L featured here is pricey at Rs 15.79 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai). But forgo the ADAS, 360-degree camera and electric parking brake, and you can get the AX7, whose Rs 13.99 lakh price tag is identical to that of the top-spec Kylaq Prestige AT. Talking about like-priced variants, there is a bit of give and take in features, but they’re still close. The duo is also close in terms of driving experience, the 3XO being marginally faster, while the Kylaq is more entertaining in its handling and slightly more absorbent in its ride quality. Where the 3XO moves ahead is in its plusher interior, more refined engine and more room for passengers. The advantage in fuel economy also tips the scales in favour of the Mahindra. Keen drivers will enjoy both models, no doubt, but it’s the XUV 3XO that eventually makes you feel like you’ve got more for your money.

    "description": "Harley-Davidson’s core business is, and will always be, big American V-twins. But there are moments in The Motor Co.’s history where it has deviated from this formula in a bid to attract a wider audience, with varying levels of success. In the 60s and 70s, Harley leveraged their part (and later full) ownership of the Italian manufacturer Aermacchi to create a handful of smaller bikes—like the 1974 Harley-Davidson SX250. Released during Harley’s infamous AMF era, this single-cylinder two-stroke was designed to compete with the lightweight Japanese enduro bikes of the day. But since it was effectively just a rebadged Aermacchi, it faded from existence when Harley sold the Italian firm to Cagiva in 1978. These days, Aermacchi Harleys enjoy a niche following among vintage racers, and anyone else who has a soft spot for 1970s oddballs.…",

    "description": "Having revealed the introductory starting price of the Harrier EV earlier this month, Tata Motors has now announced the full price list, including the AWD variant. The Harrier EV RWD's price starts at Rs 21.49 lakh, while the Harrier EV AWD is priced from Rs 28.99 lakh. Not only does the Harrier EV sit at the pinnacle of Tata’s all-electric line-up, but it’s also the carmaker’s first model with an all-wheel-drive layout since the Safari Storme was discontinued over five years ago. Bookings for the Harrier EV are slated to open on July 2, 2025. UPDATE: Tata Harrier EV scores 5-star BNCAP safety rating Tata Harrier EV 65 range revealed Tata Harrier EV launched in India at Rs 21.49 lakh (introductory) Electric SUV sports minor design tweaks over current Harrier  Gets 65kWh and 75kWh battery pack options; maximum output is 313hp and 504Nm Tata Harrier EV full price list All variants of the Harrier Ev get an optional AC fast charger, which costs Rs 49,000, including the installation charger. Only the Empowered 75 RWD and Empowered 75 AWD variants are available in Stealth Edition form, priced Rs 75,000 higher. This means that for the introductory period, Harrier EV prices range from Rs 21.49 lakh to Rs 30.23 lakh.  Tata Harrier EV priceVariant*PriceAdventure 65 Rs 21.49 lakh Adventure S 65Rs 21.99 lakh Fearless+ 65Rs 23.99 lakh Fearless+ 75Rs 24.99 lakh Empowered 75^Rs 27.49 lakh Empowered 75 QWD^Rs 28.99 lakh *AC fast charger and installation cost is Rs 49,000 ^Stealth Editions cost Rs 75,000 more   Tata Harrier EV exterior design Mostly identical to ICE-powered Harrier On the outside, the Harrier EV’s styling largely echoes the facelifted Harrier that’s been on sale here since 2023. However, Tata has brought it in line with other EVs in its line-up. Up front, the Harrier EV gets a new closed-off grille, underneath which sits a revised bumper with a line-based design. Over to the side, the Harrier EV comes with a set of new 19-inch, aero-optimised alloy wheels and ‘EV’ badging on the front doors. The only change at the rear is the ‘Harrier.EV’ lettering on the tailgate. The Harrier EV is 2mm longer and 22mm taller than the standard Harrier, though their wheelbases are the same – 2,741mm. All-black Stealth Edition on offer Four colour options will be available with the Harrier EV at launch: Empowered Oxide, Nainital Nocturne, Pristine White, and Pure Grey. Alongside these, Tata will also sell a Stealth Edition of the Harrier EV, which features blacked-out design elements inside and out – in line with the carmaker's Dark Edition models. Tata Harrier EV interior and features Infotainment screen is a Samsung QLED panel Much like the outside, the Harrier EV’s cabin doesn’t stray far from its ICE-powered counterpart. However, the 14.53-inch infotainment screen that sits atop the dual-tone dashboard is a world-first Samsung Neo QLED display, which should make for crisper image quality. There's a 10.25-inch digital driver’s display and a four-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated Tata logo. Boot space stands at 502 litres (999 litres with second row folded down), and a frunk is available too. Harrier EV feature list is loaded The centre console has a touch-based HVAC control panel, and moving further down reveals a rotary selector for the six terrain modes - Normal, Snow/Grass, Mud-Ruts, Sand, Rock Crawl, Custom - and electronic parking brake. Other notable features on the Harrier EV include a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, ventilated and powered front seats, powered Boss mode for the second row, 10-speaker JBL sound system with Dolby Atmos 5.1, powered tailgate, vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) functionality, four drive modes (Eco, City, Sport, and Boost), all-digital inside rearview mirror, auto park assist, and more. With the Harrier EV, Tata has also debuted a new electrical architecture termed TiDAL (Tata Intelligent Digital Architecture Layer) that powers the SUV's connected car features, such as over-the-air (OTA) updates, voice commands, etc. Additionally, the Harrier EV gets a 540-degree surround camera view that alerts the driver if any of the wheels comes too close to a kerb, and there's a new DrivePay feature that eliminates the need for a mobile device for FASTag and EV charging point payments. Coming to safety, the Harrier EV comes equipped with six airbags as standard (seven in higher trims), a 360-degree camera, built-in dashcam, blind spot monitor, electronic stability control (ESC), and more. Level 2 ADAS is also part of the Harrier EV's safety suite, and Tata claims that it has been fine-tuned for Indian road conditions. Moreover, the system can provide a live feed stitched from all the cameras around the Harrier EV, which can be quite helpful while off-roading and is a segment-first addition. Tata Harrier EV battery and range Generates up to 504Nm of torque The Harrier EV leverages an enhanced iteration of Tata’s Acti.ev platform, which debuted last year with the Punch EV and is also utilised by the Curvv EV. Entry-level trims of the Harrier EV come equipped with a 65kWh LFP battery pack that powers a single motor on the rear axle that sends 238hp to the rear wheels. In higher trim levels, the Harrier EV gets a 75kWh LFP battery and dual motors – one for each axle – that develop a combined 313hp and a whopping 504Nm. This variant can sprint from 0-100kph in just 6.3 seconds with the Boost mode enabled. 75kWh Harrier EV delivers up to 627km range As far as range goes, the Harrier EV's RWD 75kWh and AWD 75kWh variants can travel up to an MIDC-certified 627km and 622km on a single charge. When subjected to Tata’s internal testing cycle – dubbed C75 – the RWD 75kWh version returned a real-world range of 480-505km, easily surpassing other EVs from the carmaker. When it comes to charging, a 7.2kW AC charger can replenish the Harrier EV from 10-100 percent in 10.7 hours, while a 120kW DC fast charger will juice up the SUV’s battery from 20-80 percent in 25 minutes. Notably, the Harrier EV incorporates a new 'Ultra Glide' multi-link suspension setup at the rear with frequency-dependent dampers for better off-road drivability. To that end, Tata has included an 'Off-road Assist' function - essentially a low-speed cruise control that can be set as low as 5kph -  and a 'Transparent' mode that projects an image of what's underneath the Harrier EV on the infotainment screen. There's a four-level regenerative braking system on offer with the Harrier EV too, as well as a summon mode that can extract the SUV from tight spaces autonomously. For more spirited drivers, Tata offers a Drift mode in the Harrier EV, which likely dials down the traction control. Tata Harrier EV price, variants and rivals Lifetime battery warranty Tata will sell the Harrier EV in three trims: Adventure, Fearless+, and Empowered. The 65kWh battery has been available on the Adventure and Fearless+ trims, while the larger 75kWh battery comes on the Fearless+ and Empowered trims; AWD is likely to be reserved for the top Empowered trim only. Tata has also confirmed that all Harrier EV buyers will get a lifetime warranty for the battery. Higher starting price than BE 6, but undercuts XEV 9e and Atto 3 At this price point, the Harrier EV lands squarely against the Mahindra’s latest EV duo – the XEV 9e and BE 6 – and the BYD Atto 3.

    "description": "Royal Enfield has substantially increased the price of its cross-spoke wheels offered as an accessory for the Himalayan 450. The price has risen from Rs 12,424 to Rs 40,645. It is no longer as affordable for existing Himalayan buyers, but will continue to be offered at the same price for those who bundle it with their Himalayan purchase. First-time Himalayan 450 buyers can still get the cross-spoke wheels for Rs 11,000 if bundled with the bike. Earlier, it was priced at Rs 12,424 for existing owners Royal Enfield Himalayan 450’s cross-spoke wheel colours It is available in three different colours The Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 is one of the few affordable adventure tourers offered with cross-spoke wheels. At launch, these wheels received immense appreciation for their pricing. They were introduced at just Rs 12,424 for existing Himalayan owners looking to upgrade from the stock tubed wheel setup to cross-spoke wheels. Royal Enfield had managed to price them so competitively that they even undercut the cost of most tubeless-conversion kits. However, Royal Enfield has now substantially increased the price. Previously priced at Rs 12,424, the cross-spoke wheels now cost Rs 40,645. That said, this revised pricing appears to apply only to existing owners purchasing the wheels as an accessory. First-time buyers who bundle the cross-spoke wheels with their new Himalayan purchase can still avail them at a significantly lower price of Rs 11,000. These cross-spoke wheels are available in three colours—black, black olive, and gold—to better match the variants, with no price difference between them. Given this steep price hike, many existing Himalayan owners who had planned to upgrade to the tubeless cross-spoke setup may now reconsider. The Himalayan 450 is priced between Rs 2.85 lakh and Rs 2.98 lakh (ex-showroom) and is powered by a 452cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine producing 40hp and 40Nm. It comes mated to a six-speed gearbox. Also see: KTM 390 Adventure X to get cruise control and updated electronics soon",
