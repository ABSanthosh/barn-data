    "description": "Chinese motorcycle giant CFMoto has been making waves in overseas markets with a series of well-equipped, good-to-ride motorcycles that are sold with enticingly low price tags. As the company gears up to re-enter the Indian market after a short-lived first attempt in 2019, it invited us to its global launch event to experience some of its latest products. CFMoto 675SR-R design, engine The first of these was the new 675SR-R, which, on the surface, looks like a rival to the sub-100hp street-oriented sportbikes like the new Triumph Daytona 660, the Suzuki GSX-8R and the Honda CBR650R. This is why CFMoto’s decision to let us ride the bike on the mighty Portimao racetrack seemed puzzling at first, but it started to make sense once we met the bike. Unlike the above-mentioned rivals, this bike takes on more of a sporty identity with much more committed ergonomics that are closer to a proper supersport. The 675cc three-cylinder engine also sounds very supersport, and the immediate assumption is that it has been ‘benchmarked’ from the erstwhile Triumph 675 motor. However, the spec sheet reveals that the bore and stroke figures are quite different here, and this motor actually finds its roots in CFMoto’s 450cc twin-cylinder engine that receives one more cylinder here: 450 + 225 = 675. What you get is an engine that produces 88.6hp at 11,000rpm and 68Nm at 8,250rpm. The sound from the compact exhaust is similar to the Moto2 howl that you get from the Triumph and Yamaha triples, and it’s quite a loud note as well. CFMoto 675SR-R handling, performance Portimao is a wild circuit with huge crests and drops and plenty of blind sections, with no reference points to whether the next corner goes left or right. It took me a couple of sessions to learn the track well enough to be able to commit to proper speeds, and the 675 never felt out of its depth as the pace went up. The power on offer was perfect for my lack of track knowledge, and it resulted in a fast motorcycle but not one that was overwhelmingly so. What needs improvement is the throttle connection, which feels a bit too sharp on the initial opening and, occasionally, a little inconsistent. Midrange torque should be impressive on the street, but with the rollercoaster-like undulations on this track, it was vital to keep the revs up. However, the rev limiter hits quite hard, and running into that with the bike leaned over between corners was a little unsettling. Aside from these issues, the performance was strong and enjoyable, and I saw just over 220kph before braking for the first corner. The front suspension is fully adjustable. With twin 300mm front rotors and J Juan calipers, the stopping performance was actually quite impressive. There was good power and feel, although this circuit has more of a flowing nature without too many brutal hard-braking zones. The main issue with the brakes was that the ABS could be quite intrusive, and many riders elected to deactivate it for the final run by pulling the fuse. CFMoto 675SR-R ergonomics, underpinnings The SR-R weighs 189 kilos, and the seat height is 810mm – both pretty good numbers for a motorcycle like this. Suspension is handled by KYB components: a fully adjustable 41mm USD fork and a preload and rebound adjustable monoshock. The tubular steel chassis and aluminium swingarm, along with the KYB suspension, resulted in a sharp yet predictable riding experience, with the bike turning well and holding a line across this fast-flowing circuit. It didn’t feel out of its depth when thrown into some really fast corners, including the final turn – which is a long downhill right-hander that leads into the main straight – at nearly 180kph.  Aero makes up a big part of the 675’s design. Even the CST tyres were surprisingly good, and while the past experience with these Chinese tyres hasn’t been positive, the new semi-slick tyres on the SR-R were never a cause for concern. Chassis-wise, the only limiting factor was the footpeg feelers that ground down once the pace went up. CFMoto says that removing them will not be a problem, but it wanted to keep them on the bikes for this event as they help protect parts like the exhaust in case the bike goes down and slides along the tarmac.  CFMoto 675 SR-R features It’s no surprise that this is a well-equipped motorcycle, and it has a sharp, functional TFT display, along with dual-channel ABS, two-level traction control and a tyre pressure monitoring system. The traction control was smooth enough that I left it in its lower setting on the track without any issues. A cable-operated throttle means the SR-R only has a quickshifter, but CFMoto says it is working on a ride-by-wire system that will enable a blipper as well. There’s also an optional “T-Box” module with a 4G SIM that unlocks a myriad of connected features.  TFT display is smooth, informative and easy to read. CFMoto 675SR-R price, India launch On its own, the CFMoto 675SR-R is a good motorcycle that will probably be quicker than any of its sub-100hp rivals around a racetrack. There are a few blemishes in it that need to be polished out, but they’re all fixable, and at the rate that CFMoto is churning out new and impressive bikes, I don’t think it will be long before the company does so. But as you would expect with CFMoto, the real kicker here is the price, which, at 7,590 euros, is just 200 euros more than a Honda CBR500R. CFMoto is planning its India launch by the middle of this year, and while the 675 is not immediately on the cards, it is being considered for our market. If the company can manage to undercut its Japanese and British rivals by around Rs 2 lakh, as it does overseas, that will make this a very tempting option indeed. CFMoto 675NK quick review We also had the opportunity to ride the 675SR-R’s naked sibling, the 675NK. This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. The 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R. We got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.

    "description": "The Hyundai Creta CVT has perhaps been the most in-demand car of the Autocar long-term fleet. Refined, comfortable and user-friendly, we’ve run this SUV for over 6,000km for shoots, commutes and road trips. Unfortunately, though, it’s now gone back to its maker, so I’m going to tell you what living with it was like. Most of my running with the Creta was done in the city, although Saumil and Hormazd did do some highway work on their road trips to Goa and Mahabaleshwar, respectively. Regardless of the usage, we agreed that this refined 1.5 petrol paired with the CVT auto makes for a seamless driving experience. And given that it especially excels in the city, it comes as no surprise that this atmospheric petrol engine outsells the other options. However, its lack of performance can be felt on the highways when you want to drive in a spirited manner. So, if performance is what you’re looking for, best opt for the 160hp turbo-petrol. Refined and seamless, the Creta IVT felt at home in city traffic. What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in fuel efficiency, by petrol SUV standards at least. In our instrumented real-world test, the Creta CVT returned a maximum of 15.05kpl on the highway, which went as low as 7.5kpl in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Also worth noting is that the efficiency will drop drastically into single digits if you drive at a brisk pace on the highway. Overall, though, with my daily usage, the efficiency hovered between 10kpl and 11kpl for the most part. What also helps conserve that little bit extra is the auto start/stop function, which works decently. Although it livens up the cabin, the ivory upholstery soils easily and is tough to keep clean. Other than the refined and fairly efficient powertrain, I also appreciated the feature-rich and well-appointed cabin. The light grey and ivory upholstery and the copper inserts and stitching work well together, though it was nearly impossible to keep the ivory bits clean given the intensive running our Creta did. And in typical Hyundai fashion, our top-spec SX(O) Creta had all the bells and whistles like a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone auto AC, cooled front seats, two screens, ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The high-res 360-degree camera and blind-spot monitor, in particular, proved their worth in the rainy season when visibility was poor. Even the Level 2 ADAS features worked well, and I liked using the adaptive cruise control on the highway. What’s also nice is that if you turn them off, they’ll remain off till you manually turn them back on. I even appreciated the Bose audio system, but passengers in the rear did feel like the volume was quite soft. Reclining backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows mean the rear seat is a comfy place. Speaking of the rear, it’s a great place to be. There’s enough room for three, and the pano roof and light upholstery make the cabin feel airy. And the reclinable backrest, sunshades, armrest and neck pillows seal the deal. However, not all is well, as the Creta does miss out on wireless smartphone integration, which is particularly annoying given that the smaller 8-inch screen in lower variants gets it. I also would’ve liked to have a sliding front armrest. The twin screens, while great to look at and easy to navigate, are set a little too low and don’t fall in your line of sight. And it doesn’t pack a heads-up display like the Kia Seltos, which would’ve alleviated this. It’s also not one for enthusiastic drivers, as handling can best be described as safe. Although there’s a noticeable body roll, the grip is ample, and overall, it feels predictable around bends. The ride quality is cushy at low speeds, but it feels jarring over sharp potholes, and large bumps tend to catch it out. There’s also some noticeable vertical movement at highway speeds, but this doesn’t feel uncomfortable like the Cretas of old. Full-LED headlamps offer great illumination and throw; the auto high beam function works well. Other things I liked in my time with the Creta were the LED headlights, which offer great illumination. The auto high beam function also worked well, meaning I didn’t have to constantly shift between high beam and low beam. It’s also nice that the Creta gets physical controls for the AC and some of the infotainment controls. I also managed to solve two things that were annoying me. The first one was that Android Auto was appearing only in a split screen, which was resolved by unchecking a box deep in the sub-menus of the system. The second was the lock/unlock beeps, which were done away with by long-pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the key simultaneously for a couple of seconds. I know we say this a lot, but this car will actually be missed a lot by all of us in the office. Given its strengths and how easy living with it has been, it’s not hard to see why the Creta continues to rule the midsize SUV segment.

    "description": "Fiat performance brand's first UK-bound SUV is also its most powerful car ever – but is it a true performance EV? What few attempts have been made to reimagine the classic hot hatch format for the electric age have so far been tepid at best, but is that now beginning to change?The acid-green Abarth 600e (other colours are available…) before is one of several new-for-2025 cars that suggest things are indeed changing.Car makers are waking up to the fact that adding an extra motor to an otherwise sedate EV and stiffening the chassis doesn’t automatically result in a rewarding B-road reprobate. They’ve clocked the fact that nobody is rushing to swap their Hyundai i20 N for a Volkswagen ID3 GTX.There’s something reassuring about the French having led the charge in the rehabilitation of a format that Brits have always loved.They’re time-honoured leaders in the field, and the new Alpine A290 does lift-off oversteer and costs a sensible-for-2025 amount, at around £33k.We like it. And the Italians are at it too, with the Abarth 600e, which is an electric hot-hatch conceived in a more traditional mould than you might be expecting.The Abarth 600e range at a glanceYou can have the 600e in one of two specifications: Turismo or Scorpionissima.The Turismo makes use of a 237bhp, front-mounted, separately excited electric motor developed in-house, with a 54kWh battery pack good for a range of 207 miles. The Scorpionissima is a special edition, of which 1949 examples will be made to recognise Abarth's founding year. It gets the 276bhp motor from the Alfa Romeo Junior Veloce, cutting the 0-62mph time from 6.2sec to 5.9sec.It also comes with the sound generator (designed to mimic the noise of a combustion engine) introduced on the Abarth 500e hot hatch.As it will be the best seller, the Turismo will be the focus of this review.On the outside, every car comes with 20in alloys and a more aggressive bodykit, while inside you get a 10.25in infotainment system, a 7.0in digital instrumentation display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a voice assistant with ChatGPT.Abarth’s own sat-nav system is standard on the Scorpionissima but optional on the Turismo.",

    "title": "Ferrari Purosangue",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ferrari/purosangue",
    "description": "It's more raised coupe than true SUV, so does this make the Ferrari Purosangue the market's best tall car to drive? I'm in Italy to drive the new Ferrari Purosangue SUV and the last time I came here to drive a Ferrari, the weather was fine, with temperatures into double figures, if a little overcast and dewy.There’s a reason why I mention this (I’m not auditioning to be the next Wincey Willis). Had it been Britain and on Autocar’s own tab, we’d have headed merrily directly down the pit lane – but sorry, said Ferrari’s people, it’s too cold for the tyres to work properly around the company’s Fiorano test track, so we’d have to wait and sip coffee until the day warmed through.So I talked to an engineer instead, and while I can’t guarantee he avoided using the phrase ‘SUV’, he told me the company had only committed to making a tall car when it was sure that it could be a true Ferrari (ditto the electric car that’s still two years away).That high car, though – the Ferrari SUV, 4x4 or crossover, as you prefer (they don’t use the terms but pretend not to be offended if you do) – is here now. And there’s no question of waiting until the roads have warmed up to test it or I’d be here until April. It’s mid-January as I drive, although not as you read. In fact, today we’ll go in search of the worst conditions that roads between Italian ski resorts can throw at us.Before driving the Purosangue I’m gently asked whether I’ve driven an Aston Martin DBX, a Lamborghini Urus or a Rolls-Royce Cullinan. But I’m assured – as each of those companies would also try to persuade me – that the model operates in a sphere of its own, with no direct rivals.They’re curious sorts of arguments, these. There may be a certain mechanical accuracy to the fact that each offering is unique, in the same way that a fish-and-chip supper isn’t strictly a direct rival to a curry. But the short of it is that when Friday evening comes around and you can’t be bothered to cook, it will be one or the other. That fires to a (relatively) muted idle in the car’s gentler driving modes, although it still sounds rich and expensive. At low speeds, the ride mooches gently, and while the steering is quick, with a 14:1 ratio similar to the GTC4’s, it doesn’t feel as nervous as that, nor any other recent front-engined V12 Ferrari.They’re always pointy and direct, and this is similarly accurate, with two turns between locks, but its initial response feels more measured. The cabin feels further forwards than those coupés/breadvans too, even though the engine is set well aft. And as a result, I feel like I’m located in the middle of the car, rather than over the back axle holding onto the reins of a flighty front end. There’s a natural feel to it all, even though active rear steer is one of a raft of standard technologies.There are more of those, most notable among them being the new Multimatic spool-valve dampers whose workings – and how they replace anti-roll bars. Lordy, they’re complicated, but they’re brilliant – able to resist the car’s pitch and roll as confidently as they do.They have three settings: soft, medium and (surprise) hard, and for my money, in all of them bump absorption is better than any car with 23in wheels and 30-section tyres has any right to be. This is largely a quiet, confident, mature car, more solid-feeling than any Ferrari I can remember. A sound cruiser, I’d think – although we’ll have to spend motorway time with it later.With that, though, body control is also tight. If the Purosangue were sufficiently light, the 48V suspension system would put enough force into itself to pitch into corners, rather than just roll less than expected.How much less than expected? The Purosangue isn’t that tall (at one point I follow a Citroën Berlingo and figure its driver and I are at about the same level), but the Ferrari’s body movements are tied down like I wouldn’t expect from even this modest elevation. It’s taut, controlled and agile for a car with an engine this size out the front, and with this kerb weight and this ground clearance. And boy, it’s fast. It has a very honest big-coupé vibe.I try to think of the car it reminds me of most and ultimately settle not on its 4x4 competitors from the Volkswagen Group or Rolls-Royce but an Aston Martin, although not the obvious one either. Instead, I imagine what an Aston Martin Rapide would have been like if it had been jacked up, not to full SUV levels but to those of cars that get Dakar, Allroad, Cross Country or Scout monikers.The similarities are there: aluminium chassis, front-mounted V12, transaxle, four seats, modest hatchback. The Ferrari bods are right: this isn’t an SUV, it’s a Rapide Allroad. It’s a GTC4 Cross Country or an FF DakarUltimately, its handling balance has that presence. There’s enough power here to overwhelm sticky rubber on a warm day (where it would do 0-62mph in 3.3sec and 193mph), so with winter tyres on glassy, frosty or truly snowy gravel tracks, it has a surplus of hoon.The Purosangue slides and skips and yumps with supreme ease and balance and then settles again with the deftness of a stage-ready rally car. It’s not an off-roader, and it’s not a 4x4, really. It can’t even tow anything. But as a way to have the V12 Ferrari experience in a relaxed setting without having to worry that you will crack four-grand’s worth of carbonfibre on a driveway ramp, look no further.Anow, no snow, it doesn’t matter: this car is a laugh. The DBX 707 is perhaps more flamboyantly keen to shout. The Cayenne Turbo GT is perhaps the only road-pummelling SUV that would equal the Purosangue for seriousness. And I still think this car will never be quite as cool as a GTC4. But this is a car Ferrari had to make, and while you excuse some car makers their SUVs because they let them make enough money to produce the sports cars we love, the Purosangue does for its maker what a lot of SUVs can’t for theirs: it actually feels like a Ferrari.",

    "description": "Plans for the Indian Superbike League have been announced and organisers aiming for the new series to debut in October 2025. The series will feature a grid of all-Indian riders, with an aim to give racers a platform where they can gain the necessary experience before stepping up to international racing. 1.    Five classes for pros and amateurs 2.    Races to be held at permanent tracks 3.    Ducati confirmed as one of the bike suppliers Indian Superbike League format The inaugural season of the Indian Superbike League will feature seven franchise-based teams. Each team will have five riders across different classes – Pro, Amateur, Female Riders and Rookie. Ducati has been confirmed as one of the bike suppliers for the league, which has been sanctioned by the FMSCI (Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India). Indian Superbike League Director Sirish Vissa revealed to Autocar India that the series is also looking at Indian manufacturers for some of the classes. Rider registrations are open online and the league says 400 riders have already signed up. The League will be working with existing riding academies in the country to select and sort the riders for the various classes. “They are used to working with riders, spotting talent, and so on. So, we are going to leverage their expertise to do some of this,” said Vissa. For the initial years, the series will feature a grid of only Indian riders. However, international riders and experts will be brought in to train not just riders, but also technicians and crew members. “There is palpable interest in two-wheelers across the country, especially in tier-II, tier-III cities. The Indian Superbike League will be a sustainable career path not just for racers, but for the whole ecosystem of motorcycle racing,” Vissa added. “We wish to create a framework that can take their interest, professionalise their ambitions, and lay out a pathway for them to move up the ladder and compete both nationally and internationally. We intend to promote not just local, but also marginalised talent in all aspects of racing. Our vision is to cultivate a cultural change in the ecosystem by supporting riders, improving technical knowhow, and elevating standards of Indian motorsports.” Indian Superbike League calendar Plans are in place for the league to make its debut in October 2025. For now, three rounds are planned in Chennai, Bengaluru and Pune. Further details regarding the exact venues will be announced in the future. But at least for the initial seasons, the league will only race on permanent tracks. So it is very likely that the debut round will be held at the Madras International Circuit.

In France, it was required until sixteen, but he got out early, walked into a trade school, and made a life out of something that felt natural. He had no desire to turn wrenches for unhappy customers. Bodywork was a slow-motion hell of sanding, priming, waiting, and repeating. The results were too far into the future. But upholstery, that was something else. It was immediate. It was hands-on. It was the kind of work where a set of dedicated hours could turn a mess into something finished, something precise, something beautiful. He started small, working on whatever came his way. Then a friend showed up with a 356. And another, becoming specialized before he even realized it. His wife asked him if he really thought there’d be enough of them left to keep going for twenty years. That was twenty-five years ago. What draws Jean to these cars isn’t just the shape or the nostalgia or even the materials he gets to work with. It is the simplicity. A Porsche 356 can be taken apart in a day. If you have the tools and the patience, you can strip it to a shell without specialized equipment or some super secret factory-only technique, or an expensive factory set of tools. The seats come out with a few bolts. The door panels pop off after a handful of screws. The headliner is a known process. It is stretched over bows and tensioned into place. It was a car made to be serviced, something that can’t be said for most sports cars built in the last few decades. Back when these interiors were first assembled, they were built to be used. Every stitch, every panel, every material choice was made with purpose. They were elegant but not indulgent, refined but never overdone. The first 356s were built in Gmünd, Austria, in a repurposed sawmill, and by the time production ramped up in Germany, the interiors were still an exercise in function over flair. Porsche outsourced much of the assembly, with coachbuilders like Reutter and Karmann handling the upholstery and bodywork. There was no hand-stitched leather, no excessive padding, no exotic materials. Seats were often covered in vinyl, with cloth or corduroy inserts. Everything was cut, sewn, and installed as quickly as possible, with patterns optimized for production, not perfection. Panels were backed with simple pressboard. Seams were glued and stapled in places unseen. A skilled German trimmer could knock out a full interior in a day. That’s what Jean is undoing, and then redoing every time he starts a new project. He pulls everything apart, studies the seams, notes where things held up and where they failed, then builds it all back again, piece by piece. He sources materials from Germany, cuts everything by hand, and stitches it together with the same attention to detail as the original craftsmen, except now there is more time to refine every piece.The patterns are the same, but the precision is more cared after. The materials are closer to what Porsche would have used if they had the time. Perhaps. The kind of people who bring their 356 to Jean-Philippe Duval understand this. They are not looking for restoration in the showroom sense. They want something that feels like it has always been there. No hard lines where new meets old. No traces of the work. Just an interior that fits the car’s story. When it is done, it looks like it never left.  Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. Continue...",
