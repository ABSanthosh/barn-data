    "description": "This 1967 Ford GT40 is one of 12 J-car chassis constructed by Kar Kraft in Detroit and is among two that were adapted for Group 7 competition with spyder bodywork after FIA prototype rule changes precluded Ford’s use of the Mark IV in international racing. Referred to as the G7A, chassis J-10 was sold as part of a two-car package in early 1969 to Charles and Kerry Agapiou, who campaigned it in Can-Am competition over the ensuing two seasons, during which it placed second in the Fuji 200 miles for its lone finish in 10 starts. Following a crash at the end of the 1970 season, the car was sent to England for repairs and was set aside for several years before being sold in 1989 to a Los Angeles real estate developer who initiated a conversion to a Mark IV-style configuration. It was then sold as an unfinished project in 1996 to its current owners, who completed a four-year refurbishment in 2017 before debuting the car at the 2018 Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance. Finished in a red livery replicating that of the 1967 Le Mans-winning GT40, the car is powered by a 427ci Ford FE V8 that breathes through twin Holley four-barrel carburetors and is mated to a Kar Kraft T-44 four-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, independent suspension with coilover shock absorbers, staggered-width 15” turbine-style center-lock magnesium alloy wheels, “bundle of snakes” exhaust headers, dual electric cooling fans, a steel roll cage, a driver’s seat upholstered in black cloth, and a dimpled passenger seat. J-10 is now offered on dealer consignment in Portland, Connecticut, with historical correspondence and a bill of sale.",

    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Rubber-mounted footpegs are new here. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "description": "MH 03 EL 6295 is wearing a few scars these days. Scars entirely of my making. Here’s the back story. To make space for a test Mercedes-AMG G 63 (yup, first-world problems!), I had to park the Creta N Line in an adjacent parking slot that’s alongside a pillar. Days later, when I got back to the Creta, I forgot how close it was to the pillar and reversed out as always with my eye on the rear view camera feed. Crrrunch. The left-wing mirror took the hit. The glass broke, but thankfully, the electronics (mirror adjust, camera and blind view indicator) survived. Phew! Because replacing the whole wing mirror would have cost a crazy Rs 32,000! All the ADAS features and electronics have made the humble wing mirror expensive. The Rs 1,000 replacement glass that I needed seems like a bargain in comparison. The mirror casing isn’t perfectly aligned, and resultantly, there’s a small blind spot in the blind view monitor. It’s not ideal, but I view it as a small reminder of the perils of being over-reliant on cameras. Lesson learnt. Objects in the mirror are pricier than they appear. Entire assembly costs Rs 32,000! Since the last report, the Creta N Line has been my ride for a few short excursions out of town. Particularly nice was a weekend in Alibaug over a spell of very pleasant weather. It was really refreshing to drive with all four windows down; the overworked dual-zone climate control and air purifier sure needed the day off. Speaking of windows, the fact that the rear windows go all the way down is something that has got a vote of approval from my drive-loving dog. This one feature is almost a make-or-break for him and is a detail I’ve learnt to be mindful of when reviewing a car. All members of the family need to enjoy the car, right? Also worth a mention are the Creta’s handy integrated rear window sunshades that my (human) passengers are prompted to put to use on sunny days. Two-zone climate control and ventilated seats work effectively against the heat. Not nice is the Creta’s fuel economy. The figure is hovering around the 7.9kpl mark in town, which makes our N Line a bit of a wallet buster. It rises to 12-14kpl over easygoing highway journeys, though. Anyone interested specifically in a Creta N Line should also know that its attractive 18-inch rims do come with compromises in ride comfort. You feel more of the surface below than you would on the standard Cretathat rides on 17 inchers. The pesky bolt-on speed bumps that have been spread like minefields in my housing complex make for a jarring start to my office commute. Single-digit fuel economy is the norm in town. Highway drives can up the number. I will be experimenting with some aftermarket solutions to enable wireless Apple CarPlay in the weeks to come, and I am also researching ways to get the N Line to sound throatier. Will keep you posted on my findings in the next report. Rear windows that roll down fully a hit with my dog. Sun shades a boon, too.

Just over a decade ago, industrial designer Chad Hodge designed and built a retro-inspired helmet as part of his final year thesis, with clear cues from vintage lids like the legendary 1960s Bell Star. Bell saw the concept, loved it, and brought Chad in-house to put it into production. The Bell Bullitt hit the market just as the alt-moto scene reached its zenith. It spread like wildfire—offering riders a premium lid with modern protection, vintage styling, and elegant finishes, and inspiring countless copycats along the way. These days, you can’t go on a group ride without spotting several Bell Bullitts in the crowd.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/roading-enthusiasts-should-be-screaming-lighter-batteries",
    "description": "A motor at each wheel enables super-heavyweight 4x4s like the Hummer to do amazing things off road The electric Mercedes-Benz G-Class I reviewed recently is an intriguing car. Tell me that loading your new 4x4 with four big blokes would take it over its gross vehicle weight and normally I’d tell you that I’d rather drive a 40-year-old Suzuki SJ 410 for the rest of my days than give it the time of day. And I do still think I have warmer feelings towards a small Suzuki. But give it time, think of it as a technical exercise and we will see where we end up. Because the idea of electrically powered 4x4s is not in itself a bad one. They should work well off road – indeed, better than a mechanically driven vehicle, because of the rapidity with which electrics and electronics can respond.  If a wheel on an ICE 4x4 is slipping, it can take a moment while slip sensors are triggered, brakes are applied or power is subdued. Time you would measure in milliseconds, it’s true, while, say, an engine spools down, but time that an electric motor directly driving a wheel doesn’t have to wait. Likewise if you want power applied right now and, better still, if you want it applied to perhaps one wheel now, two in a second, then one, then four and so on, an electrical system could be unbeatable in terms of keeping a car moving. There’s more, too. You may have seen cars encouraged to rock back and forth as they attempt to drive themselves out of ruts. Electric motors could do this on a whim. Big adventure motorcycles tend to have single- or twin-cylinder engines. There are a number of reasons for this, but one is that power pulses to the wheel – especially if the crank position of the two cylinders is offset, as it usually is. This is what gives big bikes the throbby power deliveries that is their characteristic. And in mud and sand, it can help keep a bike moving. Effectively it bobs its power to the ground, like a tug-of-war team in sync, rather than spinning it away like a smooth, four-cylinder power delivery would. And an electric motor can be told to do this – or anything else you want. Range, too, tends not to be a concern when you’re seriously off road. The efficiency of EVs is better at low speeds in general, because aerodynamic losses become negligible. It’s also rare to use all of the available power and it’s common to use regenerative braking. Plus, when you get where you’re going, you have a high-voltage battery to power your grille, chainsaw or mattress pump. The problem – and it’s a big one – is how much batteries weigh. Weight is the enemy of skipping over obstacles. And unlike on metalled roads, where it’s the quantity of really heavy traffic rather than the weight of some cars that breaks up surfaces, on loose ground it makes a big, big difference in how much it can tear up the ground. And if you think the Mercedes G580 is heavy, it’s not alone: other electric 4x4s are the same. The Tesla Cybertruck is around 3100kg at the kerb, the Ford F-150 Lightning similar and the GMC Hummer a gulpsome 4100kg. It’s an area where plug-in hybrid technology (sort of like in the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, although that car’s electric motor drives through its regular transmission) could have its day. But if there is a place in motordom where the use case is screaming for batteries to be lighter, it’s here. Farewell to a legend News that the Lexus LS has been canned in the UK had me scurrying to the classifieds, where there was just one original-series LS 400, a 1999 car in gold and beige inside, with some history, recent work, 180,000 miles under its wheels and even the old font on its T-reg numberplate.  It could have been mine for four grand. As I write, it’s still there and has been joined by another one, a year newer and with a very low mileage (60,000) but more than twice the price. I don’t know if either is a great example, but the LS 400 in principle feels like a really significant car to me. As much so as the original Honda NSX, appearing out of the blue to thrash some of the grand old names at their game.",

    "title": "How to open your own car museum",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/how-open-your-own-car-museum",
    "description": "There are more than 100 cars on display at County Classics Motor Museum One successful motor trader has opened up his car collection for the benefit of his home town. We pay a visit. So, you want to start a car museum. You will need some cars and a place to put them. You will also need deep pockets. Above all, you will need a vision and a cast-iron determination to achieve your goal. In short, you will need to be like Pat Hawkins. The 62-year-old has a light in his eyes that not even a brush with death could extinguish. It was six years ago. He had been rushed to hospital, suffering a rare heart condition. At the last moment, a specialist from Chicago agreed to operate. A few weeks later, as his strength returned, Hawkins vowed to give back to his home town of Taunton. He had just the idea… Since he was a boy, Hawkins had dreamed of owning his own garage, and by the age of 11 he had bought and sold his first car. At 15, Hawkins was apprenticed to a British Leyland dealer as a mechanic, and in the evenings he carried on trading. Three years later, Hawkins began dealing full time. By 21, he had bought the first of many garages. However, by the 1980s, the trade had begun to change: everyone wanted to be a dealer. So Hawkins started selling tyres, undercutting all of his rivals by importing them directly from Germany. By 39, he had 13 tyre depots – and then Tom Farmer, founder of Kwik Fit, rang. “He said he wanted to buy me out,” recalls Hawkins. “I was thinking about getting into property, so I sold out for £1 million.” It was the late 1990s, and at the same time as buying properties, Hawkins had started buying what he considered future classic cars: common and more rarefied motors, always immaculate and with solid service histories and low mileages. Come 2018 and, while Hawkins was recovering in hospital, the local council served him a compulsory purchase order on one of his plots of land. This visionary, this deal maker, this man who had come close to death was ready for them – and made an offer they couldn’t refuse. “My big idea to give something back to Taunton was to open a car museum in the centre of the town, and I knew just the place: a failing food store called County Stores that had been trading since 1832,” says Hawkins. “I told the council I wouldn’t make buying my land difficult if they would help facilitate my plans. They agreed.” That was the easy bit. The hard part was relieving the owners of their keys and then, with sleeves rolled up and talented tradespeople hired, refurbishing and converting the tired 23,500sq ft shop. That took a year, and by the time the museum was ready to be occupied, Hawkins had burned through £3.5m. Meanwhile, he was continuing to buy display cars from private sellers and at auctions. “All told, the cars have cost me around £2.5m,” he says. At last, in November 2023, County Classics Motor Museum was ready to open; The Grand Tour presenter Richard Hammond cut the red tape and the first visitors passed through the doors. Just as they did then, greeting today’s arrivals are more than 100 cars, most of them spanning the 1950s to the 1990s, and an equal number of motorcycles. An eclectic mix of the common, the rare, the beautiful and the fascinating, most of the cars are low-mileage and have just one previous owner, and all of them are in original condition. For a flavour of how diverse the collection is, it includes Ford Capris, probably the most rust-free Fiat X1/9 in the country, a Ford Mustang Mach 1, a Datsun 280ZX, a super-rare Nissan Cherry Europe GTi, a Porsche 911 3.2 SC, a 1961 Porsche 718 RS 61 Spyder, a genuine 1997 AC Cobra Superblower 5L, a pair of Ford Escort RS Turbo Series 1 Group A and Lancia Fulvia S1 rally cars, a Ford Racing Puma, a Peugeot 205 GTi 1.9, a Volkswagen Golf GTI Mk1, a rare Subaru XT 4WD Turbo and an Audi Quattro Turbo. All these plus a Jaguar E-Type, a Triumph Dolomite, a Morris Marina, a Mini Metro, a Toyota MR2 Mk1… “For most middle-age visitors, they’re the cars of their youth – although one 90-year-old gentleman was delighted to see our Austin Seven Special,” says Hawkins. To date, the museum has welcomed 45,000 visitors, one of them being Martin Read, who has driven up from Torquay. “I’m shocked by how much they have here,” he says. “I’m that impressed, I’ve bought an annual pass.” Hawkins is convinced that his museum will be a boon for Taunton. “We know people are making special journeys to come and then seeing the rest of the town,” he says. “The council had a good deal.” And so did car enthusiasts.",

    "description": "To underline the Skoda Kylaq’s image of being a fun-to-drive and performance-oriented alternative to the bevy of compact SUVs, the Czech company is planning to put together a racing series in India. Speaking to Autocar india on the sidelines of the Octavia RS drive in Croatia, Skoda Auto India brand director Petr Janeba, said, \"We want the series to be competitive, but still very reliable and accessible from costs, so that young drivers can train and get better.\" Skoda Kylaq Cup race car details The VW Group's 2.0-litre TSI engine will be used in the Kylaq Cup racer. The Kylaq currently on sale is powered by the VW Group’s 1.0-litre TSI engine that makes 115hp and 175Nm, and is based on the MQB A0 IN platform. However, the plans that are being drawn up are to have a custom-built Kylaq Cup race car using the MQB 37 platform, and powered by the VW Group's 2.0 TSI engine, used on the likes of the Skoda Octavia, Superb, Kodiaq and Volkswagen Tiguan. Under the hood of the latest Octavia RS, this unit puts out 265hp, but the Kylaq Cup race car would see power bumped a little north of 300hp and 450Nm of torque.  Naturally, the Kylaq Cup racer would feature other competition hardware such as roll-cage, larger brakes, a race suspension, and racing slicks.  Skoda India in motorsport Skoda isn’t exactly new to motorsports in India as its rally-prepped Fabia R5 has been available to privateers who want to participate in rallies. However, this would be the first time the brand directly organises a motorsport event in India – joining the likes of Maruti Suzuki and Volkswagen – and enters the track racing arena. Speaking of sister brand Volkswagen, the German brand had been directly involved in motorsports in India since 2010. It held the Polo Cup in that year and then went on to hold the Vento Cup in 2015, the Ameo Cup in 2017, and then it brought back the Polo Cup in 2020. However, Volkswagen Motorsport India operations were handed over to Rayo Racing in 2022, spelling the end of the German brand’s one-make racing series’. Incidentally, Skoda is celebrating 125 years of its motorsport history, and Janeba says this is a nice time, along with the brand's 25th anniversary in India, to introduce the Kylaq race car and the racing series. The plans for the Kylaq Cup are as yet in the initial stages, and no date has been set, with Jenba saying, \"I don't want to over promise that everything gets ready this year, but we would still strive to get some prototype cars done.\" Also see: Skoda Kylaq video review Skoda Kylaq waiting period extends up to 4 months F1 2025 car liveries revealed",

    "description": "Get ready to meet your hero cars! The Modern Classic Rally is back, and the 2025 edition will be held on March 1 and 2 at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai, in Kalina. The event will consist of a static display on Saturday, March 1, followed by a drive across Mumbai on Sunday, March 2, with over 80 of the most alluring modern classics expected to be in attendance. Be there! Modern Classic Rally 2025 tickets Tickets for the exclusive static display are available for the first time. This year’s event will also be special. For one, a whole raft of cars never seen on display are expected to descend at this landmark event. And, for the first time, enthusiasts and car lovers will be able to purchase a limited number of tickets to attend Saturday’s static display. Yes, sign up early by using the link below and you can join us for an unforgettable day of celebrating the cars that helped shape the golden age of motoring. What are modern classic cars? What makes modern classics so desirable is that they are true enthusiast cars. But what are modern classics? Simply put, a modern classic falls somewhere between a modern car and a traditional classic. Consisting of cars that are between 10 and 50 years old, modern classics also include younger cars that have left their mark in fields such as performance, styling or luxury.  Another way to look at modern classics is to view them as poster cars; the ones we’d put up on our walls. As cars today become increasingly more complex, with digital tech and automated systems turning them into bots, it’s the modern classics' analogue experience that is fast becoming more and more popular. And it’s not just popularity, modern classics are fast turning into the most valuable genre of cars worldwide, outpacing both traditional vintages and classic cars. The 2025 edition has sports cars, supercars, performance sedans, SUVs, limos, luxury cars, and more. This year’s rally will have everything from sports cars and supercars, to performance sedans, SUVs, limos and luxury cars. When asked what makes modern classics so special, Autocar India editor Hormazd Sorabjee explains that it is “the mechanical appeal and purity of design that makes them so utterly desirable. And they are also the perfect digital detox for car lovers in today’s world.” Curator Perseus Bandrawalla said, “Modern Classics are much more than a hobby – they are a way of life. Yes, they are about the iconic cars, sure, but they are also about communities and shared experiences. You don’t just buy into modern classic ownership, you also buy into a lifestyle.” Modern Classic Rally 2025 classes explained There are four classes for the 2025 event.   This year’s show has four classes. The first is imported cars made between the mid-sixties and 2004, and includes some cars assembled in India using kits. The second class has cars manufactured from January 2005 to December 2010. This class also has cars assembled in India using kits. The third class has luxury cars manufactured in India, including high performance models manufactured from January 2005 to December 2014. The final class – Contemporary Classics – are quintessentially collectible sports or luxury cars, which, though not classified by their age, are generally around five to seven years old. Can’t wait to see all the icons line up together and tell the story of the golden age of motoring. See you there.

    "link": "",
    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",

    "description": "The Breakers really shouldn’t exist. Not in its current artful form anyway. Built in 1896 as a wooden retreat for America’s elite, it was a beacon of wealth and exclusivity, until a kitchen fire consumed it in 1903.The owners rebuilt bigger, and grander, determined to make it even more opulent. But again in 1925, disaster struck, this time from something as trivial as an electric curling iron left on in a guest room. The flames ripped through the wooden structure, reducing it to embers once more.  Rather than admit defeat, the owners made sure it would never happen again. Inspired by the great Renaissance palaces of Italy, they rebuilt The Breakers in fire-proof stone, and marble. They wanted its legacy to last for generations.  That same spirit of preservation of legacy, reinvention, of perseverance, makes it the perfect stage for a sold out crowd Cavallino Classic, where Ferrari’s past and present meet in a curated display of mechanical art and automotive obsession.  Walking through the resort and then stepping out onto the 13th hole, it’s clear: this isn’t just another car show. The event was the biggest ever for organizers despite the layout itself reflecting a tight and quite exclusive capacity for cars. The lauded 250 GTO, of course stood commandingly, quietly, at the peak of the display.  The meticulously curated lineup of Ferrari’s greatest hits, F40s, Enzos, LaFerraris, formed the next tier, blue-chip collectibles that define generational milestones. Beyond that, the broader field of concours entrants stretched across the 13th green.  It’s easy to assume that Cavallino is just a playground for the ultra-rich, and it absolutely is, but that’s a lazy and pretty myopic take. Yes, these cars are enormously valuable. Yes, the event is very exclusive. But what stands out beyond the wealth, is the obsession. Talk to the attendees, and you realize just how deep the passion runs. These aren’t absentee collectors. They’re historians, archivists, curators of the Ferrari’s DNA. They don’t just know their car’s production numbers, they know who ordered it, and when. Where it’s been, how it was optioned, and what color thread was used in the interior stitching. Many of the participants care. Deeply. Cavallino isn’t just a concours; it’s a gathering of true believers. Dare to say, these are some absolutely ultimate car nerds. The Cavallino Classic isn’t just about \"owning\" a Ferrari. That’s why the judging process at at the event is taken so seriously. 70 out of 104 cars registered for judging this weekend achieved a 97 out of 100, earning them a best of show accolade.  Winning here isn’t just a physical trophy, it’s validation, and a stamp of approval from some of the most ruthless and knowledgeable judges on the planet. Ferrari historians, restorers, and experts are flown in from the U.S. and Europe, all working under the strict rules of the IAC/PFA, which, for the uninitiated, is the International Advisory Committee for the Preservation of the Ferrari Automobile. Basically, if you’re restoring a Ferrari and want it done right, these are the people you don’t want to disappoint. If they're happy. You're happy. Passing muster here adds weight to a car’s history, increases its value, and cements its place in Ferrari lore. A platinum award means that a panel of the world’s most discerning judges has picked your car apart and deemed it worthy.  In addition to well versed judges, Enzo Mattioli Ferrari, a direct descendant of the legendary Enzo Ferrari, partner and president of Cavallino Classic, and grandson of Piero Ferrari, attended the event. This added serious weight to not only the awards given, but the event itself.  “I strongly believe in the Cavallino project, and for this reason, I am excited to participate in its development and growth, not just with financial investment, but with strategic involvement,” said Enzo Mattioli Ferrari upon being named President of Cavallino. On display are cars both new and old. As of late, Ferrari’s latest hypercars, like the F80, the 12Cilindri, or even the Purosangue, don’t have that same immediate recognition outside the die-hard enthusiast circle as some of the legends of the past. Ferrari has leaned into hyper-exclusivity, and while that strengthens its brand prestige, it’s also pulling it further out of reach for the next generation. The F80, the current flagship is one of those cars. Batted about a bit in the media, it certainly doesn’t get justice it deserves. Photos don't do the trick. In person, it’s commanding, aggressive, a statement piece of design and engineering. But was it the standout of the councours? Maybe. Maybe not. It had a presence, no doubt. A modern Ferrari halo car always does, but was it the gravitational center of the event? People will wax on, telling you its not like the F40. “THAT was an instant icon” people usually opine. “Every kid with a bedroom wall had that poster! Something is missing.” Nostalgia is murky, and the truth is a little more nuanced. Upon its release in 1987, the Ferrari F40 received a mix of acclaim and criticism. It performed, but it was brutish, especially compared to its competition. It wasn’t yet on a pedestal. It had to earn it. And it would. Eventually. But it took decades to become the untouchable legend it is today. Whether the F80, or any other modern hypercar for that matter can achieve such heights is uncertain.    The Cavallino Classic is a crossroads, connecting Ferrari’s past, the stuff of legend, to whatever comes next. The show definitely captures Ferrari, and it's culture at a crucial point in time. Some of these cars will matter forever, some might never make it to the kind of legendary status we're used to seeing for some models. Right now, it is tough to know what’s to come, but at least we know the heritage is safe in the hands of everyone that came out to celebrate the legend that is Ferrari at Cavallino.

    "description": "The eighth generation Eldorado was a more than pleasant surprise to the public when it arrived in showrooms for the 1967 model year. As we covered previously, its fresh and angular exterior styling was quite unexpected from Cadillac. Especially so when one considered how staid and barge-like the Eldorado had become as it was reduced over generations into a trim rework of the DeVille (even if it was built by Fleetwood). Interior styling received a considerable update too, with minimal chrome, no wood paneling whatsoever, and a driver-focused cockpit which would become the hallmark of the personal luxury car. But as was de rigueur , General Motors set about messing with the Eldorado via various annual changes.",
