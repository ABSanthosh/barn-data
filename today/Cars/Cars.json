    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/ohlins-fork-springs-review",
    "description": "It’s common to see custom bikes with swanky high-end shocks propping up their tails. Swapping out the rear suspension on a twin-shock bike is quick and easy, and can have a big impact on both handling and style. But if you upgrade your rear suspension without upgrading your front suspension, you’re doing it wrong. There are myriad ways to beef up your bike’s front end, from full fork swaps to cartridge kits. But there’s a simpler way to eke the maximum performance out of your forks—like a simple Öhlins spring swap and oil change. The front forks on my air-cooled Triumph Bonneville are basic 41 mm right-side-up units with zero adjustability. According to the internet, their springs have a rate of around 7 N/mm, and their oil has a viscosity of between 5 W and 10 W.…",

    "description": "For the last few years, the modern custom motorcycle scene has presented major OEMs with a whole new market in which to peddle their wares. We’re all familiar with the process; release a new motorcycle, run an in-brand customization contest with it, and show off the results at a major event. Lather, rinse, repeat. These initiatives can produce predictably boring results. But they can also produce gems, like this honed Honda CL250 café racer from Turkey’s Bunker Custom Cycles. The bike was created as part of, you guessed it, a European Honda customization contest. The brief was to customize a Honda CL500, but Bunker was given a concession to use its little brother, the Honda CL250, instead. Available only in Japan and Turkey, the CL250 closely resembles to the CL500, but trades the latter’s parallel-twin engine for a 249 cc single-cylinder mill.…",

Showing only 21,401 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO I example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example is among the lowest mileage ones in the world. The Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO I was developed from DTM racing to challenge BMW in the German touring car championship. Built to meet Group A homologation requirements, it featured a Cosworth-tuned engine producing 202 hp, along with aerodynamic upgrades like a rear spoiler and wider fender flares for improved downforce and handling. With a revised suspension for racing demands, the EVO I set the stage for Mercedes’ later dominance in DTM and paved the way for the more aggressive EVO II. Both models reflect the close link between motorsport and street-legal performance cars.   Continue...",

    "description": "This 1957 Dual-Ghia is the fifth of approximately 115 convertible examples produced in collaboration between Italian coachbuilder Ghia and Dual Motors Corporation of Detroit, Michigan. Chassis 105 was constructed for Esther Jacobson of the Detroit-based Jacobson’s Department Store family and was purchased by the current owner in the late 2000s. A subsequent multiyear refurbishment was reportedly completed by White Hall Restorations of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, in 2014. The car is finished in green over matching two-tone leather upholstery, and power is provided by a 315ci Dodge Poly-head V8 paired with a two-speed PowerFlite automatic transmission. Features include power-assisted drum brakes, power steering, 15″ chrome wire wheels, a green convertible top, front bucket seats, and power windows. Following completion of the refurbishment, the car won First in Class and Best in Show at the 2014 Hemmings Motor News Concours d’Elegence followed by various other concours awards through the 2010s. This Dual-Ghia was previously listed on BaT in June 2023 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Saint Louis, Missouri, with a clean Florida title in the owner’s name.",

    "description": "The best way to haul people and cargo is still with an MPV. These are the best ones currently on sale Multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) are some of the most versatile vehicles out there, majoring in space, practicality and people carrying.  Thanks to an extremely efficient use of space, they usually offer more value than vehicles with a similar footprint. They also tend to be packed with surprise-and-delight features that take the stress out of transporting families. Traditionally MPVs are seen as seven-seaters, but the sector also includes five-seat models, and some even go up to nine seats. That's perfect for those who never need to carry extra passengers but do want the space and thoughtful design. With SUVs continuing to surge ahead in the sales charts, though, the number of people carriers on sale in the UK is dropping. We've lost the Ford S-Max, Ford Galaxy and Volkswagen Sharan in the past few years, but don't worry: the MPV hasn’t slipped into obscurity just yet. Increasingly, the class is seeing the arrival of van-based models, their boxy bodies and no-nonsense engineering making them the ultimate utilitarian family holdalls. Our top MPV pick is the Dacia Jogger, which offers by far the best value for money and supreme practicality, but which other models should you consider buying?

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-honda-prelude-could-feature-manual-gearbox",
    "description": "New Prelude will be based on the Civic, serving as a halo for Honda's electrified technologies Revived sports coupé, which will use a hybrid powertrain, is spotted testing in Germany ahead of 2026 launch The new Honda Prelude has been spied testing for the first time – while the hybrid sports coupé's project leader has refused to rule out that it could offer a manual-style transmission. Honda will revive the long-running model after a gap of more than 20 years, with the new version due to go on sale in 2026. It's based on the Civic and is set to serve as a halo product for the Japanese manufacturer's electrified technologies, using a 2.0-litre hybrid powertrain. Already revealed as a show car, the Prelude has now been spied testing in the German countryside. Although it's covered in a camouflage wrap, it's clear that the styling of the show car will be carried through to production. While Honda has been coy on technical details about the Prelude, there have been reports in the Japanese and Australian media that in order to meet the car’s sporty brief, it's planning to fit a manual gearbox – or at least a system that replicates a manual. Project lead Tomoyuki Yamagami said that “the joy of driving is a top priority for us\" and \"when you're in charge of developing the Prelude, you understand everyone has a lot of expectations of a coupé\". Asked by Autocar about the manual gearbox reports, he said: “It’s very hard to answer that. Let me say that I own three cars and two of them have a manual transmission: one is an Accord Type R, the other a 997 [Porsche 911], because I'm a big fan of manuals. “I really love manual vehicles, and I can only say that it would be something I’d like [for the Prelude]. With a manual transmission, it would be a very fun vehicle to be with.” Honda has previously offered a manual gearbox on Civic and Insight hybrids, but it would be complex to install on the firm's current e:HEV hybrid system. Instead of having the petrol engine driving the wheels while being assisted by a small electric motor, this uses only the motor for propulsion, with the engine acting as a generator to charge the battery. This removes the need for traditional gearing, so it’s likely that any manual-style transmission offered on the Prelude would be a simulated one, similar to that offered on the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N EV.",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/skoda-kylaq-prototype-review-meet-the-sub-rs-10-lakh-skoda-suv-433219#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Measuring just under four metres in length, the Skoda Kylaq is the Czech carmaker’s smallest SUV yet and has been conceived with the express intent to woo compact SUV buyers. There’s big rewards for the effort because the compact SUV segment is the fastest growing in the Indian market, making up 30 percent by volume. The Kylaq, in effect, opens Skoda to a whole new buyer base that’s already spoilt for choice with models like the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet. The Kylaq’s job is to deliver everything we like about Skodas in a compact and more affordable package. A caveat first. What you see here is a pre-production model that we’ve experienced at the CoASTT race track in Coimbatore, which explains why it’s covered up on the inside and outside. Skoda doesn’t want you or us to see its baby SUV just as yet. Skoda hasn’t revealed all facts and figures either, so this brief review might come across as sketchy in places. The primary goal of the drive was for Skoda to get feedback on the engine, gearbox and suspension before its signed off for production. Skoda Kylaq name and design First things first, the Kylaq name. Skoda ran a contest across India inviting entries for the name of its new compact SUV. Of the two lakh entries and 20,000 unique names received, Kylaq was selected. Kylaq derives its name from Mount Kailash, which, in Sanskrit, translates to crystal – something the Czech Republic is known for. Onto the way it looks. Even under the garb, it's easy to identify this as a Skoda. There are clean lines all around and frontal lighting will be a clear point of distinction compared to the Kushaq. The Kylaq sports a split headlamp setup with an LED Daytime Running Light arrangement up top and LED projector headlamps lower down. The Skoda grille sits proud on the fascia and lends the front end an imposing look. It's from the sides that you can tell the Kylaq's a sub-4-metre car. Overall length is 3,995mm while the wheelbase measures 2,566mm. For reference, a Kushaq has a 2,651mm wheelbase, so a lot of the length reduction has actually come from between the wheels. Even so, the Kylaq's wheelbase is second only to the Mahindra XUV 3XO in the segment, and that does come with the promise of a good amount of space at the back. The other number of interest is the 189mm ground clearance. It's sufficient, but down on the Tata Nexon's class-best 208mm. Talking specific details at the sides, the Kylaq runs on 17-inch rims and running my hand on the stickering suggests simpler surfacing than what we’ve seen on the Kushaq. Chunky door handles make a good point of contact and I’m happy to report that the solid thunk we’ve come to associate with Skoda's doors has been retained. A chunky C-pillar lends solidity to the design, but what is a clear distinction to the Kushaq are the tail-lamps. The lights are smaller but their squared-out effect works with the clean styling theme. Of the other things, the tailgate is wide and extends fairly low, so loading/unloading luggage should be convenient. Skoda insiders hint that luggage space could be best-in-class, but that's something we'll know only once its final homologated figures are out. Skoda Kylaq interior, features and safety My lips are sealed on the matter of space at the back and, sadly, I can’t tell you much about the rest of the interior either. It was covered in different kinds of materials to hide it from view. But what I can tell you is that the Skoda Kylaq will not only come with ventilation for both seats but also a first-in-class power adjust for both front seats. Under the skin, the Kylaq is closely related to the Kushaq. It's built on the same MQB A0 IN platform and that’s a good thing because the platform has been tested for the highest safety standards. The Kushaq and Slavia, if you recall, are both 5-star Global NCAP-rated cars and Skoda is aiming for that with the Kylaq as well. As standard, the Kylaq will get six airbags, ABS, ESC as well as ISOFIX child seat mounts for the rear seats. Skoda Kylaq engine and performance On to the heart of the matter. The Skoda Kylaq will be a petrol-only model and will be offered with the familiar 1.0 TSI engine from the Volkswagen Group. This three-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo petrol makes 115hp and 178Nm, which are pretty good figures for this class of car. We know the engine from the Skoda Kushaq and Slavia, and the Volkswagen Polo, Taigun and Virtus. And as on its other applications, it’s a very likeable unit here too. It’s an engine with a good degree of fun built into it. The mid-range is punchy and you can also rev the engine happily and heartily. The engine does get thrummy but never obtrusively so. Performance in town and at low speeds is something we can comment on only when we get the Kylaq outside the confines of a racetrack. The Kylaq will be available with two gearboxes. The standard fit 6-speed manual is sporty but I did find clutch travel to be a bit long. For those who don’t want the bother of a clutch altogether, there will be the option of a 6-speed torque converter automatic. It’s a nice gearbox and you can have fun with manual gearshifts via the gear selector too. Skoda Kylaq ride and handling Skoda’s choice of a race track as the venue (pun not intended) for the Kylaq drive might seem unusual, but it did pay off to highlight one of the SUV’s strengths – handling. The Kylaq will be a compact SUV of interest for those who enjoy driving. It’s smooth around the corners, holds triple-digit speeds with confidence and feels maneuverable even in tight turns (we also drove on a go-kart track). It’s got a more measured steering and the setup feels softer than the Kushaq (especially at the back). Overall though, it's more predictable and novice-friendly. In fact, the grip and poise only highlighted the chassis’ competence to accept a more powerful engine. Skoda, maybe a Kylaq RS with the 150hp, 1.5 TSI engine should be added to the to-do list. Of the other takeaways from the track experience was that the Kylaq drives like a proper VW Group car. It feels stable and surefooted at all times. Simulating a panic stop from 80kph also revealed that the Kylaq remains composed and can track true to its intended line. An area where the Kylaq improves on the Kushaq is ride comfort. On a broken stretch of road on the race track’s periphery, the Kylaq felt more absorbent than a Kushaq would. There’s less of the surface that makes it inside, addressing one of the complaints we’ve had on the Kushaq. Skoda Kylaq fuel economy, expected pricing and launch timeline There's no word on fuel economy for the moment and prices will also be revealed only at the Kylaq's launch in 2025. However, Skoda has hinted at a competitive price tag within this segment. Our estimate is that the Kylaq range will start around Rs 8.5 lakh (ex-showroom) with the fully loaded automatic versions coming in around Rs 14.5 lakh. At these prices, the Kylaq will not only go head-to-head with other compact SUVs but also eat into the Kushaq 1.0 TSI's sales. Pricing aside, Skoda says total cost of ownership, which includes service and maintenance costs, will also be competitive. The Skoda Kylaq will be revealed in full on November 6, 2024 and will go on sale between January and March 2025. It’s still some time from production so what we see might not be what we get. Sure, styling will not change but some tweaks to the suspension, engine and gearbox could be expected. But, first impressions are very positive. This could be a model that really brings the numbers to Skoda and takes the competition to established players in the compact SUV segment. My suggestion? Don't buy your next compact SUV without giving the Kylaq a shot. Also see: Skoda Kylaq prototype video review Skoda Kylaq image gallery",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-comparison-reviews/bsa-gold-star-650-vs-royal-enfield-interceptor-650-comparison-review-433196#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Here are two modern retro motorcycles that carry a British badge and a sizeable chunk of motorcycling history behind their names. At first glance, these two bikes seem relatively identical since they have similar designs, performance, engine capacity, weight and price. However, the difference is more apparent when these two are ridden back to back. BSA’s Gold Star is the new kid on the block and has no direct rival apart from Royal Enfield’s Interceptor 650. Both these motorcycles approach the same goal in a different manner, which delivers a very different riding experience overall. We’re here to tell you what those differences are and how these two stack up in the real world. Flamboyance \u0026 Flair Given their retro credentials, both motorcycles take a rather minimalist approach to their throwback aesthetics. There is abundant use of chrome, and while looks are subjective, I found myself gravitating a little more towards the Gold Star. Both motorcycles get a round headlamp, flat seats and a well-shaped fuel tank. They are available in multiple colours, depending on which the price can vary. Classy retro dials fit the aesthetic, but the tiny screens are hard to read. The feature list, too, is relatively minimal, and while the Interceptor 650 now gets an LED headlamp that outperforms the simple halogen setup on the Gold Star, BSA’s approach seems a tad more authentic, given the overall aesthetic. On the flip side, both motorcycles get analogue-styled dials, but I quite like the amber backlight on the Gold Star. However, there is no denying that the Interceptor 650’s dials are more readable and that the LCD screen has better visibility. The Gold Star is equipped with a Type-A and Type-C charging socket, while the Interceptor 650 gets a USB port that’s hidden away. Royal Enfield has also equipped the Interceptor with a set of adjustable levers – a welcome addition. While the 650 has more expensive-feeling switchgear with aluminium housings, the Gold Star’s conventional switches are more straightforward to use. In terms of build quality, both motorcycles lack the premium touch and feel like they’re built on a budget. That said, the Gold Star is by far the best offering to come out of Classic Legends’ stable despite having areas that could use improvement. Early signs of rust and  a loose-fitting side panel did seem concerning, but the brand says it is working on improving its overall quality. The Interceptor 650, too, has some signs of rust, but overall, it feels like the better-built machine in this comparison. Interceptor’s clocks are simpler, but the larger digital display is more legible. It is worth mentioning that the Gold Star does not come with a main stand as standard, and BSA – for now – doesn’t offer one as an accessory either. RE’s footpeg placement is a well-known issue. The Interceptor 650 is not only equipped with a main stand but also has a higher ground clearance. My issue with this RE is with its footpegs, which tend to jut out and come in the way while you ‘walk’ the motorcycle in traffic. While this issue is less bothersome for taller riders, shorter ones will find it more tedious. In the saddle The Gold Star’s riding position feels more natural and less aggressive in comparison. You get a slightly more upright seating posture and a more relaxed footpeg position. Coupled with a soft seat and a 780mm seat height, this is more approachable for shorter riders, but someone over 6 feet may find the leg space to be a bit cramped. Rishaad did wish for a slightly firmer seat, which is an easy fix in comparison to the Interceptor 650’s shortcomings. Gold Star has a wider seat with softer padding. Royal Enfield has built the Interceptor 650 with slightly more sportier ergonomics. It’s noticeable from the moment you swing your leg over its taller and narrower seat, and you’ll notice a more forward lean as you reach for the handlebar. Its footpegs, too, are slightly higher, and the narrow seat does rob it of some comfort as it puts more pressure on your tail bones and causes saddle soreness sooner than you’d expect. Royal Enfield does sell a more comfortable accessory, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem – only makes it slightly more bearable. Seat is well cushioned but uncomfortably narrow. Take aim, fire! The BSA Gold Star’s single-cylinder engine is one of the largest in its class and traces its roots back to the Rotax engine used in the BMW Funduro F650. This motor packs a healthy low- to mid-range performance, builds power from as low as 2,500rpm, and does so linearly. Despite the single-cylinder unit, BSA has done a commendable job of keeping the vibrations in check. Though it is short on one gear, the Gold Star’s engine and gearbox combination work well in tandem and will rarely ever leave you wanting that extra gear. That said, I have a few gripes with this motor, starting with its low-speed throttle response, which can sometimes feel too snatchy. We faced low-speed stalling issues with both motorcycles, but the Gold Star stalled more frequently. Underdamped rear shocks are the main complaint. The Interceptor 650, on the other hand, felt a lot smoother thanks to its extra cylinder and had a more pleasant sound to its exhaust. RE’s 650cc motor will happily cruise in higher gears at lower speeds, and the tractable motor will even reward you with a soothing note each time you downshift, but it is no match for the BSA’s mid-range punch. It felt like the more engaging motor, regardless of the speed or riding style I took up. Our numbers reveal that the Gold Star is the quicker motorcycle of the two. Not only did the Gold Star have better acceleration figures, but it also showcased quicker in-gear acceleration. It is also worth noting that we tested the BSA in the wet, which means we could expect even better numbers with dry tarmac. Interceptor’s suspension setup does a better job. Fuel economy is where the Interceptor 650 shines with a larger fuel tank, longer range and better city and highway efficiency. Its engine also handles high-speed touring better, with a calmer demeanour at higher RPMs. However, in city traffic, the BSA is more accessible to ride due to its more relaxed riding position and lighter clutch. Neither engine had a heating issue in bumper-to-bumper traffic and kept their cool in tight jams.  It’s about to get bumpy   In terms of weight, both motorcycles have a mere 5kg variance, but the difference feels higher, and the Interceptor comes across as a heavier, more cumbersome machine. The Gold Star is nimble at low speeds and showcases capable handling around flat, well-paved corners. However, its underdamped rear suspension is its biggest flaw and renders the ride and handling a bit too wallowy around most bumpy roads. It can take getting used to, but it does hamper the overall day-to-day experience with this motorcycle. On the flip side, the Gold Star’s Pirelli tyres and Brembo brakes do a fantastic job of providing stopping power, and the lever packs a decent amount of feedback. All in all, the bike rides well, but it deserves better rear suspension.  RE’s brakes and tyres aren’t as good as the BSA’s. While not exceptional, the Interceptor 650’s suspension has been improved over time and feels more balanced than the BSA’s. However, its brakes and tyres could use some improvement. Regarding handling, the Interceptor feels more capable with higher lean angles, but it takes more work to manage at low speeds in heavy traffic. BSA’s fit and finish can be improved. Old but gold Price isn’t likely to be the deciding factor, as both bikes are similarly priced. The actual choice comes down to the experience you’re looking for. The BSA Gold Star offers a more authentic retro experience with a delightful torque-driven engine. It’s more comfortable, easier to manage in the city, and can be fun around well-paved corners. Although it falls short on one cylinder and the lower refinement that comes with it, it makes up for it with its engaging power delivery and solid braking performance. It is our choice when it comes to a modern, classic riding experience. However, Classic Legends must prove its long-term reliability. And while the quality levels on its bikes have improved over time, there is still some way to go. BSA’s brake and tyre combo works surprisingly well. The Royal Enfield has a gem of an engine, and if you want a twin-cylinder experience, it has to be the RE. What also works in its favour is RE’s extensive service network and its vast accessory list. So, while we enjoyed riding the BSA more, the Interceptor 650 might be the safer bet for some people. Also See: BSA Gold Star 650 vs Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 comparison video",

    "description": "It’s been nearly a year since I got my hands on RS Taichi’s waterproof backpack, which is available in five colours and a unique Resident Evil edition. I’ve gone for the plain black shade due to its stealthy look and was quite eager to see just how usable this bag would be during monsoon. The WP backpack’s construction mainly comprises polyester and thermoplastic polyurethane. The bag consists of a primary 25-litre waterproof compartment, a smaller compartment located near the primary compartment’s opening and an external quick-access pocket that isn’t waterproof. Main compartment holds 25L. The bag uses a roll-up top system to seal the main compartment and can be adjusted based on how full it gets. It’s easy to use and even includes a Velcro strap to keep it tightly sealed. Its 25-litre storage is a boon for when I’m travelling, and over time, I’ve fit huge items in this compartment, including Rishaad’s fully packed Kriega R25 backpack! Secondary compartment is handy storage for small items The secondary compartment is only water-resistant, even though it uses the same opening as the main compartment. It can be used for smaller items, such as a pair of gloves, balaclavas and cleaning cloths. The third external pocket is mainly designed for items you’d like to keep handy that aren’t fazed by the rain, like a set of keys. Outer pocket is not waterproof. This bag gets a chest harness and a waist belt; both of these can be further adjusted to your size and do a good job of preventing the straps from slipping off the shoulders and distributing luggage weight evenly, especially when on the bike. Chest harness divides the load and provides a better fit. The overall fit, finish and feel of this bag are premium, and it feels built to last. However, after all this time, I did lose the rubberised end on the zipper pull tab located on the external pocket. Honestly, this is quite a minor issue and can be easily replaced. I’ve had absolutely no complaints with this bag otherwise. It’s been quite handy and dependable through my daily commute during peak Mumbai monsoon. Waist harness helps keep the bag secure while riding. Given that this bag is waterproof, you are prone to wearing it outside your protective rain gear, which can make it susceptible to dirt and grime being flung on it by the rear wheel. In such cases, a quick wipe-down with a wet cloth helps, and fortunately, the bag doesn’t stain permanently. This bag is currently available on special order at 6kiom.com and will cost approximately Rs 15,000. Velcro strap help seat the two main compartments well. I managed to buy it for far less overseas, and you may also have to wait anywhere from one to four months for it to be delivered. Just like most imported products, the RS Taichi WP backpack comes at a price, but it gives you good quality and performance in return. Also see: Ixon Dirt Air gloves review",

    "description": "Kia has confirmed it will take the wraps off its long-awaited Tasman pickup truck on October 29 at the Jeddah International Motor Show in Saudi Arabia. The Tasman will be Kia’s answer to popular models such as the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger and Volkswagen Amarok. The company has also released new teasers previewing the vehicle in production-ready form. Kia Tasman is likely to sit on a ladder-frame platform It will come with a 2.2-litre turbo-diesel engine Expected to go on sale in Australia first The latest teasers confirm a squarish-looking pickup with a boxy silhouette, rounded edges and an upright nose. The front fenders are pronounced, and the headlamps are stacked vertically, like in other Kia models such as the Carnival MPV. There’s also a horn-like trim piece above the grille connecting the bumper with the hood. The Tasman has a dual-cab setup and a standard bed that will be similar in size to its rivals, the Ranger and Hilux. Its ground clearance seems to be competitive as well. While it is not yet clear, the Tasman will most likely sit on a ladder-frame architecture that used to underpin the now-discontinued full-size Mohave SUV. It will have off-road gear, but it remains to be seen what type of setup Kia goes with.  As for the engine, the Tasman will pack a 2.2-litre, 199hp, four-cylinder turbo-diesel unit that’s seen in some other Kia models. There are talks of a larger, 3.0-litre V6 turbo-diesel as well, which may be offered at a later stage. Upon debut, the Tasman will initially go on sale in Australia, followed by markets such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South Korea, and some African countries. For India, Kia recently launched the new Carnival and the EV9, and it will introduce the Syros SUV, the Carens facelift and the Carens EV next year.
