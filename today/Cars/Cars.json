The Avant is an institution at Audi, to the extent that it’s launching its latest Audi A6 as an estate first, with the saloon to follow later on.Globally, just over half of A6s are specified as a saloon, but in Europe, the estate dominates. Even so, its role has changed over the past five decades of A6 and 100 production.Today, buyers after a large, practical family car are more likely to pick an SUV, such as the Q5 or Q7. That leaves the A6 free to become more of a lifestyle product, one that puts more emphasis on style and driving dynamics.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/smart-5-brabus-637bhp-suv-range-rover-sport-sv-pace",
    "description": "Electric SUV is described as the \"pinnacle\" of the Geely-owned brand; will arrive late this year German tuner Brabus has got it hands on the new Smart #5 SUV, pumping it with 637bhp and giving it the acceleration to match a Range Rover Sport SV. The flagship variant of the largest car Smart has ever produced is described as the “pinnacle” of the Geely-owned brand.  It stands out from the standard #5 with a small front diffuser, 21in alloy wheels, a matt paintjob, red accents, red brake callipers and an assortment of Brabus branding. Inside, it features an Alcantara steering wheel, heated front and rear seats and a dashboard dominated by dual 13in OLED screens. The car also gets a Brabus mode that remaps the throttle to increase power delivery and introduces artificial engines noise into the cabin - like in the #1 Brabus and #3 Brabus. Like those sibling cars, the #5 Brabus also gets a Launch Mode, which here primes the SUV for 3.8sec 0-62mph sprint.  The #5 Brabus draws power from the same 100kWh battery as the top-spec standard #5, which here is capable of a 335-mile range (down 31 miles). Utilising a 800V electrical architecture from the Geely SEA2 platform, the #5 Brabus can charge at speeds of up to 400kW via a DC connection. This allows for a 10-80% (or 235-mile) top-up in 18 minutes. The electric car will arrive in the UK from October along with the rest of the #5 model range. This opens with the Pro, which couples a 76kWh battery with a single electric motor for around £40,000. Pricing for the #5 Brabus is therefore likely to begin above £50,000.",

    "description": "Lighter, faster, and meaner – the Maserati GT2 Stradale is the MC20 at its most unhinged. This isn’t just a track-focused special; it’s a full-throttle, no-compromise statement from Maserati. Developed from the GT2 race car but adapted for road use, the Stradale is sharper, more powerful and even more thrilling to drive. The pit lane at Yas Marina hums with quiet anticipation. Parked in front of me, the Maserati GT2 Stradale squats low and wide, every bit the hardcore track weapon it promises to be. Stripped of excess weight and dialled up on downforce with underbody diffusers and a massive rear wing, the GT2 Stradale is primed for battle. So am I. Maserati GT2 Stradale exterior design Optimised for weight saving and downforce One look at the GT2 Stradale, and its intentions are clear. The towering adjustable rear wing alone generates up to 500kg of downforce at speed, keeping the car pinned to the tarmac. Up front, larger air intakes and a reworked splitter ensure maximum cooling and stability. Carbon fibre isn’t just for show – it’s used extensively for weight savings and structural rigidity. Rear wing produces 500kg of downforce.   Maserati GT2 Stradale performance and handling Drop into the tight bucket seat, strap yourself in, and hit the starter button. The Nettuno V6 ignites with a bark – raw, visceral and unfiltered, in a way the standard MC20 never quite was. This is the GT2 Stradale’s truest form, road-legal in the most technical sense but spiritually bound to the circuit. Powered by 640hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine At its core sits Maserati’s spectacular 3.0-litre twin-turbo Nettuno V6, now massaged to 640hp – up from the MC20’s 621hp. And it’s lighter, too. The GT2 Stradale was put on a diet, shedding 59kg to tip the scales at just 1,365kg. The result? A blistering 0-100kph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 324kph. Neatly styled air intakes to cool the Nettuno V6 engine.   Razor-sharp responses and gear shifts Out of the pit lane, I squeeze the throttle, and it’s immediately obvious how hyper-reactive this track-focused Maserati is. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response, and the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox rifles through ratios with millisecond precision. Every shift feels instantaneous, and every prod of the throttle pedal is met with a precisely metered surge of power. Braking into Turn 5, the carbon ceramics clamp down with brutal efficiency, hauling the car down from triple-digit speeds in an instant. The front end has the sharp bite of a Rottweiler clinging to the tarmac, beautifully complemented by steering that’s loaded with feedback. Maserati’s engineers have widened the track, stiffened the suspension and fine-tuned the aerodynamics for maximum downforce. The result? A car that feels surgically precise yet alive with every twitch of the wheel. Tight and snug bucket seats are essential for coping with high g-forces. On slower corners, you can provoke the rear into a controlled slide, but it never feels nervous. It’s playful yet poised, letting you dance at the limit without ever making you feel like you’re about to overstep. Nettuno V6 has a raw, mechanical sound Maserati has always been about the soundtrack, and while the GT2 Stradale’s V6 lacks the operatic wail of a naturally aspirated V8, it has a raw, mechanical ferocity that suits its persona. Opt for the titanium exhaust (track use only), and it snarls like a proper race car, spitting and crackling on downshifts. Throttle sensitivity is razor-sharp; though, below 3,000rpm, there’s a hint of turbo lag. But once the boost comes in, acceleration is relentless. It’s not the outright fastest in its class – the Ferrari 296 is quicker – but the GT2 Stradale delivers a deeply immersive experience. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response. Within a lap, I’m comfortable with this car, which eggs you on to push harder and harder. By the time I roll back into the pits, my pulse is racing, my hands tingling. This isn’t just another track-focused supercar. This is Maserati rediscovering its soul. Some bits of practicality Despite its hardcore underpinnings, the GT2 Stradale hasn’t completely abandoned road manners. A nose-lift system raises the front by 1.4 inches – critical for avoiding the heartbreak of scraping that carbon splitter. There’s even a 100-litre boot, but let’s be honest, practicality isn’t why you buy this car. Maserati GT2 Stradale interior Every detail focused for driving Inside, it’s all business. Alcantara dominates the dashboard to minimise glare, while the carbon-fibre bucket seats are available in two sizes. They grip you tight – brilliant for the track but a reminder that this isn’t a car for long-haul comfort. Shift lights on the steering wheel, a relocated drive-mode selector – every detail is designed for pure driving focus. No skimping in the cockpit, which is covered in Alcantara. Where the GT2 Stradale stands apart is in the design. Maserati has always had a way of making even its most extreme cars look effortlessly elegant. Unlike Ferrari’s aggressive, function-first approach to aero, the Stradale retains a sense of Italian artistry. Maserati GT2 Stradale verdict Not an everyday supercar Scissor doors are an integral part of the GT2 Stradale’s visual drama. The GT2 Stradale is an exquisite blend of race-car aggression and road-going grace. It’s not an everyday supercar – far from it – but for those lucky enough to get behind the wheel, it delivers a raw, unfiltered driving experience few cars can match. Production is limited to 914 units, a nod to Maserati’s founding year, 1914. Pricing remains under wraps, but with this level of exclusivity and performance, expect it to command a hefty premium over the MC20. For the driving purist, this is as close to a road-legal race car as Maserati has ever built. And it’s utterly magnificent.   Also See: Aston Martin Vantage India review: split personality New BMW M5 track drive: Heavyweight champ",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "description": "The fabled Tonti frame has formed the backbone of countless Moto Guzzi motorcycles over the years—but some of them wore it better than others. Classics like the Le Mans, V7 Sport, and 850 T3 California are iconic. The 1985 Moto Guzzi SP3 1000? Not quite. Although the SP3 ticks all the right boxes for a classic Moto Guzzi tourer, it misses the mark, visually.

    "description": "After Toyota updated the Urban Cruiser Hyryder with new features and a new variant, Maruti Suzuki has also rolled out similar updates for the Grand Vitara SUV. For 2025, the Maruti Grand Vitara has been updated with a new strong hybrid variant, more features across the board, 6 airbags as standard and an automatic transmission option for the AWD variants. Prices for the 2025 Grand Vitara start from Rs 11.42 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). Grand Vitara now gets 6 airbags as standard Panoramic sunroof is now an optional extra on mid and top trims Strong hybrid powertrain made more accessible with the new Delta+ trim 2025 Maruti Grand Vitara variant rejig Strong-hybrid powertrain made more accessible Maruti has introduced a new Delta+ trim for the strong hybrid powertrain, making it a little more accessible. Previously, this powertrain was offered only with the top-spec Zeta+ and Alpha+ trims at prices starting from Rs 18.58 lakh (ex-showroom). The new Delta+ strong hybrid lowers that entry price to Rs 16.99 lakh. Additionally, the 5-speed manual gearbox on the 1.5-litre petrol-AWD variant has been replaced with a new 6-speed automatic gearbox. Maruti Suzuki has also made the panoramic sunroof an optional extra for Rs 60,000 on the Zeta, Alpha, Zeta+ and Alpha+ trims; earlier, it was a standard fit on these trims. Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara new features Safety update Maruti Suzuki is also offering 6 airbags as standard on the updated Grand Vitara. Previously, the base Sigma and Delta trims came with 2 airbags. Other standard safety features on the Grand Vitara include ESP, hill hold assist, ABS and EBD, 3-point seatbelt for all passengers and ISOFIX mounts.   More convenience features added Maruti Suzuki has also added a few comfort and convenience features to the Grand Vitara but hasn’t specified which trims these come in from. These include a new 8-way powered function for the driver’s seat, an electronic parking brake for the automatic variants, an air purifier with PM2.5 display, new LED cabin lamps and rear window sunshades. Maruti has also updated the design of the 17-inch alloy wheels. Other features include a 9-inch infotainment touchscreen, wireless charging and phone connectivity, head-up display, a 360-degree camera and ventilated front seats.
