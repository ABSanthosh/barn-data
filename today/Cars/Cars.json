    "description": "The Himalayan has now completed a year with us, and it’s time for the bike to be returned to Royal Enfield. Over the past year, the bike has gone on a couple of long rides out of the city, but most of the 6,648km on the Odo have been clocked within the metropolis. During this time, the bike has made my 70km round-trip commute far more enjoyable than it has any right to be. I’ve spoken about this before, but the Himalayan’s size, seating comfort, and superb suspension have won me over. With the engine, it’s not quite so straightforward, and I find myself wishing for more character after a few days of continuous commuting. However, the moment I take a break from the bike (which happens far more often than I’d like with the travel schedule), I get back on it and find myself enjoying the mid-range punch. That being said, RE still has work to do when it comes to damping out the handlebar vibrations at highway cruising speeds. Seating and suspension comfort are both outstanding. That I have enjoyed riding the Himalayan 450 is without doubt, but the experience has not been free of flaws. First, there was the issue of the bike pulling to the right when the handlebar was released. This took ages and multiple visits to the showroom to be sorted, and I was given to understand that it came down to correctly torquing some of the bolts that connect the engine to the frame. 17-litre tank is top-heavy, but it also makes the bike feel big. We also had the toggle switch on the left-hand switchgear fail, and it was replaced under warranty. But even when it works, I find the switch fiddly enough that I avoid using it altogether. This means that even though there is quite a bit of tech within all the menus on that pretty circular TFT display, I never bother with it. Thankfully, this has had no negative effect on the riding experience. The joystick switch is fiddly to use and needs redesigning. Finally, there’s the infamous cone-set issue. It first started to get loose at about 5,000km, which I reported on in the previous report. I was told by the folks at the service centre that it was tightened, as the bearing didn’t need to be replaced. However, less than 1,000km later, it has gotten loose again and is now considerably worse than it was the first time. For something that was such a well-known issue with the old Himalayan 411, it’s surprising to see it continue in the all-new model. It’s also been disappointing that the service centre has not reset the service warning after two separate services, and it shows up every time I start the bike. The steering cone set bearing keeps getting loose. But as I write this, I’m reminded that while there have been niggles, there have never been any serious breakdowns (or letdowns). The bike has always started when I’ve asked, and every ride has been enjoyable. Whenever I conclude a long-term review of a motorcycle, I always ask myself if I’d buy one. Usually, the answer is no, but here, I could see it being a yes because this bike fits my particular needs for a large, quick and super comfy bike that can steamroll through the mess of our local road system. The Himalayan has truly excelled at that role.

    "title": "How much does it cost to charge an electric car?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advice-electric-cars/how-much-does-it-cost-charge-electric-car",
    "description": "The details of EV charging and the cost of it can seem complicated at first, but this guide spells it out clearly Thinking of switching to an electric car? Finding out how much it will cost you to charge is the first answer you need to find out. Sadly that answer isn’t simple, because it depends on where and how you charge. Charging at home is usually much cheaper than using public chargers. But even at home, costs vary depending on your energy tariff and the type of charger you install. Public chargers add another layer of complexity. Prices change based on the charging speed and provider. Fast and ultra-fast chargers are convenient but come at a premium. Then there's VAT to consider. Home charging is taxed at 5% but public charging is hit with a 20% rate. Charging comparison Charging Location Typical Cost per kWh VAT Rate Speed Notes Home (standard tariff) 27p 5% 3-7kW (slow/fast) Most cost-effective if charged overnight Home (EV-friendly tariff) 6p–15p 5% 3-7kW (slow/fast) Cheapest option, typically off-peak overnight Public (fast charger) 40p–60p 20% 7–22kW (fast) More expensive, suitable for short top-ups Public (rapid/ultra-rapid charger) 60p–85p+ 20% 50–350kW (rapid/ultra-rapid) Fastest but highest cost How much will it cost to charge my car at home? The vast majority of electric car drivers charge at home, where it's not only cheaper to do so but also far more convenient. Even with the recent hikes in electricity prices, you will still be saving cash on every refill compared with a traditional petrol or diesel car. For example, charging a Kia Niro EV with a 64.8kWh (usable) battery and a claimed 285-mile range at home will cost around £17.50 for a full charge, based on the current capped tariff of 27p (£0.27 x 64.8kWh). This figure assumes you're charging an empty battery to a little short of 100%, but in reality you're likely to be charging from around 20% to 80% – the minimum and maximum amounts for best preserving battery cell life.  Some energy providers offer special tariffs for electric car owners, providing even cheaper rates for overnight charging. You might see this advertised as off-peak. For instance, E.on gives seven hours of electricity per night at 6.7p/kWh. If you’re able to complete a full 64.8kWh charge solely on that off-peak rate, it would cost less than £5. Moreover, if your home has solar panels, some chargers can use this ‘free’ energy to charge your EV, further reducing bills. There are even trials running for bi-directional charging that allows you to ‘sell’ any surplus power from your EV back to the grid. Home charging for company car drivers is more complex, owing to the need to prove how the energy has been used. However, drivers can claim 7p per mile for business trips in electric vehicles, which is the easiest way to avoid administrative headaches. Home wallbox costs It's possible to use the factory-supplied three-pin plug charger when refilling your EV's battery cells, but charging times are lengthy and most manufacturers advise this method is for emergency use only.  Prices vary, but you can expect to pay £500-£1500 for a smart home wallbox that will communicate with your phone, allowing you to control it remotely. If you're a home owner in a single-unit property and haven’t yet bought an EV, a number of manufacturers are offering a free wallbox and installation when you buy one of their electric models. Either way, if you’re committed to EV ownership and you have access to a driveway or garage, it’s always best to use a dedicated wall-mounted unit that can charge at up to 7kW, which is more than twice as fast as the three-pin alternative. There are a number of different manufacturers to choose from, plus a choice of tethered (with a charging cable permanently attached) or untethered (allowing you to choose different sockets and cables for different cars) layouts. Regardless of which one makes most sense for your EV, you will need a qualified electrician to check your household wiring is up to the task and then to install the box. In England, renters and flat owners qualify for the government's charge point grant, worth either £350 or 75% off the cost to buy and install a socket, whichever amount is lower.    Public charging costs Public charging costs depend on where you charge and what car you have, because there are numerous options. For kerbside charging, there are four types of public chargers: slow, fast, rapid and ultra-rapid.  As of April 2025, to charge a Vauxhall Corsa Electric with a 50kWh battery from 0-10% will on average cost £12.43 using a slow charger, £25 using a fast charger and £38 using a rapid charger. Elsewhere, you can find DC rapid chargers at charging hubs and on A-roads and motorways. At these, leading provider Instavolt, for example, charges 85p per kWh on its rapid charger tariff, making it considerably more expensive on a pence-per-mile basis than a petrol car.  If you frequently travel long distances, providers such as BP Pulse offer a subscription service with a monthly fee of £7.85, giving you discounted rates (the brand estimates a 20% saving compared with pay as you go) on many of its 9000 chargers plus free access to a handful of AC units.  You will need a smartphone app to access the cheaper rates (or an RFID card for some of the older units), but once connected, you will be billed at 44p on the AC 7kW charger, 63p per kWh on the rapid AC 43kW/DC 50kW​ chargers and 69p on the ultra-fast DC 150kW-plus chargers. It’s also possible to use many of the chargers on a pay-as-you-go basis with a contactless bank card at a rate of 59p per kWh for 7kW AC chargers, 79p per kWh for 50kW and 85p per kWh for the 150kW-plus chargers. Some hotels and shopping centres offer free charging to customers. The widespread use of smartphone apps for all providers makes it easy to see where the charging points are, how much they cost to use and whether they’re free, so you can easily tap into a provider that suits your needs and budget. Many car manufacturers offer simplified charging by enabling access to numerous providers under their own charging schemes. For instance, Audi's E-tron Charging Service account gives access to nearly 20 different energy firms and 75% of the UK's public charging points, while new E-tron models come with the choice of £500 worth of free charging or a free Ohme home charger or £500 off the vehicle's price.  Tesla owners get their own dedicated rapid-charging Supercharger network of more than 1400 chargers plus a number of Destination fast chargers at locations such as hotels. Owners of a Tesla Model S or Tesla Model X registered before 2017 are eligible for free charging, while some owners received 6000 miles of free charging if they bought their cars between 15 December 2022 and 12 January 2023.  Non-Tesla owners can now also use the Supercharger network, and in April 2024 the company reduced its prices for these people and allowed them to take out Tesla membership for £8.99 per month or £90 a year. With membership, non-Tesla owners pay as much for Supercharger power as Tesla owners. Tariffs change according to location and time of day but they range from 54p to 67p per kWh.  Tesla also charges ‘idle fees’ if you remain parked up once your car has a full battery, to reduce how long it takes for others to get connected. If the Supercharger station is more than 50% full, you will be charged 50p for every minute you’re parked in a fully charged car, rising to £1 if the station is completely full. How much does motorway charging cost? You will pay a little more to charge at a motorway service station, largely because most of the chargers there are fast or rapid units. Costs typically range from 60p-85p pkWh.   And remember, there will often be an activation fee to pay ahead. This is refundable, and typically ranges from £1-£40. Is charging an electric car cheaper than fuelling a petrol or diesel car? Just as fuel prices vary between fuel stations and are much higher at motorway service stations, so EV charger prices vary widely between locations and providers. Other variables include whether you're a member of a provider's charging scheme and how fast the charger is. On that point, a fuel pump dispenses petrol or diesel at a fixed speed, whereas chargers range in 'speeds' from 3kW to more than 350kW. And then you've the fact that you can charge at home and take advantage of much lower tariffs.  It's charging at home where the savings are greatest. For example, in the case of the Kia Niro EV, charging it at home on the current capped electricity tariff of 27p per kWh, the cost per mile would be around 7p. To refuel its sibling model, the Kia Niro Hybrid, which has an official combined fuel economy figure of 64.2mpg, at the average pump price for unleaded petrol of £6.79 per gallon it would cost more like 12p - almost twice as much. Charging becomes more expensive on a per-mile basis when you use public chargers located at hubs on A-roads and at motorway service stations, where you're paying for speed and convenience. The way to counter this, if it's offered, is to become a subscriber to take advantage of lower tariffs.",

    "description": "Fixed-roof GTS has the production go-ahead after its 2024 concept debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed MG has confirmed plans to put the four-seat hard-top version of its Cyberster sports car into production.  The fixed-roof Cyberster GTS was revealed as a running prototype at last year's Goodwood Festival of Speed, but there has been no word on a likely launch date since then - despite suggestions that it could arrive as early as this year. But now, MG has confirmed at the Shanghai motor show that a production version is inbound and could land in time for the 60th anniversary of the original MG B GT in October. Asked for an update on the Cyberster GTS, MG parent company SAIC's design boss, Jozef Kaban – who was responsible for the concept – would only go so far as to say: \"It's coming.\" He cited the positive public reaction to last year's concept as a factor in MG giving the green light to a production version, saying the exposure \"made it happen\".  Kaban was speaking on the sidelines of the unveiling of the new MG Cyber X concept – a brutalist electric crossover that's set to go on sale as the second model in the enthusiast-focused Cyber model family, alongside the Cyberster.  He hailed the effectiveness of the two-door sports car as a halo model for MG as an incentive to expand that line-up. \"It makes you smile,\" he said. \"It makes you happy the moment you open the doors. You know everybody's watching. You know you are the star. \"That's why we love cars, because you feel that they are there to make you stronger. They make you happy. They make you shine.\" A new derivative of the sports car would effectively give MG's Cyber brand a three-car line-up - and the dramatic difference in billing between the Cyberster and Cyber X model lines suggests there could be bandwidth between them to expand it further.",

    "description": "Michelangelo famously said, “I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.” I’ve long suspected that Yuichi Yoshizawa applies a similar philosophy to building custom motorcycles. The frontman of the Japanese workshop CW Zon has the ability to take even the most mundane motorcycle, stare into its soul, and turn it into something magical. This time, he’s done it to the venerable 1981 Yamaha XV1000. Known as the TR1 in some markets and the Virago in others, the XV1000 featured an oddball combination of Japanese engineering and American sensibilities. It now enjoys regular attention from custom builders—but there are only so many ways you can spin it. Unsurprisingly, Yoshizawa-san’s Yamaha XV1000 looks like no other custom Virago out there.…",

    "description": "The Vellfire is Toyota’s big global MPV. It’s the current craze among India’s rich and famous, and has even gone on to become an unlikely red carpet regular. Mind you, this new-gen model was launched in India way back in 2023, but such has been the demand (nearly 1,200 were delivered last year), even the team at Toyota – that wouldn’t cut a queue – seemingly got their hands on their own media car only now. 2025 Toyota Vellfire exterior design and engineering: 7/10 5 metres long and 2 metres tall Vellfire has big presence You wouldn’t buy a Vellfire – or any MPV for that matter – primarily for the way it looks, but this latest-gen model does look more luxury product and less upscale airport pickup than the last one did. Of course, it’s the 5-metre length, 2-metre height and massive body that make the hulking Toyota unmissable even amidst luxury sedans and SUVs. Chrome treatment extends to 19-inch rims. Chrome details add bling to large MPV There’s more bling too. The huge 6-slat grille that almost extends to the floor is slathered in dark chrome, there’s more of the shiny stuff lining the bumper and even the headlamps sport a jewelled effect. You get the full effect of the Vellfire’s towering size at the side. Even the 19-inch rims look small amidst the vast body. A stylistic fold at the window line does give the slab-sided Vellfire some distinction in the world of MPVs. At the back, a roof spoiler and protruding bumper add some sportiness, if you will. Upward sweep of window line limits visibility for middle row passengers. The Vellfire uses a monocoque construction and is built on Toyota’s TNGA-K platform meant for large models. Toyota claims the new Vellfire is significantly stiffer in its construction yet engineered to be comfier and quieter than the last-gen model. 2025 Toyota Vellfire interior space and comfort: 9.5/10 Middle row comfort is exceptional Make what you want of the way the Vellfire looks, because the real story starts when you get inside. The first and perhaps only place of interest for the Vellfire’s chauffeur-driven clientele will be the middle row seats, access to which is via powered sliding doors. It is a bit of a step up into the living room-sized cabin. However, the short trek is worth it, ending in a pair of individual chairs that are no less than thrones. Large enough to accommodate the biggest of passengers, padded to perfection and adjustable in multiple ways, the middle row seats are among the very comfiest in the business, price no bar. Vellfire's middle row captain seats are among the comfiest in the business, price no bar.  Physical controls at the seats or detachable screens positioned on the armrests can be used to move the seats fore-aft, recline the backrest angle and raise the legrests. There’s a wide range of motion, and, at full extension, you can really stretch out business-class style to catch a power nap on the go. Heating, ventilation and massage functions only up the comfort levels. However, the upswept rear windows don’t give the panoramic view out you’d expect in an MPV. Detachable screens mounted on armrests control seat adjustment, heating, ventilation and massage.   Third row offers enough room for three adults to sit in comfort Middle-row space and comfort is just brilliant, but it isn’t too bad for your entourage at the very back either. In fact, the Vellfire’s third row is the best we’ve experienced. Access is convenient enough (through a passage between the middle seat and body) and there’s enough room for three adults to sit in comfort, which is saying something. Backrest recline is included and the seats can also be slid to maximise legroom or balance space for luggage. Access to third row is easy which has enough space for three adults.   Access to the Vellfire’s luggage area is via a powered tailgate that's large enough to do justice to the word ‘gate’. There's loads of flexibility built in: push the third row seats far forward or manually swivel them up and to the sides to free up courier van-levels of room. For all its space though, the Vellfire doesn't offer enough room for a spare tyre. Vellfire's boot offers courier van-levels of space, but there’s no provision for a spare tyre.   Cabin quality sees a huge jump over last-gen Vellfire We don’t foresee too many Vellfire owners getting into the intricacies of the front section of the cabin, but even so, the news is good. The dashboard with a wrap-around look is nicely done, but more pronounced is the huge leap up the new Vellfire has taken in terms of perceived quality. There’s more generous use of leather and padded surfaces, and even the wood-like detailing is convincing. Front seat comfort is also really good. Wraparound look to dash and high quality materials make cabin look rich and inviting.  The Vellfire gets abundant storage spaces across all three rows (including roof-mounted boxes), although the glovebox is unusually small. 2025 Toyota Vellfire features and safety: 8/10 14-inch touchscreen and digital dials are part of long equipment list The Vellfire comes loaded with goodies, so let’s break down the features set row-wise. Power adjustment for the steering and driver’s seat make it easy to find a comfy driving position, while the digital dials (limited in layout) make for easy viewing too. Also nice is the 14-inch touchscreen. The UI isn’t cutting edge, but the screen is smooth and slick, and packs in essentials like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected tech to remotely operate certain features. Physical knobs for the temperature settings also get our thumbs up. A 360-degree camera is included but feels only marginally better than the one in a Toyota Glanza (that costs a tenth!). The 15-speaker JBL sound system won’t get you enthused either. 14-inch touchscreen is smooth and slick, but UI isn't cutting edge.    Middle row passengers get lots of features and gizmos The multi-way adjustable, heated, cooled and massaging seats are the highlights in the middle row, and there’s more to make your journey comfier. Both seats pack in flip-out tray tables with a built-in vanity mirror, and there’s a 14-inch rear entertainment screen (it support Miracast and HDMI connectivity only) that folds out of the roof when summoned via the detachable control screens on the armrests. These mobile phone-sized screens (as well as buttons on the roof) can also be used to adjust the 14-colour ambient lighting, powered window sunshades and dedicated zones for the climate control system. Also, there won't be any quarreling with your co-passenger over sunroof opening thanks to the presence of individual glass panels with powered sunshades atop both seats. Middle row passengers get dedicated sunroofs. Adjustable seats, AC vents and powered sunshades for the quarter glass are features of note for third-row passengers. ADAS is part of Vellfire’s safety suite Safety kit includes six airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are also included. Lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control worked well on the smooth and well-marked Coastal Road in Mumbai, though it was the Blind Spot Warning function that came in most handy when piloting the oversized Vellfire. 14-inch rear entertainment screen folds out of the roof.    2025 Toyota Vellfire performance and refinement: 7/10 Vellfire offered in India only in front-wheel drive form Before we get moving, you should know that the Vellfire is sold in India only in front-wheel-drive format. Versions on sale overseas can be had with a rear electric motor that powers the rear wheels, effectively enabling all-wheel drive when driving conditions require. As things stand, the Vellfire is the most expensive front-wheel-drive vehicle on sale in India. Strong hybrid powertrain delivers a max of 250hp Driving the front wheels via an eCVT is a strong-hybrid arrangement. The powertrain comprises a 192hp, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine and a 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp. Vellfire doesn’t like to be rushed and feels its best in city confines.  It goes without saying that this is not a vehicle you buy for performance. If you’re in a hurry, the Vellfire is probably not the right vehicle to pick from your garage. This one’s job is to transport seven passengers in comfort. Vellfire can run in electric-only mode when battery has enough charge The Vellfire loves easy-going driving and gentle cruises, but ask anything more of it by pressing down harder on the accelerator pedal and that CVT-ness of the drivetrain comes right through. The engine will become audible and the groan stings at this price point. When there is enough charge in the battery, the Vellfire will slip into all-electric EV mode, which brings the decibel levels right back down. This is when you see the Vellfire in its best light. The Vellfire is ideal for easy-going driving and gentle cruises.  The Vellfire actually feels its best in stop-start urban confines, where the hybrid setup keeps the big Toyota in its comfort zone. It works as a long-distance vehicle too, but the powertrain simply doesn't feel as effortless as a strong diesel or even a strong turbo-petrol engine would. 2025 Toyota Vellfire ride comfort and handling: 7/10 Suspension doesn’t iron out all bumps and road noise creeps in to the cabin On the go, the VIP sat at the back will have reason to nitpick. Ride comfort is good but not good enough for a vehicle that sets you back by Rs 1.5 crore. The bumps and potholes do get filtered to quite an extent (it’s far nicer than the last Vellfire on this front), but the experience is not as pliant as it should have been. There’s also a fair bit of road noise that makes its way into the cabin, and at high speeds, you’ll hear air slamming against the A-pillar. Drivers will take some time getting used to the Vellfire’s size.    Drivers will need some time to get comfortable with the Vellfire’s size Also, the Vellfire isn’t the kind of vehicle that you just get into and get comfortable behind the wheel of. Sure, the high-set seat and large glasshouse give a commanding view of the world, but the windscreen that extends far forward makes it tricky to judge the Vellfire’s frontal extremities, at least initially. The size takes some getting used to and U-turns will need a bit of planning. There’s more ground clearance than the low floor would suggest. Ground clearance might appear inadequate but the Vellfire clears big speedbreakers without scraping its belly. No height adjustable air suspension here; the Vellfire rides on steel springs. 2025 Toyota Vellfire price and verdict: 8.5/10 Toyota Vellfire prices start at Rs 1.22 crore (ex-showroom) The Vellfire starts at Rs 1.22 crore for the Hi trim, while this VIP Executive Lounge spec is yours for Rs 1.32 crore (ex-showroom). Fun fact? That’s a crazy Rs 40 lakh-plus jump over the last-gen model’s launch price in 2020! The Vellfire is clearly not your average level-headed Toyota, nor is it your typical practicality-above-all-else MPV. It’s a luxury good and Toyota would like you to think it’s priced as such too. The Vellfire is for the chauffeur-driven who want to lounge on their way to work or home. A like-priced luxury sedan or SUV will get you more power and deliver a quieter experience, and of course, there’s the lure of a more prestigious badge too. But nothing, and I mean nothing, at this price can match the Vellfire’s rear seats for comfort. For the chauffeur-driven who merely want to lounge on their way to work or home, the Vellfire will be money well-spent. Toyota’s peace of mind ownership and a claimed 19.28kpl fuel economy figure would perhaps help strengthen the case for the Vellfire with the company CA too. But you know what? There’s an even more exclusive, more refined and comfier option from the house of Toyota – the Vellfire’s cousin. It’s called the Lexus LM, and it goes up to Rs 2.6 crore. Van damn!

    "description": "The 45kWh variants of the Tata Nexon EV have secured a 5-star rating in crash tests conducted by Bharat NCAP (New Car Safety Assessment Program). The Nexon EV 45kWh scored 29.86 out of 32 points in adult occupant protection (AOP) and 44.95 out of 49 in child occupant protection (COP). Tata Nexon EV 45kWh got 29.86 out of 32 points in AOP It secured 44.95 points out of 49 in COP The Nexon EV 30kWh also achieved a 5-star BNCAP rating last year, which means the complete Nexon EV variant portfolio has scored the highest possible overall safety grade domestically. Tata Nexon EV 45kWh safety features 6 airbags, ESC, 360-degree camera are standard BNCAP tested the Tata Nexon EV’s top-spec Empowered+ LR variant, which comes equipped with six airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), ISOFIX child seat anchor points, 3-point seatbelts with reminders for all passengers, a 360-degree camera, and tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS). Tata Nexon EV 45kWh adult occupant protection Frontal offset deformable barrier test: 14.26/16 points In the Nexon EV 45kWh’s frontal offset deformable barrier test, protection for the driver’s head, neck, pelvis, thighs and feet was rated ‘good’, while the chest and tibias scored ‘adequate’. The co-driver’s head, neck, chest, pelvis, thighs and left tibia received ‘good’ ratings, but right tibia protection was marked ‘adequate’. Side deformable barrier test: 15.60/16 points In the side pole impact test, all parts of the driver were marked ‘good’, which also held true for the side movable deformable barrier test. However, chest protection in the latter was marked ‘adequate’. Tata Nexon EV 45kWh child occupant protection Dynamic score: 23.95/24 points Child restraint system (CRS) installation score: 12/12 points Vehicle assessment score: 9/13 points The Nexon EV 45kWh racked up 23.95 out of 24 points in the dynamic test with the child restraint systems in use. For the 18-month-old and 3-year-old dummy’s side protection, the dynamic score was a full 4 out of 4. Frontal protection to the 18-month-old dummy stood at 7.95 out of 8, while the 3-year-old scored full points again – 8 out of 8. Tata Nexon EV 45kWh BNCAP score vs rivals Trades punches with Mahindra XUV400 The chief rival of the Nexon EV is the Mahindra XUV400, which scored more in AOP ratings (30.38 versus 29.86) but fell short of the Tata e-SUV in COP (43 versus 44.95). Speaking of which, all of Tata’s electric SUVs – the Nexon EV, Punch EV, Curvv EV – and their full variant line-ups are now 5-star-certified in BNCAP crash tests.

    "description": "Volkswagen’s ID sub-brand showcased three concepts: Era and Evo SUVs, and Aura sedan, on Tuesday. The carmaker has yet to publish specifics on each model’s powertrain, but has confirmed that all are new-energy vehicles (NEVs), which include plug-in hybrid, range-extender and all-electric powertrains. VW will be introducing 30 new vehicles by 2027 in China, which are previewed by these ID concepts. Era SUV previews VW's first range-extender powertrain Evo is a sibling to the ID Unyx SUV Aura has a similar silhouette to the Volkswagen Bora sedan (Vento successor in Europe) Volkswagen ID Era SUV concept Up to 1,000km range Made in collaboration with the Chinese automotive manufacturer SAIC, with which Volkswagen has a joint venture (JV), the ID Era concept previews the brand’s first range-extender powertrain. A petrol engine or generator is solely used to charge the battery, and with maximum fuel and battery levels, the vehicle can deliver a range of up to 1,000 km. Inside, the VW ID Era SUV has a seven-seat setup similar to the Volkswagen Tayron (sold in international markets). Volkswagen ID Evo SUV concept 800V electrical architecture Volkswagen’s second SUV concept here, the ID Evo, is built by its sub-division based in Anhui, China. It is a sibling to the ID Unyx - a rebadged version of the Cupra Tavascan. However, the Evo concept swaps the Unyx’s rakish rear roofline with a more traditional SUV look. Also, Evo’s electric version packs an upgraded 800V electrical architecture (400V system used by the Unyx), a new zonal computer setup for a wide range of new digital services and quick over-the-air (OTA) software updates. Volkswagen ID Aura sedan concept First car based on CMP The VW ID Aura sedan is a result of the brand’s JV with First Automotive Works (FAW), one of China’s oldest and largest automotive manufacturers. While it did not disclose the dimensions of the sedan, it has a similar silhouette to the VW Bora (successor to the Volkswagen Vento in Europe). The Aura concept will spawn the first car based on the new Compact Main Platform (CMP), which is specifically aimed at the Chinese market. The production versions of the concept trio will feature a Level 2++ AI-based autonomous driving system. “In certain situations, cars will be able to drive fully autonomously, including overtaking and turning manoeuvres and independently merging into traffic, with the driver’s supervision,” Volkswagen said in a statement.
