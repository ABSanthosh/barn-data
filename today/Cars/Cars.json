    "description": "St James's Spectacle is free to attend, running on Pall Mall between 10am and 3pm on 2 November Inaugural event tomorrow – Saturday 2 November – is a prelude to the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run The organiser of the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run has announced a new car show presenting landmark models from history of motoring. The St James’s Spectacle is free to attend and will take place on London’s Pall Mall tomorrow, Saturday 2 November, ahead of the London to Brighton Run the following day. It will comprise a concours event for some 75 pre-1905 cars judged by industry and television personalities including Edd China and Alan Titchmarsh, as well as several zones highlighting the past and future of the motor industry. The Heritage Display area will provide a neat timeline through the history of the industry, from horse-drawn carriages through to steam-powered cars and up to today’s high-tech electric vehicles. It will also celebrate 125 years of Fiat and Renault, plus the 50th anniversary of the Volkswagen Golf. Meanwhile, the Modern Design showcase will feature a mix of famed classics and new supercars. They range from a 1904 Mercedes Simplex and a Subaru Impreza rally car to the Aston Martin Valkyrie and a Porsche 963 hypercar that raced in this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours. “The Spectacle really will live up to its name,” said Duncan Wiltshire, Chairman of the Royal Automobile Club. “Whether it’s the extraordinary collection of Victorian and Edwardian pioneers or the glittering array of equally innovative hypercars furthering the ground-breaking technologies to come, Pall Mall will be packed automotive legends past, present and future. And, best of all, everyone can enjoy the Spectacle for free.” The event will start at 10am and end at 3pm.",

    "description": "Court of Appeal's ruling effectively bans dealers profiting from finance deals unless the buyer gives their consent Some car makers have paused sales in the wake of a UK court judgement that taking commissions on car financing is unlawful. The landmark ruling by the Court of Appeal has thrown banks, dealers and car makers into a state of disarray, given that it effectively bans dealers from profiting on finance deals unless the buyer gives their consent. Such was the worry from car markers in the aftermath of last Friday’s ruling that BMW and Honda dealers were told to hold back vehicles already sold through financing deals while the situation was assessed, The Telegraph reports. Honda Finance Europe operations director Richard Winter told dealers the firm wouldn't be paying out on already agreed finance contracts “until further notice”, adding that it was a “difficult decision”, Car Dealer reports. A spokesperson for Honda Finance Europe has since confirmed that deliveries have resumed through interim provisions, adding: “We have now had time to review the situation and have been able to put in place interim measures to allow us to resume the funding of all finance business.” The ruling by the Court of Appeal – one of the highest courts in the country – was announced as part of a case brought against Close Brothers and Firstrand Bank by three customers who claimed they were mis-sold finance deals. The trio had previously had their cases thrown out by lower courts. Judges unanimously ruled to uphold their appeals, stating that “a broker could not lawfully receive a commission from a lender without obtaining the customer’s fully informed consent to the payment”. Moreover, the ruling effectively threatens the long-established agreement that dealers receive commissions from banks or lenders for acting as a middle man in selling finance agreements on vehicles.  Since the ruling, many car makers have already begun to disclose commission rates to customers in order to continue business as normal. This has sent shockwaves through the industry as it braces for a barrage of incoming lawsuits, likened to how the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal exploded at the turn of the 2010s. Among those gearing up for the worst is Lloyds Bank, as the owner of Black Horse, a leading lender of car finance. In February, it revealed it had set aside £450 million to cover legal expenses and compensation payouts. It follows an investigation earlier this year by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) concerning discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) sold between 2007 and 2020, after more than 10,000 complaints were made. DCAs allowed dealers and brokers to adjust lenders’ interest rates to reward themselves with commission payments on hire purchase (HP) and personal contract purchase (PCP) deals. In one complaint, the FCA stated, Black Horse was found to have allowed a dealer to set an interest rate between 2.49% and 5.5%, with anything over 2.49% being paid to the dealer as commission. The dealer charged the highest rate of 5.5%, amounting to half of the customer’s total interest bill on the loan. In addition, the dealer didn't tell the customer it had set the interest rate or how much commission it had earned.",

    "description": "Have you noticed how photographers often favor the right-hand side of a motorcycle? Sometimes it’s because the bike’s side stand has it leaning over to the left, making it awkward to capture a good angle. Other times, it’s because the right-hand side is simply more visually appealing than the left. That’s not the case with this 1970s Harley Shovelhead, which features a burly open primary, a bespoke oil tank, a hand-shifter, and a handmade exhaust system—all on the left side. It’s the work of the Japanese custom bike builder Masumi Tsuchino, who operates out of Iruma in the Saitama Prefecture, just northwest of Tokyo. Tsuchino-san qualified as a mechanic out of school, then cut his teeth at a Toyota dealership.…",

You may know Mark Hawwa as the founder of the Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride (and Drive), the man behind the Throttle Roll custom bike show, or the owner of Sydney’s newest donut joint, Donut Garage. We know him as a total motorcycle nut with a penchant for café racers. But what we didn’t know, is that he’s always wanted to own a Harley V-Rod. Given the V-Rod’s inherent style, most custom examples are wide-tired, chrome-slathered brutes. That’s never appealed to Mark’s sensibilities, so he’s long imagined a V-Rod with a sportier bend.

    "description": "Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V has been updated, and it’s offered in two variants: Standard and Pro. As the name suggests, the Pro is essentially the erstwhile Rally Edition, and it’s the more extreme version of an already capable off-road motorcycle. It is also available with a set of optional Maxxisknobbies that you see on our test bike. Hero has given the Xpulse 200 4V Pro some new features this year, and I took this motorcycle out in its natural habitat to find out what it’s like. You now also get three switchable ABS modes. Hero has made some noticeable changes to the 2024 Xpulse range, which includes new reinforced knuckle guards, new switchgear, revised footpeg position, a new projector LED headlamp, a USB charging socket and ABS modes. The all-new headlamp is significantly brighter and incorporates an all-new Daytime Running Lamp design, making the Xpulse appear slightly more upmarket. New switchgear feels better to use. Unique to the Xpulse Pro is a new rally-styled windshield that is 60mm taller than before. The rally visor deflects wind well on the road. All in all, the new changes are a welcome addition and will improve the overall usability of this motorcycle. As before, the Pro variant towers over everything else on the road and stands tall while looking purposeful. Its size is deceptive, and many onlookers assume it is a motorcycle with a much larger capacity. An efficient motor that could use some more power. The Xpulse continues to be powered by a 199cc, oil-cooled motor that produces 19hp at 8,500rpm and 17.35Nm at 6,500rpm. What has improved is that with its OBD2 update, the engine now needs to be serviced every 6,000km instead of the 3,000km. Due to its easy power delivery, this motor continues to perform adequately, and is a boon to use for inexperienced off-road riders. At 161kg, the Pro variant is only 2kg heavier than its standard counterpart, which isn’t too bad given all the added hardware. Allows upto 25 clicks of rebound damping adjustment While the knobby tyres provided excellent grip, the engine lacked the power to overcome it. So sliding this motorcycle was not as easy as it is on ADVs that sit in a higher segment. What helps its case is that you will never find yourself running out of grip, and the Xpulse Pro keeps its cool even when climbing up sections with loose surfaces. While I still wish for more power, I have also come to enjoy its underpowered and calm nature on such tricky trails. Maxxistyres cost Rs 16,000 extra. The Xpulse Pro is a challenge to ride on the tarmac if you choose the Maxxistyres – they are road legal, but are also zero-compromise knobbies built for off-road. Grip itself is fine, but the tyres feel scary when the bike is leaned over and they also make a loud, constant droning noise. The tyres also get unsettled over road irregularities and expansion joints can change the bike’s course at any given moment. On the normal Ceats, the bike would be much nicer, but you’ll still need to live with the very tall seat height – we’ll get back to that. Fork compression damping can be easily adjusted. However, when they hit the dirt, these tyres come into their elements and provide an incredible amount of grip. Compression and rebound damping can be dialled in on the adjustable fork, and the owner’s manual has multiple setting recommendations for various riding situations and these settings are a good starting point from where you can tweak the set-up to your liking. My biggest challenge was the 891mm seat height, which can take getting used to and initially be a little daunting. Mind you, this is with the stock seat and going for the optional rally style bench seat will take that number above 920mm. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro compels you to find your nearest trail. The added height makes the motorcycle feel sluggish and more top-heavy, and this is where the humble engine’s limits become more apparent. However, in time, I’ve gradually gotten more comfortable with its size, and wrestling it off-road has become easier as you go. What has helped is the new footpeg positioning along with the handlebar risers that allow riders to get a better grip and find a more suitable position while standing. Tall ride height towers you over everything else on the road. Hero’s Xpulse 200 4V is a competent machine, and the Pro variant makes it even more unstoppable. That being said, it takes a certain skill level to get the most out of this bike. The suspension is best suited for high-speed off-roading. Shorter, or lesser skilled riders might be better off with the standard Xpulse for slower-speed trails. Either way, the updated features do a great job of uplifting the overall experience. The Xpulse 200 4V Pro is in its element out in the mud. It is worth noting that all of the above-mentioned additions have come at a mild price bump of Rs 3,000, which sounds like a sweet deal. All in all, the Xpulse 200 4V Pro is an excellent alternative to the standard variant and costs Rs 8,000 more, which, given its credentials, sounds too good to be true. The Pro variant is an easy recommendation for anyone skilled enough to dive deeper into the off-road genre of motorcycling. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure review: Incremental changes",

    "description": "Viaterra’s Holeshot Pro is a sporty glove that offers a hybrid between race looks, good protection and street-friendly comfort. From a distance, these look a lot like a sporty, track-oriented glove, especially if you go for one of the coloured versions, like the blue ones here. But take a closer look and you’ll see that a significant portion uses a mesh construction for better breathability. The top of the thumb and the first three fingers are all mesh, with some soft rubber protectors. The pinky finger gets a leather panel sewn onto the mesh to protect against abrasion, as this is a common impact area in a crash. The top of the glove around the knuckle area is all leather, and there’s another patch of leather above the wrist as well. The entire palm is leather and there’s a high-grip panel below the fingers. All the leather used is perforated for better breathability. Carbon fibre protector for the ulna is nice at this price point. Protection levels aren’t as high as those of a full-gauntlet race glove, but they’re good nevertheless. You’ll get Knox scaphoid armour for the palms, as well as some armour for the ulna bone on the outside of your wrist. For street gloves, this is more than sufficient, but you won’t find things like a bridged pinky finger or externally stitched seams here, although Viaterra offers those in its top Grid 3 full-gauntlet glove. The Holeshot Pro gloves have touchscreen-sensitive leather patches on the thumb and index finger. The tops of the fingers also get reflective elements to improve nighttime visibility. The wrist closure is secured by a single velcro strap, and they’re easy to get on and off. The overall fit is on the snug side, especially in the knuckle region. The gloves break in over time, but the fit is sporty; if you want something more relaxed, you’ll want to look elsewhere. I like the balance of sportiness and usability the Holsehot Pro packs in for life in the city, and the price is worth what you’re getting.

    "description": "As I drive home, I’m on the expressway, cruising at speed. My eye catches a single leaf that is attracted to my car like it’s stuck in a vacuum. Somehow, the leaf wraps its desiccated body around the windshield wiper arm. I can smell its dry, brittle scent. The smell of autumn. I suddenly had a thought. “Was that the last auto event for the season?” Rewind back 7 hours. Let's go back to the beginning. The event in mention is the annual 28 Liberty car show, hosted by Carpark in the financial district of Manhattan. Like many other Carpark events, organizers Rob Blackman, Jeffrey Einhorn, and Liz Gilchrist create a show that is as much a celebration of the cars as it is a gathering of people. In Jeff’s own words, ‘a three-dimensional event’. With food, wine, cars, and even a marching brass band, there aren’t many events that have the same milieu. The annual 28 Liberty Car Show Continue...",

    "description": "Following an action-packed festive season with several special edition launches, November is going to be equally exciting, with four new launches and unveils lined up this month, including two new very important Marutis, a new Skoda SUV and a sporty Mercedes sedan. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. Maruti Suzuki eVX November 4 First showcased in concept guise at the 2023 Auto Expo, Maruti Suzuki will globally unveil the production version of the eVX electric SUV on November 4 in Milan, Italy. This underscores the eVX’s importance as a global product for parent company Suzuki, as a significant portion of the production of the made-in-India EVs, has been marked for export to Europe and Japan. Indian audiences will have to wait until the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025 to see the production-spec eVX in the flesh. This will be Maruti’s first born-electric vehicle that will also spawn a Toyota derivative. The eVX will get a 60kWh battery which is said to give it a range of up to 500km, and it will also come with an AWD system. The price announcement is slated for March 2025. Skoda Kylaq November 6 Skoda will unveil the Kylaq on November 6 in production form, which will be the company’s first attempt at the sub-compact SUV segment, and it will be based on the MQB-A0-IN platform that also underpins its larger sibling, the Kushaq. However, to slip under the 4-metre length, the Kylaq will have a shorter wheelbase as compared to the Kushaq. Skoda says it will be the first model to bring the new ‘Modern Solid’ design language to India but it isn’t likely to stray too far away from the Kushaq, to maintain a family look; the interior, too, is expected to be largely carried over. The Kylaq will be powered by the familiar 1.0-litre TSI turbo-petrol engine that will come with 6-speed MT and AT gearboxes. The price announcement will be due by early-2025. Maruti Suzuki Dzire November 11   Following Maruti’s first EV will be the launch of one of its core volume generators in India, the all-new Dzire. Although it will be based on the new-generation Swift, recent Dzire spy shots gave us a completely uncamouflaged look at the compact sedan, and at least visually, it looks far removed from its hatchback sibling. The new Dzire boasts a much sharper and mature design and is even likely to include a segment-first electric sunroof. The interior and most of the equipment, however, is expected to be carried over, unchanged. The new Dzire will be offered with the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine as the Swift, which makes 82hp and 112Nm. It will also get a petrol-CNG option. Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance November 12 Mercedes-Benz will launch the new AMG C 63 on November 12. The AMG C 63 drops the V8 for a new plug-in hybrid setup that combines a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine along with a rear-mounted electric motor. The engine on its own puts out 475hp, while the electric motor produces 203hp, taking the total output to 680hp. It gets a 9-speed multi-clutch automatic gearbox with all-wheel drive. The C 63 also gets four-wheel steering, and thanks to the 6.1kWh battery pack, can travel on electric power alone for 13km. It also looks sportier than the regular C-Class with the AMG grille and redesigned front bumper with active cooling flaps. The interior, too, will carry AMG-specific touches, like a new steering wheel and new upholstery.

    "description": "We recently reported that Mercedes-Benz had slightly rejigged the variant and equipment configuration on the new-gen E-Class, offering the Superscreen only on the top-spec AMG line trim with E 450 4Matic variant. The company has, however, now clarified that the Superscreen continues to be available as standard on all variants of the E-Class - the E 200, E 220d and E 450 4Matic.  The ‘Superscreen’ setup comprises a 12.3-inch free-standing digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen. The official statement from Mercedes-Benz India said,  \"We want to clarify, Mercedes-Benz during the initial production, manufactured a limited 72 units of the LWB E-Class without the Superscreen, some of which were also used for the certification purpose, owing to an initial shortage of Superscreen. These limited units are since sold by our Franchise Partners. Mercedes-Benz however, will continue retailing the LWB E-Class in the current E 200, E 220d variants and the upcoming E 450 variant, with the MBUX Superscreen as a standard configuration.\" The E 200 and E 220d variants come in the Avantgarde spec, while the range-topping E 450 4Matic is available in the AMG Line trim. The two trims were largely differentiated on the cosmetic front with different looking bumpers and wheels. Also See: New Mercedes E-Class review: Has the best gotten better?",
