    "description": "The Ampere Nexus is currently the most premium offering by the brand and has been designed and developed in India. It exists in an extremely competitive space, where it is up against not only legacy OEMs but also established electric vehicle startups. The big question is: Does this new kid on the block have the credentials to hold its own against the rivals? Well, here’s what we discovered. The Nexus is a handsome-looking scooter finished in this shade of Zanskar Aqua. Not only is it bright and eye-catching but it also has a beautiful pearlescent finish under direct sunlight. Its design cues are subtle and tastefully done, and its overall build quality is decent. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. There is a deep storage compartment located under the handlebar, but the shape is odd, and the plastics have a sharp edge, which feels built to a cost. The boot can swallow up most half-face helmets but will struggle with a full-face one, especially with its bulky charger inside. A deep cubby that’s usable, but the plastic surrounding it is quite sharp. In terms of features, the Nexus gets an LED headlight that performs very well and a bright and legible 7-inch TFT display. However, the display isn’t very smooth and, at times, had a delayed response to my touch inputs. The UI could be nicer, and it is also a little harder to use with gloves. 7-inch TFT is legible even under direct sunlight but needs a better UI. While the piano black switchgear looks premium, with its tightly packed buttons, it demands Blackberry levels of muscle memory to use.  Its tightly packed buttons demand muscle memory to use. The charging socket is located near the footboard and looks like a bit of an afterthought. Even the charger looks rather simple and not as well-designed as offerings from its rivals. Unplugging the charger involves pressing two release buttons simultaneously, which can get a little tedious. The charging socket doesn’t look as premium as the rest of the scooter. Despite its simplistic design, this charger is capable of juicing up the Nexus in around four hours. However, a bigger issue is the time it takes for the Nexus to boot up right after charging, which can sometimes take as much as five minutes in my experience. That is something that needs to improve. Overall, while this is a premium scooter, it could do with better attention to detail and finish. Ampere’s Nexus delivers a comfortable and nimble riding experience, making it well-suited for urban commuting. Darting through traffic was an easy affair, and the suspension made little work of any unexpected bumps. I’ve also received good feedback from those pillion riders. The suspension irons out most bumps with ease as long as the speeds are low. With a telescopic fork and twin rear shocks, the overall setup is well-controlled and leaves very little to complain about. Handling is good, and it is only on hard impacts at higher speeds where the scooter will generate an occasional hard thud. All in all, this scooter does a commendable job of striking a good balance between ride and handling. The Nexus features three riding modes: Eco, City and Power. The throttle response is smooth across all modes, ensuring a predictable ride without jerky acceleration. However, it is a bit too dull and reserved up to about 25kph even in City and Power modes. In my experience, these two modes struck a good balance, and I’d often oscillate between them on my commutes. On the other hand, Eco mode is very slow and is best reserved for extreme bumper-to-bumper traffic or to get home on a low battery. For reference, in Eco mode, the Nexus takes over 12 seconds to reach 40kph, whereas the TVS iQube takes a mere 4.63 seconds to do the same. In our tests, the Nexus performed adequately, with a 0-60kph time of 12.98 seconds in Power mode, which makes it one of the slower scooters in its segment. It features a 3kWh LFP battery and sports a peak motor output of 4kW. The Nexus has a certified range of 136km, but in our tests, we managed to extract just under 100km, which is around 10 percent lower than similarly priced rivals with similarly sized batteries. Zanskar Aqua is by far my favourite shade on the Nexus. In City and Power modes, you can expect a range of about 50km to 70km, respectively. Once the battery drops to 10 percent, the Nexus goes into limp mode, which severely limits performance. The Nexus’ braking performance is decent, and the combi braking system works well. However, the brakes require a firm pull and could do with better feedback. In our tests, the Nexus managed to come to a halt from 60kph in 22.04m. For reference, the popular TVS iQube managed to do the same in just 19.71m. The Nexus is a comfortable and endearing electric scooter, but it has areas that need improvement. Ampere’s Nexus is clearly the best-made and most premium offering by the brand yet, but it still has some catching up to do compared to its rivals. The Nexus’ LED headlight provides excellent illumination. The Nexus’ excellent ride quality, comfort and practicality work in its favour and give it a slight edge over its competitors. However, it still needs work on its overall finish and the end-user experience to meet what people have come to expect at this price point. If comfort is all you seek, then the Nexus could be the one for you, but buyers looking for a more polished experience will find other alternatives.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/triumph-speed-t4-road-test-review-433878#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Triumph’s Speed T4 stands as the most affordable product from the British manufacturer and undercuts the relatively affordable Speed 400. This iteration arrives just a year after introducing the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform, owing to its origins as a development-stage variant. It does beg the question if one should consider the Speed T4 over the Speed 400, given that they’re separated by less than Rs 25,000. Surprisingly, I’ve come to prefer the Speed T4 in a lot of ways. While the overall silhouette remains the same, very little of the design has changed, and it would be hard to tell the two apart at a glance. The easiest giveaways are the graphics and front fork, which is now telescopic and not finished in gold.  Unique graphics for the T4, but could use more vibrant colours. Furthermore, the handlebar, headlamp mount, and footpeg holders aren’t made of aluminium; instead, they are made of steel. Triumph has also excluded the Speed’s adjustable levers and engine immobiliser. A legible speedo with an illegible, tedious-to-read rev counter. You do get the same semi-analogue speedo and switchgear, but you miss out on features like ride-by-wire and traction control. While overall quality levels are good, it lacks some of the higher-quality parts found on the Speed 400. Regardless, the Speed T4 is a handsome-looking motorcycle despite appearing slightly less premium in comparison.    The T4 offers an upright and comfortable riding posture, making it well-suited for city commutes. However, a noticeable increase in seat height due to different tyres may make it less accessible for riders under 5’8”. The seat is now narrower but still well-cushioned and supportive. Triumph has addressed this by narrowing the seat near the tank, aiding shorter riders in flat-footing the bike. However, it comes at the cost of comfort to some degree, and one will notice the lower levels of support on longer journeys.   To keep costs in check, Triumph has downgraded the T4’s suspension from a USD fork to a telescopic fork, along with cost-effective MRF bias-ply tyres. Given the more relaxed nature of the bike, neither come across as noticeably poor compromises. The tyres are good enough, and the suspension feels comfortable in most circumstances, although hard hits in bigger potholes do make the suspension feel a bit soft. The T4 is agile, but it’s not a bike you buy for aggressive riding. Heavier-set riders will benefit from adding some preload at the rear. Interestingly, Triumph says it has reworked the steering geometry and tuned the suspension to mimic the Speed 400’s ride dynamics. The T4 retains nimbleness despite a longer wheelbase, making it well-suited for relaxed urban riding. The overall setup is satisfactory for its intended audience. Taller tyres perform quite well but increase the overall seat height. Triumph has moved to an axial caliper and organic brake pads, which are more affordable but, in our test, can perform on par with the Speed 400’s braking performance. My issue is not with the braking performance, but instead with the lack of bite and feedback from these brakes.   At its heart, the Speed T4 retains the 398cc engine from the Speed 400 but with notable changes. Power has dropped from 40hp to 31hp, accompanied by a slight reduction in torque to 36Nm. Punchy motor has a wide torque band and is quite efficient. Key changes include a smaller throttle body, revised camshafts, a redesigned airbox, and a 31 percent increase in crank inertia. While this may sound disappointing on paper, the Speed T4 was less than 2 seconds slower in our tests than the Speed 400. More importantly, the in-gear acceleration figures were only milliseconds apart, owing to the wider spread of torque. The T4’s motor may not be as quick-revving as the Speed 400, but it impresses with its more relaxed, torque-rich riding experience. Bassy exhaust sounds great but could use a better-looking finish. It’s in the concrete jungle where the engine’s mellow nature shines. The wide torque band and smoother throttle allow for effortless manoeuvrability, with the sixth gear comfortably holding as low as 60kph. The overall experience feels smoother, the exhaust sounds bassy, and this comes a lot closer to what you’d come to expect from a modern classic. Fuel efficiency, too, has gone up, and in our test, the T4 managed to get about 38kpl on the highway and 32kpl in the city, which would put it on par with some of its rivals. By the end of my time with the T4, I found myself preferring its motor over the more expensive Speed 400.   The Speed T4 is a lovely machine that perfectly embodies the modern classic experience on a budget. It might lack some of the Speed 400’s premium features and outright performance, but it offers a more subdued, approachable and cost-effective alternative. Good looking headlamp that offers adequate levels of illumination. Its relaxed engine, refined throttle response, and urban-friendly demeanour make it a compelling choice, especially for those prioritising ease-of-use over raw performance. While the Speed 400 presents even better value, the Speed T4 is quite a different proposition, and its relaxed nature makes it quite an appealing alternative as well as a good rival to the likes of  Hero’s Mavrick 440 or even the Royal Enfield Classic 350.

    "description": "Beating a Porsche on the legendary Nürburgring is no mean feat, especially when the Porsche in question is the Cayenne Turbo GT Coupé. But the 2025 Audi RS Q8 Performance did just that. A full-size SUV with 640hp and enough tech for an Engineering Explained video, the RS Q8 Performance might look like a standard Q8 with some blacked-out bits, but that’s the kind of thought that will have you gasping at its performance. We had it for a whole day on a race track and in the Spanish countryside to see what all is new and how much of a difference it has made. 2024 Audi RS Q8 exterior design  On the face of it, the RS Q8 Performance continues with stern expressions and almost no emotion. There is no smiling grille or angry air vents; it’s sleek, sharp and means business. What’s new over the older version are the LED Matrix headlamps with multiple daytime running lights (DRLs) options and a re-profiled grille finished in gloss black with a 3D honeycomb pattern. Wrapped around the grille is a massive carbon-fibre frame, and there’s more carbon fibre on the front lip and air vents. LED Matrix headlamps are standard. The bumpers are sportier and more aggressive than before, and what’s really nice to see is that there isn’t an ounce of chrome to be seen anywhere on the car. Over to the side, the optional 23-inch wheels look stunning (22-inch come as standard), and these help shave 20kg off the total SUV’s weight. Hidden behind these large rims are massive 420mm carbon-ceramic brake discs (standard on the Performance version) with red brake calipers. Carbon fibre on the outside rearview mirrors finishes off the changes at the side. OLED tail-lamps get customisable DRL designs. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance gets OLED tail-lamps conjoined by an LED light bar, some more honeycomb pattern on the bumper, and a gloss-black diffuser with carbon-fibre surrounds for the oval exhaust tips. Dramatic is not something you’d call the RS Q8 Performance, despite its many oversized bits and plenty of carbon-fibre trimmings (courtesy of the optional Carbon Pack). It’s the perfect look for the introverted car guy, especially in the subtle Satellite Silver paint shade. 2024 Audi RS Q8 interior and features  On the inside, the introversion is even more pronounced as there is little that will ‘wow’ you. As standard, the Performance version gets the Sport Seats Plus; these seats offer lots of bolstering and are also very comfy for long drives. And there is the same honeycomb pattern with Race-Tex and all-black upholstery. But barring all that, it’s all very simple – very high-quality, but nothing that will make it look fast while stationary. Even the steering, which was a chunky flat-bottom one on the previous car, is now a simple round unit. The racy one has been tucked away in the options list. However, you can choose between red, blue or grey for the upholstery contrast stitching. For anything more, like maybe a panoramic sunroof, you’d have to start ticking the options list. Its interior oozes quality but lacks the drama you’d expect from a 640hp super SUV. The centre console features the all-too-familiar dual-screen layout, and apart from the RS modes and drive settings, it’s all very simple and straightforward. At the rear, the RS Q8 Performance has enough space for three adults, and there’s four-zone climate control with electric sun blinds for added comfort. But would you want to be chauffeured in a 640hp super SUV? I think not. 2024 Audi RS Q8 performance  Performance is literally this RS Q8’s name, and it is truly mind-boggling. Sure, it has beaten the Cayenne around the Nürburgring, but what does that mean? Is it fun? Or is it a weapon to be wielded only in the hands of a professional test driver? To find out, we did a few laps around the Parcmotor Castelloli in Spain, and a few laps is all it took to showcase why and how this is the fastest SUV around the Nürburgring. Powering the RS Q8 Performance is a 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8, as before, but it now makes 40hp more, bringing it to 640, while max torque is 850Nm. The 0-100kph sprint takes an astounding 3.6 seconds, and the SUV can haul all the way to the good side of 305kph. The increase in power is the result of the catalytic converter’s repositioning, which, in turn, has reduced exhaust back pressure. The turbo boost pressures are also higher now, and the end result is an engine with virtually no lag. To add to this instant boost is a 48V mild-hybrid system that lends a hand during acceleration, which means no matter how tight the corner, you can exit it with all the brute force available. The real star is the nimble chassis. The 8-speed Tiptronic gearbox is rapid, too, but select Dynamic Plus or any of the RS modes, and it shifts with lightning-fast speeds. The paddle shifters are also quite responsive, and in manual mode, you can have total control of the shifts. On straightways, the acceleration is a blur, and given the SUV’s driving position, it’s hard to believe that you can be seated this high up and travel this fast. The sense of speed is immense, and the engine sounds terrific at full pitch. Audi has a reputation for making silent cars, but in this, it actually removed some of the sound insulation so you can hear even more of the engine noise on the inside! After all those e-trons, this sure comes as a welcome change. Out on the public roads, however, the engine changes character in a flash. Swap from the Dynamic or RS mode to Comfort mode, and it puts the leash and muzzle on the engine instantly. You can amble through town without being noticed and in comfort. The engine has a soft burble, which only amplifies post 4,000rpm and, of course, through tunnels. The ease of driving it as a daily driver takes you by surprise, especially if you’ve been hooning it around a racetrack an hour ago. 2024 Audi RS Q8 ride and handling  Speaking of hooning around a racetrack, pin-point handling is not something you expect from an SUV the size of the RS Q8 Performance. Yet, thanks to all the wizardry under the skin, it corners like it has an identity crisis. It refuses to acknowledge it is an SUV; instead, it identifies as a hot hatch. Many things are at play here – active roll stabilisation, all-wheel steering, Adaptive Air Suspension Sport and the new Quattro Sport differential – words you’d find in engineering textbooks but with the effect you’d find in comic books. The RS Q8 Performance holds the lap record on the Nürburgring for the fastest production SUV. The RS Q8 Performance corners with absolutely no body roll or understeer, and despite the power and torque available on tap, it always has the grip to save you. A lap record definitely needs precision, which the RS Q8 has, but even for mortals with not even a fraction of the pro talent, it is very hard to look bad on the track. The power split is 40-60 as standard, but in case of slippage, it can send up to 70 percent power up ahead and 85 percent to the rear wheels. Then, there is the electromechanical active stabilisation, which is basically a motor between two halves of the anti-roll bar. On long, straight highways, the two halves are disconnected, which reduces pitching and vertical movements, but as soon as you get to the corners, they link up and twist the bar in the opposite direction to the turn, thereby reducing roll and keeping the car as level as possible. It sounds complicated, but when you notice the steering is on full lock and you haven’t keeled over in your seat, it makes sense. Ride comfort with large 23-inch wheels is surprisingly good. Ride comfort is also surprisingly good, given the weight and, more importantly, the large 23-inch rims with low-profile tyres. The adaptive air suspension is compliant in Comfort mode and tries its best on broken patches, but for Indian conditions, the 22-inch ones will undoubtedly be more comfortable. 2024 Audi RS Q8 verdict and India launch details  Audi has not confirmed the RS Q8 Performance for India as of now, but given the strong response to the older version, it is likely to make it back to home soil in 2025. Prices would be slightly higher than the outgoing version, but you can expect it to be extremely competitive against its arch-rivals, the Lamborghini Urus S and Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. As a performance SUV, the RS Q8 ticks all the boxes. It is large, mighty fast and loud enough to shake up the mountains, and best of all, incredible to handle, too. It does not have the flash of a supercar or super SUV, but not everyone wants that kind of attention all the time. For those who love the concept of a ‘sleeper’ or discreet performance, this is what you should get your hands on – enough space and comfort to drop the kids off to school or do an airport run and enough power to never be late.

    "description": "From “The Perfect SUV” to “Undisputed. Ultimate.” The Creta’s positioning statements might seem pompous, but based on its stellar sales performance, Hyundai has every right to boast. Competitors have come and gone, yet the Creta continues to stand tall with demand growing from strength to strength. A lot has been documented in our reviews and comparisons on the good and not-so-good bits of the Creta 1.5 Petrol IVT. So, in this long-term report, I’ll keep the focus on my Mumbai-Goa-Mumbai drive experience, a round trip of about 1,200km. I started my journey at the break of dawn, and the fastest route suggested by the Creta’s on-board maps was NH66, commonly known as the “old Mumbai-Goa highway”. I had forgotten to carry my phone charger, and because the Creta lacked wireless smartphone integration, I had to rely on its in-built navigation throughout. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with its accuracy and the detailed guidance it provided. I particularly appreciated it when it clearly suggested whether I had to climb onto a flyover or go from below. How did I manage to charge my phone? Well, its wireless charger had me covered.  On-board maps are surprisingly accurate and even get detailed guidance. With light traffic and some newly laid roads, I managed to keep the average speed high. However, the default ‘City’ mode felt a bit inadequate, especially on the winding uphill sections. Sport mode added more pep, with a sharper throttle response and the IVT gearbox keeping the engine spinning in a higher rev band. I must add that the engine doesn’t enjoy being driven hard, as it feels out of its comfort zone and sounds strained, though it does the job asked of it. What I didn’t like was that in Sport, even the steering weight increases, which didn’t add any more feel but only added to the effort required. Also, keeping the transmission in ‘S’ mode wasn’t ideal, as it spun the engine closer to its redline, thus making it sound very boomy. Hence, my ideal setting on a highway drive is to keep the gearbox in ‘D’ and drive mode in ‘Sport’, heavy steering notwithstanding. The SUV’s high-speed stability is good, and handling is predictable, but it rolls a fair bit; hence, sporty it isn’t. And over wavy surfaces, you can experience vertical movements more than in its Volkswagen or Skoda rivals. While the ride quality is generally good at low speeds, it hits sharp potholes in a rather jarring manner. Sharp potholes come through in a rather jarring manner. What’s the fuel efficiency it achieved? With empty roads, Sport mode and an enthusiastic style of driving, the Creta returned a little over 9kpl. On the positive side, I reached Goa in just 9.5 hours, which included an hour’s worth of stops to refuel the car and myself. However, for my return, I left closer to noon – a bad, bad decision. The journey on the NH66 felt starkly different in terms of traffic, and all the diversions I had sailed past on my way to Goa were suddenly clogged and seemed never-ending. As a result, average speeds were much lower. Over the course of this journey, I got a chance to experience some other bits in more detail. For example, the Bose sound system is good, but I think Mahindra’s Sony, MG’s Infinity and Tata’s Harman speakers are noticeably better. Also, its rear speakers are noticeably softer, so the audio experience at the back is quite poor. A sliding armrest is missing in an otherwise well-equipped car. The Creta’s lane assist works in an unobtrusive manner, giving you gentle feedback to stick to the centre of clearly marked lanes. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) works the smoothest when the distance between your vehicle and the one in front is set to maximum. However, once the vehicle ahead slows down and picks up speed, the Creta accelerates automatically to its preset speed very slowly. The auto high beam assist worked like a charm, dipping the high beam upon detecting vehicles ahead. I wish the throw of its LED headlamps (in low beam) was better. Finally, for a car that’s ergonomically spot on, the non-adjustable armrest felt like a glaring oversight on Hyundai’s part. I would have preferred a sliding unit. The journey to Mumbai was nearly 2.5 hours slower, but with a mix of City and Sport drive modes and much lower average speeds (52kph), the Creta’s fuel efficiency was around 12.5kpl.  Powered, ventilated driver’s seat is comfy for long drives. My highway drive reiterates that the Creta petrol IVT isn’t an enthusiast’s choice but is perfect for a majority of buyers who value its refinement, relaxed nature, interior comfort, and the sheer amount of features it packs in. This is reflected in its sales, too. The share of petrol variants in the Creta’s sales is around 60 percent, of which merely 10-15 percentare turbo-petrol (including N Line). And quite honestly, for its sheer well-roundedness, the petrol IVT is the one I’d recommend. Is it “The Perfect SUV”? Well, not quite, but it certainly comes very close.

    "description": "We round up the past year’s news highlights While 2023 was the year electric cars slipped into the mainstream and their popularity boomed to a point where the 2035 EV-only target began to look achievable, 2024 was the year that brought the automotive world back down to earth with a bump and showed there really is still an awful long way to go. The slowdown in EV sales growth, driven by incentives ending in powerhouse markets such as Germany, comes as car makers are forced to contend with increasingly strict emissions mandates in the EU and the UK, thereby creating a paradoxical environment in which electric cars must be sold in volumes that are, in many places, currently greater than the market demand. Throw in a trade war with China, the onset of pivotal new technical regulations and a turbulent geopolitical environment, and this has been yet another transformative year for the car industry – one that will be seen in years to come as either the catalyst for change or the start of a difficult period for the sector’s electric push. The hybrid renaissance Around the middle of the year, car makers started to rethink their own target dates for going EV-only. The growth of electric car sales proved far slower than projected, with just a 6% year-on- year (January-September) increase in Europe, compared with 28% for the whole of 2023. Much of this downturn was driven by Germany (down 29%). Porsche was one of the first to fold, confirming that its Cayenne – which had been due to go EV-only in 2026 – would be offered with pure-ICE and hybrid power well into the next decade. Mercedes also extended the life of models such as the A-Class, which had previously been earmarked for the chop in favour of a new wave of EVs. Skoda was another, delaying its upcoming electric estate and extending the lifespan of its small combustion models, while Suzuki refused to set a date for its second EV, which would follow the e-Vitara, instead telling Autocar it was “monitoring” the market before any decisions would be made. Elsewhere, stalwarts at Volvo and Ford also reneged on their pledges to go electric-only by 2030. When Volvo made its announcement, the company’s then deputy CEO, Björn Annwall, told Autocar: “If we want to be consistent with the strategy that we believe we’re going to be fully electric but we accept that it takes longer, [then] keeping the existing cars alive a little bit longer could make sense.” This was echoed by Marin Gjaja, chief operating officer of Ford’s Model E electrification division, who argued: “I don’t think we can go all in on anything until our customers decide they are all in, and that is progressing at different rates around the world.” He added that the brand’s previous target had been “ too ambitious”. This, of course, made adhering to stricter emissions regulations, such as the UK’s zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate and similar laws about to be launched in the EU, even harder for car makers. The upshot was manufacturers limiting ICE car sales in order to hit these targets. Tariff turbulence While all of this was going on, the same European car makers were squabbling with law makers over how to deal with growing sales of China-made EVs. The likes of MG and BYD were claiming chunky market shares by undercutting rivals on price, largely thanks to production costs being heavily subsidised by the Chinese state The European Commission’s solution was to impose large import tariffs on all electric cars made in China. BYD and Geely were taxed at 17% and 18.8% respectively, while MG owner SAIC was slapped with the highest rate of 35.3%, on top of the 10% it already paid. Even Western car makers operating in China were affected. Among them, BMW, which makes cars such as the iX3, Mini Cooper EV and Aceman in the country, and Renault (Dacia Spring), were both hit with an additional 20.7% duty.  Geely-owned Volvo announced plans to further increase European production of some EVs in future, partly in order to avoid the tariffs. Tesla, which has a factory in Shanghai, escaped with a lower 7.8% rate due to its subsidies in China being lower than those of its rivals. These tariffs will last for at least five years, having been ratified in November after a trial period. Although the move was intended to level the playing field for European car makers, several of the industry’s leading firms have railed against the introduction of tariffs. Skoda sales chief Martin Jahn told Autocar: “We don’t think tariffs can solve the situation.” Renault CEO Luca de Meo said it was time to “find a deal” with China’s car industry before an all-out trade war erupted. China is duly looking to respond, by throttling European car makers’ supply in the region, and the effects are already being felt by a struggling Volkswagen Group. The owner of Audi, Bentley and Porsche reported a decline in pre-tax profits of £2.75 billion, with “difficult decisions” to be made to balance the books, including the possibility of heavy job cuts. Along with rising fixed costs (including electricity and wages), a 10% drop in sales in China, one of its biggest markets, hit the company hard. The cheap car returns Until recently, EV development had centred on large, premium cars as manufacturers sought to maximise the return on their early investment and recoup the much higher production costs of electric vehicles.  But as EV demand stalled and emissions rules bit, the need for a focus on the development of small, cheaper EVs became clear. Chinese car makers had already shown it could be done with the likes of the sub-£25,000 MG 4, which was the catalyst for the firm’s revenues reaching £1.3bn last year. Of course, it would be up to others to see whether profits could be made from small electric cars without production being subsidised by the state. In March, with Europe’s car brands on the back foot, de Meo went on the offensive and decried Europe’s regulations as “objectively favouring premium models”. He called on the authorities to help redress the balance by actively promoting the development of affordable cars again. Nothing from governments was forthcoming, but the Renault Group ploughed ahead anyway and launched the Dacia Spring, a bare-bones EV offering 137 miles of range with a headline-grabbing £14,995 entry price. Crucially, it was the cheapest electric car in Europe – but notably one that is built in China, making it a more viable business proposition. Even with the 20.7% import tariff, there are no plans to move production to Europe. Renault has since followed it with the made-in-France 5, priced from £22,995, and Volkswagen is readying both a sub-£25,000 ‘ID 2’ and sub-£20,000 ‘ID 1’. New Government This year also brought a change in government, ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Come October, there was a lot riding on new chancellor Rachel Reeves’ autumn budget, but it turned out the answers to many crucial questions weren’t hiding in her shiny red briefcase. As part of its election manifesto, Labour promised a host of car-and driver-focused pledges, including to reinstate the 2030 ban on new ICE cars (with some hybrids allowed until 2035) to provide “certainty” for car manufacturers that really didn’t know which cars they would be able to sell when we entered the next decade.  It also pledged to lower soaring insurance costs and help EV buyers by increasing the number of charging points, as well as introducing a battery health standard to promote the uptake of second-hand EVs. Yet October’s autumn budget proved something of an anticlimax, and despite major lobbying efforts from the automotive industry’s main players, no buying incentives were introduced for electric vehicles.  Calls were made to delay the planned roll-out of vehicle excise duty on electric cars from 1 April 2025 onwards, in part because their higher list prices meant a disproportionate number of EVs would be hit by the £40,000 luxury tax threshold.  Instead, the government brought parity the other way by doubling VED for most new combustion-engined cars. Elsewhere, fuel duty was again frozen for another 12 months. ZEV difficulties At the time of writing, the ZEV mandate debate has taken quite a turn. For one, Stellantis cited it as the reason for proposing to close its Luton van factory.  CEO Carlos Tavares had previously threatened this outcome and branded the policy a “terrible thing for the UK”. Hours later, the government confirmed it may redraw the ZEV rules. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said he was “concerned” by how the current “inherited” laws “are working at the moment”. The debate has raged for most of 2024, with car makers struggling to hit this year ’s 22% EV sales mix target, despite big fines.  Next year’s 28% target looks especially daunting. Indeed, ICE sales are now being suppressed in pursuit of the target, adding to the rising disruption. The industry will welcome these latest comments, but is the change of tone from the government too little, too late.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/our-favourite-cars-2024-toyota-gr-yaris-evo",
    "description": "You can take your dream car to the max without leaving second gear – you just need a frozen lake You don’t have to drive fast to have a good time. Case in point: my outing in the revamped Toyota GR Yaris Evo was the most fun I’ve had in a car this year, and I never even got out of second gear. In my defence, I was on a frozen Finnish lake. That sheet of ice was near Jyväskylä in the 1000 Lakes region, the heartland of Finland’s rallying scene and, handily, home to Toyota’s World Rally Championship team. And it was the perfect canvas on which to experience the capabilities of the Japanese firm’s hot hatch.  Well, some of its capabilities, at least: if you want to experience the GR Yaris’s mighty acceleration and assured high-speed handling, you’d be better off trying it on a circuit, as my colleague Matt Prior did. But if you want to feel just how pliant, poised and controllable the GR Yaris is, well, you need ice, ice, baby. And it really is controllable. It didn’t take much practice before I could pitch it into a slide and control it on throttle alone for a surprising amount of time. Of course, it helped that I had a pro-level Finnish rally driver alongside passing on some vague knowledge of Scandinavian flicks and sideways driving – but it helped more that the GR Yaris is just such a wonderfully balanced thing. With its evocative 1.6-litre turbo engine, it’s hugely potent and pleasingly wild without ever feeling intimidating, and the updates for the facelift (including a better seating position and dashboard layout, and a new auto ’box) marked genuine improvements.  Even in an unfamiliar environment, I never felt out of my depth – well, at least until Jari-Matti Latvala gave me a passenger ride. It turns out you can drive fast on a frozen ice lake, although my rearranged innards still question if it was more fun.",

Given the caliber of the custom builders that grace these pages, it’s a tall order. Each year’s routine is the same, starting with a ‘short’ list of 30-plus bikes. Once that’s trimmed down to a more palatable size, I eliminate any bikes that have already placed in our ranked Top 10, in the interest of fairness.

Given that it’s 54 years old and 250 cc, expecting it to do much more than maintain 55 mph is asking a lot, and it did that without complaint. Ultimately, my experience of the bike is more reverence than critique. What it lacks in power and all-around performance, it makes up for with character and charm, which shone through in unexpected ways. Over time, I began to actually appreciate its overtaxed 18 hp single.…",

I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki has crossed the 30 lakh unit production target with the Dzire. It took the sedan over 5.6 years to achieve this goal from 20 lakh in 2019, while the journeys from 10 to 20 lakh and zero to 10 lakh took over 4 years and 6 years, respectively. With this, the Dzire joins the Alto, Swift, and Wagon R Arena stablemates, who are already part of the 30 lakh milestone club.  Maruti launched the first-generation Dzire at Rs 4.49 lakh in 2008 One in every two compact sedans sold is a Dzire The 'Made-in-India' Dzire is exported to 48 countries  In November, Suzuki debuted its fourth-generation Dzire with a new petrol engine, added features, and safety enhancements. As of the time of writing, the ex-showroom prices (Mumbai) for the car range from Rs 6.79 to Rs 10.14 lakh. Before this model, the third (2017), second (2012) and first-generation (2008) Dzires were also despatched in good numbers, making it Maruti’s bestselling sedan. As per data from JATO Dynamics, one in every two compact sedans sold in the country is a Dzire. Talking about exports, the Dzire remains one of Maruti Suzuki's top five models sent out of India. Currently, it is exported to 48 countries across regions such as Latin America, Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, with around 2.6 lakh units shipped so far. In the fiscal year 2024, the Dzire was Maruti’s second most-exported passenger vehicle. In the under-4-metre sedan segment, the Dzire rivals the second- and third-generation Honda Amaze, Hyundai Aura, and Tata Tigor.  IMAGE SOURCE Also, see: 2024 Maruti Suzuki Dzire review: India's favourite sedan massively updated New Maruti Dzire variant-wise features, trims and prices explained New Maruti Dzire launched at Rs 6.79 lakh",

    "description": "BYD has recently been busy registering new design patents in India. While the September filing pertained to the Bao 3 EV, it was followed by the Denza N9 PHEV in October. Notably, this comes ahead of the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January 2025, in which BYD has confirmed its participation. However, official communication from the Chinese brand over the presentations of these two EVs is yet to come.  Denza is a luxury new energy vehicle (NEV) brand owned by BYD Bao 3 is manufactured by Fangchengbao, an off-road-focused subsidiary of BYD BYD India’s current line-up has BYD eMAX 7, Atto 3 and Seal electric cars BYD Denza N9 BYD-owned Denza is a luxury new energy vehicle (NEV) brand headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Sitting on a 3.1-metre-long wheelbase, the N9 runs 5.2 metres long, which is Mercedes GLS territory. The Denza N9 is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), as per the listing on China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology website.  The N9 PHEV is powered by a combination of ICE and EV powertrains. Combustion duties are handled by a 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine that generates up to 206hp. Further, N9’s electric setup makes a 924hp combined output from a front-axle motor and two motors for each rear wheel. Its 47kWh blade-cell battery is good for a range of 165 kilometres. There is an all-electric N9 with a similar three-motor setup with a maximum of 965hp on tap. BYD Bao 3 The Bao 3 electric SUV is built by BYD’s Fangchengbao off-road-focused subsidiary. Based on the Super 3 concept car, the 4.6-metre SUV will be slotted above the Atto 3 (4.4 metres). Bao 3’s front (149hp) and rear (299hp) electric motors are designed to simulate a four-wheel drive (4WD) setup. It has a 0-100kph sprint time of 4.9 seconds and maxes out at a top speed of 201 kph. A separate design patent for the SUV with a roof-mounted carrier was also registered here by BYD. BYD’s presence at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo will be marked by its existing electric vehicle line-up and other NEVs. Stay tuned to find out if the BYD Denza N9 and Bao 3 will make it to the expo next month.
