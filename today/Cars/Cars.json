    "description": "This 1978 Lincoln Continental was modified in the style of a 1960s Batmobile during a project commissioned by the seller that was undertaken between 2013 and 2018. The work involved overhauling the 400ci V8 and three-speed automatic transmission, fitting fabricated fiberglass bodywork, bubble-style windscreens, and a custom interior, and refinishing the car in black with red bat graphics. Features include hooded headlight surrounds, batwing-style tail fins, an emergency beacon, and a siren in addition to a rear turbine-style vent, polished vertical stacks, and a power-operated hood and trunk lid. A touchscreen DVD stereo is mounted to the dash, and replica props include a bat phone, an anti-theft activator, a bat ray control lever, and a batbeam firing button. This Batmobile replica is now offered in Canada with clean Ontario registration in the seller's name.",

    "description": "This 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint 1300 was built in November 1964 and delivered new to Madrid, Spain. Chassis AR385591 was subsequently brought to the US, where it underwent a repaint and an interior re-trim in the 1990s prior to installation of a 1.6L twin-cam inline-four in the early 2000s. The car is finished in blue and rides on Koni shocks along with 15\" Fergat-style wheels. Inside, the low-back front seats are trimmed in gray tweed with blue vinyl sides and are accompanied by a wood-rimmed Nardi steering wheel along with refurbished Veglia instrumentation. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transmission, and further equipment includes a cabin heater, a single Weber carburetor, and front disc brakes. This tipo 101.02 is now offered by the selling dealer with an Alfa Romeo Classiche Certificato di Origine, service records, historical photographs, and a clean North Carolina title.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/company-cars/benefit-kind-reporting-company-cars-be-phased-out",
    "description": "Starting with the 2026/27 tax year, employers must collect any tax at the same frequency as employees are paid HM Revenue and Customs is phasing out annual benefit-in-kind reporting for company cars. The reforms come into effect from 6 April 2026 and, with draft legislation not due until 2025, many fleets are facing short deadlines to comply with those changes. Starting with the 2026/27 tax year, employers must report the value of any workplace benefits (anything provided in addition to salaried income) to HMRC through their payroll software and collect any tax at the same frequency as employees are paid – even if that’s weekly.  Although some employers have already opted into that newer system, many still collect drivers’ benefit in kind monthly, report using a P11d form at the end of the financial year and collect any backdated tax at the same time. They have less than 18 months to reform that process. Simon Down, director at Deloitte’s employment tax automotive team, warned that this could create administrative challenges – such as ensuring vehicle changes are reported to payroll more frequently, including downtime for repairs and courtesy car loans that last more than 30 days.  “A key risk is that, with a reduction in the amount of time to collate, validate and process fleet data, mistakes could be made,\" he said. \"These could create a very poor employee experience where they are taxed on vehicles they should not be taxed on, or if there are other problems with the data that are not identified and fixed within the narrow payroll window.  “Where these negative experiences are allowed to occur and persist, a company car scheme could come under negative internal scrutiny. Ensuring quality data and a robust approach to collate, validate and process that data is critical.” The reforms also affect salary sacrifice schemes, where employees pay the monthly lease cost out of their pre-tax salary and (if the car emits 75g/km of CO2 or less) benefit in kind for the use of the vehicle.  Cheryl Clements, head of business development at Tusker, says the payrolling of benefits gives drivers more transparent, predictable monthly costs while reducing the risk of backdated tax bills. However, she advises opting in early – businesses have until the start of the tax year (on 6 April) to register. “You've still got five months, so why don't you do it from April 2025?\" she said. \"It isn’t going to take long to set up and a lot of people will be waiting until April 2026. If you need to involve your payroll team or payroll provider, they may be under the cosh to get everybody set up and on board.  “Get in contact with HMRC. Then speak to your payroll team or payroll provider to say: ‘This is what we would like to do. What do we need to do to make this happen?’ They should be able to work that through the system.” Alex Ali Marks, associate director in Deloitte’s employment tax automotive team, suggests similar. He said: \"Stakeholders need to understand their obligations and responsibilities in advance, communicate changes with employees and look for opportunities to automate data collection. “There are naturally some items which cannot be confirmed until HMRC’s guidance has been finalised. However, most actions can be planned for and started ahead of this as some items, such as agreeing new terms or arrangements with suppliers, can take some time to come into effect.\"",

    "description": "Sixty jurors from 23 countries had selected seven cars each to form a longlist of 42 eligible vehicles The Car of the Year shortlist for 2025 is dominated by small electric cars. Among the seven shortlisted models are the Alfa Romeo Junior, Citroën ë-C3, Hyundai Inster and Renault 5. The shortlist is completed by the Cupra Terramar, Dacia Duster and Kia EV3. The winner will be announced at the Brussels motor show on 10 January. Sixty jurors from 23 countries selected seven cars each from a longlist of 42 eligible candidate cars launched in 2024, and the seven cars with the most votes have made up the shortlist. Hyundai's new city car is the smallest car on the list, while the 5 (nominated jointly with the Alpine A290) and ë-C3 (ditto with the petrol C3) are superminis. The Junior is a crossover that's offered in both electric and hybrid forms and is closely related to 2023’s Car of the Year, the Jeep Renegade. The EV3 is the latest electric Kia to make the shortlist. The Kia EV6 won the 2022 Car of the Year award and the Kia EV9 came fourth last year. As for the non-electric models, the Terramar is a hybrid SUV that’s closely related to the Volkswagen Tiguan and competes in a new market for the fast-growing Cupra brand. Remarkably, the Duster SUV is the first Dacia to ever make the Car of the Year shortlist. The 2024 Car of the Year was the Renault Scenic electric SUV. The BMW 5 Series and Peugeot 3008 completed the podium. To qualify for Car of the Year, cars must be all-new. Facelifts are not permitted, nor are derivatives allowed. Car of the Year statutes dictate that: \"The main criteria on which a car should be judged are the following: general design, comfort, safety, economy, handling and general roadworthiness, performance, functionality, general environmental requirements, driver satisfaction and price. Technical innovation and value for money are major factors.\"  Autocar is a sponsor of and has a jury place on Car of the Year, which was first held in 1964, when the Rover 2000 took the prize.",

    "description": "As with the older Tour-X4, Arai’s latest Adventure helmet is very versatile, in that it can also be configured as a road helmet without the peak or an MX-style helmet without the visor. However, it now addresses a universal complaint with the previous Tour-X4 – its visor change mechanism that needed the removal of four screws. The new one debuts a much easier system where the entire peak and visor can be removed by using just a small push tab under the covering plate. In typical Arai fashion, it’s a marvelously over-engineered solution that can be intimidating to use at first, but you quickly figure it out, and the system works well. Just ensure that the mechanism is properly clicked into place before you ride off!   The X5 gets a new Pinlock-compatible visor that has a more rounded profile with improved optics. One of the big changes here is the removal of the trademark eyebrow vents in the visor, which is a bit bittersweet. On the one hand, those vents definitely work well, but the flip side is that they tend to leak in continuous heavy rain, even when closed. The Tour-X5 also drops the chin vents on the sides of the helmet jaw. The total number of vents has reduced, but the actual venting is still superb, so I have no complaints.      I spent a week in this helmet at the GS Trophy, which was easily the most intense riding of my life, and the comfort was excellent. The best helmets are the ones that melt away into the background and let you focus on your riding, and this one manages just that.  The Tour-X5’s peak has also been redesigned, and I found that it had noticeably less lift at high speeds on an adventure bike. It also feels much better on naked bikes, with negligible lift at a steady 100kph. However, the tradeoff is that wind noise is quite high, so it’s best to use this helmet on a bike with good wind protection.    The Tour-X5 has a weight similar to the Tour-X4   Weighing 1,650 grams, it is more or less the same as the T4, but like the old helmet, it feels superbly balanced and great for all-day usage. Another really appreciable change is that Arai knows almost all its customers will install a Bluetooth communicator, so they’ve made it easier to do so. The cheek pads now have dedicated circular Velcro extensions for your speakers, and there are even small wire-managing tabs built into the liner. This is definitely the nicest helmet I’ve used for installing/removing a comms device, and it’ll be great to see other Arai models get a similar treatment.    It has convenient cut-outs for speakers   The helmet is now ECE 22-06-compliant, and quality is at a typically high level with a beautiful paint finish, the most luxurious inner liner material you’ll ever come across and a solid, built-to-last feel in every component. As always, this helmet is an investment in a top-quality handmade product, and the prices match that. They currently start at a little under Rs 60,000 for plain colours in Europe and go up for graphics. You will save a significant amount if you shop from some Asian markets, but be aware that Arai’s shell shapes and sizes are different in these markets, so it’s crucial to try before you buy.    Where: araihelmet.eu   Price: Rs 64,000 (approx.)   Also see: Arai Tour-X4 helmet review",

    "description": "If there’s one thing our otherwise very accommodating photo and video crew insist on, it’s an early morning start. The golden hour of soft light at sunrise guarantees beautiful captures.   But today, it’s me leading the pre-dawn charge to our shoot location an hour outside Mumbai for a less noble, more selfish reason. There’s a Lotus Emira waiting on the other side of the journey, and I’m itching to drive it. Drive it hard. There’s just a few hours before our favourite road is swarmed by two-wheelers, trucks and tractors. The window of opportunity is small.   Lotus Emira engine and chassis What is the Emira, and why is it special? In a line, it’s a small, light and tight sportscar – the kind of car that made Lotus Lotus. Think Elise, Exige and Evora. What makes the Emira doubly special is that it is also the last of its kind from Lotus, with the Chinese-owned Brit carmaker committing to an all-electric future in the years to come. The all-electric Eletre SUV and Emeya grand tourer are the ‘new’ Lotus’ first steps in its transformation from sportscar specialist to EV specialist. No volts, amps or range talk today, though. The Emira is a proper combustion-enginedsportscar with its heart literally in the right place – just ahead of the rear axle. The mid-engined layout dictates the Emira’s gorgeous form, but I’ll have time to ogle at it later. Time is of the essence. The engine in question is Mercedes-AMG’s manic M139 unit, better known as the source of power on the mad AMG A 45 S. The highly strung turbocharged four-cylinder unit makes 360hp and 430Nm in the Lotus (421hp and 500Nm in the A 45 S), and more powerful iterations are said to follow. There’s a supercharged V6, too (see below), but the four-pot unit, at the very least, deserves a fair hearing. Let’s not forget Lotus has a long, back catalogue of four-cylinder greats. The engine is nestled amidst an aluminium chassis, and the Emira tips the scales at 1,446kg, all in. It’s not as featherweight as Lotuses of old, but it’s no heavier than a comparable Porsche Cayman either. Lotus Emira performance The Emira’s doors open conventionally (no scissor or butterfly doors here), and getting in is convenient enough by sportscar standards, thick sill notwithstanding. There’s a Lambo-like flap to access the starter button; press it, and the engine rumbles to life. The sound at idle itself establishes that this is no namby-pamby family sedan engine. Let the show begin. I quickly realise I’ve underestimated the potency of the powerplant. Pressing down hard on the accelerator launches the Emira well into the mid-range, and before I can say “turbo lag”, it is well past 6,000rpm. I back off before it does. Woof! I make a fresh start and learn a few more things about the engine over the next few minutes. One, it’s un-turbo-like in its willingness to rev. I think I saw 7,000rpm on the digital tacho. Two, there’s a delightful urgency with which it pulls in the mid-range. It’s almost as if no one told it it’s a small engine. Three, it sounds great. With the engine just behind the passenger cabin, you can hear it breathe intimately. The soundtrack made up of intake noises, hisses from the blowoff valves, a raspy exhaust note, and pops, bangs and crackles on the overrun is better than anything you’d get on the otherwise superb KEF audio system. Despite thin rubber on 20-inch rims, ride comfort is good. The characterful engine eggs you to drive harder, and you know what? The relatively sensible power figure means you can get more out of the engine than you can in an over-endowed supercar. The 4.42-second 0-100kph time isn’t record-setting but is quick in absolute terms and par for the course for this class of sportscar. Oh, and Merc’s 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox is game for spirited driving and is satisfyingly responsive to tugs at the paddle shifters or gear lever. Lotus Emira ride and handling The experience gets elevated when I get to the twisty section of the road. Lotus sportscars have long been revered for their handling prowess. Now I know why. There’s a brilliant connect at the steering. Hydraulically assisted, it feels well-oiled in its smoothness and has the right weight to perfectly communicate what the front wheels are up to. Turn-in is sharp and smooth without feeling absolutely pointy, which, in its own way, makes this car easy to get up to speed with. Grip levels are reassuringly good throughout, and I’m always left with a feeling that the car could have taken the last corner faster still. There’s room for the driver to level up to the car’s capabilities without being intimidated, and that’s a good thing.   Over familiar corners, the Emira’s mid-engined balance shines through. There’s no delay between command and execution, and I feel at one with the car. It’s not a front-row seat to your favourite artist’s performance. In an Emira, you are the artist. A compliant suspension that’s quick to regain composure after a mid-corner bump, beautifully metred brakes and a gearbox happy to oblige with a high rpm downshift are other elements that keep you so, so engrossed in the drive. For the brave, there’s the option to dial up the engagement further by switching to Track drive mode, which reduces electronic intervention and brings with it some twitchiness at the rear end. On the subject, the Emira doesn’t get adjustable dampers. Buyers have to pick between the Tour and Sport packages (different dampers, spring rates and tyres) at the time of speccing their car. Only larger speedbreakers will require a zig-zag manoeuvre to clear. Other takeaways from my drive? Frontal visibility is great, and ride comfort is actually pleasant. I’m not cocooned from road imperfections, but the Emira is also not jarringly stiff as many other sportscars are. The 20-inch low-profile tyres tend to tramline, though, which is something to be careful of on wavy surfaces. There’s no nose-lift function, but a slow crawl is enough for the Emira to clear speedbreakers without making chin or belly contact. However, the Emira has an unusually large turning circle, and as I learn, the gearbox doesn’t like being rushed between drive and reverse. Also, the Emira doesn’t particularly like crawling speeds – it’ll lurch when you want it to inch forward. Lotus Emira interior and exterior It’s when the photo and video crew shoot static shots that I get to really take in the Emira’s design. What a looker! It’s some parts aggressive, some parts delicate, and all parts gorgeous. There’s a fantastic flow to the design, and even the aero scoops and channels don’t look forced or overdone. It’s a thing of beauty in the classic sense. My favourite bit is the rear end, which is home to a high deck spoiler and purposeful dual exhausts that poke out of a mesh surround. “Ferrari hai kya?” Emira draws attention everywhere. It’s rather nice on the inside, too. It’s a fuss-free – simple even – environment that gives the driver easy access to all information and controls. The 12.3-inch digital dials are easy to read; the 10.25-inch touchscreen packs in Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and there are physical controls (hurray!) for the climate control and drive mode functions. All touch points are really well finished, and our test car even had an Alcantara finish on the roof. Also, while the cockpit is cosy, there’s enough space for two large adults to sit in comfort. There’s a degree of practicality built into the cabin with cupholders, door pockets, a storage box between the seats, a usable open space under the centre console and storage behind the front seats (it’s a strict two-seater) for a soft bag or two. The engine cover also lifts to reveal a 151-litre cavity that can accommodate two cabin bags. It may not look it, but there’s enough room for two large adults.   Lotus Emira price estimate, verdict It’s easy to fall for the Lotus Emira. It’s stunning to look at, deeply rewarding to drive and even reasonably India-friendly thanks to a comfy-enough ride. Before you start mentally speccing your Emira (might I recommend the fetching Hethel yellow), there is a spoiler. And that is the price. Lotus is expected to launch the Emira at Rs 3.1 crore (estimated, ex-showroom) before options. To put things in perspective, the sensational Porsche Cayman GTS 4.0 was on offer for Rs 1.6 crore not too long ago. Then again, the Cayman is no longer on sale, and there’s actually no other mid-enginedsportscar available in India for Emira money. The Ferraris, Lamborghinis and McLarens of the world sit way higher up the power and price ladder. The luggage bay aft the engine can hold two cabin bags. The Emira doesn’t have price to power on its side, but driving purists with deep pockets might see the Lotus in the right light. And that is as a loud, proud and emotive sportscar. The kind of car that we grew up lusting for.And one that’s guaranteed to light up your drives for years and maybe decades to come. If you’re on the fence about adding one to your driveway, just remember they won’t make ’em like this in the not-too-distant future. The clock is ticking. Lotus Emira V6 engine If AMG’s turbocharged four-cylinder doesn’t cut it for you, the Emira can also be had with a 3.5-litre supercharged V6. The Toyota-sourced unit makes more power (400hp and 430Nm) and betters the AMG-powered Emira with a 4.3 second 0-100kph time. However, the bigger differences will be in the way the power is delivered and theatrics. Gearbox options include a 6-speed auto and a, wait for it, 6-speed manual, complete with an exposed gearchange mechanism! The other thing? The price difference to the turbo is expected to be all of Rs 10 lakh or so. Something tells me the supercharged V6 will be the engine of choice in India. Manual gearbox an option on the V6.

Mercedes GLC price to increase by Rs 2 lakh Mercedes-Maybach S680 V12 sedan prices to go up by Rs 9 lakh Price hike not applicable to units built by December 31 Mercedes price hike not applicable to models booked by December 31 The brand has clarified that the price hike will apply to vehicles not in stock by December 31, 2024, as well as to existing bookings and those made before this date. Mercedes-Benz India further says that the price hike has been conducted due to higher material costs, inflationary pressures, and logistic expenses, which lead to higher operational costs. This has been creating “substantial pressure” on the Mercedes-Benz business and its overall bottom line. The brand further says that it is “absorbing” most of the cost pressures and passing on a “nominal” portion to the market. Prices for the GLC SUV, which starts at Rs 75.90 lakh, will increase by around Rs 2 lakh, while prices for the Mercedes-Maybach S 680 V12 sedan, priced from Rs 3.43 crore, will go up by up to Rs 9 lakh.

    "description": "What better tribute can we pay Mercedes’ celebrated designer who died recently, than to line up all his greatest works and celebrate them. So much of what we see and like about a car begins with the design. It sets the tone and lends character to the car, and if the designers manage to sync the looks with what the car actually ‘feels like’, they can both feed off each other and enhance the car as a whole. Bruno Sacco, one of Mercedes’ stars and the head of design for Mercedes from 1975 to 1999, often managed to do this. Come November 24, you will be able to see many of his finest designs celebrated at one single location, the Mercedes Benz Classic Car Rally 2024 in Mumbai. Not only will we have all of his best designs placed cheek to jowl, they will also be placed in chronological order, so you can appreciate both the horizontal conformity as well as his vertical progression, just as Sacco would have wanted.  Bruno Sacco was head of design for Mercedes from 1975 to 1999 Born in Italy, Sacco left a lasting mark on the company with his timeless, clean designs and his passion for simple aesthetics. Some of his greatest hits include the 124 model series, with all four body variants, the S-Class of the 126 model series – including the SEC coupe that he had a soft spot for – the ground breaking Mercedes-Benz 190 (W 201) and the R 129 SLs; the latter also being among his personal favourites. He always had amazing clarity. “A Mercedes-Benz must always look like a Mercedes-Benz.” And almost all his cars were designed to age well – clean minimalist lines; large, perfectly sculpted surfaces; and strong chamfered sections that would lend a feeling of solidity. Mercedes-Benz 124 model series in design development. But it wasn't just perfect geometric and seamless form that Sacco was famous for. He was also one of the pioneers of the integrated bumper and side cladding, the latter used to lend a modern air and help break up the mass of the car. Introduced by Sacco in 1979, these side protective strips can be seen on the 126 series S-Class, the innovative 190 or compact class (W 201), the W124 that started it all in India, the W140 S-Class (1991-1998) and the R 129 SL (1989-2001). And Sacco, also put great emphasis on aerodynamic efficiency, which can be seen in the steady improvement over the years, designers working hand in hand with aero engineers, much as they do everywhere today. The R 129 SL was among Sacco's personal favorites.  What’s amazing is that Sacco was only the second dedicated designer to ever be appointed by the body engineering department at Mercedes, the first being another legend, Frenchman Paul Bracq. During this time, he worked with others on outstanding models such as the Mercedes-Benz 600 (W 100) and the 230 SL “Pagoda” (W 113). He also assumed design management for the Wankel engine experimental cars, the C 111 (1969) and C 111-II (1970). On March 31, 1999, Sacco retired and subsequently received several awards like an honorary doctorate from the University of Udine in 2002. He was then admitted to the “Automotive Hall of Fame” in Dearborn, Michigan, in 2006, and to the “European Automotive Hall of Fame” in Geneva in 2007.

    "description": "2011 RUF RT Roadster Location: Miami, Florida Original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: - Mileage: 6,900 miles Price: Call for Price   The Car | 1 of 1 RUF RT Roadster With a reputation for creating the pinnacle of bespoke performance sports cars, RUF can sometimes afford the luxury of creating one-off coach-built vehicles for close family friends and special clientele. The one-of-one RUF RT Roadster was the result of a unique idea presented by such a client to produce a true B-pillar Targa that hadn’t been available from Porsche from the 993 until the 991. This meant engineering a new body based on a 2011 997.2 chassis to create a Targa that would seamlessly combine nostalgia with the exhilarating driving feel RUF is so well known for. The team wanted to pay homage to the very first Targas produced which were famous for their ability to fully remove the rear window to provide a ‘soft window’ Targa experience. The RT Roadster reimagines the iconic rear quarter panel openings that feed the intercoolers, breathing cold air into the twin-turbo 3.8-liter flat-six that produces 650 horsepower delivered to all four wheels through a PDK transmission. Underneath rests a special RUF-tuned suspension and carbon ceramic brakes on all four corners. Finished in a truly bespoke Chromaflair satin paint, the lines of this RT Roadster flow as the paint transitions through its various layers of flake and its undertones are exposed. The interior is finished in contrasting red leather with silver stitching, extended carbon fiber accents, and painted Chromaflair satin interior trim, showcasing RUF's meticulous attention to detail. Factory options include phone connectivity, foldable carbon bucket seats, color-matching hard top panels, matching red leather luggage belts on the rear parcel shelf, and center lock wheels. The RT Roadster was unveiled at Rennsport VI in 2018 and subsequently featured in a MotorTrend article. It has been privately enjoyed by its original owner since then before being offered for sale to the general public. Continue...",

    "link": "",
    "description": "Photography by: Zach Brehl (@zachbrehl) 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole (QV) Location: Toronto, Ontario Country of original delivery: Canada Chassis/VIN: GLA12978 Mileage: 25,334 kms (15,742 miles) Certification : Polo Storico Certification Price: Call for Price     The Car | The 1st nut-and-bolt restoration undertaken by Lamborghini As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer this highly storied, two-owner, factory-restored, US-specification 1986 Lamborghini Countach LP5000 Quattrovalvole. Believed to be the first nut-and-bolt restoration project ever undertaken by Lamborghini, years before the creation of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015, this Countach LP5000 QV represents a unique chapter in Lamborghini history. This 1986 Countach Quattrovalvole, finished in Rosso over Champagne with a Brown dashboard, was originally delivered on April 17, 1986, to a dealership called Autolynn in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. It was equipped with fuel injection to comply with North American emissions regulations and featured USA-specific bumpers. In the summer of 1988, the car was owned by a real estate agent who, after an afternoon drive, parked it in his driveway. Later that day, smoke began to emanate from the engine bay, ultimately igniting a fire that damaged the engine, body panels, and interior, scorching the seats and causing significant smoke damage. Deemed a write-off by the insurance company due to the scarcity and cost of replacement parts, the car seemed destined for obscurity—until the current custodian, a Canadian collector with a deep passion for the Countach, entered the picture. The search for parts was arduous. “I called every Lamborghini dealer in North America, faxed lists, and made countless calls, only to be told that parts were unavailable or would take months to arrive,” the owner recounted. “The factory had shifted focus to the new Diablo, making Countach components nearly impossible to find.” Then, an unexpected call came from a Toronto lawyer representing Lamborghini. The company, aware of his search through multiple inquiries across North America, wanted to inspect the salvaged parts. By 1989, he shipped the car to Milan. Lamborghini’s sales manager, Ubaldo Sgarzi, responded within a week of the car's arrival, confirming receipt and outlining plans to prepare an estimate for the restoration. With the production line for the Countach already dismantled, many parts had to be handmade or specially ordered from original suppliers. The extensive project took two and a half years and cost over USD $240,000— $30,000 more than the price of a new Diablo at the time. “The documentation is immense,” says the owner. Invoices, receipts, and correspondence attest to what was essentially a full rebuild. This restoration stands as a landmark: the first comprehensive restoration carried out by Lamborghini itself, years before the establishment of their official heritage department, Polo Storico, in 2015.   Continue...",

    "description": "4.6 million square feet (honestly, who even measures in kilometres?) of cars, vendors, and sheer automotive freedom – it’s outrageous, especially for an industry that remains a very niche market in a global sense. Yet somehow, this sprawling chaos leads to an extraordinary diversity and quality of vehicles on display. Generally speaking, of course – but […] The post It’s Bigger, It’s Better, It’s SEMA 2024 appeared first on Speedhunters.",

Cadillac shrugged off the protruding tail fins it wore since 1948 in exchange for sleeker integrated ones, and newly stacked headlamps gave the brand’s lineup an all-new look. Today we check out the exterior updates as applied to the new 1965 Fleetwood Eldorado.",
