    "description": "This 1965 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GTA is one of approximately 500 examples of the aluminum-bodied homologation model built between 1965 and 1967 and was completed on September 28, 1965. Chassis AR613705 is said to have been delivered new to Société Française Alfa Romeo (SOFAR) in Paris, France, on October 22, 1965, and raced in Europe through the early 1970s. It was relocated to Japan in 1991 and subsequently purchased by is current owner in 2015 before being brought to Osaka, where it remained until being imported to the US in 2024. Finished in orange with green accents, the car is powered by a 1,750cc twin-cam inline-four that features a twin-plug cylinder head as well as dual Weber carburetors. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transmission linked with a sliding-block rear axle fitted with a limited-slip differential. Further equipment includes 14” Campagnolo alloy wheels, Koni shock absorbers, plexiglass side windows, and a roll cage along with black vinyl–trimmed bucket seats paired with latch-and-link harnesses. This GTA is now offered on dealer consignment with an Alfa Romeo Classiche Certificato di Origine, invoices from 2025, a spare set of Campagnolo alloy wheels, and a clean Montana title.",

    "description": "Fourth-generation SUV gets fresh styling, new interior features and a new electrified AMG derivative in mid-life refresh The Mercedes-Benz GLE is, rather alarmingly, rapidly approaching its 30th birthday. And having racked up more than two million sales worldwide since it went on sale in 1997, badged as the M-Class, and now reaching towards the latter part of its fourth model generation, it has recently received a fairly typical mid-cycle facelift - with an all-new AMG performance derivative added to the line-up: the GLE 53 Hybrid.The M-Class was one of the founding fathers of the modern luxury SUV niche, although the segment as it exists today is vastly different to the one that it emerged into originally. Today, the premium brand SUV ranks have grown to include multiple offerings from a wide variety of car makers in many different sizes and configurations. To truly stand out and pique the interest of potential customers it takes something truly out of the ordinary.In a bid to match the competition head on, the fourth-generation GLE, which appeared in 2019, was developed anew from the ground up, as part of an engineering program that also included the second-generation GLE Coupé and third-generation GLS. Mercedes threw quite a lot of technology at it in an attempt to elevate its appeal – not least a whole new PHEV hybrid powertrain system, which can be teamed with petrol or diesel combustion engines of either four or six cylinders.Of the 10 SUVs that Mercedes currently offers, then, the GLE (and its GLE Coupé sister car) sit around seventh and eighth in the size rankings, below only the GLS and G-Class.",

    "description": "EV1 would be roughly equivalent to the existing Picanto (pictured) Brand's president says it \"definitely needs\" an entry-level electric car aimed at the mass market Kia “definitely needs” an entry-level model to broaden the appeal of electric cars, according to company president Ho Sung Song. Speaking at the brand's second EV Day event, Song confirmed that the company is “internally studying” what an entry-level model would look like – be it a city car to sit below the upcoming EV2 and fight the future Renault Twingo and Volkswagen ID 1, or a more affordable version of an existing model. He also hinted that the prospective EV1 could cost around €25,000 (£21,000), referring to the fact that there will be a difference of around €5000 between the incoming EV2 crossover (€30,000) and the existing EV3 (€35,000). Song said: “If we want to move to the late majority customer target group, definitely we need a lower size of model – or a lower-price model – and we are internally studying what will be our entry EV models, apart from our EV2. “Maybe next EV Day, we’ll show you what we are planning.” The reveal of an EV1 concept next year would put a production car on track to arrive in 2027, the same year as the VW ID 1 is due to be launched and a year after the Twingo. Song’s new comments tally with what he told Autocar last September: that an electric city car to replace the Picanto in the long term was its “next, next target” and that the brand will “need sub-€25,000 in our EV cars”.",

The frontman of Taiwan’s Rough Crafts regularly turns his hand to other makes and models, constantly redefining his comfort zone. Rough Crafts’ latest project is a bigger departure from their usual remit than we’re used to, but it’s no less spectacular. Collaborating with Faber Lai at Faber Studio, Winston set out to turn a brand-new Yamaha Ténéré 700 into a slick flat tracker with all the Rough Crafts hallmarks. As usual, he nailed it. “The flat tracker is one of my favorite styles of custom builds—a nimble narrow chassis, upright sitting position, and wide handlebars, perfect for Taipei’s city streets,” Winston tells us.…",

    "description": "It’s a pleasantly nippy morning, and I’ve just set off on a flashy red/black Aprilia Tuono 457. I’m in Sport mode with traction control switched off before I get going because it’s been a long time since I’ve been aboard an Aprilia Tuono, and I’m itching to have some fun. I stop at the side of the road as the convoy of Tuono 457s being piloted by other journalists passes me by, and I find myself smiling ear-to-ear as that lovely twin-cylinder soundtrack reverberates through the area. With the road empty and visor down, I plonk the Tuono in first and give it a prodigious handful of throttle, and immediately, the front wheel comes up! I almost run into the rev limiter as I shift into second, and again, the Tuono points skyward – we’re in for a thrilling day! Aprilia Tuono 457 design, differences from RS 457 To create the Tuono, Aprilia ditched the RS 457’s fairing, clip-ons and signature tri-lamp headlight setup in favour of a small new headlight and a handlebar. While the Tuono’s LED headlight isn’t as pretty as that of the RS, I do find it growing on me the more I look at it.  The headlight’s design grows on you with time. Aprilia’s technical team has also reprofiled the tank slightly for a little more lock-to-lock clearance and to accommodate the new handlebar, thereby reducing the fuel capacity by a marginal 300ml to 12.7 litres.  Aprilia has reprofiled the tank to accommodate the taller handlebar. The company has also shortened the final drive gearing with a one-tooth larger rear sprocket on the Tuono and given the bike rubber-mounted footpegs (in the same position as the RS), both of which are helpful when riding on the road. Unlike the RS, its footpegs have rubber tops. Since the Tuono’s chassis is the same as the RS, you may wonder why it weighs the exact same 175 kilos when it has a lot less bodywork. Aprilia engineers informed me that the Tuono’s smaller headlight actually weighs a fair deal more than the RS’ larger (but sleeker) unit, and the handlebar and its accoutrements make up for the RS’ fairing, which weighs just 3 kilos.  Aprilia Tuono 457 comfort, handling, city usability On the road, especially our far-from-ideal ones, the Tuono is a much better place to be than the RS because you sit almost upright with a slight bend toward the handlebar. Since the suspension travel and tuning are exactly the same as the RS – which means this is a stiffly sprung bike – the upright riding position makes road imperfections much more bearable. And that added comfort hasn’t come at the expense of the RS’ sublime handling. I’ll wager that, on the road, you’ll not miss the more focused ergonomics of the RS because this Tuono felt just as eager and composed as its faired sibling when attacking corners.  The Tuono 457 marries all-day comfort and engaging performance beautifully. The cherry on top is that the Tuono is also an absolute peach when handling the rigours of the concrete jungle. The parallel-twin engine that powers this bike was already very smooth with gobs of low and mid-range grunt, and with the shorter gearing, things only got better. You can pull away from a dead stop in second gear without protestation, and 45kph in sixth is devoid of any knocking. And despite the shorter gearing, you can comfortably cruise at 120kph (even 140 isn’t too bad except for the windblast) in top gear. And as I’ve said before, the Tuono is more than happy if you want to travel everywhere on just one wheel! So, is this a perfect bike?  Twin-cylinder engine is flexible, punchy and smooth. Aprilia Tuono 457 areas of improvement The Tuono 457 comes very close to being perfect but stops a few yards short. For one, at this price, the exclusion of adjustable levers and sintered brake pads seems like an avoidable oversight, although both are easy fixes for not a lot more money. And – we’ve said this for the RS 457, too – the quickshifter (sets you back a cool Rs 20,050) should be standard on the Tuono at its Rs 3.95 lakh sticker price. It’s also sad that this new naked design doesn’t offer the same looks and wind protection as the traditional semi-faired design theme seen on other Tuonos, setting it apart from most naked bikes.  Its dash is shared with the RS and has loads of features and tech.   Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict   But, in the grand scheme of things, these are minor niggles, which should tell you how good and rounded a package the Tuono 457 is. It can handle anything you throw at it on the road – be it carving corners, touring the country, or just commuting to work – while keeping you reasonably comfortable and engaged. For what it packs, its Rs 3.95 lakh price (Rs 25,000 less than the RS) is also reasonable, and the Tuono has no real direct rival.   Aside from the flashy red/black option, there's also a subtly classy white/grey colour. As I’m sure is clearly evident by now, this bike has me smitten, just like my own previous Tuono V4, and I’m seriously considering spending my money on it. If, like me, you enjoy fast and sporty yet reasonably comfortable machines, then the Tuono 457 warrants serious consideration. Also See: Aprilia Tuono 457 video review",

    "description": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is the go-to luxury car for anyone with money. It’s the German luxury brand’s number one model and the bestselling car in its class, largely thanks to its long wheelbase, which provides the much-coveted legroom rear-seat passengers desire. In India, where luxury sedans are predominantly chauffeur-driven, rear-seat comfort is a top priority. BMW, recognising Mercedes’ winning formula, finally joined the long-wheelbase club with its latest 5 Series. But Mercedes struck back with an even stronger offering – the new E-Class with three engine options, ensuring it covers all bases. The E 450 is priced Rs 14 lakh higher than the E 200. We tested the E 200, the base version, which we loved for its ride comfort, but the engine is a bit anaemic and just doesn’t have the pep customers who want to drive would like. That’s where the range-topping E 450 4MATIC with the M256 engine comes in. The 3-litre, straight-six turbo petrol mill produces a humongous 177hp more than the 2-litre unit in the E 200, and because of that, the E 450, with an ex-showroom price of Rs 92.5 lakh, costs Rs 14 lakh more than the E 200; the on-road price is well north of a crore. However, aside from the upgraded powertrain and all-wheel drive (4MATIC), equipment levels remain essentially the same. So, are the extra horses and traction worth the extra rupees? The answer lies in the driving experience. Mercedes E 450 exterior design Despite the AMG Line package, the E 450 doesn’t look as sporty as the AMG counterparts The E 450 comes in AMG Line trim only, which includes these 5-spoke alloy wheels; high profile tyres, though good for ride comfort, spoil the stance. Visually, the E 450 LWB maintains the stately limousine aesthetic of its lesser siblings. The only differences are the trapezoid exhausts, the AMG Line-styled front bumpers and AMG alloys, which, wrapped in high-profile rubber in the interests of ride comfort, quite frankly don’t look very sporty. Otherwise, it is unlike its AMG counterparts, which flaunt their muscle with aggressive bumpers, flared wheel arches and loud exhausts. Mercedes E 450 engine and performance Not as loud as full-fat AMGs, but still blisteringly quick Smooth 3.0-litre straight-six engine produces 381hp and 500Nm of torque. At the heart of the E 450 is Mercedes’ M256 engine, churning out 381hp and 500Nm of torque. Paired with a mild-hybrid system that adds a temporary 23hp boost, the E 450 rockets from 0kph to 100 in a blistering 4.5 seconds. That’s the kind of acceleration you’d expect from a proper AMG, yet here, it’s delivered in the most refined manner possible. Unlike the full-fat AMG models with aggressive exhausts and crackling overrun sounds, the E 450 remains discreet. It doesn’t shout about its capabilities, but make no mistake – it moves with serious intent. The 6-cylinder engine is silky smooth, and the 9-speed AT is impeccably tuned With a claimed 0-100kph in 4.5 seconds, the E 450 is quick. The 9-speed automatic transmission is impeccably tuned, delivering almost imperceptible shifts in Comfort mode but responding with urgency when you put your foot down. More than just performance, there’s something to be said about a six-cylinder engine, which, quite frankly, is even becoming a rarity in the Mercedes world. A straight-six feels so much smoother, so much more effortless than a four-cylinder, and it’s the velvety punch, the lusty power that marks out this motor. It also sounds so much sweeter and richer than a four-cylinder, reminding you there’s something special under the hood. The other ace up its sleeve is the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, adding a reassuring layer of security when pushing hard or tackling loose surfaces. Mercedes E 450 ride and handling Ride quality isn’t as plush as the 5 Series but strikes a better balance between sporty and comfortable  Long-wheelbase cars often struggle with ground clearance, but not the E-Class – it glides over most speed breakers without scraping its underside. Ride comfort has always been a core strength of the E-Class, and this latest version, like the E 200, remains absolutely top-class. It soaks up bumps, undulations and everything Mumbai roads throw at it with ease. However, dare I say, the ride isn’t quite as plush as the new 5 Series, which has sacrificed a little of its signature sporty edge for an extra degree of comfort. What’s remarkable about the E 450 is that it hasn’t sacrificed anything. It feels sporty, nimble and agile without compromising on comfort – a rare balance that Mercedes has absolutely nailed. Handling and agility are impressive for a car of this size The E 450 is such a joy to drive, you’ll be happy to trade the luxurious back seat for the thrill behind the wheel. Of course, having a strong engine is one thing, but being able to fully exploit that power is another. And that’s where the E 450 truly shines. The body control is superb, the handling precise, and the agility impressive for a car of this size. But what really stands out is the steering. Mercedes has aced it – it’s that perfect blend of accuracy, feedback and lightness, making it effortless to manoeuvre at slow speeds while still being engaging when you pick up the pace. Mercedes E 450 interior and features No other car in its class comes close to the E-Class in terms of rear seat comfort But here’s the question: at slow speeds or in traffic, is it really the driver’s seat you should be in? I ease myself into the back seat to remind myself why the E-Class is the segment’s bestseller in the first place. Step inside, and the E 450’s interior is a masterclass in luxury. The dashboard is dominated by Mercedes’ Superscreen – a stunning combination of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch central touchscreen and a 12.3-inch passenger display. While the tech is impressive, Mercedes has taken a largely buttonless approach, meaning even basic functions like climate control require navigating menus. It’s sleek but occasionally frustrating. The selfie camera in the dashboard for video calls is neat, though one for the rear-passengers might have been more appropriate. Rear-seat comfort is where the E-Class truly distances itself from rivals, especially the 5 Series. In this department, nothing comes quite as close. The long-wheelbase variant offers limousine-like legroom, but it’s not just the space – it’s how Mercedes has used it. The reclining rear seats, which tilt from 24 to 36 degrees, make a huge difference in comfort, allowing passengers to stretch out in a near-business-class position. Pair that with the chauffeur package, which lets you electrically move the front passenger seat forward when unoccupied, and you can comfortably sit cross-legged – just as you would at home. Where the 5 Series falters, the E-Class excels. BMW’s new 5 Series LWB has softened its ride to appeal to chauffeur-driven buyers, but it still doesn’t offer the same seat recline, legroom, or sheer sense of indulgence. One key area where the 5 Series loses out is the lack of rear sunshades–in the E-Class, you get electrically operated sunshades all around, including a rear sunblind, enhancing privacy and comfort. The E-Class is still the reigning champ in terms of rear-seat experience in this segment. The Burmester 4D surround sound system with Dolby Atmos further elevates the experience, turning the E-Class’ cabin into a rolling concert hall. And then, there’s an interesting modern touch – Mercedes has included a selfie and video camera on the dashboard. It’s great for video calls, though one could argue a rear-seat camera for executives attending Zoom meetings would have made more sense. Ultimately, the E-Class is the luxury sedan to beat. For most owners, this will be a chauffeur-driven car from Monday to Friday, but when the weekend arrives, there’s more than enough under the hood to tempt them into the driver’s seat. Mercedes E 450 price and verdict The E450 4MATIC is a perfect blend sportiness and comfort without compromising either   The E 450 4MATIC is the ultimate stealth weapon. It’s got the power and acceleration to rival an AMG but without the loud styling and exhaust theatrics. It delivers everything the E 53 AMG does in real-world driving: effortless power, a rewarding drive and a level of comfort no sports sedan can match. Unless you truly crave the full AMG experience, the E 450 offers 90 percent of the performance with 100 percent of the practicality. It’s the thinking man’s AMG – a car that lets you enjoy serious performance while flying under the radar. The way it blends sportiness and comfort without compromising either is something not even the cheaper 5 Series can match. Pricey it is, but that’s the cost you pay for getting the best of both worlds.

    "description": "There’s little doubt the Hyundai Ioniq 5, our 2024 Car of the Year, is one of the best cars Hyundai has put to market in recent times. Part of this is because it breaks new ground and seamlessly integrates modern EV tech into regular everyday motoring. Using the Ioniq 5 for the past couple of months has literally been transformative. The large 72.6kWh battery and good efficiency of 5.5-6.0km per kWh in Eco mode allow me to charge the battery once a week at work (six hours at 11kW). What makes the Ioniq 5 experience even more seamless is that it is such a comfortable and easy car to live with. It gives between 440km and 460km on a full charge when driven in Mumbai traffic. Sure, it’s wide, and that does take some getting used to in congested Mumbai traffic, but what gets the corners of my mouth to curl up is that it does such a good job almost everywhere else. Take the supple and absorbent ride for instance – near perfect for Mumbai’s lunar roads; the superb sound insulation that creates a hush inside the cabin despite a wedding procession outside, the very comfortable and almost armchair-like seats, which can be adjusted at the front and rear, or the fact that even in Eco mode, the Ioniq 5 has enough zip. And Eco also gives me a range between 420km and 440km on a single charge. It’s big and wide, so squeezing into tight parking slots isn’t always easy. On sections where there are multiple speed cameras, I use the ADAS, which works great so long as the cameras can see the lane markings clearly. It even drives the tight corner inside the Coastal Road tunnel perfectly, slows down for slower traffic ahead, comes to a full stop, and starts up again without any input from the driver. You have to hold the steering wheel, of course; otherwise, the car puts out a warning. You can have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but only if you carry a wire. What I do miss is having wireless Apple CarPlay, a definite pain point as I use Google Maps every day for route selection. The faster route is 15-20 minutes quicker, at times. Other pet peeves include the dull fascia and the lack of a spare tyre, and when you really begin to enjoy driving this rear-wheel-drive version with its sharpish front end and direct steering, the long-travel, soft rear suspension lets you down. I do like the fact that the centre console slides back and allows the driver to exit from the left door quite easily; this helps when you need to park this really wide EV. The best bit is that it’s an EV that is both characterful and charming. Good-quality rubber helps deliver both direct steering and a comfy ride.   Also See: Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 19,500km report Hyundai Ioniq 5 long term review, 15,900km report",

    "description": "Kia has revealed the EV2 concept as the progenitor to the Korean carmaker’s new global entry-level model, which is set to go on sale in 2026. The EV2 will be Kia’s smallest electric car yet. Kia EV2 concept teases company's upcoming entry-level EV It gets radical styling with claw-like headlights and square-spoke alloy wheels The dashboard and windows feature LED animations Kia EV2 concept design The EV2 concept sports an evolved form of Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design language, with the compact SUV’s front end featuring rakish claw-like dual headlight units and thick plastic cladding on the bumper. Over to the side, the EV2 concept gets alloy wheels with funky square spokes, no door handles, and a pillarless design. At the rear, the EV2 concept has low-set tail-lamps that somewhat echo those of the Syros, as well as a roof spoiler. Kia EV2 concept interior and features Inside, the EV2 concept is equipped with bench seating for the front passengers and folding bench-styled seating in the second row, which can be slid back to free up more legroom. In this configuration, Kia claims that there’s enough space for occupants to sit on the EV2 concept’s flat floor. EV2 concept dashboard has LED animations The dashboard is finished in burgundy and doesn’t have much other than the combined instrument and infotainment screen arrangement. Interestingly, the dashboard and windows feature unique LED animations, and the triangular speakers in the doors are removable and portable. Other notable features include a panoramic sunroof, support for over-the-air updates, and V2L (vehicle-to-load) which allows the EV2 concept to power external devices. Kia EV2 concept battery and range Technical details remain undisclosed, but the EV2 will likely use the entry-level 400V version of Hyundai’s E-GMP architecture, which also underpins the larger Kia EV3 and EV4. Therefore, the EV2 is expected to offer a choice of 58.3kWh or 81.4kWh battery packs, paired with a 201hp single front-mounted motor.The smaller battery pack yields up to 434km of range in the EV3, whereas the larger one can go up to 603km on a single charge. Alternatively, the EV2 could sport the 43.3kWh LFP battery pack found in the PV5 electric van. Kia EV2 India launch details Once the EV2 debuts globally next year, it will replace the Picanto hatchback sold in international markets. An India launch for the EV2 has not been confirmed, but it could be brought here as Kia trademarked eight EV names here in 2023.

    "description": "The Skoda Octavia is scheduled to make its comeback to the Indian market this year, and a diesel engine is going to be part of the line-up. As we reported from Auto Expo 2025, Skoda has decided to bring back the diesel powertrain five years after its parent company, VW Group, discontinued all of its oil burners. On the sidelines of the Octavia RS drive, Petr Janeba, Skoda Auto India brand director, confirmed that the diesel-powered version of the sedan will arrive in India in time for the festive season. India-spec Octavia diesel to get 2.0-litre engine Will be brought as a full import Skoda Octavia diesel India launch date and specifications When asked when the Octavia diesel would arrive, Janeba said, “I think late September should be the date before the festive season comes.” He also confirmed that the model would be brought in as a CBU through the Indian government’s GSR 870 rule and would be the same model on sale in the UK. India-spec Octavia diesel to get 150hp engine and automatic gearbox Skoda India’s brand director also asserted that the UK-spec Octavia diesel being brought to our market has a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine, which produces 150hp. An automatic gearbox will be standard fit. Janeba said that, at the moment, there is an internal discussion going on regarding the Octavia diesel’s price point.

    "title": "How (Not) to Rally Scout in the Unkillable Mercedes W123",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Another car bought sight unseen, another “gotta own this one someday” box checked. It also ticked the “probably definitely won’t break down” box, a critical facet for this purchase. The job? Scout the ’22 Overcrest Rally: 10 days, 8-10 hours a day, and thousands of miles, all in one state. Idaho. The 1979 300TD was rough but rust-free, and as my grandfather would say with a touch of irony, “a smooth runner with a straight body.” Despite its quirks, the W123’s legendary reliability and patience testing pace made it the perfect scout vehicle for the rally.   Most of the state is seen from a 72 mile jaunt across i90. A stretch easily defeated by those that would often rather be “there” than wherever “here” was. In about one episode of a podcast it's over and everyone is on to Spokane, Seattle, Portland, or some far off distant easterly place where pizza and bagels are made just right. No one hops off to venture inland to try some finger steaks or french fries from potatoes pulled out of the ground a few hours earlier. There are no grandma's huckleberry pies on the interstate either. But Idaho's uniqueness goes beyond just the food, it has roads. Some of the best one's you'll ever get the pleasure to find. Idaho proudly wears the Sawtooth Mountains at its heart. At the state’s beltline lies Boise, the capital city that initially wasn’t even on our radar. It lay too far below the squiggly tarmac and unknown mud and gravel of the forest roads. Before heading up there, the car needed a few things. It was the crest of summer, and the air conditioning didn’t work. We needed to install the European headlights that came with the car or we couldn’t bear our own existence. It didn’t have a roof rack, which seemed like a shame, and Jasin, the co-driver, a quiet, sharp, and witty man, wanted a bicycle in case we got stranded somewhere. “Dude, We are not going to need a bicycle. This thing is the most reliable vehicle ever made” “We might.” “We won’t…” Despite the w123 being the most reliable vehicle ever made, we ended up looking for a bike. After a bunch of “is it availables” we still ended up just going to a Pocatello pawn shop. We now had a bike (and cooler for Dews) on our roof rack. The air-conditioning swallowed up some cans of r134, and with some hotwiring of the compressor, we had ac. There was no power with it on, but we had it. 77hp with it off, and probably 65 with it at full chat. The vacuum system controlling the HVAC in the car was shot and screwdrivers were shoved through the vents to hold the blower flap open. It was the only way to get air flow. The fact that each one was essentially a guaranteed death by being impaled in an accident wasn’t lost on us, but aircon is aircon, the bastion and oil gilded holy grail of any old shitbox. If you’ve got it, you’re a king, and we had it. Us kings, royal purveyors and surveyors of the almighty road trip. May all without it bow before our superiority, piety, and condescension.  Far up into the mountains, we were met with snow. It was somewhere between \"no problem\" and \"big problem\" in depth, located a two-hour drive from where we’d started, and just 100 yards from the summit. The other side of the summit, and our route out, was right there. You could have hurled a stone and hit dirt on the other side. It was the answer to all of the “do we really want to drive 2 hours backwards?” considerations. The easy answer to this was no. No we did not. This route was supposed to be on the rally, which meant we’d have to drive back the other side just to check it out. The 30-40 yards of snow that swept across the mud was dense, and slushy, the last vestige of a long winter at 9000 feet. Making it through would save half a day of driving. The bike loomed. “What do you think?” “Not great.” “Not great… yeah.” “Should we make a run at it?” “Sure, why not.” Why not was that it was a really bad idea. At that altitude that car, even with the AC off was gutless. Maybe 50 hp. When it was new. 270k miles ago. The gearshift dropped into low and the old OM617 wheezed without spinning the tires in the mud towards the snow. There was no climax, no “ope, he might make it.” It was beached with just a few yards to go. The bike loomed again. Hours passed and after the digging with the top tray of a toolbox got tiresome the conversation got closer and closer to riding back down the mountain. In the middle of the debate a truck rounded the bend. After a chat the driver realized he wouldn't make it through either, but he did have a tow strap. Kings saved by mere mortals, a story for all time.  “Told you we wouldn’t need the bike.” On the way out, some sort of celestial car karma kicked in and the right front caliper seized. The roads were slick with rain and the car was not doing well downhill.  A call out to social media didn’t help and we were forced into heading to Boise to hit up a junkyard. There, the two wrench trick and some elbow grease yanked a caliper off an old w114 250C. It was pure luck the car was there and we knew it. This was the land of Bumpside Ford’s, not the land of vintage German tanks.  On the way out the door of the yard we spotted another w123 parked right next to ours. A turbo diesel sedan with a lot of miles. This thing had been around the block, a million times. It was well worn. The US headlights were in rough shape with one side missing the bezel, and the other side about to be.  The caliper got chucked in the backseat for later We knew exactly what we had to do. Working fast, we yanked the Euro-spec H4s out of their boxes, uninstalled the very nice US-spec lights, and swapped them out. Just as we finished, the owner of the million-block W123 walked up. As is often the case the man looked a bit like his car. He’d seen a few things and his weathered skin and thin wild hair spoke of it.   “Love your car sir.” “Thanks a lot.” “Hey so we noticed you maybe needed some headlights.” “Yep, thats why I was here, but no luck.” “I tell you what, take these.” “What do you want for them?” “Nothing.” The man thanked us, took the headlights graciously, hopped in his car, and clattered away. It's possible we got stuck and that caliper got seized for a reason.  Incredible roads were in abundance. Warm Lake Road, a monument to loneliness, curling up and up eternally, forcing us to shove snow in the engine compartment to keep going. White bird grade. A high bedrock set of switchbacks set in the hills below Grangeville. Both were empty. No one ever came, and it was ours for every mile. These roads are not in your backyard, and it takes significant effort to get out that far past the border of what people consider nowhere, but it's worth it, when you find out they’re all yours.    Continue...",

    "description": "\"The sum of its parts represents something that simply doesn't exist in the modern world anymore, and I had no clue what that was when I got it.\" David Steca didn’t need a project car he needed a daily driver. To the lot of us, that means something sensible and reliable, a car that you can use without thinking about it. To David it meant something steeped in function and style, that could be stuffed with camera gear, and handle complex filming rigs. A workhorse that would help him document stories, not only here for Petrolicious but for his own wrenching and exploration based automotive Youtube channel: Only a Roadtrip Away.    It could have been a simple choice of a simple car. There were plenty of options, cars with air conditioning, modern safety features, dead on reliability, and zero surprises. But David isn’t wired that way. Instead of a practical choice like Volkswagen Golf he bought a Peugeot 205 GTI, a 40 year old hot hatch. An odd choice for a daily, perhaps, but a valiant one. And if you roll the clock all the way back to the 80’s, it was as obvious then as it is now.  The 205 GTI was a working-class hero of 1980’s France, a true product of its era. It took what the Volkswagen GTI started and pushed things a bit farther. Where the GTI was predictable and planted, the 205 GTI was nervous and eager, rewarding drivers who knew how to handle its infamous lift-off oversteer. When it launched in 1984, it was designed to be a workhorse with a wild streak, a car that could handle the daily grind and still make a grocery run feel like a rally stage. For the French, it was practical but never boring, a commuter car with a backbone, something that could slip through tight Parisian streets during the week and carve up back roads on the weekend. It found a home with young professionals, tradesmen; collars but no ties. It wasn’t precious. It was just good. In a way, David is exactly who Peugeot had in mind when they built it. He was just 40 years too late to snag one off the assembly line.  This Peugeot, however, wasn’t a hero, not yet. The brakes were seized, the engine was a nightmare of misrouted hoses and mismatched parts, and nothing worked the way it should. “In the state that I bought it in, it wasn't drivable at all. The brakes were sticking. Everything was just old and cruddy,” David says. He doesn’t sound annoyed or frustrated, he sounds interested, like the car’s condition was, and would be just another part of its story, and his. Sourcing original parts became a treasure hunt, each find bringing the car one step closer to its former glory. Late nights in the garage, poring over manuals and tinkering with the engine, became routine. The goal was clear: transform the Peugeot into a dependable daily driver, something he could trust. It wasn’t about chasing perfection, itwas about striking the right balance between preserving what was there and replacing what was beyond saving. “There's no shortcut. You have to go through everything,” he says.  The 205 GTI rewards that kind of attention. It’s not a fast car by today’s standards, but it feels quick within it’s context. It asks you to be present, to engage. “Every bit of control that this vehicle has is analog,” David says. “You brake way later or you don’t brake at all and you turn way sharper than you would normally do.” There’s nothing digital to filter the experience. It demands a certain kind of dedication, or loyalty, and if you don’t give those, it won’t give anything back. David’s approach to getting the Peugeot going wasn’t about achieving perfection. It was about understanding the car for what it was and bringing out the best in it. There’s a humility in that, and an honesty in giving the car its purpose back. When he talks about the car, it’s clear he discovered more than he expected. Now, the humble hatchback is not only David's daily driver, but his on set workhorse, a humble partner in his film creations here in Petrolicious, on his own Youtube channel, and elsewhere.  This 205 GTI isn’t only a tool for getting from A to B, despite David’s original intent. It’s a shade of his life philosophy. David isn’t interested in rushing or forcing things into place. He lets stories, whether on film or on the road, unfold naturally. He works through what’s in front of him, trusts the process, and knows that if he does it right, the end result will speak for itself.  Continue...",
