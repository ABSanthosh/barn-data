    "description": "The Triumph Speed Triple turns 31 this year. In those three-plus decades, it has evolved in leaps and bounds and built an unrivaled cult following. Scores of riders love it for its unapologetic looks, sharp handling, and characterful triple-cylinder engine—this writer included. The new Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RS takes everything good about the newest incarnation of the Speed Triple and cranks it up another notch. Visually, there’s not much to distinguish the 2025 Speed Triple 1200 RS from the outgoing model—but although the updates are subtle, they’re also impactful. To be fair, last year’s Speed Triple hardly needed a refresh. First released in 2021, it boasted a new 1,160 cc engine and a lightweight, razor-sharp build that made it handle better than bikes half its weight.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lexus-drops-ls-uk-line-after-35-years-sale",
    "description": "Luxury saloon was first launched here in 1990, but homologation and legislation issues have led to its withdrawal The Lexus LS, the first car launched by the Japanese brand here 35 years ago, has been dropped from the UK line-up. The decision follows a sustained period of poor sales of the hybrid V6-powered saloon, with 39 sold since the turn of the decade – including just three last year. This means the ES is the only Lexus saloon still offered in the UK as new. Homologation and legislation issues are other reasons the LS has been dropped, Lexus confirmed to Autocar. A spokesperson added that the popularity of the new LM luxury MPV – which is in the same segment as the LS – also contributed to the decision. The saloon continues to be sold in other European markets and can still be bought from stock in the UK. Before going off sale, the LS range started from £101,000, rising to £128,000 in top-rung Takumi guise. Every LS was powered by a hybrid set-up comprising a 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine, two electric motors and a lithium ion battery. This combined for 354bhp and a top-end 0-62mph time (when four-wheel drive was optioned) of 5.4sec. Lexus’s decision brings to an end a lineage that began in the UK three and a half decades ago. The first-generation LS 400 (pictured above) arrived in the UK in 1990, just after it was launched in the US - the key market for the brand. Lexus’s first model was used to position Toyota’s offshoot as a maker of refined luxury vehicles that could take on Europe’s and America’s elite – and for a cheaper starting price. Since then, a further four generations have followed in the UK – the final, badged LS 500, being launched in 2017 and subsequently updated in 2020. The brand’s UK line-up now comprises the LBX, UX, NX, RZ, RX, ES and LM.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/renault-5-stay-fresh-latest-ev-tech-design-wont-change",
    "description": "Electric supermini is in line for important battery and tech upgrades in coming years but don't expect a 'facelift' Renault will preserve the new 5 supermini’s retro design for as long as possible but keep the car competitive throughout its life cycle with upgrades to its drivetrain and technology.  Company CEO Fabrice Cambolive outlined his plans for the Renault 5 on the sidelines of the 2025 What Car? Awards, where the supermini was named Car of the Year - just days after also being named the European Car of the Year.  He attributed the 5’s early acclaim to its striking, 1970s-inspired design, technological capability and distinctive handling characteristics – “when you win like that, it’s because you are different” – and said Renault will bolster these attributes to ensure it stays fresh but will not drastically change its design at any point.  “The good point of R5 is that we would like to stay with this design as long as we can,” Cambolive said.  Renault will not look to change the \"details\" of the 5, but rather update \"very, very precise elements\" throughout the car's life cycle, Cambolive suggested. \"It's opening a lot of creativity for [head designer] Gilles Vidal and his team to keep the same car, but different. That's the idea for R5.\" From a technical standpoint, the Renault 5 lines up neatly – in terms of range, power and charge speed – with its current Vauxhall Corsa Electric, Peugeot e-208 and Mini Cooper E rivals – and Cambolive suggested the firm is committed to ensuring it remains so as those cars are upgraded and renewed, and as the electric supermini market expands. \"We have to invest in the way we do our battery management, for sure. We'll invest in terms of connectivity, and we could invest also in the versatility and modularity of the car,” he said. According to traditional timelines, the 5 should be up for a facelift in around 2028, at about the same time as Renault introduces a new generation of electric cars with vastly improved efficiency, rapid charging and much cheaper batteries, as previewed by the Embleme concept. While these cars will be based on a new platform, separate from the 5's CMF-BEV structure, it's likely that the supermini will be able to take advantage of the promised technological developments - chiefly a new battery chemistry that's claimed to cut costs by up to 50% and support sub-15min charge times in its most advanced form. Before that, in 2026, Renault will swap its mainstream EV batteries – including that in the 5 – from NMC to LFP, which it says will reduce costs by 20% while having no impact on range. It’s not yet clear whether that will translate directly to an identical reduction in list price, but if it does, the 5 could drop below £20,000 in the UK.  The 5 is headed to UK dealerships in the coming weeks, having already become the best-selling electric car in Renault’s home market of France, where it was launched in October last year - aping the success of the original Renault 5, which was France’s best-selling car from 1972-1986. Cambolive hailed the R5’s early critical and commercial success as a sign of its potential to claim a large share of Europe’s EV market but said he doesn’t expect it to immediately be as popular as its petrol-powered siblings, the Clio and Dacia Sandero.  He said: \"Even though we are in the fifth year of the Clio, last year it was number two in Europe, just after Sandero, with both cars increasing a lot. But I don't know if we have to fix or to pursue objectives like that - to be number one and so on. For me, what is important is the capacity of R5 to break the glass ceiling of EV adoption.” The role of the Renault 5 is primarily a conquest one, Cambolive said, with the aim that customers buy the supermini \"not because they want to go to an EV, but because they want the R5\".  \"The main objective is to extend our coverage to the other price brackets up to €25,000,\" he said – referencing the upcoming Renault 4 crossover and Twingo supermini that will round out Renault's line-up of small, affordable EVs – \"and then we will count the sales.\"  But, Cambolive said, while outright sales dominance is not the ultimate target for the 5, \"I don't see any reason not to be among the leaders on the market next year\". Europe's best-selling electric cars are mostly SUVs, with the likes of the Skoda Enyaq, Volkswagen ID 4, Volvo EX30 and BMW iX1 featuring in the top 10, but the 5's early success in France – where it was the most popular electric car in November and December – suggests it has potential to capture a large share of the European market. The Tesla Model Y has long been the region's best-selling electric car – and recently the most popular car in general – but Cambolive said matching the American car's mammoth sales figures (nearly 18,000 in November alone) with the R5 \"is not such an objective for us\".  He acknowledged that concerns around EV utility remain an inhibitive factor for growth – \"it's normal for new adopters shifting from ICE to EV to be very cautious\" – but said 40% of Renault 5 orders in France are for the smaller-battery, 190-mile entry version, suggesting that is becoming less of a concern.",

    "description": "Before I start telling you about this unique-looking bag, I have a confession to make: I have organisational OCD and am a creature of habit. I can’t stand disarray of any sort when it comes to packing my belongings, and the way I pack follows the saying – ‘a place for everything, and everything in its place.’ That’s why the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag fits neatly into my life and has become my go-to bag for nearly everything over the past four months, from daily commutes to weekend trips and even shopping. Main pocket is quite deep. This bag is divided into three main compartments comprising an absolutely waterproof main compartment that holds seven litres, accompanied by two ancillary zippered ones that can hold a total of another seven. While seven litres may sound small, I have been able to fit two boxes containing my office lunch, a couple of t-shirts, and a 1-litre water bottle, with quite some room to spare. Kriega claims you can fit a 14-inch laptop into this compartment, but I’ve fit my colleague’s 15-inch one without hassle. Waist belt helps reduce load on your shoulder. Then, there are the two secondary zippered pockets, one larger than the other. Both appear quite slim at first glance, but as you’ll discover, this small bag is capable of holding much more than you think. The larger zippered pocket can hold a thick 500-page novel, a 750ml water bottle, a chunky power bank and my phone charger. In the smaller one, I usually have my old-fashioned leather wallet, sunscreen, a spare pair of spectacles, my Bluetooth earphones and house keys. As is evident, if you’re meticulous about how you pack your things, the Messenger Pro can swallow a lot. Total 14 litres of storage available. Since this is a sling bag, you get one main strap, which you sling across your torso, and anyone who has worn one will tell you that it can get a little uncomfortable on its own after some time. Thankfully, Kriega has also supplied a sturdy waist belt that alleviates most of the pressure from your shoulder. I’ve worn this bag all day for multiple days in a row, and I’m happy to report that you don’t feel any discomfort for the first 5-6 hours. After that, you will start to feel some soreness, but you can always reverse the strap’s mounting to the other side and sling it on the opposite shoulder. At Rs 15,799, the Kriega Sling Pro Messenger Bag is unquestionably a luxurious indulgence. That holds true even in the Kriega context because there are other similarly priced or more affordable backpacks from the same company that are more versatile, spacious and can even be equipped with a hydration bladder. So, to answer the all-important question: to buy or not to buy? The thing is, you’ve got to particularly want this form factor. I can confirm that it works well in an urban context while also being a bit of a unique style statement from a motorcycling perspective. But, if that’s not a particular priority, and if this is your first step into the world of Kriega, you will find some more versatile personal luggage-carrying options.

For years, we’d run our respective long-termers (usually small cars) on the daily commute and then negotiate with our colleagues (usually Hormazd) to borrow a larger one for an occasional outstation trip. Now, as is the tendency of all cars to become big SUVs of some sort, almost all of us run relatively large cars every day and negotiate for a smaller car for quick errands in Mumbai traffic. In fact, the Comet is now in the Sorabjee household and likely sees more use than any of the fancy luxury cars; go figure! Often mistake my earpods for the key. First things first, a big thanks to MG for actually letting us use the Comet for the long term. It completed a year in the fleet last month, and though it’s no longer in my care, I’ve used it the longest so far, and I have a lot of anecdotes. So, in no particular order, here are some of them: Autocar fleet is now more EV than ICE, with one for every need. As it’s seemingly the most compromised in terms of space, I’ve been determined to use it for as many transport missions as possible; it passed them all with flying colours and the amusement of anyone involved. Nothing too major, of course; there were a few big grocery hauls, a large tropical plant and two airport runs with full-size suitcases (the rear seat had to be folded, of course). The one thing I transported in the back seat that fascinated me the most, however, was myself. A friend wanted to try the car out, so I hopped in the back for a roughly 30-minute journey. While the space is fine, it’s not particularly comfortable, with the choppy ride not helping. What’s more, thanks to the large front seats, very little AC draft reaches the back, and the view forward isn’t great. The view through the unique aeroplane-like windows isn’t bad, but they feel like they actually put you on display more. Rear seating is spacious but no fun. Efficient as the Comet is, it’s still a victim of its tiny 17.3kWh battery. The thing is that our long-term fleet is now more EV than ICE, so the sole 11kW ABB wallbox charger at the office gets a solid workout every day. And though every other EV has a much larger battery, the Comet takes just as long to charge, thanks to its slow 3.3kW max charging speed. A slow 3.3kW charger means it takes ages to top up. I’m glad they now offer a 7.4kW version, and if you’re buying a Comet, it is a must. The other updates they’ve added that I wish our car had are the creep mode, hill hold assist and upgraded brakes; it is deeply unsettling to screech to a halt, even when you’re not going that fast. Transport almost anything if you’re brave enough. Over-the-air (OTA) firmware update alerts have popped up on the screen, though I’m not sure about when they actually download and install, as the update requires several minutes of your undivided attention, which I’m never prepared to offer (please, I just want to drive the car). Some things have changed, though; the doors auto-lock and unlock based on your proximity to the car, so you never need to press the button. The annoyance is that the Comet also switches off when it locks, so every time I hop out to open the gate to my home, I have to restart the car when I get back in. I’m sure there’s a way to opt out of this. At times, infotainment screen goes blank or doesn’t start. I do hope it stays with us longer, or better still, MG swaps it out for the updated version because the Comet has now become an indispensable part of the Autocar fleet. Even if not as a daily commuter, it’s great for dashing off for a quick lunch meeting, a trip to the bank, or if you forgot your laptop at home. You can really park it anywhere.

    "description": "The electric car is perfectly noiseless and clean. There is no smell or vibration, and they should become very useful when fixed charging stations can be arranged. But for now, I do not anticipate that they will be very serviceable – at least for many years to come.” Sounds like the predicament we’re in today, doesn’t it? The EVs themselves are sound, but the infrastructure isn’t quite there yet. However, that statement wasn’t made by some industry pundit in Germany, a senator from Washington or a tech genius from Silicon Valley. Those are the prescient words of Charles Rolls, co-founder of Rolls-Royce. And they were spoken in the year 1900. You see, both Rolls and Sir Henry Royce were big proponents of all things electrified. They made dynamos and electric motors for cranes and championed other brands’ forays into electric cars, but before committing their own initials to an EV, they were determined to get it absolutely right. It wouldn’t be until the Phantom-based 102EX of 2011 – a concept that featured, among much else, wireless car charging – that Rolls-Royce first showed proper intent. But still, it wasn’t ready. 2011’s 102EX concept first previewed what a Rolls EV could be. It wouldn’t be for another 11 years – and finally in 2022 – that we got our first glimpse of the Spectre, an EV that didn’t take the form of a traditional saloon car or a more contemporary two-box SUV. No, it was a swooping two-door, four-seat coupé, which is  just as well for the relative aerodynamic benefits that are so important for an EV. But it was more to make a statement that an electric Rolls-Royce could at once be luxurious, dynamic and uncompromising. Rolls Royce Spectre exterior design This Dark Emerald example wafted silently into view under an autumnal sunset in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. We have dinner scheduled soon, so my potential drive time is running out, but I can’t help myself from having a walk around and taking it all in. And it’s quite a walk: 5.5 metres from prow to stern (as long as a Maybach S-Class) and over two metres wide, mirror to mirror. Huge 23-inch wheels don’t look out of place here, and despite all the mass, its fastback roof that stretches down to the tail allows it to look sleek, more so if you specify it in a contrasting colour. This is the most aerodynamic Rolls ever, with a 0.25 Cd, and you can see that in the laid-back grille, steeper-raked windscreen, and even a unique ‘Spirit of Ecstasy’ hood ornament that hunkers lower than the regular lady. Most aerodynamic Pantheon grille ever. The hood ornament is tipped forward, too. As I carefully swing the rear-hinged coach door open – power-assisted, of course – I’m quickly reminded once again of how big the car actually is, as its wingspan takes up half a parking slot. They’re probably the largest doors I’ve seen on a car, so much so that they get their own customisation options – like huge expanses of wood veneer and even the LED-ingrained ‘starlight’ option otherwise reserved for the roof liner. Closing the doors is an easier – and cooler – endeavour, requiring just a press of the brake pedal for the motorised slab to swing shut; don’t worry, it will stop if it detects an obstacle. Rolls Royce Spectre interior and features As the door clicks shut, it suddenly feels like I’m in a sound vacuum, and using my remaining senses, I soak in the grandeur of the interior. It’s somewhat anticlimactic to find it’s exactly the same as every other Rolls – a few angles and surfaces aside – but that should hardly be a complaint, should it? It isn’t futuristic for the sake of it – a trend legacy carmakers often fall prey to when they make an EV. No, the Spectre’s interior is traditional, sumptuous and excessive, just like those of its stablemates. And it’s all real – from the wood to the metal to the leather. I even welcome back my sense of hearing by flicking the AC vent to listen to its characteristic metallic ‘clang’. A detail I love is the ‘Spectre’ wordmark on the passenger side of the dash, surrounded by a galaxy of ‘stars’, which are not painted or engraved but instead made of individual lighting elements set at different depths inside the dashboard, making for a literal three-dimensional art piece. Massive doors get their own customisation. However, make no mistake. This is still the most cutting-edge Rolls ever, and there’s a lot of tech underneath it all, including some debuts like fully digital dials and the latest generation of ‘Spirit’ infotainment system with connected car tech and ADAS features, but it’s designed to never feel overbearing. For example, the auto climate control doesn’t give temperature readouts or numerical fan speeds; a dial simply goes from red to blue, and another goes from ‘soft’ to ‘max’. And yes, there are plenty of physical buttons still, once again proving that real luxury doesn’t bow down to trends that don’t have any real benefit to a customer. Rear seats are big and comfy enough for adults. Two doors but four windows. It’s almost become de rigueur to dismiss the rear seats of any two-door coupé as being, at best, just for kids and, at worst, completely unusable. But this is a Rolls-Royce, so, of course, that isn’t the case. The front seats motor forward a fair bit, but it’s still a bit awkward getting past the coach door into the rear of the cabin. Once you do, though, there’s more space here than most four-door sedans and considerably more luxury. There’s four-zone climate control, too, and while rear passengers don’t get their own doors, they can open their own frameless windows. Perhaps some of this space could have been apportioned to the boot, which, at 380 litres – hampered more than likely by the battery pack – is not a whole lot for such a vast vehicle and will undoubtedly hurt its grand touring credentials. Rolls Royce Spectre range, battery and performance No frunk under long bonnet, just a silver shroud. What would potentially hurt it more is its WLTP range of 530 kilometres, despite its big 102kWh battery. The real-world figure could be considerably less, too, judging by the rate at which the readout recedes on my short drive, because 0.25 Cd aside, this is still a 2.9-tonne car. Sure, the V12 cars aren’t noted for their efficiency either, but at least they can be refilled quickly. Should you find a fast-enough charger, the Spectre can feed from a DC plug at up to 195kW, with 10-80 percent being recovered in a claimed 32 minutes. But there’s more to the story than just that, as I will soon find out. The Spectre is, in some way, the trickiest Rolls to get comfortable with, as I discover while negotiating an oblique sloped U-turn out of our hotel. The seats are low, the dash is high, the windscreen is slim, and worst of all, the nose dips out of view. I can only see the wingtips of the Flying Lady. I nurse it through the tiny town at the bottom of the hill, which is already shutting shop for the night, wondering if I should have just ended my review with that walkaround. Those big wheels wobbling over the cobblestones are only raising my anxiety levels, but as I finally make it onto an open road, it starts becoming clear. The Rolls-atypical raked windscreen and dipped bonnet make it tricky to position easily. As with the interior, this powertrain was intended to be a Rolls first and an EV second. To that end, the power delivery has something few other EVs do – a personality. It’s not an on/off switch like the EVs of old, nor is it perfectly linear like most new ones. It grows and swells, like a locomotive building steam, making for a sensation that’s simultaneously familiar and also unlike anything else. It does a spot-on impression of the effortless excess you get with the V12, albeit smoother still. Sound? It’s digital, of course – an ethereal hum that’s meant to evoke “an orchestra tuning up”. You can turn this off, but even so, they had to engineer some noise in; 700kg of sound deadening made the Spectre so silent that, during development, it was reportedly making people ill! Instead of ‘Low’ in the V12s, the button on the drive stalk says ‘B’, which, like in BMW’s EVs, cranks up both the regen and the power delivery. A quick, firm prod brings the horizon to me, as all 585hp and 900Nm are deployed with the ferocity of the fastest electric cars. It’s a bit unbecoming, so I switch out of it at once, but on the topic, an engineer did reveal that when it’s time for the inevitable Black Badge Spectre, all they’ll need is a laptop to release the extra performance. The hardware has plenty more to give. It covers ground with the hushed effortlessness expected of a Rolls. Wider roads and higher speeds reveal there is some dynamism to this near-three-tonne coupé, as it reins its mass in well through some flowing bends. The trick, planar suspension has already proven that it can manage heavy weights with grace and ease, and the floaty behaviour at low speeds settles down admirably as you go faster. What’s only amplified by the silent powertrain, unfortunately, is the road noise, which on a less-than-stellar surface will always filter in; perhaps a size-down to 22-inch wheels will help. Rolls Royce Spectre price and verdict With the sun now firmly behind the hills, I have to rush back for that dinner, and I realise I’m way more comfortable with the Spectre. I lean on it while entering and exiting roundabouts, and even the treacherous village from before is despatched in a breeze. As I hoof it up the hill, I’m convinced more than ever that the ultimate application for EVs is luxury. Wide 23-inch wheels can be felt on bad surfaces. Range will improve with time and tech, but the blend of refinement and effortlessness is something batteries do even better than petrol. And as the Spectre has shown, there can be character, too. Of course, this level of boundary-pushing doesn’t come cheap, and Rs 7.62 crore (ex-showroom, before options) is what it will set you back by. But in the stratosphere of the market, price matters little if the experience is up to the mark. EVs have been the great equaliser of the car industry. They have democratised the powertrain across various price points, which forces the rest of the vehicle to excel in order to stand out. What the Spectre does is debunk that theory by delivering not only an exceptional Rolls-Royce but an exceptional EV as well. The time has finally come.

But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",

    "description": "The Government of India has proposed doubling the rebate up to 50 percent in one-time tax on the purchase of new vehicles in lieu of scrapping the ones with BS-II or earlier emission norms. The development was confirmed via an official draft notification issued on January 24, 2025. The cap on the rebate currently stands at 25 percent for private vehicles For commercial vehicles, it stands at 15 percent Vehicles qualifying for additional rebates will be at least 25 years old The official draft notification released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) states that a discount of up to 50 percent will apply to vehicles, both commercial and personal, that are BS-I-compliant or were manufactured before the BS norms were introduced. The notification further says that this discount will also apply to BS-II vehicles that fall under medium and heavy private and transport categories. Currently, owners who send their old privately registered vehicles for scrapping receive a 25 percent discount in the motor vehicle tax for the new vehicle purchased. For commercial vehicles, the rebate is capped at 15 percent. The Government of India introduced the BS-I carbon emission norms in 2000, followed by the BS-II emission norms in 2002. This means vehicles qualifying for the additional rebate are at least 25 years old. Owners of these old vehicles who wish to get them scrapped under the Transport Ministry’s Voluntary Vehicle Modernization Program or Vehicle Scrapping Policy can do so through a network of Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (RVSFs) and Automated Testing Stations (ATSs). Currently, there are over 60 registered vehicle scrapping facilities across 17 states/UTs and 75 Automated Vehicle Testing Stations across 12 states/Union Territories in India. The government plans to introduce more such facilities across the country in due course.",
