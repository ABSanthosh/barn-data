    "description": "Viaterra’s Second Skin is a base layer designed for motorcycle riding in hot weather, where the aim is to wick the sweat and moisture away from the body to help keep it cool.  As the name suggests, this is meant to be the first layer you wear under your riding jacket, and it’s designed to be as comfortable as possible. The material is nice and stretchy, and Viaterra has taken care to design the seams to be as unobtrusive as possible. The seams are quite flat, and they all have a piping of soft material around them to reduce chafing against the skin. The result of all this is that comfort is very good, and you’ll be happy wearing this for long days on the bike. What I did notice is that it’s not a high-compression fit like some of the more performance-oriented products out there. You can try a size smaller, but the sleeves might end up being too short. Ultimately, this isn’t a super snug, body-hugging fit, and I found myself preferring to use the Viaterra Second Skin for more relaxed, touring sort of riding rather than high-intensity track or off-road riding, where a compression fit is nicer. Polygiene tech helps keep odour build-up under control. One area where the Second Skin has fared well so far is in odour management. I have found that some base layers can retain odour even after a machine wash, and that hasn’t been an issue here so far. The company uses Polygiene technology, which is a silica-based solution that captures and removes odours from the material. The Second Skin is available in six sizes, and you have a choice of five subtle colours, including a couple of interesting-looking camo-style prints. There’s also a choice of lower base layers in the same material. Both the top and bottom are available for Rs 1,499 each, which is on par with the competition and a fair amount to pay.

    "description": "Nostalgia is a really powerful emotion, and it’s one of the big drivers behind the success of so many brands like Harley-Davidson, Royal Enfield and the born-again Jawa and Yezdi motorcycles. The 42 FJ you see here is the latest motorcycle from Classic Legends, and the initials in its name are a tribute to Jawa’s founder, František Janeček. It has been over four months since the bike went on sale, and Classic Legends finally gave us the opportunity to ride one. And they took us all the way to Ooty to do so.  Jawa 42 FJ engine, chassis While it shares the first half of its name with the smaller Jawa 42, the reality is that these two bikes aren’t very closely related. The FJ not only moves from the 293cc engine to the bigger 334cc mill, but it also uses a different chassis, one that is more closely matched to the Yezdi Roadster. And it is this engine that proves to be the most impressive aspect of the motorcycle.  New Alpha 2 engine is quick and enjoyable. This Alpha 2 engine is the same 334cc as has been seen on some earlier Jawa/Yezdi motorcycles, but it’s been significantly reworked internally. The unit now makes 29.2hp and 29.6Nm, which is a slight drop, but that’s fine because it has made big gains in terms of refinement and rideability. The fuelling is almost perfectly judged, and you’ll encounter no irritating surging or snatchiness at low speeds. LCD is hard to read in direct sunlight. Classic Legends has also tried addressing multiple customer complaints about engine heat. Their solution has been to use a larger radiator fan with a new shroud that is supposed to direct hot air away from the rider’s legs. The weather in Ooty was far too cold for me to confirm how well this has worked, but I can tell you that the fan is quite loud. Jawa 42 FJ performace, handling The best part is the strong mid-range performance, aided by rather short gearing. The Alpha 2 effortlessly pulls you forward in almost any situation, and I even found it comfortably climbing uphill in 4th gear at speeds as low as 28kph. The 6-speed gearbox also feels more crisp and precise, and the whole experience is topped off with a nice soundtrack from the dual exhausts. They not only belt out a surprisingly loud sound but one that’s also deeper than before and is accompanied by some occasional burbles and pops. Exhaust pipes blare out a loud and engaging sound with occasional pops and burbles. The Alpha 2 engine seemed perfectly at home whether ridden at a gentle pace or wrung out over some of the faster winding roads in the region. The chassis was also happy to play along, and the 42 FJ can best be described as easy and agile. Classic Legends quotes 184kg weight without fuel, so this will be about as heavy as a Classic 350 with its 12-litre tank brimmed. In reality, though, it feels lighter and more manageable, and the company has done a good job with this. The FJ was good fun around the Nilgiri’s non-stop bends, with enough lean-angle clearance that it doesn’t scrape its exhausts very easily. That said, it’s not particularly sporty, and you don’t get much feedback about what’s happening on the road, but there’s enough stability, grip and agility for you to trust the bike and carry quite a high pace. The braking is also decent – more front-end bite would have been nice, but the bike slows down well enough, and you have the security of dual-channel ABS. Jawa 42 FJ ride comfort, design The suspension can also be described as decent; I’d have liked it to be a bit more plush and absorptive, but it’s not bad, either. It would have been nice to have a more supportive seat, as this one starts to get achy in about an hour. As for the riding position, your arms are slightly stretched forward to the handlebar while your feet are in a neutral posture. At first, it felt a bit strange, but I found that it’s not bad over longer periods, and the seat-to-footpeg ratio is not as cramped as on the original Jawa 42.  Rear suspension, seat comfort can improve. As for the design, this is a good-looking bike with some typical Jawa traits, like the flowing side panels and twin exhaust pipes. However, the brushed aluminium tank and the overall colour palette seem a bit too derived from the Ducati Scrambler. Quality levels are rising steadily with every new product from Classic Legends, but the overall fit and finish is still some distance away from the competition. Jawa 42 FJ price, verdict At the end of the day, nostalgia will only take you so far, and the product has to stand for itself. Classic Legends’ products have been a bit behind the curve, but this new wave of bikes has brought about some big improvements, and the bikes are now genuinely good to ride.   Of course, the company also has to fix its reputation for quality and reliability, and that’s something only time can prove. But for what it’s worth, I’ve ridden the 42 FJ for three days now with quite a bit of hard riding and speed-breaker jumping, and nothing has come loose or fallen off, and that’s not been the case with past Classic Legends bikes.  With ex-showroom prices in the Rs 2 lakh-2.2 lakh range, the FJ goes up against the likes of the Triumph Speed T4, RE 350s and Honda CB 350 RS, and I think it now makes for a worthy challenger. So yes, seven years after the first Jawa bikes were launched, Classic Legends appears to be at the cusp of a new era, and I now look forward to what’s in store. Also See: Jawa 42 FJ video review",

    "description": "More than the surprise India debut of this long-wheelbase iX1 at Auto Expo 2025, it was the price it was launched at that caught us all off guard. We’ve been conditioned to believe that EVs must be more expensive than their ICE counterparts; call it a technology tax, if you will. But, at Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the iX1 LWB costs Rs 1.8 lakh less than the petrol X1 (as well as all its EV rivals), while delivering much greater room in the back seat. The price is for the first six months of production only, and is the result of local assembly, this being the first BMW EV to be brought in as a CKD. BMW iX1 LWB exterior To the uninitiated, it’s hard to spot the extra 116mm of length at first glance, but to those familiar with the standard model, the stretch is immediately evident. The good news is it doesn’t look ungainly like, say, the 5 Series did after its stretch. In fact, where the standard iX1 looks just a little comical with its exaggerated headlamps, tail-lamps and grille, you don’t get as much of that sensation with this larger vehicle, and to these eyes, the proportions are better. Exaggerated headlamps and grille look more proportional in the LWB model. It’s a shame the wheels didn’t move up a size from the 18 inchers of the previous version; in fact, even their design is the same, and they look a little lost in the large, square wheel arches. 108mm of that increased length is in the wheelbase (now up to 2,800mm), and in case you’re worried about how this affects its speed breaker-crossing ability, BMW assures us the laden ground clearance is around 175mm, which means it’s closer to 190mm unladen. 18-inch wheels look a bit small on the LWB version. Increased length aside, it’s visually identical to the short-wheelbase iX1, even retaining its M Sport styling kit. This gives some requisite attitude to what is no longer a compact vehicle in any sense, and saves it from looking too slab sided. Yes, some of the details might still polarise – tail-lamps and grille especially – but there’s no doubt it looks striking. BMW iX1 LWB interior and features As you might imagine, the lengthening of the iX1 has all gone into the rear of the cabin, and the legroom here is just vast. As before, you’re sat low to the floor in a knees-up position, thanks to the battery, but it doesn’t bother you as much since you have so much more horizontal space to stretch out. It’s also because the seat base has been lengthened by 15mm and softer cushioning has been used throughout, making the seat subtly more comfortable. The backrest can even be reclined up to 28.5 degrees. Huge space at the rear now and seat comfort has improved too. All this makes for a more comfortable chauffeur-driven experience, with space that’s far superior to anything else in the segment. Enhancing the sense of space here is a larger glass area in the form of a bigger panoramic sunroof (now a fixed glass, rather than an openable one) and, naturally, longer windows. However, much like in the 5 Series, the iX1 misses out on rear window blinds, which would have been a worthwhile addition in the LWB version. Dash design is quirky and surprisingly practical. Other spec differences include the removal of the beige upholstery colour; mocha brown is your only option now, and some features that have been removed. Among these are the ‘boost’ paddle behind the wheel which would get you 10sec of extra torque, and the massage function for the front seats. Other features, meanwhile, are there, but for a price, as BMW is offering them as options or subscriptions, including onboard navigation, certain drive modes and even the spare wheel! BMW iX1 LWB performance and range It’s not just features that have been removed, though; the iX1 has ditched its rear motor and now uses a front-wheel-drive setup rather than AWD. With this new sDrive20 powertrain has come a drop in power from 313hp to 204hp, and torque from 494Nm to 250Nm. Naturally, that’s resulted in a dip in performance, with the 0-100kph acceleration times dropping from 5.49sec to 8.31sec, but with the same 66.4kWh battery, BMW’s certified range figure has jumped from 440km to 531km. However, in our short time with the car, we couldn’t do a real-world range test.  It uses the same 66.4kWh battery, but ditches the real axle motor from the SWB model. What we could verify was the performance, which feels noticeably subdued, and not just in comparison to the old xDrive30 version. 200hp sounds like a lot, but this is a larger and heavier vehicle, and during overtakes especially you feel wanting for power, or at the very least that EV-typical instantaneous punch. It definitely has that ‘entry level engine’ vibe about it, and once you make your peace with that and factor in the greater range, the trade-off seems fair. Some of X1's agility has been lost with the added length. The longer wheelbase has brought a more laidback demeanour to the handling too, and combined with the relaxed power delivery, you’re not inclined to push this car as you might have the xDrive30. What’s remained is the excellent ride quality, which is a trait BMW has lately stolen from arch rival Mercedes. Apart from an at-times hollow-sounding thunk on sharp bumps, the suspension is absorbent and even maintains good body composure. BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The front half of the cabin hasn’t changed, for better or worse. This includes the quirky but practical dash and centre console, the hit-or-miss interior quality, and the frustratingly complex i-Drive 9 touchscreen which has swallowed up too many functions (here’s where Merc has stolen a march on BMW). But these are problems for your driver, as the focus with the iX1 LWB is the rear seat. BMW says the car was borne from two factors – buyers’ complaints that entry-level luxury cars felt too cramped for their asking price, and that while market leader Mercedes has a stranglehold on the top end of the market, the bottom end was there for the taking. Think if the iX1 LWB as a sister car to the 3 Series Gran Limousine, and it starts to make sense. It isn't just cheaper than its rivals; it's cheaper than its own SWB petrol counterpart, too. This car, then, is a statement of intent from the Bavarian brand, a flag to mark its territory. And if the combination of superb rear-seat space and a knockout price of Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) entice enough buyers, it might just be what can jump-start the waning entry luxury segment.

    "description": "Combustion-engined A7 was thought to be on the way to accompany new electric A6 Under now-scrapped strategy, EVs wore even–numbered designations and combustion cars odd-numbered ones Audi has reversed its new model naming strategy that differentiated combustion-engined models from electric models using odd and even numbers. The move comes after customer and dealer feedback confirmed the new system was causing confusion. Under the original plan, ICE cars, including plug-in hybrids, were assigned the numbers 1, 3, 5 and 7, while EVs were assigned 2, 4, 6 and 8. At the time, Audi’s then head of technology, Oliver Hoffmann, justified the approach as a way to create a “clear and intuitive distinction” between drivetrain types. This led to notable shifts in model naming: the A4 was rebranded the A5 and the A6 was set to become the A7. The new A7 (due to be revealed on 4 March) will now instead be called the A6, with the electric A6 badged E-tron and the ICE A6 badged TFSI for petrol and TDI for diesel. However, Audi has confirmed to Autocar that it has no plans to change the names of the new A4 and A5, despite the pair being effectively the same car just powered by different powertrains. This is because, under the revised system, the numerical sequence from 1 to 8 indicates the vehicle’s size and hierarchy within the Audi range, irrespective of powertrain type, and the A5 is a physically bigger car than the A4. By the same rationale, Audi said that existing models, such as the electric Q4 and Q6, will retain their current names. Audi models will continue to be identified by letters and numbers, with 'A' designating traditional cars and 'Q' signifying SUVs. Sales and marketing boss Marco Schubert said: “This decision follows extensive discussions and aligns with the preferences of our customers and international dealer network. \"Our updated naming approach ensures a more intuitive understanding of our line-up, making it easier for customers worldwide to navigate our portfolio at a glance.”",

    "description": "The German custom powerhouse WalzWerk has just marked its 35th birthday in the best way it knows—with a handsome BMW boxer bobber. A Frenchman in Morocco takes on the world with a Honda XL 125S, an Indonesian custom shop builds a Honda Trail replica out of a Suzuki, and a Japanese privateer builds a sharp Yamaha SRX600 café racer. BMW R80RT by WalzWerk Marcus Walz is unstoppable. His shop, WalzWerk, built their 1,000th custom motorcycle just over two years ago, and they’ve just hit another significant milestone—their 35th birthday. To celebrate, the German outfit has designed a new limited edition BMW boxer bobber, based on their made-to-order Schizzo custom series. But you’d better act fast if you want one, because almost all of the 35 units they’re building are already spoken for.…",

    "description": "Anyone who’s ever built something will tell you that inspiration can come from the strangest places. In the motorcycle world, it could be a headlight bucket, paint chip or a set of old bias ply tires. For builder Bret Crandell it was something as simple as a 1977 Florida State Inspection sticker that set the tone for his 1966 BMW R50/2 build. While he sought to honor the life his project bike had already lived, the barn-find Beemer proved to be the perfect canvas for a few of his racier ideas as well. Bret hails from Flint, Michigan, which he affectionately calls ‘a post-industrial wasteland city,’ and, he recently quit his full-time gig at Chrysler to pursue his passion. His business is Obsessive Compulsive Design, specializing in the development and manufacture of custom motorcycle parts.…",

    "description": "An extremely rare 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 R Stromlinienwagen has been sold at auction for 51 million euros, or approximately Rs 458 crore, becoming the most expensive Formula 1 car ever auctioned. Notably, it is one of the only four known complete examples fitted with a factory-built streamlined bodywork. The bidding took place at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart (in Germany) by RM Sotheby's on February 1, 2025. Details about the buyer were not immediately revealed. Further, it is the second most valuable car in the world after the 1955 Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut coupe, which was auctioned for about Rs 1,266 crore in 2022. Sir Stirling Moss recorded the fastest lap at the 1955 Italian Gran Prix with the W196 R It featured a 2.5-litre straight-eight engine with direct fuel injection, generating up to 290hp  The W196 R, chassis number ‘00009/54’, has a significant racing history. It was driven by five-time Formula 1 World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio to victory at the 1955 Buenos Aires Grand Prix. The same classic Mercedes F1 car was also driven by Sir Stirling Moss at the 1955 Italian Grand Prix in Monza (in Italy), where it recorded the fastest lap of the race. After its competition career ended, Mercedes donated the W196 R to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum in 1965. For nearly six decades, it was taken care of by the museum, occasionally displayed at major automotive events, including the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, a premier classic car show. The W196 R was a key part of Mercedes-Benz’s dominant return to Formula 1 in the 1950s. This legendary F1 race car featured a 2.5-litre straight-eight engine with direct fuel injection and valve actuation, generating up to 290hp. Its streamlined bodywork was designed to maximise speed on high-speed circuits like Monza, making it one of the most advanced F1 cars of its time.

    "description": "https://youtu.be/2TdYfbosJhc In Stuttgart, two brands are king: Porsche and Mercedes. Their presence is ubiquitous, paved into the roads, the culture, and the very identity of the region. If you grew up there, you were supposed to pick a side and pledge allegiance to one of the two. Jürgen Claus grew up in Stuttgart but didn’t adhere to that conventional German wisdom. Something else had earned his attention. In flashes, glimpses, and a few stolen frames of life during rides on his bike, he would spot a car. It would streak past, barely there, and then gone, but each time, it gave Jürgen something to dream about. Before it was a legend, before it was the car that toppled giants, the A110 was a newly fleshed curiosity. The Alpine was born in Dieppe, France, in the early 1960s as Jean Rédélé’s vision of a “weight is king” sports car built for agility over brute force. He saw weight as the real enemy, believing that the right balance of power, size, handling, and simplicity would create something truly special. What the world ended up with was a fiberglass-bodied, rear-engined scalpel of a car, built on Renault underpinnings. It was compact, delicate looking, and deceptively quick. The A110 would eventually thrive where muscle cars faltered, becoming a Rally tool that affixed its name onto motorsport history. It won everywhere, on the Monte Carlo stages, in the Alps, on gravel, on tarmac. It was light, agile, and utterly unforgiving. In 1973, when the World Rally Championship was officially founded, it was the Alpine A110 that took the very first title, proving that more horsepower wasn’t always better. Other lightweight pioneers like the Lancia Stratos may never have been penned if it wasn’t for the A110. Jürgen’s search for his A110 took him deep into the unknown, pulling threads on rumors and whispers. Finding a regular Alpine in decent condition isn’t easy. Finding a works race car? Almost impossible. The world is full of lookalikes, tributes, and fiberglass imposters. True competition built A110s are ghosts. He eventually caught wind of a car that had supposedly been sold in Hungary, a real Alpine with real pedigree. There were no documents, no clear paper trail, just a lead. He did what anyone with an obsession this deep would do. He packed a backpack full of cash and hit the road. No guarantees, no promises.  Beneath layers of questionable modifications, spoilers, turbochargers, intercoolers, there was something unmistakable. The plaques in the front trunk were still original. On them, the chassis number revealed the truth. The car was real. It didn’t matter that it looked nothing like it should. It didn’t matter that it would take years of work to bring it back. He wasn’t leaving without it. Jürgen spent years undoing the damage. Hours turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. Sanding, welding, reshaping... dreaming. Obsessing. There were no blueprints, no factory records with detailed specs. The A110 wasn’t built with the obsessive precision of a Stuttgart engineer. It was built by French hands, refined through trial and error. Every reinforcement, every brace, every tweak was added as needed. Problems were solved on the spot, one by one with little documentation to follow. There were only 17 genuine versions of this car ever built, and that is in 1973. How many still existed? Just a handful of originals bobbing in  a sea of replicas. Waiting to be discovered, and restored. “My name is Jürgen Claus,” he says, “and I fell in love with a queen. The queen of rallies.”   Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJDrjdXmFeI Dave will be the first one to tell you his ’67 Shelby GT350 isn’t period correct. But when it comes to ticking the boxes of what truly matters, concours rules don’t even make the list. This car is more than a restoration; it’s the embodiment of perseverance, sacrifice, and a vision he held onto for decades. As a teenager, Dave watched the GT350 roll past his gas station, driven by a Vietnam veteran who had bought it brand new. To Dave, it wasn’t just a car; it was a rolling symbol of freedom and individuality. He knew, deep down, it would be his someday. That day came in 1973 when, after a few changes of ownership, he finally made the dream a reality. As it inevitably tends to do, life came by and happened. Marriage, family, and the responsibilities of adulthood meant the GT350 got pushed off to the back of his mind. Still, Dave never let go of the vision he had when he disassembled the car in 1976. Thirty years later, with his family’s support, he finally turned his attention back to the car, not to build a concours queen but to create something deeply personal.  “This car is not necessarily period correct.” Dave says, “It's not a concours car, but it's a hell of a machine because I built it the way I want it.” It took two years of bodywork, engine rebuilds, and assembly. He meticulously archived every bolt and part, documenting every detail as he blended authentic elements with personal touches to craft a machine that fulfills the longing he felt all those years ago watching it cruise by the station. Plenty of people want a factory-spec restoration, a polished time capsule built to live on manicured grass instead of asphalt. Instead Dave built something that embodies everything he values most: hard work, sacrifice, family, and the passion to see something through, no matter how long it takes. It’s not correct by concours standards, but it’s real by every measure that counts. For Dave, that’s all it ever needed to be. Continue...",
