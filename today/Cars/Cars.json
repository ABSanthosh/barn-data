    "description": "I flew to L.A. this past spring to talk about a new project between actor Orlando Bloom, Deus Ex Machina’s Michael “Woolie” Woolaway, and BMW Motorrad. I’m not much for Hollywood, but I was wide-eyed about their idea. They’d take an already naked S 1000 R (a bike I’ve spent a summer on and for which I have an affinity) and make it more naked: a high-performance inline-four turned cooler, lighter, and more nimble. Talks on the new project began when Deus founder Dare Jennings, Woolie, and Orlando met with BMW Motorrad designer Ola Stenegärd and the design crew at the Munich factory in Germany last year. While the rest of the world had caught fire to the stripped-down lines of the R nineT as a starting point, Woolie drew upon his racing background and desire to do something different with the race-inspired S 1000 R.…",

    "description": "Firefighter-turned-custom bike builder Chris Scholtka has a knack for building slick, and somewhat hot-rodded, café racers. This Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 café racer epitomizes his style well—but it was almost built using a very different donor bike. “It started two years ago when an old friend called me,” Chris tells us. “She had received a big birthday gift from her family—a Honda CX650—and wanted to have it customized by me. We had a plan, but sadly the bike was stolen and we had to start from zero.” Chris operates under the moniker Motocrew from his workshop in Cottbus, Germany. And considering the slick custom bikes he typically creates, he was secretly relieved that the CX650 and its gawky frame were no longer part of the project.…",

    "description": "The Classic 650 Twin has been a long time coming, and it is the latest model to use RE’s proven twin-cylinder mill and combine it with the timeless British looks of the Classic 350. While we did sample the bike in the UK last year, this opportunity to ride it around Coonoor helped us understand who this bike is for. Royal Enfield Classic 650 design, features Appealing design and high quality levels found on the big Classic Probably one of the strongest driving forces behind someone’s purchase of the Classic 650 will be its charming design. While this is unmistakably a Classic, its sheer size and that additional peashooter will instantly give away that this is the bigger one.  The Classic 650's design is one of its strongest points. The fit-and-finish is absolutely top-notch here, and the attention to detail is marvellous for a bike at this price point. You get things like chromed-out switch cubes and wheel hubs on all the colourways, and this top variant we rode gets bodywork that’s almost entirely chrome!  The Classic 650’s features set is very similar to the smaller 350’s, and you get the same handsome digi-analogue display and a USB-C charger. It also gets a slip/assist clutch and adjustable levers, but that’s about it. USB-C charger tucked away discreetly below the clutch lever. While it certainly is a head-turner, one little chink in its armour is the gap between the fender and the rear wheel. It’s not really an eyesore, but it stands out like a sore thumb on this gorgeous a machine. Royal Enfield Classic 650 engine, performance Proven twin-cylinder motor has good power, but at 243kg, the bike is rather heavy Aside from the appealing design, another major reason that people will gravitate towards the Classic 650 Twin is its engine. The 648cc parallel twin motor has been lifted straight off the Shotgun with almost no changes, but that’s not a bad thing.  We’ve come to know this engine very well over the years, and it carries forward all of its strong points, such as its creamy smooth refinement, the easy-going but punchy performance, and that lovely soundtrack. For someone looking to step up from a smaller Royal Enfield or buy a retro-looking motorcycle with proper highway capability, the Classic 650’s performance is sure to impress.  The twin-cylinder engine is smooth, powerful and has a lovely soundtrack. At 243kg, the Classic 650 is a big, heavy thing, and you feel that at a standstill and also while pushing it around or during U-turns, but Royal Enfield has done a commendable job of masking its weight once you get going. We rode this bike on some really narrow, twisty roads, and with how well it handles, I’d never have guessed it weighs what it does.  Unlike the Shotgun, the Classic 650 gets a right-way-up fork, which performs just fine and suits its more traditional look, too. Braking performance is also nice, and while the power is more than sufficient, the rear brake felt a little too aggressive; a more progressive, gentler initial bite here would suit the overall demeanour of this machine.  The Classic’s handling belies its 243kg kerb weight. Royal Enfield Classic 650 suspension comfort  With suspension derived from the Shotgun, this Classic has a stiff ride The Classic 650’s rider triangle is spot on, and you’re seated in this really commanding position, just like its smaller sibling. You could easily spend long hours in this bike’s saddle, and it would have made for a great touring machine.  We say “would” because the suspension comfort here (or the lack thereof) really betrays the Classic name. The twin shock absorbers are lifted straight off the Shotgun and have the same 90mm of travel, too. RE says the tuning is slightly different, and while the Classic 650 is marginally better than the Shotgun, it still has that underlying stiff feeling. Stiff shock absorbers don’t do justice to the Classic’s name. While the roads we travelled on were largely well-paved and smooth, over the few bumps that I did go over, I didn’t get the same plush, absorptive feel that the Classic 350 has; it felt rather close to the Shotgun. Another complaint I have is that the Classic 650 runs tubed wire-spoke rims, and while RE is working on a tubeless solution, that is still some time away. Royal Enfield Classic 650 price and verdict Good pricing, pleasing design and performance will find it quite a few takers Ultimately, the Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin is a heart-over-head purchase, and it’s for a casual sort of rider – someone who likes to use their bike as more of a leisure pursuit than as their regular workhorse. Chrome switch cubes are nice to look at and operate, but the placement of the pass switch is unintuitive.  As for the Classic’s pricing, the bike is available in four colours. The base Vallam Red and Bruntingthorpe Blue will set you back Rs 3.37 lakh, the middle Teal (which comes with a colour-matched frame, centre stand and side stand) costs Rs 3.41 lakh, and finally, this top Black Chrome colour will set you back Rs 3.50 lakh.  Same display as the smaller Classic and Bullet, but the headlight housing is much bigger. This places the Classic 650 Twin almost on par with the Bear 650, and it sits above the Interceptor and Continental GT but a fair deal below the Shotgun and Super Meteor. With its strong brand recall, fantastic design and the ability to hold triple-digit speeds without any fuss, the charming Classic 650 Twin could well become one of the bestselling RE 650s, both in India and overseas. Just try to steer clear of any bumps you encounter on the road!",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/vauxhall-corsa-electric-update-brings-266-miles-range-%C2%A329k",
    "description": "Prices for the updated Long Range Corsa start at £28,900 Revised battery chemistry and motor improve Long Range version to 266 miles between charges The Long Range version of the Vauxhall Corsa Electric has received an update that increases its range by 14 miles. Vauxhall attributed the gain to improved cell chemistry in the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery and revisions to the electric car’s motor reducing energy consumption. This means the Long Range variant is officially capable of driving 266 miles between charges, compared with 252 miles previously. For reference, the rival Renault 5 gets 252 miles from a larger 52kWh battery, while the new Hyundai Inster’s 49kWh pack yields 229 miles. The updated Corsa Electric is also distinguished by the inclusion of vehicle-to-load (V2L) capabilities, meaning the car’s battery can power external devices at up to 3.6kW and 16A. This is enabled by using the car’s charging cable with a bespoke V2L 'gun' that will be sold by Vauxhall dealers. Given the Corsa Electric is closely related to the Peugeot e-208, that car is expected to receive the same set of upgrades in the coming months. Prices for the updated Corsa Electric Long Range will start at £28,900 – £1395 more than the unchanged regular version (134bhp, 221-mile range). Deliveries will begin in May. At the same time as introducing the revised Corsa Electric, Vauxhall has increased prices across the rest of the model range. The regular Corsa Electric in Yes trim has gone up by £675 to £27,505. The regular Design and GS models have increased by £500. And the Long Range GS and both Ultimate models are £725 more than previously.",

    "description": "Citroen finds its value niche within the Stellantis juggernaut with a likeable, practical electric hatchback As the various brands of the Stellantis juggernaut try to find their place and identity, Citroën appears to be morphing into the French Skoda, and the best example of that is the Citroën ë-C4, and its piston-powered equivalent the Citroën C4.Years ago, that Skoda comparison would have been an insult, but it certainly isn’t today. Skoda takes shared mechanicals and manages to make them just that bit easier to use, less pretentious and more practical.The ë-C4 attempts a similar trick, taking the basis of a small car and building a bigger but cheaper one on top. So the ë-C4 has the same e-CMP platform as the Peugeot e-208 and is priced in line with that car, but it’s the size of the Peugeot e-308.Citroën has just given it quite a comprehensive visual update to keep the family resemblance with the Citroen ë-C3, and to keep it fresh in a field with plenty of attractively priced alternatives like the Renault 5 and upcoming Renault 4, as well as the MG4 and Kia EV3.As before, there’s also a slightly weird saloon version of the ë-C4, called ë-C4 X. It’s mechanically identical, so we’ll briefly touch on the differences where relevant.",

    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?

    "description": "Shortly after teasing us with the Basalt Dark Edition, Citroen India has dropped yet another teaser confirming dark editions of the Aircross SUV and C3 hatchback. Like in the Basalt, we expect the Aircross and C3 dark editions to only get exterior and interior cosmetic updates. Aircross and C3 dark edition variants to get dark chrome accents Interior to have black upholstery with contrast stitching All cars will likely carry over the same powertrain options Citroen Aircross, C3 dark editions: what to expect? All black exterior finish  The teaser video hints at a stealthy black exterior paint shade for all three cars, along with dark chrome accents for the grille inserts, badges and alloy wheels. The standard versions of these cars have a bumper with silver accents, which could get a darkened finish on the Dark Edition. Additionally, the headlamps could get a smoked-out finish. New black leatherette finish for dashboard  Interestingly, the teaser also gives a glimpse at the interior, which gets a leatherette finish for the dashboard with contrast red stitching. All regular models of Citroen get a plastic dashboard, so this could be a notable upgrade, at least on the Basalt and Aircross. The teaser also gave us a peek at the new black leatherette upholstery with contrast stitching. However, the equipment list can be expected to remain unchanged. The Dark Edition models will likely be based on their respective car’s top-spec trim. Citroen Aircross, Basalt, C3 dark editions: powertrain options  Likely to come with a Turbo engine  The Dark Edition variants of the Aircross, Basalt and C3 are expected to remain mechanically unchanged. All three cars get either an 82hp, 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol or a 110hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol; only the latter gets an automatic gearbox option. The Dark Edition variants will likely be offered in top Turbo guise only. Growing popularity of dark edition models The list of dark edition SUVs seems to be growing constantly. Models like the Hyundai Creta, MG Astor, Honda Elevate, Tata Harrier and Safari, Jeep Compass and Mahindra Scorpio N all have Dark Edition variants, with the Mahindra XUV700 Ebony Edition being the most recent addition. And it’s not just limited to SUVs, as the Toyota Hilux and MG Comet also received dark edition variants recently. Besides these Citroen models, the Tata Curvv is also expected to get a dark edition soon.

    "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar range has crossed the 2 crore sales milestone across 50 countries and to celebrate this milestone, Bajaj is offering discounts of up to Rs 7,300 on selected models.  Pulsar 220F enjoys the highest price cut Pulsar N160 TD single seat price increased by Rs 1,000 Bajaj Pulsar hits 2 crore sales milestone Bajaj is offering discounts on select models The Bajaj Pulsar made its debut in 2001, revolutionizing India’s budget performance segment. It initially launched with 150cc and 180cc models, which were considered high-performance at the time, given that most other offerings ranged between 100-125cc. Over the years, the Pulsar lineup has grown significantly, and today, it boasts a diverse range of twelve models, spanning from 125cc to 400cc. The Pulsar range managed to hit the first one crore sales mark in seventeen years, whereas the second crore came up in a rather short span of six years. Bajaj claims that Pulsar is a market leader in over twenty countries out of the fifty countries it is sold in. To celebrate this milestone, Bajaj is offering discounts on select models– starting with the Pulsar 125, witnessing the lowest discount of Rs 1,184, bringing its price down to Rs 84,493. Meanwhile, the iconic but dated Pulsar 220F has seen the highest price cut of over Rs 7,300 in states like Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal. Bajaj has also increased the price of the N160 twin disc variant by Rs 1,000, now priced at Rs 1.23 lakh. Currently, the range starts from Rs 81,400 for the Pulsar 125 and goes up to Rs 1.84 lakh for the flagship Pulsar NS400Z.  Bajaj Pulsar discountModelPricePrice differencePulsar 125 NeonRs 84,493Rs 1,184Pulsar 125 Carbon FibreRs 91,610Rs 2,000Pulsar 150 Single DiscRs 1.13 lakhRs 3,000Pulsar 150 Twin DiscRs 1.20 lakhRs 3,000Pulsar N160 USDRs 1.37 lakhRs 5,811Pulsar NS125 BaseRs 1 lakhunchangedPulsar NS125 ABSRs 1.07 lakhunchangedPulsar N160 TD Single SeatRs 1.23 lakhPrice increased by Rs 1,000Pulsar 220FRs 1.44 lakhRs 7379 discount in Maharashtra, Bihar \u0026 WB Only All prices ex-showroom, Delhi",
