    "description": "This 1976 Porsche 930 Turbo is a European-market example that is said to have spent time in the Netherlands before arriving in Belgium circa 2000, and a refurbishment carried out within the last year involved re-dying the Hell Green leather upholstery, applying replacement gold \"Turbo\" graphics, and overhauling the turbocharged 3.0-liter flat-six and the four-speed manual transaxle. The car was repainted in Black under previous ownership, and it also features a \"whale tail\" rear spoiler, European-specification exterior components, 15\" Fuchs alloy wheels, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. This 930 Turbo is offered by the selling dealer, a BaT Local Partner, on dealer consignment with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a seller-prepared refurbishment summary, service records, and Belgian registration.",

    "description": "Dual-motor MG 4 shows just what a Chinese-built EV can offer an old-fashioned petrolhead: enormous power for a limited budget Having been sidelined as a concept for some time, the hot hatchback is making something of a comeback.While tightening emissions rules have made petrol-powered hot hatchbacks less and less commercially viable, all-electric alternatives are now emerging. Many - the likes of the Alpine A290, and the recently previewed Peugeot e-208 GTI - are from practiced performance brands, and come with high expectations. Some of these fast electric cars, however, have come right out of the long grass and taken us all by surprise.Which is just what the MG 4 XPower did when it arrived in the UK in the summer of 2023. Back then, the idea of a high-performing, twin-motor, compact electric car wasn’t entirely novel; but one that combined fairly classic hot hatchback proportions with lots of power and speed, and an eyebrow-raisingly affordable price, certainly got our attention.SAIC, the MG brand’s Chinese owners, revived an old MG-Rover name for this dual-motor version of the MG 4 electric hatchback. XPower was used on the regrettably doomed MG XPower SV sports car created just before the financial demise of the UK-operated MG Rover. Interestingly, however, that brand is not used on domestic-market versions of this car, which are rather more enticingly called the MG Mulan Triumph Edition (the commercial rights to the defunct Triumph car brand are actually retained by BMW, after its period of ownership of The Rover Group in the 1990s; which might explain why the car was rebranded for export sales).",

Ben Townsend, head of automotive at Thatcham Research, Victor Zhang, UK country director at Omoda and Jaecoo, Scott McCammon, head of motor repair at Admiral and Felix Page, deputy editor at Autocar will discuss what this change means for UK car insurance and the car industry as a whole.  Join our webinar ‘How a fresh approach to gauging risk will make modern cars insurable’ on 8 May at 11:00 to find out more about this industry-changing shift, how the new rating system works, how the vehicles are assessed, and how Thatcham Research can assist manufacturers with the process.  Click here to sign up",

    "description": "I flew to L.A. this past spring to talk about a new project between actor Orlando Bloom, Deus Ex Machina’s Michael “Woolie” Woolaway, and BMW Motorrad. I’m not much for Hollywood, but I was wide-eyed about their idea. They’d take an already naked S 1000 R (a bike I’ve spent a summer on and for which I have an affinity) and make it more naked: a high-performance inline-four turned cooler, lighter, and more nimble. Talks on the new project began when Deus founder Dare Jennings, Woolie, and Orlando met with BMW Motorrad designer Ola Stenegärd and the design crew at the Munich factory in Germany last year. While the rest of the world had caught fire to the stripped-down lines of the R nineT as a starting point, Woolie drew upon his racing background and desire to do something different with the race-inspired S 1000 R.…",

    "description": "Firefighter-turned-custom bike builder Chris Scholtka has a knack for building slick, and somewhat hot-rodded, café racers. This Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 café racer epitomizes his style well—but it was almost built using a very different donor bike. “It started two years ago when an old friend called me,” Chris tells us. “She had received a big birthday gift from her family—a Honda CX650—and wanted to have it customized by me. We had a plan, but sadly the bike was stolen and we had to start from zero.” Chris operates under the moniker Motocrew from his workshop in Cottbus, Germany. And considering the slick custom bikes he typically creates, he was secretly relieved that the CX650 and its gawky frame were no longer part of the project.…",

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-reviews/royal-enfield-classic-650-india-review-heart-over-head-434965#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Bike+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "The Classic 650 Twin has been a long time coming, and it is the latest model to use RE’s proven twin-cylinder mill and combine it with the timeless British looks of the Classic 350. While we did sample the bike in the UK last year, this opportunity to ride it around Coonoor helped us understand who this bike is for. Royal Enfield Classic 650 design, features Appealing design and high quality levels found on the big Classic Probably one of the strongest driving forces behind someone’s purchase of the Classic 650 will be its charming design. While this is unmistakably a Classic, its sheer size and that additional peashooter will instantly give away that this is the bigger one.  The Classic 650's design is one of its strongest points. The fit-and-finish is absolutely top-notch here, and the attention to detail is marvellous for a bike at this price point. You get things like chromed-out switch cubes and wheel hubs on all the colourways, and this top variant we rode gets bodywork that’s almost entirely chrome!  The Classic 650’s features set is very similar to the smaller 350’s, and you get the same handsome digi-analogue display and a USB-C charger. It also gets a slip/assist clutch and adjustable levers, but that’s about it. USB-C charger tucked away discreetly below the clutch lever. While it certainly is a head-turner, one little chink in its armour is the gap between the fender and the rear wheel. It’s not really an eyesore, but it stands out like a sore thumb on this gorgeous a machine. Royal Enfield Classic 650 engine, performance Proven twin-cylinder motor has good power, but at 243kg, the bike is rather heavy Aside from the appealing design, another major reason that people will gravitate towards the Classic 650 Twin is its engine. The 648cc parallel twin motor has been lifted straight off the Shotgun with almost no changes, but that’s not a bad thing.  We’ve come to know this engine very well over the years, and it carries forward all of its strong points, such as its creamy smooth refinement, the easy-going but punchy performance, and that lovely soundtrack. For someone looking to step up from a smaller Royal Enfield or buy a retro-looking motorcycle with proper highway capability, the Classic 650’s performance is sure to impress.  The twin-cylinder engine is smooth, powerful and has a lovely soundtrack. At 243kg, the Classic 650 is a big, heavy thing, and you feel that at a standstill and also while pushing it around or during U-turns, but Royal Enfield has done a commendable job of masking its weight once you get going. We rode this bike on some really narrow, twisty roads, and with how well it handles, I’d never have guessed it weighs what it does.  Unlike the Shotgun, the Classic 650 gets a right-way-up fork, which performs just fine and suits its more traditional look, too. Braking performance is also nice, and while the power is more than sufficient, the rear brake felt a little too aggressive; a more progressive, gentler initial bite here would suit the overall demeanour of this machine.  The Classic’s handling belies its 243kg kerb weight. Royal Enfield Classic 650 suspension comfort  With suspension derived from the Shotgun, this Classic has a stiff ride The Classic 650’s rider triangle is spot on, and you’re seated in this really commanding position, just like its smaller sibling. You could easily spend long hours in this bike’s saddle, and it would have made for a great touring machine.  We say “would” because the suspension comfort here (or the lack thereof) really betrays the Classic name. The twin shock absorbers are lifted straight off the Shotgun and have the same 90mm of travel, too. RE says the tuning is slightly different, and while the Classic 650 is marginally better than the Shotgun, it still has that underlying stiff feeling. Stiff shock absorbers don’t do justice to the Classic’s name. While the roads we travelled on were largely well-paved and smooth, over the few bumps that I did go over, I didn’t get the same plush, absorptive feel that the Classic 350 has; it felt rather close to the Shotgun. Another complaint I have is that the Classic 650 runs tubed wire-spoke rims, and while RE is working on a tubeless solution, that is still some time away. Royal Enfield Classic 650 price and verdict Good pricing, pleasing design and performance will find it quite a few takers Ultimately, the Royal Enfield Classic 650 Twin is a heart-over-head purchase, and it’s for a casual sort of rider – someone who likes to use their bike as more of a leisure pursuit than as their regular workhorse. Chrome switch cubes are nice to look at and operate, but the placement of the pass switch is unintuitive.  As for the Classic’s pricing, the bike is available in four colours. The base Vallam Red and Bruntingthorpe Blue will set you back Rs 3.37 lakh, the middle Teal (which comes with a colour-matched frame, centre stand and side stand) costs Rs 3.41 lakh, and finally, this top Black Chrome colour will set you back Rs 3.50 lakh.  Same display as the smaller Classic and Bullet, but the headlight housing is much bigger. This places the Classic 650 Twin almost on par with the Bear 650, and it sits above the Interceptor and Continental GT but a fair deal below the Shotgun and Super Meteor. With its strong brand recall, fantastic design and the ability to hold triple-digit speeds without any fuss, the charming Classic 650 Twin could well become one of the bestselling RE 650s, both in India and overseas. Just try to steer clear of any bumps you encounter on the road!",

    "description": "China’s CFMoto has many new bikes that are catching attention worldwide, but none of them have made as big a splash as the 450MT. This is the motorcycle that the company plans to re-enter India with in mid-2025, and we had a chance to get acquainted with it on a ride around the Outer Ring Road in Hyderabad. One of the many things the 450MT has going right is the way it looks. It has a handsome, large and proportionate design that doesn’t look or feel budget in any way. When it comes to looking like a scaled-down big ADV, the 450MT achieves this better than any of its current rivals. The overall fit, finish and quality of materials feel like they’re from a segment above, and you could remove the badges and easily believe that this was a bike from any top manufacturer. Weighing 195kg fully fuelled, it is 13 kilos heavier than the new 390 Adventure but a kilo lighter than the Himalayan 450. Lifting it off the stand echoes the weight figure on paper – definitely not as light-feeling as the KTM but also not as top-heavy as the Himalayan, which is interesting because this has a similarly sized 17.5-litre fuel tank. Seat height is the lowest in the class at 820mm, and it can be further lowered to 800mm by using a different mounting point on the rear shock linkage. Tall riders will probably want to go for the accessory seat, which raises the seating position by 50mm. There are only two bikes in the country at the moment, and they’re being used for validation purposes by CFMoto’s local partner (who has asked not to be named yet), so we didn’t take the risk of riding the 450 off-road. On-road manners were good, with the bike having a light steering feel and being easy to manage at low speeds. This easy nature translates to the handling as well – it’s quite good, although it very much feels like a tall ADV with a large front wheel. The bike displays a tendency to lean over a little abruptly, but I chalk that down to the CST tyres, which work decently well, but you could improve the bike with better tyres. I’d also like more bite from the brakes, which, like the tyres, are more than adequate but not great. The suspension feels set a little on the firm side, but it is fully adjustable at the front and rebound/preload adjustable at the rear. Attacking a set of tall rumble strip speed breakers suggested that this suspension doesn’t feel quite as plush as the Himalayan, but it is better at taking big hits than the KTM 390 Adventure. The engine is one of the highlights. It’s smooth in a way no single can match, and it makes a deep and involving sound that’s similar to the Aprilia RS 457 but also a little different. CFMoto has gone for very short gearing, so the bike feels remarkably tractable at low speeds but a little high-revving above 120kph. A super-light clutch also aids rideability in the city, although those interested in a lot of high-speed touring may want to make some changes to the final drive sprockets. The 6-speed gearbox is smooth, and an upshift-only quickshifter will be sold as an accessory.   Our test bike had quite poor fuelling, but we were warned that this would be the case as the company was working on engine calibration for our local fuel. The second bike behaved far better, and the company assures us that the fuelling will be fully sorted by the time it launches the 450MT. On that topic, the recommended fuel is 95 octane. In typical CFMoto fashion, the 450MT is loaded with features, including a very nice TFT display, a height-adjustable windscreen, cross-spoked rims that support tubeless tyres, and adjustable suspension. From a touring standpoint, the only thing some people may miss is cruise control. A limited opportunity to shoot photographs means that this will be a quick review, but you can check out our video review for more details. Ultimately, the 450MT looks good, is enjoyable to ride and has built a good reputation overseas for quality and reliability. It will come into India as a CKD, and we’re told a sub-Rs 4 lakh price is the target, which we hope the company can achieve because anything more will be a bit of a challenge. Moreover, CFMoto and its local distributor have a big task on their hands when it comes to providing high-quality sales and after-sales experience. Hopefully, that will be achieved. Because this bike really has a lot going for it. Also see: CFMoto 450MT video review",

    "description": "The 2025 Americas MotoGP race had all the makings of an unpredictable roller coaster ride – an aborted race start, a factory Ducati other than Marc Marquez’s winning the race, and his younger brother Alex Marquez actually taking the lead in the World Championship. Marc Marquez crashed out of the lead, and his teammate Francesco Bagnaia capitalised on that by taking the win in this race. Alex Marquez, who now leads the standings, finished second, and Fabio Di Giannantonio took the chequered flag in third place. Alex leads the championship and is just a point ahead of Marc Yamaha bags a top-five finish with Jack Miller Bagnaia takes his 30th MotoGP win Ducati victorious at COTA, but not Marc After his victory in the Sprint race on Saturday, Marc Marquez looked nigh unstoppable as he extended his winning streak, and he looked all but set to win at his favourite track for a seventh time. And up until he lowsided at Turn 3 on Lap 9, when he already had a very comfortable 2-second lead over his brother Alex, Marc appeared to have it all in the bag. After that, once Bagnaia took the lead, he pretty much stayed there with a comfortable buffer to his sibling. This win was Bagnaia’s first this season, and he now has 30 race victories to his name.   Yamaha makes good progress; Miller in top 5   It wouldn’t be overstating things when we say that Yamaha has fallen from glory in recent years in MotoGP. However, a strong pre-season has finally started to translate into credible results for the Iwata-based factory. Jack Miller took his satellite Pramac machine to a top-five finish (Fermin Aldeguer’s late race crash is partly to thank here) and was the highest-ranked non-Ducati rider.   In fact, this race saw all four Yamaha machines finish in the points. Fabio Quartararo finished 10th, teammate Alex Rins was 11th, and Augusto Fernandez (reserve rider standing in for Miguel Oliveira) finished 13th.  Bastianini’s P7 silver lining to KTM’s dark cloud   The factory KTM duo of Brad Binder and Pedro Acosta had a good start to the 2025 Americas GP, and they were troubling the top five in the early stages of the race. But it wouldn’t last for long as Acosta crashed out first, followed shortly by Binder. And since Maverick Vinales had an issue during the second (and final) race start, the task of upholding KTM’s honour fell squarely on Enea Bastianini’s shoulders. Thankfully, ‘the Beast’ is known to be a tyre whisperer (an expert at managing tyres throughout race distance), and a strong turn of pace in the later stages of the race saw him cross the chequered flag in seventh place. Teammate Vinales finished 14th to take home two points.    2025 MotoGP standings   A Marquez still leads the standings, but it’s the younger sibling, Alex, who has a slender one-point lead over his brother Marc. With his victory here, Bagnaia has handsomely closed down the deficit to the Marquez brothers and is just 12 points adrift of the lead. The next race will be held at the Lusail International Circuit in Doha, Qatar, on April 13.  2025 Americas GP results 2025 Americas MotoGP resultsPositionRiderTeam1Francesco BagnaiaDucati2Alex MarquezGresini Ducati3Fabio Di GiannantonioVR46 Ducati4Franco MorbidelliVR46 Ducati5Jack Miller Pramac Yamaha6Marco BezzecchiAprilia7Enea BastianiniTech3 KTM 8Luca Marini Honda9Ai OguraTrackhouse Aprilia10Fabio QuartararoYamaha11Alex RinsYamaha12Raul FernandezTrackhouse Aprilia13Augusto FernandezPramac Yamaha14Maverick Vinales Tech3 KTM 15Lorenzo SavadoriAprilia16Somkiat ChantraLCR Honda17Johann Zarco LCR HondaNCMarc MarquezDucatiNCBrad BinderKTMNC Pedro AcostaKTMNC Joan MirHondaNC Fermin AldeguerGresini Ducati",

    "description": "The inaugural quarter of 2025 brought forth a bevy of notable car launches, like the Kia Syros, Hyundai Creta Electric, Mahindra BE 6, and many more. As we head into the second quarter of the year, April looks to keep the momentum going with several new launches. Volkswagen Tiguan R Line Launch date: April 14, 2025 The Tiguan R Line is slated to arrive next month as Volkswagen’s most expensive SUV offering in India. Compared to the previous-gen Tiguan that’s currently on sale here, the new SUV is 30mm longer and features overhauled styling, including redesigned headlights, sportier front and rear bumpers, 19-inch alloy wheels, R Line side panels, full-width LED front and rear light strips, and a rear spoiler. Inside, the Tiguan R Line comes equipped with creature comforts like a 10.3-inch all-digital instrument cluster, sports seats, tri-zone ambient lighting with 30 colours, and a 12.9-inch infotainment touchscreen running Volkswagen’s latest MIB4 software with over-the-air update functionality. The India-spec Tiguan R Line will be powered by a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that’s good for 204hp and 320Nm. Power is sent to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, and Volkswagen claims a 0-100kph time of 7.1 seconds and a 229kph top speed. Since the Tiguan R Line will be sold in India as a CBU, expect pricing to be in the ballpark of Rs 50 lakh. MG Cyberster Launch date: April 2025 MG’s first all-electric sports car - the Cyberster - is set to go on sale in India next month and will be available exclusively through MG Select premium showrooms. Design-wise, the Cyberster prominently features an upward-swooping fascia intended to mimic a smile, a long bonnet, 20-inch wheels as standard, arrow-shaped tail-lamps connected by an LED strip, and of course, scissor doors. Coming to the interior, the Cyberster has a 10.25-inch all-digital instrument cluster, two 7-inch screens, and another 7-inch touchscreen on the center console. Adaptive cruise control, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 360-degree camera, and an ADAS suite with blind-spot monitoring, lane-keep assist, and collision warning are also on offer. So far, MG has showcased only the Cyberster’s top-spec 77kWh all-wheel drive variant in India, which gets dual motors producing 510hp and 725Nm, enabling a 0-100kph time of 3.2 seconds and a 580km claimed range. Depending on public response, MG could launch the lower-spec 64kWh rear-wheel drive Cyberster instead, which is good for 310hp, 475Nm, and a 4.9sec 0-100kph time. Kia Carens facelift Launch date: April 2025 Three years after its initial launch in India, the Kia Carens MPV will receive a facelift next month. However, Kia plans to take the Honda Amaze approach with the Carens facelift by selling it alongside the current model. The Carens facelift will also carry a new name, and spy shots of the updated MPV have hinted at a higher bonnet line to give it an SUV-esque stance, as well as Syros-inspired headlamps, vertically-oriented tail-lamps with an LED light bar, and new 16-inch dual-tone alloy wheels. Precise details surrounding the interior remain unknown at the moment, but we expect Kia to update the Carens’ dashboard with new buttons and switchgear, and higher-quality materials. In line with newer Kia models, the facelifted Carens’ feature list could also include Level 2 ADAS and a 360-degree camera. The updated Carens is anticipated to retain the same three powertrains from the current model. Entry-level trims will be powered by a 1.5-litre naturally-aspirated petrol engine developing 115hp and 144Nm, with only a 6-speed manual on offer, whereas higher-end variants will get a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol unit producing 160hp and 253Nm, paired with either a 6-speed iMT or 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. A 1.5-litre turbo-diesel mill will also be available across the range, coupled with either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed torque converter auto. Skoda Kodiaq Launch date: April 2025 The new-gen Kodiaq sports updated styling cues that bring the flagship SUV in line with Skoda’s global models. Up front, the new Kodiaq gets Kushaq-esque headlights, a new grille, and a redesigned bumper. The side profile is smoother than the outgoing Kodiaq, and there are door-mounted wing mirrors and new alloy wheels as well. Over to the rear, the tail-lamps are connected, and chunky cladding can be seen lower down. Inside, the new Kodiaq gets a 13-inch infotainment screen, ambient lighting, an all-digital instrument cluster, and more. The SUV will be powered by the same 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine as the previous Kodiaq. Output stands at 190hp and 320Nm, which is routed to all four wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Tata Curvv Dark Edition Launch date: April 2025 Following in the footsteps of the Nexon, Harrier, and Safari, the Tata Curvv will soon receive the Dark Edition treatment. Only available in the top-spec Accomplished trim, the Curvv Dark Edition will be a purely cosmetic change, with the coupe SUV sporting an all-black colour scheme throughout its interior and exterior. No changes are expected under the hood, with the Curvv Dark Edition set to offer the same 1.2-litre turbo-petrol (125hp, 225Nm) and 1.5-litre turbo-diesel (118hp, 260Nm) engines, both of which can be had with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch transmissions. Pricing is expected to land between Rs 16.5 lakh-19.5 lakh (petrol) and Rs 16.8 lakh-19.6 lakh (diesel), with an estimated Rs 40,000 price increase over the standard Curvv variants. Citroen Basalt Dark Edition Launch date: April 2025 The Citroen Basalt will also add a Dark Edition to its variant line-up next month. A recent teaser video from Citroen hints at a new black exterior shade for the Basalt Dark Edition, which will likely join the existing five colour options. Blacked-out front and rear skid plates, bespoke badging, and alloy wheels finished in dark chrome may also be included. The blacked-out treatment is expected to be carried over to the Basalt’s cabin as well. Like other all-black variants, the Basalt Dark Edition will likely be based on the coupe SUV’s range-topping Max trim, which gets a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine developing 110hp and 205Nm. Transmission options comprise a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed torque converter auto.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-comparison-reviews/honda-amaze-vs-maruti-dzire-comparison-434964#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "Maruti Suzuki and Honda have given their compact sedans a significant update, bringing us the fourth-generation Dzire and the third-generation Amaze, respectively. Can these sedans carry on the fight in an increasingly SUV-dominated market? With these new-gen models, both brands have also placed a strong emphasis on safety this time around. Standard features on both cars now include ESP, six airbags and hill-start assist. Additionally, the Amaze stands out with its camera-based ADAS suite, while the Dzire has earned a 5-star Global NCAP crash-safety rating. And now, with similar features and specifications, the two sedans are closer than ever. So, we put their petrol-automatic iterations through our exhaustive tests to find out which one comes out on top. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire exterior design Amaze boasts a higher ground clearance and a longer wheelbase. The Amaze follows Honda’s latest design philosophy, bearing a strong resemblance to its larger siblings. Its front shares styling cues with the Elevate SUV, while the rear resembles the City. Though the side profile remains unmistakably Amaze, elements such as door-mounted mirrors and 185/60 R15 diamond-cut alloys provide a modern touch. The new Dzire impresses with its large Audi-esque grille, and the LED headlamps look sleek. Like the Amaze, its side profile is familiar to its previous generation, but distinctive tail-lights featuring a tri-arrow LED signature and a subtle boot lip spoiler add character. Dzire is taller, but Amaze has a higher ground clearance Dimensionally, both cars are near-identical in length and width, but the Dzire is 25mm taller and rides on slightly higher-profile 185/65 R15 tyres. The Amaze boasts a 20mm longer wheelbase and higher ground clearance (172mm versus Dzire’s 163mm). The Dzire AMT weighs 960kg, making it 26kg lighter than the Amaze. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire interior Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through, and its high-set seats result in excellent visibility. With a dashboard that resembles that of an Elevate, the Amaze’s interior adopts a minimalist approach. The beige-black colour scheme adds some brightness, and Honda’s hallmark ergonomics shine through with well-placed storage spaces and excellent visibility. Also carried forward from the Elevate are its superbly executed part-analogue, part-digital instrument cluster and the neat, buttoned climate control console. Where the Amaze must improve is the front-seat comfort; the absence of adequate seat base support becomes glaringly evident in this comparison. Its rear seat fares much better in this aspect – there’s good support, and the backrest angle is more comfortable than the Maruti. Three fixed headrests not only improve comfort but also provide whiplash protection to adults seated here. And while neither of these sedans is wide enough to seat three adults comfortably, the Amaze’s rear air-con console protrudes a fair bit into the middle passenger’s kneeroom. Also, taller passengers will find the headroom in limited supply in the Amaze. Dzire interior feels more spacious and comfortable Some textured bits enhance its appeal, as do features like a larger screen and sunroof. There’s a greater sense of space inside the Dzire due to its design and lighter colour scheme. Some smartly executed textured bits lift its appeal, while its larger 9-inch touchscreen and a sunroof add a touch of modernity. It also gets an edge over the Amaze due to its broader, more supportive seats. For short drives, its soft cushioning feels very comfortable, too. However, this could induce some body ache after spending extended hours in the car during long drives. Its rear seat is just as accommodating as the Honda’s, but with a bit more headroom due to a scooped-out roof, taller passengers will be comfier here. While both cars have ample storage areas spread across the cabin, the Dzire’s 382-litre boot is a bit smaller than the Amaze’s, which measures 416 litres. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire price and features Amaze (clockwise): Camera-based ADAS works well under most conditions; The front seats’ base is small and needs better support; Rear AC console eats into the kneeroom of passengers; Smooth transmission complements its engine well. The Honda Amaze CVT comes in three variants priced between Rs 9.35 lakh and Rs 11.20 lakh, whereas the Dzire AMT’s range of Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 10.19 lakh makes it significantly more affordable. The features common to their top trims include auto LED headlamps, 15-inch alloys, keyless entry, wireless charging, automatic climate control, rear air vents, cruise control, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, ESP and six airbags. Dzire (clockwise): Includes in-vogue features like a sunroof and a 360-deg cam; The AMT gearbox’s shifts are jerky; No headrest for the middle passenger; Faux wood, silver inserts and textures enhance its appeal. The Dzire AMT stands out with a 360-degree camera, a sunroof and a larger 9-inch touchscreen (compared to the Amaze’s 8-inch unit). However, during our tests, its screen froze on more than one occasion while connected to Android Auto. Amaze distinguishes itself with ADAS features For the Rs 1 lakh premium that the Amaze CVT commands over the Dzire AMT, it gets paddle shifters, a part-digital instrument cluster, and an ADAS package featuring lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. These ADAS features are well-calibrated to suit Indian driving conditions and function in a non-intrusive manner, making highway drives more convenient and safer.

Amaze’s 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine is carried over from the previous-gen model and, hence, remains very similar in its characteristics. It is an enjoyable unit with a strong mid-range and a free-revving nature. But performance at the lower end of the rev range feels weak, especially below 2,000rpm. Its continuously variable transmission (CVT) keeps the engine spinning optimally, thus extracting the best out of this unit. And in the absence of fixed gears, this belt-pulley automatic works seamlessly. However, enthusiastic user input results in a noticeable rubber-band effect, where the revs increase without a corresponding effect on vehicle speed; this makes an already buzzy engine sound even harsher. Honda’s free-revving mill can get quite vocal when spun faster. The new Dzire switches to Maruti’s latest 1.2-litre Z12E petrol engine that has one less cylinder. And, at 82hp, makes 8hp less than the Amaze as well as its own previous-generation model. However, as we’ve seen with the Swift, where it debuted, this three-cylinder unit’s clear focus on low-end torque aids drivability, as does its crisp throttle response. 5-speed AMT is a sore point for the Dzire's driving experience These make the Dzire feel rather effortless within urban confines. But the 5-speed automated manual transmission (AMT) is the weakest link in this package. Yes, it provides the convenience of clutch-free driving, and even though it can be categorised as fine by AMT standards, you will feel a prominent lag between gear shifts; it is nowhere near as smooth or seamless as the Amaze’s CVT. Maruti’s three-cylinder unit is surprisingly refined and drivable. In our performance tests, the Amaze accelerates from 0-100kph in 13.12 seconds, 2.09 seconds quicker than the Dzire AMT. Interestingly, their rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph and 40-100kph are very similar. Pedal to the metal, the Honda CVT tops out at 148kph, whereas the Dzire AMT hits a higher top speed of 170kph.

Honda claims an ARAI-rated efficiency of 19.46kpl for the Amaze CVT, whereas Maruti claims a staggering 25.71kpl for the Dzire AMT. Although nowhere as close, in our real-world tests, the Amaze CVT and Dzire AMT averaged 13.28kpl and 15.41kpl, respectively. The Amaze CVT achieved 16.62kpl on the highway and 9.94kpl in the city, whereas the Dzire returned a higher 19.22kpl and 11.61kpl, respectively. Notably, neither car gets an Eco mode; the Dzire has an automatic engine stop-start feature to check fuel consumption while idling. However, in extreme 45-degree heat, this feature struggled due to the air conditioning’s higher fan speed requirements to maintain the preset 22 degrees Celsius cabin temperature in full-auto mode. In contrast, the Amaze maintained cabin temperature effectively with a lower fan speed. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire ride and handling The Amaze's steering is more responsive, but the Dzire wins on the low-speed ride front. A comfort-oriented setup makes the Amaze soak up the bumps and road imperfections rather competently, but the sharper potholes come through with a prominent ‘thwack’ from the suspension. At highway speeds, it tends to bounce on its soft springs, resulting in a fair bit of vertical movement over wavy surfaces – not ideal for those prone to road sickness. Dzire's ride is plusher at low speeds The Maruti is the comfier riding car since its low-speed ride is a touch more absorbent, and it does its duties in silence. Sharp movements do come through at highway speeds, so in that sense, its ride can feel busy when you up the pace. However, it recovers much better than the Amaze after a dip, and it doesn’t float as much either. Those who enjoy driving may prefer the Honda’s steering, which feels pointier and more fluid than the Maruti’s, but in terms of steering effort, the Dzire’s lighter unit, with its relatively shorter turning radius, will appeal to most buyers. Honda Amaze vs Maruti Dzire verdict Honda Amaze ZX CVT: 8/10 Maruti Dzire ZXi+ AMT: 8/10 The Honda Amaze petrol-automatic gets the basics right with a far smoother driving experience and better outright performance, which will certainly appeal to self-driven owners. In addition, it is also equipped with segment-first ADAS. However, its powertrain could have done with better refinement, its front seats should have been more supportive, and its highway ride comes across as a bit bouncy. The Maruti Dzire isn’t perfect, and the jerky AMT gearbox is a letdown, but if you can look past this, it feels larger and more expensive on the inside, and its seats are comfier, too. The ride is plusher, the engine more refined, and it has a more desirable kit, including a sunroof and a 360-degree camera. Building the case further is the better fuel efficiency and a substantial Rs 1 lakh lower sticker price. All in all, then, the Dzire is the better all-rounder, ensuring it emerges the winner in this battle. Also see: Maruti Dzire vs Honda Amaze: Which is the new compact sedan for you?
