    "description": "Ford's best-seller finally gets an all-electric powertrain It feels like the Ford Puma Gen-E was needed a couple of years ago, really.With the likes of the Renault 5 now hitting showrooms, plus the (recently price-cut) Jeep Avenger and VW ID.3, the Skoda Elroq, MG S5, Volvo EX30, Smart #1 and all of Stellantis’ other forthcoming sub-£30k electric cars shouldering in, never mind the ever-pressing ZEV mandate regulations, Ford desperately needs an affordable electric car.The good news is that the Ford Puma Gen-E is precisely the sort of lower-cost proposition that should get customers through the doors. Starting from under £30,000, it gets a 43kWh lithium-ion NMC battery (53kWh total capacity) that powers the front-wheel drive, all-electric Puma Gen-E to a WLTP range of up to 233 miles. That makes it one of the most efficient electric cars in the class, which is especially great news for a car that also manages a healthy 8.0 seconds to 62mph.Is it remotely that efficient in the real world? We’ll get to that a bit further down…",

    "description": "Lighter, faster, and meaner – the Maserati GT2 Stradale is the MC20 at its most unhinged. This isn’t just a track-focused special; it’s a full-throttle, no-compromise statement from Maserati. Developed from the GT2 race car but adapted for road use, the Stradale is sharper, more powerful and even more thrilling to drive. The pit lane at Yas Marina hums with quiet anticipation. Parked in front of me, the Maserati GT2 Stradale squats low and wide, every bit the hardcore track weapon it promises to be. Stripped of excess weight and dialled up on downforce with underbody diffusers and a massive rear wing, the GT2 Stradale is primed for battle. So am I. Maserati GT2 Stradale exterior design Optimised for weight saving and downforce One look at the GT2 Stradale, and its intentions are clear. The towering adjustable rear wing alone generates up to 500kg of downforce at speed, keeping the car pinned to the tarmac. Up front, larger air intakes and a reworked splitter ensure maximum cooling and stability. Carbon fibre isn’t just for show – it’s used extensively for weight savings and structural rigidity. Rear wing produces 500kg of downforce.   Maserati GT2 Stradale performance and handling Drop into the tight bucket seat, strap yourself in, and hit the starter button. The Nettuno V6 ignites with a bark – raw, visceral and unfiltered, in a way the standard MC20 never quite was. This is the GT2 Stradale’s truest form, road-legal in the most technical sense but spiritually bound to the circuit. Powered by 640hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine At its core sits Maserati’s spectacular 3.0-litre twin-turbo Nettuno V6, now massaged to 640hp – up from the MC20’s 621hp. And it’s lighter, too. The GT2 Stradale was put on a diet, shedding 59kg to tip the scales at just 1,365kg. The result? A blistering 0-100kph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 324kph. Neatly styled air intakes to cool the Nettuno V6 engine.   Razor-sharp responses and gear shifts Out of the pit lane, I squeeze the throttle, and it’s immediately obvious how hyper-reactive this track-focused Maserati is. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response, and the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox rifles through ratios with millisecond precision. Every shift feels instantaneous, and every prod of the throttle pedal is met with a precisely metered surge of power. Braking into Turn 5, the carbon ceramics clamp down with brutal efficiency, hauling the car down from triple-digit speeds in an instant. The front end has the sharp bite of a Rottweiler clinging to the tarmac, beautifully complemented by steering that’s loaded with feedback. Maserati’s engineers have widened the track, stiffened the suspension and fine-tuned the aerodynamics for maximum downforce. The result? A car that feels surgically precise yet alive with every twitch of the wheel. Tight and snug bucket seats are essential for coping with high g-forces. On slower corners, you can provoke the rear into a controlled slide, but it never feels nervous. It’s playful yet poised, letting you dance at the limit without ever making you feel like you’re about to overstep. Nettuno V6 has a raw, mechanical sound Maserati has always been about the soundtrack, and while the GT2 Stradale’s V6 lacks the operatic wail of a naturally aspirated V8, it has a raw, mechanical ferocity that suits its persona. Opt for the titanium exhaust (track use only), and it snarls like a proper race car, spitting and crackling on downshifts. Throttle sensitivity is razor-sharp; though, below 3,000rpm, there’s a hint of turbo lag. But once the boost comes in, acceleration is relentless. It’s not the outright fastest in its class – the Ferrari 296 is quicker – but the GT2 Stradale delivers a deeply immersive experience. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response. Within a lap, I’m comfortable with this car, which eggs you on to push harder and harder. By the time I roll back into the pits, my pulse is racing, my hands tingling. This isn’t just another track-focused supercar. This is Maserati rediscovering its soul. Some bits of practicality Despite its hardcore underpinnings, the GT2 Stradale hasn’t completely abandoned road manners. A nose-lift system raises the front by 1.4 inches – critical for avoiding the heartbreak of scraping that carbon splitter. There’s even a 100-litre boot, but let’s be honest, practicality isn’t why you buy this car. Maserati GT2 Stradale interior Every detail focused for driving Inside, it’s all business. Alcantara dominates the dashboard to minimise glare, while the carbon-fibre bucket seats are available in two sizes. They grip you tight – brilliant for the track but a reminder that this isn’t a car for long-haul comfort. Shift lights on the steering wheel, a relocated drive-mode selector – every detail is designed for pure driving focus. No skimping in the cockpit, which is covered in Alcantara. Where the GT2 Stradale stands apart is in the design. Maserati has always had a way of making even its most extreme cars look effortlessly elegant. Unlike Ferrari’s aggressive, function-first approach to aero, the Stradale retains a sense of Italian artistry. Maserati GT2 Stradale verdict Not an everyday supercar Scissor doors are an integral part of the GT2 Stradale’s visual drama. The GT2 Stradale is an exquisite blend of race-car aggression and road-going grace. It’s not an everyday supercar – far from it – but for those lucky enough to get behind the wheel, it delivers a raw, unfiltered driving experience few cars can match. Production is limited to 914 units, a nod to Maserati’s founding year, 1914. Pricing remains under wraps, but with this level of exclusivity and performance, expect it to command a hefty premium over the MC20. For the driving purist, this is as close to a road-legal race car as Maserati has ever built. And it’s utterly magnificent.   Also See: Aston Martin Vantage India review: split personality New BMW M5 track drive: Heavyweight champ",

    "description": "Let’s begin with this bike’s name. While it is called the 390 Enduro R, KTM lists this bike under the Dual Sport section on its website and not the actual Enduro category. And that’s rightfully so because this motorcycle doesn’t have a dedicated Enduro chassis or engine like you’ll find on the wild 350 or 450 EXC-F motorcycles. Instead, it is based on the 390 Adventure, which itself uses a derivation of the trellis frame from the 390 Duke, as well as the same 399cc engine. The result is a 177kg kerb weight that’s almost the same as the 390 Adventure and about 60-70 kilos heavier than a competition-spec enduro from KTM. Those are the facts; now let’s lend them some perspective.  The 390 Enduro R is derived from the 390 Adventure and is more of a dualsport than a true Enduro. The big benefit here is that KTM is trying to offer an approachable package at an affordable price. If you want a true enduro weapon, KTM India now sells the mighty 350 EXC-F Six Days, but it’ll cost you Rs 13 lakh and can’t be registered for road use. This motorcycle, on the other hand, is priced at about a quarter of that, and it comes with number plates. So, let’s get over what it’s not and focus on what it is. KTM 390 Enduro R changes for India India-spec bike has less suspension travel than the international model The 390 Enduro R is closely related to the 390 Adventure, with the same engine and chassis. The core visual difference is that it comes with much slimmer bodywork and is missing the large ADV-style headlamp and wind protection. From a mechanical standpoint, it gets a bigger 18-inch rear wheel and runs on chunky 50/50 Mitas E-07 tyres. Unlike the 390 Adventure, these tyres have inner tubes. 50/50 Mitas E-07 tyres are new here and run inner tubes. The riding position is also a little different thanks to a new handlebar that has a taller riser and can be adjusted in three positions on the steering triple clamp. Standing and seating ergos feel more off-road appropriate than the 390 ADV, although very tall riders will still want an even higher handlebar riser. The 46hp/39Nm engine is in the same state of tune as the 390 Adventure, but the rear sprocket is two teeth larger to account for the bigger diameter of the rear wheel – KTM tells us that the overall gearing is similar to the Adventure. India-spec 390 Enduro R comes with the same suspension as the 390 Adventure. The international-spec 390 Enduro R comes with 230mm of suspension travel. However, Bajaj pulled a surprise at the launch event by revealing that the bike for India would get the same reduced suspension travel as the domestic 390 Adventure, resulting in a lower 860mm seat height instead of 890mm. To say that this dampened the mood would be putting it lightly because the India-spec 390 Adventure’s suspension, while adjustable, is too soft for what that bike is supposed to be.  KTM 390 Enduro R ride and handling Despite the suspension change, the bike is well-behaved and capable off-road Thankfully, this is one of those cases where the motorcycle tells a better story than its spec sheet does. Only a few minutes into the trail ride, I could feel that this suspension was behaving noticeably better than on the 390 Adventure, without the same tendency of bottoming out over medium-sized jumps. Sure enough, after the ride, I confirmed with the engineers that the Enduro has revised damping settings as well as more spring preload compared to the 390 Adventure.  The suspension only bottoms out over the bigger jumps at faster speeds. The trail we rode on had plenty of rocks to jump and quite a few steep drops and climbs, where the Mitas tyres proved to be very nice, both in terms of grip and rider feedback. The terrain was quite varied, and it included a fairly deep water crossing as well as a stretch of loose rocks where the chassis and steering had an opportunity to showcase good stability. The entire time, the Enduro felt noticeably lighter and more compact than the 390 ADV, which I had ridden just a couple of days earlier, even though the bike is actually only about 5 kilos lighter. Part of this is surely down to the fact that the Enduro is slimmer and less top-heavy with its smaller 9-litre fuel tank, but there’s also the psychological factor of not having all that big and tall bodywork right in front of you.   The Enduro’s front brake is smaller, owing to its off-road bias. Through most of the trail ride, with my weight (about 80kg in full gear), I was happy to leave the suspension in its middle settings, although a few of my colleagues did want to firm up the front. It was only on one particularly fast, rutted section where we were flirting with triple-digit speeds in 3rd and 4th gears that I felt the need to add some compression damping because the bike did bottom out on a couple of bigger hits. KTM 390 Enduro R off-road capability It is a properly capable machine and only pro-level riders will want something more focused After a thoroughly enjoyable trail ride, we moved to two different short tracks that were more MX in nature, with banked corners and a few big jumps. This was where the Enduro did run into the limits of its suspension travel more often, especially on the bigger jumps. But even when the bike bottomed out, it handled the situation well and encouraged the rider to keep going. However, this was a clear indication that the 390 Enduro is not for serious competition-style riding and is more about going out and having fun with your friends on the trails. That said, it’s only very experienced and/or pro riders who are going to plough through the limits of this bike, and for someone like myself, there’s plenty of room for personal skill improvement before I start to ask for more from the motorcycle. The slim seat will help shorter riders put their feet on the ground. To go with the Enduro’s friendly nature is a very well-judged electronics package. Power delivery is not too aggressive, but it is exciting enough in Off-Road mode, which also deactivates the rear ABS. Unique to this motorcycle is a separate button that turns off the front ABS if you feel the need to. I also really enjoyed the traction control in off-road mode, which allowed plenty of sideways slip and never felt intrusive, even on steep uphill climbs.   New switchgear on the Enduro, with a dedicated ABS deactivation button. Turning the traction control off actually created more for me to manage because, with the peaky nature of this road-oriented engine, it was easy to over-spin the tyre on some of the looser, gravelly surfaces. On that note, this 399cc liquid-cooled single doesn’t have the same meaty bottom end you’d expect from a purpose-built off-road bike, and I stalled it a few times while easing out the clutch from a standstill – slipping some revs in is something this engine appreciates.   KTM 390 Enduro R features Feature-rich machine has a TFT display, riding modes, switchable ABS and TC One of the nice aspects of the Enduro’s road-bike roots is that it has far more features than you’d usually get on a bike like this. This includes a small but well-designed 4.2-inch TFT display that is easily controlled by a joystick on the left switch cube. In addition to traction control and ABS, you get two riding modes, Bluetooth connectivity and navigation assists. However, there is one important feature you’ll miss having, and that’s a fuel gauge, which means you’ll have to rely on a low-fuel warning lamp. Small 4.2-inch TFT display packs good info but misses out on a fuel gauge. This launch event was purely about off-road riding, and we still need to see what the on-road comfort is like. On that topic, the flat seat is wider than the usual slim and hard bench you get on a proper enduro bike. For now, I suspect comfort should be reasonably manageable on a daily commute. However, the seat is still quite slim and firm, as it should be on a bike like this.  KTM 390 Enduro R price and verdict This is a properly capable machine despite what the spec sheet may suggest Priced at Rs 3.37 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the 390 Enduro R finds itself almost midway between the 390 Adventure X and the 390 Adventure, and just Rs 7,000 more than the much lighter but much slower Kawasaki KLX230. On the one hand, this is easily one of the most fun bikes I’ve ridden in 2025, and I can assure you that it’s not the disappointment that it appears to be on paper. On the other hand, there’s no doubt that Bajaj has watered down this KTM for India, although I can understand their intentions of making it more accessible to a wider range of people.  The Enduro's closest rival is the less powerful but also way lighter Kawasaki KLX230. What would be ideal is if the R is removed from the name of this version and Bajaj also sells the international spec bike alongside it for those who want the full experience. At the very least, the company should make the longer travel suspension available at a reasonable price. Nevertheless, I will conclude this with the acknowledgement that I enjoyed the 390 Enduro R far more than I expected to after hearing the product briefing, and I’d love to spend a lot more time with it.  Also See: KTM 390 Enduro R video revIew",

    "description": "What is it that makes BMW motorcycles the perfect canvas for customization? Is it the visual distinctiveness of powerplants like the no-nonsense airheads or the outlandishly equipped K-series? Or possibly the rigorous engineering that makes these platforms stand the test of time. Whatever the cause, BMWs are a staple of the custom scene, and the factory has embraced our will to make these bikes our own by building-in modularity and offering a robust line of customizable parts. Support for customizers extends beyond the corporate level, and the BMW Motorcycle Owners of America group wants to see what you’re working on. BMW MOA is hosting the 2025 Builders Best Custom Motorcycle Show in Lebanon, Tennessee, June 19-21. MOA is looking for custom bikes of all brands to participate in the event, with cash prizes ($1,000 per class) awarded for the best BMW and Open Class bikes.…",

    "description": "The custom motorcycle scene is firmly in its kit-built era. Business savvy workshops have realized that there’s a lot of demand for parts that can transform a bike with minimal fuss. One-off specials will always rule the roost—but not everyone has the skill, time, or funds to build them. For some riders, it makes more sense to take one of the countless modern classics currently on the market, and personalize it with a smorgasbord of tailored parts. If that’s you, the Triumph Scrambler 1200 is one heck of a starting point. This writer has spent considerable time aboard the Scrambler 1200, and can confirm that it is a tour de force—both technically and aesthetically. It looks handsome out the box, its 1,200 cc parallel twin motor is a peach, and its big front wheel and long travel suspension aren’t just for show.…",

    "description": "The adoption of electric vehicles in India’s luxury car segment is accelerating faster than in the mass-market passenger vehicle space, with EV penetration reaching as high as 10–12 percent of total sales for some premium brands, according to Mercedes-Benz India. With a growing range of EVs in the luxury space, the industry is expected to sustain electric vehicle adoption levels at around 10 percent going forward. EV adoption in luxury segment vs mass-market segment Luxury EV adoption 5x more than mass-market segments “The acceptance of EVs in the luxury segment is much stronger compared to the mass market. Currently, we have 8 percent EV penetration, and some other luxury brands are at 10-12 percent,” said Santosh Iyer, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Mercedes-Benz India. Of the 51,000 luxury cars sold in the last financial year at an industry level, nearly 4,500 units were EVs. In contrast, while EV adoption in the mass-market segment is growing, it is still at just around 2–3 percent last fiscal, even with total EV sales reaching approximately 1.2 lakh units. What’s driving EV adoption in luxury segments? Greater readiness among luxury EV buyers Iyer credited the higher penetration in the luxury segment to greater customer readiness. “It’s not just about the numbers—it’s also the kind of EVs being sold. We focus on top-end electric vehicles, while others may offer entry-level EVs. But across the board, acceptance in luxury is stronger.” While confident in the segment’s upward trajectory, Iyer stopped short of calling it an acceleration, citing a steady build-up in adoption over time. “From 2 percent to 2.5 percent, then 4.5 percent, and now 7–8 percent, we’ve seen consistent growth. Even without a massive portfolio expansion, we expect to sustain this momentum,” he said. “More products entering the segment will drive demand, but even with our current lineup, we’re seeing strong quarter-by-quarter progress.” Mercedes-Benz India does not plan to significantly expand its EV offerings in the short term but expects organic growth to continue, supported by improved infrastructure and shifting consumer preferences. Mercedes-Benz India’s EV sales Strong demand for top-end EVs In the financial year 2024–25, the German automaker’s EV sales surged by a robust 51 percent. In the March quarter, the locally assembled EQS SUV pushed EV penetration to 8 percent of total sales. At the higher end of the spectrum, the EQS Maybach Night Series and the electric G-Class have also garnered strong demand. Both models now have a waiting period of up to 12 months.

    "description": "The Kia Syros has been crash tested by BNCAP and it has come away with a 5-star safety rating for both adult and child occupant protection. The Syros scored 30.21 out of 32 in adult occupant protection (AOP) and 44.42 out of 49 in child occupant protection (COP). This makes it Kia’s first model to get a 5-star safety rating in a crash test by either BNCAP or GNCAP.   Syros scored 30.21 points out of 32 in AOP It secured 44.42 points out of 49 in COP 5-star rating is applicable for all petrol variants BNCAP tested the top-spec HTX+ petrol-DCT and the mid-spec HTK(O) petrol-MT variants of the Syros, but the ratings are applicable for the entire petrol range of the Syros. Kia Syros safety features Gets 6 airbags, ESC as standard  The tested models came equipped with six airbags three-point seatbelts with reminders for all passengers, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), ISOFIX anchors for rear outboard seats and a passenger-side airbag cut-off switch.  The Syros also complies with ESC regulations and AIS-100 pedestrian protection norms. Kia Syros adult occupant protection 30.21 out of 32 in AOP  The report noted that the protection offered to the driver’s and the passenger’s head and neck region was good, although protection to the driver’s chest and knee area was adequate. The Syros secured 14.21 out of 16.00 in the frontal offset deformable barrier test. In the side movable deformable barrier test, the Syros secured 16.00 out of 16.00, offering good protection overall. In the side pole impact test, it was rated OK. Kia Syros child occupant protection 44.42 out of 49 in COP  The Syros scored 23.42 points out of 24 in dynamic test and 10 points out of 12 in CRS installation. Both the 18-month-old and the 3-year-old child dummies were tested in rearward-facing child seats positioned in the front passenger seat, secured by ISOFIX anchorages and a support leg. Interestingly, while the Sonet is based on Kia’s K2 platform, the Syros is underpinned by the smaller K1 platform that underpins cars like the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios and Exter. The company refers to the Syros’ platform as the reinforced K1 though, given that it has been strengthened with a lot of hot-stamped parts in the body shell. Kia says using the newer K1 platform has enabled it to bring in the latest electrical and electronics architecture as well as upgrade it to perform better in NCAP tests. Kia Syros BNCAP score vs rivals Kylaq has a higher safety score  Among Syros’ rivals, the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO and the Skoda Kylaq have also been crash tested by BNCAP, and all have secured a 5-star rating. Among these, the Kylaq boasts of the highest points, while the Syros comes just after it, followed by the Nexon and XUV 3XO. In Kia’s own stable, the Syros is the highest rated car. The Seltos, Sonet and Carens have been crash tested by GNCAP before, and all three cars have only secured a 3-star rating. Also See: Every car, SUV tested by Bharat NCAP so far",
