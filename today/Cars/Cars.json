    "description": "This 1963.5 Ford Falcon Sprint was built by vintage race car specialists Dralle Engineering around 2014. It started as a California black plate car and was fitted with a 331ci V8 equipped with Edelbrock aluminum cylinder heads, Mahle forged pistons, and an Eagle crankshaft and connecting rods. A Tremec TKO five-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes with Lincoln front calipers, red leather Cobra bucket seats, a dash-mounted Smiths tachometer, a MotoLita steering wheel, an exhaust system with cut-outs, and an upgraded clutch, flywheel, drive shaft, rear end, and suspension were also installed. It was offered on BaT in 2016 and then given a Ford France rally-style makeover the following year. BaT co-founder Randy Nonnenberg bought the car in 2022 and further refined it, and it was driven in that year's Copperstate 1000 as well as to numerous BaT events across California. The Falcon is now offered on dealer consignment with build records, service records, and a clean California title.",

    "description": "This Chevrolet Corvette is noted to have been an unsold 1954 example that was initially utilized under the direction of Chevrolet engineer and former Indianapolis 500 race winner Mauri Rose as an experimental car for high-output V-8 performance development. Sales of the C1 were not meeting expectations following the model's launch, and seeing the marketing potential of breaking performance records, engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov proposed preparing a specialized example capable of becoming the first American production vehicle to top 150 mph. Chassis EX87 was reassigned from Rose to Duntov for development, including modifications to the bodywork such as a low-cut windscreen, a passenger-side tonneau cover, a head fairing, and a unique belly pan, as well as fitment of a manual transmission along with a bored and stroked 307ci V8 that featured a special high-lift camshaft, now known as the \"Duntov Cam.\" Reclassified as EX87/5951, the car was piloted by Duntov at the GM Desert Proving Grounds in Arizona, where it achieved speeds of around 163 mph during test runs. An updated 1956 Corvette was to be built for the actual high-speed run attempts held at Daytona Beach, and as a result, the car was disassembled and separated into the chassis, EX87, and the body, 5951. The 5951 bodywork was re-mounted elsewhere, while the EX87 chassis was brought to 1955 specification with fitment of a 265ci V8 engine, a two-speed automatic transmission, and replacement bodywork sourced from another test vehicle. That car went on to be used as a demonstrator and was reportedly later sold to a GM engineer before being purchased by the current owner's husband in 1968. Following a subsequent engine failure, a 327ci V8 was installed and the bodywork was repainted red. Having remained under the same ownership in California for 57 years, this C1 Corvette is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with historic correspondence from GM, literature, service records, spare parts, and a clean California title that lists the car as a 1955 Chevrolet.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-government-and-legislation/breaking-trump-slashes-import-tariff-uk-made-vehicles",
    "description": "Tax applies to first 100,000 cars exported from UK to US; reduced from a previously announced 25% rate UK-made vehicles imported into the US will be hit with a reduced tariff of 10%, president Donald Trump has announced, but only for the first 100,000 cars exported. It follows more than a month of negotiations between British and American officials after Trump announced sweeping import tariffs on foreign-made products, including a 25% tariff on new cars. All tariffs were due to start on 1 April, but a 90-day reprieve was given so that negotiations could take place. Details on the new deal are currently sparse, but the US confirmed that the 10% tariff - which brings it in line with the levy on other foreign goods – will apply to \"100,000 cars\", suggesting that anything over that number will be hit by the higher 25% rate. Previously, before Trump's March announcement, the tariff was 2.5%.  Prime minister Keir Starmer said the 10% rate represented \"a huge and important reduction\" and confirmed that \"we have scope now to increase that quota; this is not final\".  Last year, the UK sent some 102,000 cars to the US. The US is the British car industry's second largest export market, behind the EU. It received 27% of all UK-made vehicles in 2024, accounting for some £9 billion a year. No details were given on the proposed 25% tariff on car parts, which was due to begin in the coming months. While details have yet to be fully confirmed, new deals on food, chemicals, machinery and industry have been struck. Tariffs on steel and aluminum have been reduced to 0%. The UK is the first nation to reach an agreement with the US following president Trump's tariff announcement in March. China will be the next, according to American officials. Announcing the deal from the White House's , Trump said: \"I’m thrilled to announce a breakthrough trade deal. The agreement with one our closest and most cherished allies. \"Final details are being written up and will be detailed in the coming weeks.\" He added that the deal gets rid of many unspecified UK tariffs that “unfairly discriminated” against US, saying: “They are opening up their country. Their current is a little closed.\" Starmer said: \"This is a really fantastic, historic day – a real tribute to the history we have of working together. This [deal] is going to boost trade.\" In response to the news, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders boss Mike Hawes said: \"The agreement to reduce tariffs on UK car exports into the US is great news for the industry and consumers. \"The application of these tariffs was a severe and immediate threat to UK automotive exporters, so this deal will provide much needed relief, allowing both the industry and those that work in it to approach the future more positively.\" The news marks a major step down from Trump's March announcement, when he signed a bill that penalised all car makers importing cars into the US market. At the time, Trump said the decision was made because of the imbalance of American-made car sales in other markets and claimed the move would lead to \"tremendous growth\" for the US automotive industry.  Around eight million cars were imported into the US last year, approximately half the total sold in the market. Most were from Mexico, Canada, Germany and Japan. The news will offer relief to the UK’s car makers, especially JLR (Jaguar Land Rover), which counts the US as its biggest market, having sent 130,000 cars there in 2024. It last month paused shipments to the US as it worked to “address the new trading terms”. Speaking today, JLR CEO Adrian Mardell said: “The car industry is vital to the UK’s economic prosperity, sustaining 250,000 jobs. We warmly welcome this deal which brings greater certainty for our sector and the communities it supports. \"We would like to thank the UK and US Governments for agreeing this deal at pace and look forward to continued engagement over the coming months.”   Mini will also welcome the news, given that the Mini Cooper hatchback, which has recorded a near-doubling in US sales so far this year, is made at Oxford. However, the Countryman SUV, made bigger in its most recent generation as part of a US market push, is made in Germany, which remains subject to the 25 tariff. Tariff negotiations between the EU (of which Germany is a member) and US are still ongoing.",

    "title": "Mercedes CLA: game-changing 484-mile EV priced from £45k",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-cla-game-changing-484-mile-ev-priced-%C2%A345k",
    "description": "CLA is 29mm taller, 35mm longer and 25mm wider than before, with 61mm more wheelbase Hyper-efficient saloon becomes UK's longest-range electric car, while hybrid promises diesel-style MPG The new Mercedes-Benz CLA saloon, Europe’s longest-range and most efficient electric car, has gone on sale priced from £45,615. With deliveries to start this summer, the entry-level CLA 250+ with EQ Technology will be capable of driving up to 484 miles between charges, Mercedes claims, and will still manage some 420 miles if driven exclusively at motorway speeds. These figures mean the CLA EQ leapfrogs all other EVs available in the UK. That includes Mercedes’s own flagship EQS 450+ saloon, which manages 481 miles per charge from a 118kWh battery. That car costs a whopping £112,610 – some £65,000 more than the CLA EQ’s opening price. The rest of the CLA EQ's range is priced at £49,3751 for the AMG Line Edition and £51,7701 for the top-spec AMG Line Premium Edition. The remarkable range figure is thanks to Mercedes’ efforts to minimise the CLA EQ’s energy consumption: it has a nickel-managanese-cobalt (NMC) battery of just 85kWh in capacity. This means the CLA EQ achieves an efficiency figure north of 5.0mpkWh – which many manufacturers consider the key to taking EVs to the next level. However, while it promises an impressive range figure, the CLA is unable to use any 400V DC charger - a common standard across the UK and Europe, meaning owners will be limited to using newer public charging stations. PUNCHY BUT FRUGAL The CLA EV’s impressive range figure is in no small part thanks to its aerodynamic design. Although the car is larger than its predecessor in every dimension (25mm wider, 25mm taller and 30mm longer), much work went into minimising its frontal area, and smoothing the flow of air around it. For example, the wheels are set further in-board of the arches than its predecessor. Small inlets on the front bumper (and corresponding outlets at the rear) guide the flow of air around each corner, relatively undisturbed by the alloy wheels’ flush-faced designs. The efforts net a slippery drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21, just behind that of the EQS (0.20) and ahead that of the Tesla Model 3 (0.22). The CLA EV’s new rear-mounted permanent magnet motor is also significant to its efficiency. It uses a new silicon-carbide inverter that brings greater output in a smaller package, reducing weight, while the engineers claim its torque density is boosted by the magnets being inserted in a double-V formation, concentrating their field. The motor also gets a Porsche Taycan-style two-speed gearbox, rather than the usual single-speed reduction gearing. This has a short (11:1) first ratio for improved off-the-mark acceleration and better efficiency at town speeds and a significantly longer (5:1) second ratio for less consumption at a cruise. The powertrain puts out 268bhp, which allows the CLA 250+ to complete the 0-62mph dash in 6.7sec. The four-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology gets an additional 107bhp motor with a single-speed gearbox on its front axle, giving a combined output of 349bhp. This cuts its 0-62mph sprint time down to 4.9sec, making it quicker in a straight line than the V8-engined C55 AMG of 20 years ago. This additional motor is decoupled from the front axle when it isn’t needed, reducing energy losses to friction by 90%. This means the four-wheel-drive CLA EV can still manage 478 miles per charge – a smaller disparity compared with the rear-driven version than is typical of most other EVs. Braking primarily relies on the motors’ regenerative effect (which can provide up to 200kW of stopping power), helping to keep the battery topped up. The CLA EV can be rapid-charged at rates of up to 320kW, thanks to its 800V electrical architecture, allowing for a 186-mile top-up in just 10 minutes. In addition to the 85kWh battery, a 58kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) pack will be added to the line- up shortly after launch. This will almost certainly bring a significant price cut but also reduce the CLA EV’s range to around 300 miles. Autocar can reveal that a hot AMG CLA 45 EV is inbound, too, with a pair of Yasa-developed axial flux motors providing more than 500bhp and a raft of extensive modifications aimed at bolstering its performance and dynamics.  ADVANCES IN COMBUSTION TOO The new CLA will also be offered in hybrid form. Specifically designed to fit in the same space as the EV’s front motor, its powertrain pairs a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a small, 1.3kWh battery and a 27bhp electric motor. These combine to send either 134bhp or 161bhp through the front wheels or, in the range-topping 4Matic model, 188bhp to all four wheels. According to Mercedes, the engine achieves “diesel levels of fuel efficiency”, suggesting an MPG figure comfortably north of 50. As part of a push for parity from Mercedes, the hybrid CLA will be priced on a par with the CLA EV, Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius recently announced. This is thanks to cost savings of some 30% in battery production bringing the EV’s overall price down by around 15%. The EV will go on sale first, around October, with the hybrid following a few months later. Joining the saloon will be a new CLA Shooting Brake. This estate car is earmarked to arrive in the UK early next year with both powertrain options, so its unveiling will most likely take place at September’s Munich motor show. STAR-SPANGLED In a first for Mercedes, the CLA hybrid and CLA EV will look almost identical inside and out, as well as sharing a model name. This marks an end to Mercedes’ strategy of entirely bespoke EVs being developed to sit alongside their combustion-engined equivalents, such as with the E-Class and EQE. The CLA also ushers in a dramatic new look for future Mercedes models, emphasising the brand’s three-pointed star logo. The motif features in the CLA’s headlights and rear brake lights, and the EV also gets a flush front grille with no fewer than 142 backlit stars. They surround the main front badge, which is also backlit. In the US, the outer ring of the badge itself is lit, but EU legislation prevents this. The CLA hybrid is differentiated by a traditional open grille, needed to provide cooling airflow to the engine. NEW-LOOK INTERIOR Inside, the new CLA takes on a sportier character than its more luxurious stablemates. The front seats have chunky side bolsters, for example, and there are more exuberant material choices, such as a combination of black and white Alcantara and faux leather with red stitching. The dashboard is designed around the latest iteration of Mercedes’ Superscreen, whose three digital displays (a 10.25in one for the instruments in front of the driver; a 14.6in infotainment one centrally; and, optionally, a 14in one for the front passenger) span its entire width. Thanks to Mercedes’ latest MB.OS operating system, the screens can be used to play video games such as Fortnite while on the move or stream shows and films via Netflix and other such services. The system also features the latest iteration of Mercedes’ virtual assistant, which blends various artificial intelligence functions (ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Bing) to provide more accurate answers to questions. In cars without the Superscreen, the passenger screen will be replaced with a glass panel with LED-backlit star logos, which match the interior’s ambient lighting. Boot space is rated at 405 litres, which is 55 litres down in the old CLA’s but, in a first for a modern Mercedes, the EV gets a frunk that adds another 101 litres of storage space.",

    "description": "The modern Triumph Bonneville T120 is a true sleeper. Its gentlemanly aesthetic follows the traditional Bonneville formula, but its rumbling parallel-twin motor kicks out 105 Nm of torque at just 3,500 rpm. It’s handsome and remarkably comfortable—and it’s not shy about getting down. This Triumph Bonneville T120 street tracker from China’s Mandrill Garage is an entirely different beast. It’s shed the T120’s mild-mannered looks for a muscular vibe—one that, if we’re being honest, would make a fine addition to Triumph’s current model range. Based in Beijing, Mandrill is more than just a custom bike garage. They run a bar and restaurant too, flexing their creative muscles with everything from cocktails to clothing. Their eclecticism is reflected in their custom motorcycles, which typically feature contemporary lines, high-end finishes, and vibrant liveries—just like this T120.…",

    "description": "The vintage BMW R-series boxer remains a perennial favorite among custom motorcycle builders. But there’s a downside to its popularity; with so many custom boxers on the road, it’s hard to build one that truly stands out. This lovely 1978 BMW R100/7 from Japan’s Heiwa MC doesn’t rely on wild engineering or crazy fabrication to grab attention. Instead, it’s the small details that distinguish it as a master-built machine. The brief for this project was familiar territory for the founder of the Hiroshima-based workshop, Kengo Kimura. His customer wanted a handsome street bike with café racer underpinnings and simplicity as a guiding principle. That meant retaining recognizable parts like the OEM fuel tank, but nipping and tucking everything else. Kimura-san responded with an array of judicious mods and subtle finishes, showing the sort of restraint that’s become a hallmark of his work.…",

    "description": "Launched in 2022 as Kia’s first EV in India, the EV6 has always stood out for its striking design, innovative cabin and punchy performance. There’s now an updated version out that promises more range, and we’ve put it through its paces to see how it performs. Kia EV6 Range and Efficiency - 9/10 Larger 84kWh battery translates into an impressive 498km combined real-world range. Composed road manners, hushed cabin make it a relaxing drive. With this facelift, the EV gets a new, larger 84kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) battery, replacing the older 77.4kWh unit. This new battery is not only more energy-dense but also lighter. The WLTP range has increased to 581km, up by 53km. Impressively, in real-world conditions, we managed a combined range of 498km, which is closer than usual to the official figure. City driving yielded an efficiency of 5.18km/kWh, which translates to a usable range of around 435km. Interestingly, highway efficiency was even better at 6.67km/kWh, delivering a range of approximately 560km. It’s worth noting, however, that ambient temperatures rose by 12 degrees during our city run, which meant the AC was working harder to keep the cabin cool, impacting efficiency. Also, while we used Level 3 (out of 4) regen braking in the city, it wasn’t strong enough to bring the car to a complete halt and didn’t recoup much. As for charging, the EV6 supports ultra-fast DC charging at speeds of up to 350kW, allowing it to go from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. Kia EV6 Exterior Design and Engineering - 9/10 Gets new headlights, bumpers and alloys; still based on the born-EV E-GMP skateboard platform. On the outside, changes to the EV6 are subtle but impactful. The most noticeable update is the new headlights, which now feature a hook-like LED DRL signature, adding to the futuristic appeal, and there’s a full-width LED strip connecting the headlights. The facelift is offered exclusively in the sportier GT-Line trim in India. There are new bumpers at both ends and a fresh design for the 19-inch alloy wheels. Minor tweaks to the LED elements in the rear lightbar further refine the appearance. Under the skin, it continues to be based on the E-GMP skateboard platform, with its advanced 800V electrical architecture, shared with the Hyundai Ioniq 5. The EV6 remains a substantial car, measuring nearly 4.7 metres in length and 1.9 metres in width, with a generous 2.9-metre wheelbase. Kia EV6 Interior Space and Comfort - 8/10 Comfy front seats feature heating, ventilation and a zero-gravity mode; rear seat wide enough for three adults, but you’re sat in a knees-up position. Rear is spacious for three, but you’re sat knees-up. Step inside, and you’ll find that the cabin retains its familiar layout but with some updates. A more conventional three-spoke steering wheel replaces the old two-spoke unit, the dashboard gets new textures, and the screens get new software and a user interface. The twin 12.3-inch high-definition screens are crisp and intuitive, with logically arranged menus. While they operate smoothly, they are prone to reflections, and the new minimalist themes, though modern, can appear a bit sparse. It’s also worth noting that the fingerprint scanner seen at the Auto Expo 2025 is absent in the version on sale. New UI is easy to use, logically laid out, and follows a minimalist theme. Comfort levels are high, especially in the front seats, which offer firm but supportive cushioning. A standout feature is the zero-gravity mode, allowing the front occupants to fully recline and relax when the car is stationary. The rear bench is spacious enough to accommodate three adults with ease. There’s ample knee and headroom, and the backrest reclines for additional comfort. However, thigh support is compromised due to the high floor, and window blinds have been given a miss. Boot space stands at a respectable 490 litres, but the compartment is shallow. There’s also a frunk, though it’s small at 20 litres.   Kia EV6 Performance and Refinement - 9/10 Performance is strong and feels seamless to drive; wind and road noise is well-contained. The EV6 continues with the same dual-motor setup, producing 325hp and 605Nm. The claimed 0-100kph time is 5.3sec (just 0.1sec slower than before), but we managed a quicker 5.16sec in our testing. Roll-on acceleration is impressive too, with 20-80kph despatched in 2.77sec and 40-100kph in 3.49sec. Performance, then, remains a strong suit. The EV6 feels very natural to drive, thanks to well-calibrated acceleration. Unlike EVs of old, the EV6 serves up its power in a progressive manner rather than in one big chunk, which aids drivability. The all-wheel-drive system also ensures excellent traction, helping put down the power effectively. Drive modes alter the car’s behaviour – Eco softens responses to maximise efficiency, Sport sharpens everything up, and Individual lets drivers customise settings to their preference.

When it comes to ride and handling, the EV6 strikes a good balance. Around corners, it feels confident and composed, with good grip levels. The steering offers decent weight in Sport, though it lacks feedback. Despite riding on large 19-inch wheels, the EV6 maintains good ride comfort. It can feel a touch firm at lower speeds but settles nicely as you go faster, delivering a pliant and absorbent ride. There are some vertical movements at higher speeds, but they’re well-contained. Cabin insulation is impressive, too, with minimal wind or road noise. Kia EV6 Features and Safety - 9/10 Features two 12.3-inch screens, Meridian audio system, ADAS tech and has V2V, V2L capabilities.  The EV6 remains generously equipped. Highlights include a sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, two 12.3-inch displays, wireless smartphone integration, wireless charging, ambient lighting, a head-up display, and a top-tier 14-speaker Meridian audio system. A larger sunroof would’ve helped the sense of space, especially given that the upholstery is black. On the safety front, it features 8 airbags, a 360-degree camera, and a comprehensive ADAS suite. This includes adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and lane-keep assist. Additionally, the EV6 supports both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-load (V2L) functions, enabling it to charge other EVs or power external appliances. Kia EV6 Price and Verdict - 7/10 A well-rounded and premium package, with great real-world performance and range. Imported as a completely built unit (CBU), the Kia EV6 facelift is priced at Rs 65.97 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which positions it higher than its rivals, such as the Ioniq 5, BMW iX1 LWB and BYD Sealion 7. However, some dealerships are offering substantial discounts, which could bring it into your budget. Overall, the Kia EV6 continues to impress with its futuristic styling, premium interiors, and generous features list. Performance remains strong, and the improved real-world range makes it even more appealing. While it may lack a premium badge, the EV6 delivers a genuinely premium experience and stands out as one of the most well-rounded EVs on sale today.

    "description": "Audi is no stranger to odd naming decisions. It replaced its engine displacement badge with an arbitrary ‘performance’ number; ‘e-tron’ (aside from its meaning in French) was first a model, then a suffix, and now a sub-brand; and did you know its CNG cars are badged g-tron? Most recently, in 2023, the brand made the bold decision to assign odd numbers to all its ICE model names and even numbers to all EVs, turning decades of legacy on its head. It was so confusing to customers that the brand reneged in 2025 and is back to numbering cars based on their size. But even before this double U-turn, one model never quite sat right on the scale, and that’s the Q8. 8 is the largest number in the Audi model range, but the Q8 is not the largest SUV. It also implies a relation to the A8, but the Q8 offers nowhere near that kind of chauffeur-driven experience. Most confoundingly, it shares its name with the Q8 e-tron, an EV that’s noticeably smaller. Some argue that it earns its 8 because it’s a sporty, stylish coupé-SUV positioned above the Q7 – but then, its name would include ‘Sportback’, which it doesn’t. Looks menacing and sleek without going over the top. Having spent some time with our long-term Q8, I’ve realised it is best not to think about any of that too much because it detracts from the fact that this is an honest-to-goodness great luxury SUV. For one – and going back to that ‘Sportback’ point – though it looks a little sleeker than most big 5-seat SUVs, it sacrifices no space or practicality to the design. You’d have seen Santa Sergius load it up with Christmas gifts (Autocar India, January 2025), and I, too, managed a couple of airport runs in my time with the Q8. The boot can hold a lot more than its 605-litre rating or the dipping roofline would have you believe, and the rear seat is wide and spacious. I once carried a full complement of passengers, and they actually marvelled at how they weren’t making contact with one another. 605-litre boot is more spacious than it looks on the outside. The Q8 is part of the outgoing generation of big Audis, and with it will go a distinct interior layout that was started with the current Q7 a decade ago. It’s not without its flaws, like the dashboard and centre console made entirely of gloss-black plastic and screens, which attract a layer of dust every time I open the windows even for a short while. But back then, it successfully modernised the Audi interior while keeping it classy and expensive-looking, and that holds true even today, more so now that we’ve seen what’s coming next. It’s a similar story with the digital dials that, though simple, are incredibly clear and easy to read on the move. Among the last Audis to use this cabin layout. Not without flaws, but oh so classy. It’s a big car, for better or worse. I absolutely love lording over traffic on the way to work every day, but navigating the tiny streets in my neighbourhood and parking in my small driveway is tedious, to say the least. At my typical crawling speeds, it’s not surprising that a 2.1-tonne SUV with a turbo-petrol V6 isn’t going to be efficient, but 5.4kpl is low by any measure. And while Sergius enjoyed the ride quality on his highway drive to Goa, in town, the suspension feels firm (and the steering heavy); air suspension is a feature they should not have deleted. Struggled to reach even 6kpl on the daily commute. Then there’s Sakhir Gold: a colour that doesn’t even slightly resemble gold but is no less alluring for it (another confusing Audi naming choice, I suppose). I love the paint shade and am glad they offer it amidst the greys, blacks and silvers typical of German luxury cars. You can even get it on the Q7 now, and it never fails to rouse a remark from anyone who steps into the SUV. In fact, in my experience, whoever does experience the Q8 has only good things to say about it. It’s only those of us who’ve been trying to wrap our heads around its positioning who never quite got it. With the facelift and price revision, it’s now better placed against the likes of the BMW X5 and Mercedes GLE, and in my opinion, it looks better than either of them. By the time you read this, it will have left the fleet and been replaced by a Q7, and for many in the team, that will be an upgrade. For one, it’s got even more space and, crucially, smaller wheels and air suspension, which should allow it to ride better. But its colour? Samurai Grey. Boo!

    "description": "Volvo Cars has unveiled the new XC70 as a plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) for the Chinese market, bringing back a nameplate that has been inactive since 2016. Previously associated with the off-road version of the Volvo V70 station wagon, the XC70 badge now marks a full-fledged SUV. The luxury carmaker claims the latest XC70 is the brand’s first extended-range PHEV as it has a pure electric range of around 200km – the highest for any Volvo car yet. The 2025 Volvo XC70 will slot between the XC60 and XC90 SUVs upon launch. Volvo didn’t disclose details about the XC70’s performance and interior Volvo XC70 launch in China slated for later this year Launch in other markets to be explored as well New Volvo XC70 platform details Built on the new Scalable Modular Architecture, AWD to be offered Volvo says the XC70 PHEV has been developed specifically \"to meet the demand for longer-range plug-in hybrids in China\". The latest XC70 is underpinned by the new Scalable Modular Architecture (SMA), designed for range-extended electric vehicles (REXs), and Volvo describes it as \"a premium extended-range plug-in hybrid [base]\". Volvo’s parent company, Geely (headquartered in China), is investing heavily in extended-range hybrids in response to lower-than-expected demand for fully electric luxury cars. LEVC, one of Geely’s other brands, has been using a REX powertrain in its Volvo-engined TX taxi. However, unlike the TX, which uses a combustion engine solely to recharge the battery, the new Volvo XC70 has a more conventional plug-in hybrid setup. Additionally, the presence of an ‘AWD’ badge on the XC70’s boot suggests that a four-wheel-drive system will be on offer. More details about the powertrain will be revealed in the coming months. New Volvo XC70 exterior design Active shutter tech for optimised airflow borrowed from Volvo EVs The XC70 borrows visual cues from other Volvo models, like the signature ‘Thor’s Hammer’ DRLs and C-shaped tail-lights. Its front section is fully sealed, including both the nose and bumper grille, which features an active shutter system that opens and closes automatically. Inspired by Volvo EVs, the shutter optimises aerodynamics, cabin climate and cooling. Flanking the bumper are Matrix LED headlights that adapt to traffic and road conditions, enhancing both visibility and safety.  As per the Volvo XC70 images, the SUV appears slightly longer than the XC60 but shorter than the flagship XC90, positioning it between the two. The XC70 design comprises smooth lines that flow from front to rear, complemented by a gently sloping roofline. Other exterior design elements include flush-fitting door handles, aerodynamic alloy wheels, a sculpted section along the doors, and LED tail-lights (which look similar to the all-electric Volvo EX40). Rising demand for PHEVs in China Demand for electric cars slowing in the country China-bound VW ID.Era SUV (concept). Interestingly, the 2025 Volvo XC70 reveal comes just weeks after Volkswagen showed its plug-in hybrid ID.Era SUV concept for China. Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said long-range hybrid technology provides \"a perfect bridge to full electrification\" amid a slowing demand for pure-EVs. \"It enables us to maintain and develop a balanced product portfolio, while offering a highly attractive alternative to customers who are not yet ready for fully electric cars,\" he added. Volvo will explore launching the XC70 in other potential markets at a later stage.

    "description": "Triumph is gearing up to launch a more premium version of the Scrambler 400 X. This variant will be called the Scrambler 400 XC, and the main difference between the two bikes will be that the XC will run on a pair of cross-spoke wheels. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC to feature cross-spoke wheels Will get body-colour-matched high fender and flyscreen Likely to cost around Rs 25,000-30,000 more than the 400 X Triumph Scrambler 400 XC: What do we know so far? The higher-spec XC variant will feature cross-spoke wheels, high fender and a flyscreen The Triumph Scrambler 400 XC will share its engine, frame, and most cycle parts with the existing 400 X. The differences between the two Scrambler 400 variants will boil down to a pair of cross-spoke wheels that support tubeless tyres in place of alloys. The XC will also get a body-coloured high fender, flyscreen, and additional engine protection, which is currently offered as an accessory on the regular Scrambler 400 X. All these upgrades are likely to push the price up by a fair margin. Currently, the Scrambler 400 X is priced at Rs 2.67 lakh, and the dealers we have spoken to have led us to believe the Scrambler 400 XC will carry a premium of around Rs 25,000 over the 400 X. At that price, it will be positioned very close to the Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 and KTM 390 Adventure X. However, it is worth noting that the Scrambler price has not changed much since its launch at 2.67 lakh, whereas the Speed 400 has risen from the original introductory price of Rs 2.23 lakh to Rs 2.46 lakh. The Scrambler 400 XC will be sold alongside the Scrambler 400 X. We expect Triumph to launch the XC variant sometime next week. Also see: ADV motorcycles with the lowest seat height under Rs 4 lakh",
