    "description": "When you’re late to the game, the best way to make an entry is with innovation. That’s exactly what Alpinestars did when they got into the motorcycle helmet market with the SM10 about six years ago. Having recently moved to this helmet after retiring my Leat GPX 5.5 (another innovative product), there’s a lot of out-of-the-box thinking that I’ve appreciated. The M10's snap-fit peak mechanism is convenient. For starters, I love the way the peak fit flush with the shell. The safety advantage is that the smooth interface leaves no edges or fasteners to catch on the ground in the fall, but the big benefit to me is the unique snap-fit fastening mechanism. There are no screws involved, and you can just pull the peak off or snap it back into place, which is a huge convenience if you regularly travel with the helmet. The downside of this design is that the peak position is not adjustable. The M10's liner has speaker cutouts. Other nice touches include speaker pockets and a three-way adjustable headband that can slightly adjust the angle at which the helmet sits on your head. There are grooves in the inner EPS liner for you to neatly route a drinks tube from a hydration bladder. Astars has also extended the EPS liner down below the cutout of the outer shell in the collarbone area. This is to reduce the chance of common injuries when the helmet hits the collarbone in a crash. Like many off-road helmets, this one also uses a variation of the MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) technology. This enables a small amount of rotational slip between the outer shell and the inner liner, which is supposed to reduce the chances of concussion and other brain/neck injuries. The shell is constructed in a tri-composite material that uses carbon fibre, carbon composite and aramid fibres. Weighing in at 1,180gm, this would have been considered in the middle ground a few years ago, but it is now quite light with today’s stricter safety standards.   There are a huge number of vents all over the helmet (I counted 28!), and as you’d expect, the airflow is superb. The vision port is also very large, which means you should be able to fit a big pair of goggles without any issues. The comfort padding is fully removable and washable, and it uses an interesting fastening system, where you first align the buttons and then slide them into place. It works well once you figure it out. The M10's liner has exceptional ventilation. With a head circumference of 56.5cm, I’m in the no man’s land between sizes S and M. I went with the S that I usually use with other brands, but I find it a bit too tight. Astars has 5mm thinner accessory cheek pads that I’m keen to try, but I suspect it might have been smarter to go for the M size (which uses a larger shell) and then opt for the 5mm thicker accessory cheek pads if necessary. Just another reminder of why you must always try before you buy. Priced between USD 650 and USD 800, this helmet is on par with the competition from top rival brands. The M10 ships with a spare peak and a bag that’s spacious enough to hold a pair of goggles and even a jersey and pants set without the armour. While the helmet does feel very well-made, there is still a small margin to be gained in terms of ultimate quality and plushness when compared to something like an Arai. But in pure performance terms, this helmet is superb, and it can justify its price.

    "description": "\"Short-term pain, long-term gain” is the chant in my head these days. No, I haven’t taken to heavy gymming. I’m just your average road user in Mumbai. You see, the city is amidst a large-scale surface concretisation drive, with authorities promising pothole-free roads in the not-too-distant future. The trouble is, they are seemingly tackling every road in the city – all at once. The city’s a mess, to put it politely. What’s not barricaded is broken. And this is precisely why the Skoda Slavia’s 179mm of ground clearance is a figure not lost on me. Ample clearance allows Slavia to tackle crater-sized potholes and giant speed breakers with ease. My short commute to work has been reduced to an obstacle course with three particularly bad sections that would catch out your regular sedan. But there are no such problems with the Slavia, which clears the nastiest of surfaces with ease. It rounds off the bumps well, and there’s a robustness to the suspension that shines through when the going gets rough. Also nice is the steering, which calls for little effort when tackling the slalom course of potholes and barricades. The Slavia in question is the latest car to join our long-term fleet. It’s a 1.5 TSI with a DSG transmission in tasty Monte Carlo spec. The Monte Carlo trades chrome for black details, and to my eyes, it’s the best-looking version of the Skoda sedan. For the full effect, opt for this Tornado Red. It’s a cheery sight on the smoggiest and dustiest of days. Just wish Skoda didn’t hold back on the wheels. As a sucker for sexy wheels, I find the current 16-inch ones to be a bit plain. The touch panel for the climate control system isn’t the easiest to use on the go. But I love what Skoda has done with the interior. The predominantly black theme with contrast red details, including part-red upholstery, makes for a colourful setting to spend long hours in. The sporty aluminium pedals look swell, too. Longish stints behind the wheel have also enhanced my appreciation for the front seats. The backrest extends quite far up, and that means great shoulder support even for a tall driver like me. The seats are electrically adjustable, which is a boon, too, and while ventilation is a cool feature (literally so), it does get quite noisy at full blast. On the subject, the air conditioning is putting up a good fight against the unusual heat, but I find myself needing to take manual control of the blower speed every now and then. Also, I’m still not convinced about the touch slider for temperature and blower control. An indent helps place your finger, but precise inputs still require taking your eyes off the road, which isn’t ideal. The red-on-black interior theme exclusive to the Monte Carlo lends its cabin a cheerful vibe. Among the things that get a big thumbs up is the touchscreen. It’s slick and quick to wirelessly connect with Apple CarPlay. I’d also rate the audio system highly. There’s a depth to the sound that adds greatly to your music. Sadly, the sound system can’t cover up the creaks from the door and window beadings. This is supposedly an easy fix, but I’d rather not have to deal with it in the first place. Creaks from the door and window beadings are irritating. I haven’t touched upon performance yet because my driving thus far hasn’t done justice to the capabilities of the sweet 150hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine. A quick overtake here and a brisk departure from a traffic light there; that was all the flexing the Slavia got to do. But I can tell that it’s a very refined engine and works well with the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox. The Slavia’s been averaging 7.7-8.7kpl in the slow-speed crawl it’s been subjected to. These are not shining figures per se but are par for the course for turbo-petrol mills in the same environment. The front-seat backrests extend high up and offer great shoulder support. Kpl and kph figures will improve once the roads do. Over to the authorities to get the job done.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-aston-martin-dbx-s-outpunches-purosangue-717bhp",
    "description": "New DBX is one of the most powerful pure-ICE SUVs on the market Aston Martin has launched a faster and lighter flagship S variant of the DBX SUV, cranking the power to 717bhp to make it the most powerful non-electrified SUV on the market. Although the British company has used the S badge for a range of high-performance specials, starting with the Vanquish S in 2004, this is the first time it has been applied to its best-selling SUV. Aston Martin CEO Adrian Hallmark claimed the new model serves as “a powerful statement of intent”, signalling that lighter, more powerful variants will remain a key part of the firm’s future model plan. The new DBX S will sit above the current 697bhp DBX 707 - since April last year, the only variant offered in the UK. It retains the same 4.0-litre twinturbocharged V8 but it has been reworked, with larger compressor wheel diameters taken from the Valhalla. Aston Martin has also tuned it to offer more “urgency” at the top end of the rev counter. While that means the 0-62mph time remains at 3.3sec, Aston claims the 0-124mph acceleration time is cut by 0.3sec. Meanwhile, a new exhaust system has been fitted to make the V8 louder, the steering ratio is 4% faster and the turning circle has been trimmed by nearly half a metre. The DBX S’s 717bhp output makes it 2bhp more powerful than its Ferrari Purosangue rival – which draws power from a naturally aspirated 6.5-litre V12 – but still leaves it short of rivals that use electrified powertrains, such as the 729bhp Porsche Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid and 789bhp Lamborghini Urus SE. The DBX S retains the 707’s variable all-wheel drive system and nine-speed wet-clutch automatic gearbox, although Aston Martin says the change-up points for the gearbox have been reworked to account for the wider rev range, and the downshifts in Sport and Sport+ modes are more aggressive. Aston Martin has also significantly reduced the weight of the DBX S by up to 47kg compared with the 2245kg 707. The slimming measures include a new optional carbonfibre roof, which forgoes roof rails and saves 18kg of mass as well as lowering the centre of gravity. There are also optional 23in magnesium wheels, which are 19kg lighter than the standard aluminium versions, and an optional polycarbonate honeycomb grille. Beyond the weightsaving features, the DBX S gains a number of styling changes, including a new black grille design inspired by the DBS 770 Ultimate, a new splitter and diffuser, and new side sills that help channel airflow around the side of the car. At the back, the quad exhausts have been vertically stacked, while the rear bumper has been extensively reworked.  Inside, there is a bespoke S design with a herringbone pattern on the seats and this is extended to the headlining if the carbonfibre roof is selected. Alcantara upholstery is standard, while semi-aniline leather and red seatbelts are optional. A 14-speaker audio system is standard and a 23-speaker Bowers \u0026 Wilkins set-up is also offered. The DBX S is available to order now and deliveries are set to begin in the final quarter of 2025. Pricing has yet to be confirmed but it will be a step up from the £205,000 DBX 707.",

    "title": "What is Apple CarPlay and how does it work?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay",
    "description": "Apple CarPlay lets you to use your iPhone's apps through your car's infotainment screen We explain everything you need to know about Apple's in-car smartphone mirroring software Apple CarPlay is a software package that mirrors your iPhone's apps and services on your car's infotainment screen, and it's one of the most desired features for people who want to buy a new car in 2025.  CarPlay was launched in March 2014 and has since become a piece of tech that many drivers consider integral to their car ownership experience. Some won’t even consider buying a car unless CarPlay is included as standard.  But what is Apple CarPlay, how do you access it, and what does it do?  We’ve put together a comprehensive guide right here so you can get to know one of the automotive world’s most-used pieces of software. What is Apple CarPlay? An alternative to Android Auto for iPhone owners, CarPlay helps you to stay connected when on the move, allowing you to legally take phone calls, use your favourite sat-nav app and play your favourite music.   Thanks to its slick and familiar interface, many drivers prefer to use CarPlay over the operating system (OS) included in their car as standard. Similarly to Android Auto, CarPlay is controlled through large icons on your car's infotainment screen. Most cars nowadays have a touchscreen, but those that don’t let you use the software via a physical control.  Car makers clearly understand the value of the product, with some 600 car models around the world using the software. Does my phone have Apple CarPlay? Do you own an iPhone? If you do, you can most probably use Apple CarPlay. The software is compatible with iPhones produced from 2012, so that’s the iPhone 5 and onwards.  CarPlay comes as standard on all iPhones carrying at least Apple’s iOS 7.1 software, launched in 2013. Apple launched iOS 18 in September 2024.  Android phones don't have access to CarPlay, instead relying on Google’s own Android Auto system, which largely offers the same functions. How do I open Apple CarPlay? Once you’ve made sure your car is one of the 600-plus models compatible with CarPlay, there are a few ways you can connect to it. Here's a list of them.  The most common connection method is by using a USB cable, although some newer cars offer wireless CarPlay, which uses Bluetooth and wi-fi for the connection.  If your iPhone is previous to the iPhone 15, you will need to use a Lightning-to-USB cable. All newer iPhones use the universal USB-C cable.  How to connect to Apple CarPlay First, locate the relevant USB port on your car. This is usually below the infotainment screen, in the central storage bin or somewhere on the centre control.  Plug in your iPhone and a message should appear after a few seconds asking if you want to start CarPlay. Simply press ‘yes’ and the service will start on the car's screen.  If your car supports both wired and wireless CarPlay connections, this will also register your iPhone to use the service wirelessly on future drives. You will be prompted to start CarPlay when you start the car in close proximity to your iPhone. If your car supports only a wireless connection (or you don’t want to use a cable), the connection process is slightly more complicated, and the procedure varies from car to car.  Some require you to plug your phone in for the first time before connecting wirelessly every time afterwards. Others act as a wi-fi hotspot to which you can connect your phone. What's next for Apple CarPlay? Apple updates CarPlay fairly regularly, with the latest iteration releasing in March 2025 as part of the brand's iOS 18.4 software update.  The update brought an additional line of icons for some models with larger infotainment screens, as well as a proper integrated electric vehicle routing system for Apple Maps.  The real big changes are due to arrive with the long-awaited 'CarPlay 2', which was first detailed by Apple in 2022.  It's tipped to be more powerful and feature-filled than ever before, taking over all of your vehicle's digital screens, including the digital driver's display. That means you could be driving around with an Apple-designed dashboard in the future with bespoke speedometers and dials.  I'll also be able to change your climate controls, radio and heated seats, which could mean traditional infotainment software becomes a thing of the past. When will the new Apple CarPlay arrive? First revealed in 2022, Apple stated the newest iteration of CarPlay would arrive by the end of 2023. It later revised this date to the end of 2024, and has now removed any estimated launch date from the CarPlay website.  That means we're not entirely sure when the new Apple CarPlay system will launch, but it could be this year. It has also been previously detailed that sports car brands Aston Martin and Porsche would receive the update first, but as yet, to no avail.  What apps can I use through Apple CarPlay? Not all apps are supported by CarPlay, but those that do will display on your car’s screen while you’re connected. Here’s a list of some of our favourites that are supported. Spotify A popular music, podcast and audiobook streaming service. Messages Apple’s Siri software will read out your received texts and allow you to send messages back via voice control. Whatsapp The same as the above, plus the ability to make and receive phone calls. Amazon Music A music streaming service. BBC Sounds The BBC’s own app for streaming podcasts and radio. Apple Maps Apple’s own sat-nav system. Waze An indepenent sat-nav app with many exclusive features not offered by its Google and Apple counterparts. Google Maps Yes, Apple CarPlay is an Apple product, but you can still use Google Maps, which is arguably the most reliable sat-nav app out there. ZapMap, ChargePoint, Plugshare Independent apps to quickly find a public charging point for that all-important EV battery top-up.  Can you play games on Apple CarPlay? CarPlay is designed to help you drive without being distracted by your phone, so no, you can’t play games using the software. Which cars have Apple CarPlay? Fun fact: the first ever car to feature CarPlay was the Ferrari FF, which was updated in 2014 to add the functionality.  Most mainstream brands have added CarPlay to their cars since, but it was often reserved for more expensive trim levels or offered as an optional extra.  Now, though, it’s usually a standard feature due to its popularity. As we mentioned above, more than 600 car models on sale today are available with CarPlay, including cars from Audi, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Skoda, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW and Ford. If you’re still unsure whether your car supports CarPlay or whether to connect using a USB cable or wirelessly, check the owner’s manual or consult Apple’s list of available models.  My car is old and doesn’t have CarPlay; can I fit it myself? You can fit Apple CarPlay yourself by buying and installing an infotainment system from an aftermarket manufacturer. So long as the car has a standard-sized (single- or double-DIN) sound system, it should be compatible.  This can be replaced by a more modern touchscreen system from aftermarket manufacturers such as Alpine, Pioneer and Sony, with prices varying from around £200 to £1500 depending on screen size and functionality. You can do this yourself, but we would recommend going to a car audio professional for peace of mind, even if it will cost a little extra. Is Apple CarPlay free? CarPlay is free to use, as are most of the apps supported by it. In 2019, BMW attempted to introduce an £85 annual fee to use CarPlay after the first year of car ownership, but it reversed the decision after a backlash from customers and the media. You will need to be wary of your mobile data charges, though. Podcasts, music streaming and other apps can use a lot of data quickly, so make sure you keep an eye on what you’re downloading to avoid any unwanted charges.",

    "description": "Ferrari has just unveiled the new 296 Speciale Coupe and Aperta, which join an iconic lineage of special edition Ferrari berlinettas, following in the footsteps of the Challenge Stradale, 430 Scuderia, 458 Speciale and 488 Pista – cars that have earned reputations for not only increased performance but also their heightened driving involvement. Like its predecessors, the 296 Speciale builds on the standard car – in this case, the 296 GTB – by increasing power, reducing weight and adding track-focused upgrades. The result is a car aimed squarely at the brand’s most committed drivers. Ferrari 296 Speciale is the first V6 plug-in hybrid in the special edition series  Produces 50hp more power and is 60kg lighter than regular 296 GTB  Customer deliveries to begin in the first quarter of 2026  Ferrari 296 Speciale: the headlining numbers Most powerful rear-wheel-drive Ferrari road car ever  Total power has increased to 880hp, a 50hp gain over the GTB, making it the most powerful rear-wheel-drive Ferrari road car to date. Aerodynamic changes are equally significant. Downforce is up 20 percent compared to the GTB, with 435kg generated at 250kph. Weight reduction has been another major focus. At 60kg lighter than the GTB, the 296 Speciale features carbon-fibre bodywork, titanium engine parts and a pared-down interior. The result is a weight of just 1,410kg (coupe), which translates to a class-leading power-to-weight ratio of 1.6kg per horsepower – again, a record for a rear-drive Ferrari. The Speciale produces 20 percent more downforce than the regular 296 GTB.  More importantly, the company says this is their best expression of ‘driving fun’, having pushed the limits with five key aspects of the car – lateral grip, acceleration, gear shifts, braking and, crucially, the sound. Arriving four years after the regular 296, the latest Ferrari special edition is also called the ‘Speciale’, just like the 458 from two generations ago. Ferrari says that’s what its fans called this model when it was under development, and so the brand chose to stick to it and make the ‘Speciale’ moniker official.   Ferrari 296 Speciale engine and specs V6 plug-in hybrid is 9kg lighter, gets extra boost in ‘Qualify’ mode  Ferrari 296 Speciale specsEngine 3.0-litre, twin-turbocharged V6Electric motor Dual-rotor, central-stator axial flux motorEngine power output 700hp Electric motor output Up to 180hp Combined power output Up to 880hp Gearbox 8-speed dual-clutch Drive configuration Rear-wheel drive Weight 1410kg (Coupe)Power to weight ratio 1.60kg/hp Battery 7.45kWhElectric-only range 25km0-100kph (claimed)2.8 seconds 0-200kph (claimed) 7 seconds The hybrid powertrain continues to pair a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 with an electric motor, but both components have been significantly uprated. The electric motor now develops 315Nm and up to 180hp when the eManettino switch on the steering wheel is set to ‘Qualify’. This “Extra Boost” function delivers a surge of torque between gear shifts, which, in turn, has allowed Ferrari to retune the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox for faster, harder shifts that hit with even greater immediacy.   The engine cover gets a new darkened finish. The V6 engine retains its distinctive 120-degree architecture and hot-vee configuration, with the turbos tucked within the cylinder banks for a more compact and responsive setup. The combustion engine alone now produces 700hp – a 37hp increase over the regular 296 GTB – courtesy of race-bred upgrades from the one-make 296 Challenge series. These include titanium con-rods, a lighter crankshaft and stronger pistons, while a Formula 1-derived knock-control system lets the engine run closer to its limits safely. Ferrari claims the 296 GTB can sprint from 0 to 100kph in 2.8 seconds (0.1 seconds faster than the regular 296), and 0 to 200kph comes up in an astonishing 7 seconds. The electric motor, mounted between the engine and the gearbox, also recharges the 7.45kWh high-voltage battery, starts the internal combustion engine and enables an electric-only range of up to 25km. A dedicated clutch decouples the motor from the engine to seamlessly switch between four drive modes: eDrive, Hybrid, Performance and Qualify. Carbon-fibre centre console gets the iconic ‘shift gate’ element for the 8-speed DCT. Weight-saving measures extend to the powertrain, which is around 9kg lighter than in the standard 296 GTB. Much of this comes from the adoption of titanium connecting rods (shared with the LaFerrari), a lighter crankshaft, redesigned turbochargers, and stronger, lighter pistons. Ferrari has also increased the compression ratio by 7 percent and further optimised cooling, drawing heavily from lessons learned in the 296 Challenge and 499P race programmes. Finally, the exhaust retains the equal-length headers and single tailpipe layout of the regular 296, but it now benefits from new acoustic ducts that amplify higher frequencies, giving the Speciale an even more thrilling soundtrack at high revs. Ferrari 296 Speciale aerodynamics and cooling Aerodynamics derived from 296 Challenge and FXX K race cars  The bodywork and aero changes are most apparent at the rear, where the 296 Speciale has a completely new aerodynamic profile. New vertical fins at the bumper’s edges optimise wake management and reduce drag; it also curves upwards, with the profile of the horizontal surface generating additional downforce. These aerodynamic elements have been derived from the 296 Challenge and the FXX K, respectively, and incorporated into a single unit here. The rear vertical fins are the most distinctive aerodynamic element on the 296 Speciale. These new side winglets work in conjunction with the active central spoiler that now gets a much faster actuator to transition between the high and low downforce configurations. There’s also a new “medium downforce” setting to bridge the gap between drag reduction and full downforce. The rear diffuser and underbody venturi tunnels have also been enhanced for improved downforce. At the front, the bonnet has a new duct that helps channel air from under the body to over the body – again, a feature derived from the 296 Challenge. Also, there are additional louvres on the sides, aero fins on the bumper’s edges and a much more prominent splitter to optimise airflow around and under the car. Air intakes on the front bumper have been enlarged by 12 percent for improved cooling. For the additional power, the 296 Speciale also needed additional cooling. Ferrari has put in a lot of work to take the heat out without increasing the size of the radiators. For this, it enlarged the air intakes on the new front bumper by 12 percent, eliminated the central aperture in the front undertray and relocated the lateral louvres further to the sides. Ferrari has also increased the size of the air ducts that are incorporated in the headlamps and channel air to the brakes, thereby improving its cooling performance as well. Ferrari 296 Speciale suspension and braking Stiffer suspension setup, 5mm lower ride height  The 296 Speciale uses new shock absorbers derived from the 296 GT3 and titanium springs to minimise overall weight. The spring and damper settings have been revised, so the car rides 5mm lower than the regular 296 GTB. However, this has helped reduce the maximum roll angle when cornering by 13 percent, thereby improving the car’s handling at the limit. One can opt for a suspension-lift system for use on poor roads. As for braking, the Speciale uses what Ferrari calls the ABS Evo controller system. The system essentially uses various sensors to ascertain the car’s effective speed with great precision, which is then used to determine a target slippage value for each wheel and optimise brake force distribution more effectively. Ferrari 296 Speciale: exterior and interior Design is guided by aerodynamic and weight-saving needs  As detailed above, the styling of the 296 Speciale is largely guided by its aerodynamic and performance needs. The front bonnet is more sculpted, the bumper has a long, suspended splitter, and there are additional wing elements at the bumper’s edges. Then, there are the louvres on sides of the bonnet – these have become a signature of the Ferrari special edition models. At the rear, the new side winglets aside, the 296 Speciale also gets a broad, black carbon-fibre strip incorporating the tail-lights. The engine cover at the rear gets a darkened finish and is concealed by a metal mesh. There’s a new five-spoke dual-tone design for the alloy wheels. The bonnet duct helps channel air from under the car to over the body. Additionally, to save some more weight, customers can opt for the front and rear bumpers, the engine compartment and the alloy wheels to be finished in carbon fibre. Ferrari is also offering a bespoke new Verde Nürburgring exterior paint shade, which can be had with one or two racing stripes extending the car’s length, along with a racing number of choice from 00 to 99. The interior of the 296 Speciale will be familiar from any modern Ferrari, except that it is extensively trimmed in carbon fibre and Alcantara. Ferrari has revised the door trim, which is now made from a single block of carbon-fibre and has a more minimalistic design. The centre console, too, is completely made of carbon fibre and has a raised surface for the controls. It also gets racing bucket seats with a four-point harness (the Aperta gets a three-point harness). Interior gets new racing bucket seats with four-point harness.   Ferrari 296 Speciale launch details Launches in Q1 of 2026 The Ferrari 296 Speciale Coupe and Aperta will be limited – not to the number of units manufactured but the duration for which they are produced. Ferrari will officially launch the 296 Speciale Coupe globally in the first quarter of 2026, followed by the Aperta about three months later in the second quarter. It is not clear when the 296 Speciale versions will come to India, but that’s likely to be towards the end of 2026. While Ferrari’s regular road cars have become increasingly powerful and complex, its track-focused specials have always been the ones to deliver the purest thrills. From the 360 Challenge Stradale to the 488 Pista, these models have consistently raised the bar for engagement and agility. On paper, the 296 Speciale looks set to do the same – with the added challenge of doing so in a new hybrid era.

    "description": "The Nissan X-Trail hasn’t exactly set the sales charts on fire. Launched in August 2024 at Rs 49.92 lakh, the X-Trail was brought in as a CBU, contributing to the high asking price for this 7-seat SUV. We can now confirm that zero-mileage Nissan X-Trail units are available at premium used car dealer Big Boy Toyz (BBT) for a whopping Rs 20.42 lakh less (about 40 percent) – at Rs 29.50 lakh. Nissan despatched 37 X-Trails to its dealers in 8 months   Price tag and features list among the reasons for slow sales BBT has an X-Trail on sale with more equipment Why does the new Nissan X-Trail get a 40 percent discount 80 X-Trails acquired by Big Boy Toyz Based on SIAM data, Nissan despatched 37 units of the X-Trail to its dealerships across the country between August 2024 and March 2025; that’s just 37 of the 150 units originally imported into India in the span of 8 months. Sources tell us that BBT has acquired around 80 MY2024 units through a third-party wholesaler, though a few units of the X-Trail are also available at Nissan’s own dealerships. When we reached out to Nissan India for a comment, a spokesperson said, “Bulk queries and corporate deals for products are a normal industry practice through authorised dealer partners, and the details of the same remain confidential.” High price, lack of features and seemingly low output figures contribute to the X-Trail’s dismal sales Among the reasons for the slow sales of the Nissan X-Trail are its price tag and the relative lack of features for something this pricey – the international-spec model gets leather upholstery, a larger touchscreen, power-adjustable front seats, ventilated seats, a powered tailgate and an ADAS suite. Most of these features are also seen on 7-seat SUV rivals like the Skoda Kodiaq (Rs 46.89 lakh-48.69 lakh) and Jeep Meridian (Rs 27.80 lakh-38.79 lakh*), both of which are priced lower. Considering the imported X-Trail was not meant to be a volume seller, a better-specced version for our market would have helped the SUV's image and, perhaps, its sales.  Another reason for the dismal sales figures is the image of the 1.5-litre three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine – its 163hp and 300Nm output figures sound disappointing on paper. However, our X-Trail review found that it’s smooth and refined. In addition, the high-tech powertrain features a variable compression ratio, which never leaves us wanting power while still delivering an appreciable fuel economy. Nissan X-Trail on sale at Big Boy Toyz X-Trail inventory at Gurugram office, though deliveries are pan-India One model available with BBT gets a larger touchscreen and premium upholstery. Speaking of the lack of features, one of the X-Trail units displayed on BBT’s site has been upgraded with a larger 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen (the standard models get an 8-inch unit) and beige leather upholstery. Interestingly, it is priced at the same Rs 29.50 lakh as the model without the additional features. A BBT sales representative also confirmed that while the X-Trail units acquired have been stocked at the company’s Gurugram office, deliveries are available pan-India. *7-seat variants only; 5-seat Meridian priced at Rs 24.99 lakh-28.79 lakh. All prices, ex-showroom, India.
