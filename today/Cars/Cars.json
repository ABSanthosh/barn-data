    "description": "This 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL is one of 1,400 Gullwing coupes built during a three-year production run and was completed on June 30, 1955, with options including Rudge knock-off wheels before being delivered new in the US via New York. Chassis 5500428 soon made its way to the West Coast, where it was purchased in 1966 by a Gull Wing Group member who retained it for 44 years while participating in numerous annual group conventions with the car. After being sold to an East Coast owner in 2010, the car underwent a cosmetic refurbishment at the hands of Paul Russell \u0026 Company in Essex, Massachusetts, between 2011 and 2012 that included a repaint in the factory shade of Graphite Gray and an interior re-trim in factory-specified red leather. It then spent nine years with a Texas collector before being sold in 2023 to a New York collector who commissioned a mechanical refresh that included an overhaul of the 3.0-liter M198 inline-six before the car was purchased by the selling dealer in late 2024. Additional features include Bosch direct fuel injection, dry-sump lubrication, a four-speed manual transmission, servo-assisted hydraulic drum brakes, four-wheel independent suspension with a rear swing axle, interchangeable sets of red leather and plaid cloth seat cushions, and a Nardi wood-rimmed steering wheel. This W198 is now offered in Newport Beach, California, with a set of reproduction matching luggage, a tool kit, a wheel balancing kit, owner’s manuals, copy of its factory build sheet, invoices from the last three years, and an Arizona title.",

    "description": "Lighter, faster, and meaner – the Maserati GT2 Stradale is the MC20 at its most unhinged. This isn’t just a track-focused special; it’s a full-throttle, no-compromise statement from Maserati. Developed from the GT2 race car but adapted for road use, the Stradale is sharper, more powerful and even more thrilling to drive. The pit lane at Yas Marina hums with quiet anticipation. Parked in front of me, the Maserati GT2 Stradale squats low and wide, every bit the hardcore track weapon it promises to be. Stripped of excess weight and dialled up on downforce with underbody diffusers and a massive rear wing, the GT2 Stradale is primed for battle. So am I. Maserati GT2 Stradale exterior design Optimised for weight saving and downforce One look at the GT2 Stradale, and its intentions are clear. The towering adjustable rear wing alone generates up to 500kg of downforce at speed, keeping the car pinned to the tarmac. Up front, larger air intakes and a reworked splitter ensure maximum cooling and stability. Carbon fibre isn’t just for show – it’s used extensively for weight savings and structural rigidity. Rear wing produces 500kg of downforce.   Maserati GT2 Stradale performance and handling Drop into the tight bucket seat, strap yourself in, and hit the starter button. The Nettuno V6 ignites with a bark – raw, visceral and unfiltered, in a way the standard MC20 never quite was. This is the GT2 Stradale’s truest form, road-legal in the most technical sense but spiritually bound to the circuit. Powered by 640hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 engine At its core sits Maserati’s spectacular 3.0-litre twin-turbo Nettuno V6, now massaged to 640hp – up from the MC20’s 621hp. And it’s lighter, too. The GT2 Stradale was put on a diet, shedding 59kg to tip the scales at just 1,365kg. The result? A blistering 0-100kph time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of 324kph. Neatly styled air intakes to cool the Nettuno V6 engine.   Razor-sharp responses and gear shifts Out of the pit lane, I squeeze the throttle, and it’s immediately obvious how hyper-reactive this track-focused Maserati is. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response, and the 8-speed dual-clutch gearbox rifles through ratios with millisecond precision. Every shift feels instantaneous, and every prod of the throttle pedal is met with a precisely metered surge of power. Braking into Turn 5, the carbon ceramics clamp down with brutal efficiency, hauling the car down from triple-digit speeds in an instant. The front end has the sharp bite of a Rottweiler clinging to the tarmac, beautifully complemented by steering that’s loaded with feedback. Maserati’s engineers have widened the track, stiffened the suspension and fine-tuned the aerodynamics for maximum downforce. The result? A car that feels surgically precise yet alive with every twitch of the wheel. Tight and snug bucket seats are essential for coping with high g-forces. On slower corners, you can provoke the rear into a controlled slide, but it never feels nervous. It’s playful yet poised, letting you dance at the limit without ever making you feel like you’re about to overstep. Nettuno V6 has a raw, mechanical sound Maserati has always been about the soundtrack, and while the GT2 Stradale’s V6 lacks the operatic wail of a naturally aspirated V8, it has a raw, mechanical ferocity that suits its persona. Opt for the titanium exhaust (track use only), and it snarls like a proper race car, spitting and crackling on downshifts. Throttle sensitivity is razor-sharp; though, below 3,000rpm, there’s a hint of turbo lag. But once the boost comes in, acceleration is relentless. It’s not the outright fastest in its class – the Ferrari 296 is quicker – but the GT2 Stradale delivers a deeply immersive experience. Every input is met with an immediate and razor-sharp response. Within a lap, I’m comfortable with this car, which eggs you on to push harder and harder. By the time I roll back into the pits, my pulse is racing, my hands tingling. This isn’t just another track-focused supercar. This is Maserati rediscovering its soul. Some bits of practicality Despite its hardcore underpinnings, the GT2 Stradale hasn’t completely abandoned road manners. A nose-lift system raises the front by 1.4 inches – critical for avoiding the heartbreak of scraping that carbon splitter. There’s even a 100-litre boot, but let’s be honest, practicality isn’t why you buy this car. Maserati GT2 Stradale interior Every detail focused for driving Inside, it’s all business. Alcantara dominates the dashboard to minimise glare, while the carbon-fibre bucket seats are available in two sizes. They grip you tight – brilliant for the track but a reminder that this isn’t a car for long-haul comfort. Shift lights on the steering wheel, a relocated drive-mode selector – every detail is designed for pure driving focus. No skimping in the cockpit, which is covered in Alcantara. Where the GT2 Stradale stands apart is in the design. Maserati has always had a way of making even its most extreme cars look effortlessly elegant. Unlike Ferrari’s aggressive, function-first approach to aero, the Stradale retains a sense of Italian artistry. Maserati GT2 Stradale verdict Not an everyday supercar Scissor doors are an integral part of the GT2 Stradale’s visual drama. The GT2 Stradale is an exquisite blend of race-car aggression and road-going grace. It’s not an everyday supercar – far from it – but for those lucky enough to get behind the wheel, it delivers a raw, unfiltered driving experience few cars can match. Production is limited to 914 units, a nod to Maserati’s founding year, 1914. Pricing remains under wraps, but with this level of exclusivity and performance, expect it to command a hefty premium over the MC20. For the driving purist, this is as close to a road-legal race car as Maserati has ever built. And it’s utterly magnificent.   Also See: Aston Martin Vantage India review: split personality New BMW M5 track drive: Heavyweight champ",

    "description": "Bentley Motors has introduced a second plug-in hybrid V8 option for its Flying Spur, Continental GT and GTC (convertible) models. Dubbed the High Performance Hybrid, the powertrain is a slightly lower-powered alternative to the existing 782hp,1,000Nm Ultra Performance setup.  New hybrid setup outperforms previous-gen W12 Speed powertrain Bentley India website features the cars with the new powertrain Bentley Continental GT, Flying Spur new hybrid powertrain specs 680hp, 930Nm 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 The new PHEVs are run by the familiar 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 and a gearbox-mounted electric motor pair like the Ultra Performance version, though the combined output is less at 680hp and 930Nm. The Continental GT and GTC accelerate from 0-100kph in 3.7 seconds and 3.9 seconds, respectively (the latter time also applies to the Bentley Flying Spur). Both GT models share a 25.9kWh battery, delivering an electric-only range of 85km in the GT and 82km in the GTC. Variant-wise hybrid system on offer  “Though the Ultra Performance Hybrid of the Speed remains the most extreme powertrain in Bentley’s range, it’s significant that the new hybrid outperforms the previous generation’s W12 Speed powertrain on all power, torque and performance parameters,” stated the Crewe-based automaker. Out of the Flying Spur and Continental GT’s four variants, only the base-spec core and Azure get this new setup, while the more powerful hybrid system is exclusive to top-spec Mulliner and Speed. Bentley India's website lists the Flying Spur, Continental GT and GTC luxury cars with both Ultra Performance and High Performance hybrid powertrains. The Bentayga, along with its EWB version, is also listed. Also, see: New Flying Spur is the most powerful Bentley four-door ever Bentley to replace W12 engine with 750hp hybrid V8",

    "description": "Citroen Basalt, Aircross and C3 Dark Edition prices will be announced on April 10. In the lead-up to the launch, Citroen has released yet another teaser, giving us a glimpse at the Dark Edition models’ interiors this time. Citroen Dark Edition models to get new black exterior colour Interior gets new black leatherette upholstery with contrast red stitching All Dark Edition models will likely be mechanically unchanged Citroen Basalt, Aircross, C3 Dark Edition: what to expect? All black exterior and interior aesthetics New leatherette finish for the Aircross and Basalt’s dashboard. The latest teaser reveals that all the Dark Edition models will get new black upholstery with contrast red stitching and grey inserts on the seats. Moreover, the Aircross and Basalt’s dashboard will get a new leatherette finish with contrast red stitching. All Citroen models in India currently have a plastic dashboard, so this will be a notable upgrade. All cars are also expected to get new illuminated sill plates and ambient footwell lighting. On the outside, the Citroen Dark Edition models will don a stealthy black paint shade, along with dark chrome accents for the grille inserts and badges. However, the dual-tone wheels on all three cars will likely stay unchanged, as would the contrasting silver trims on their bumpers to break the black monotony. The dual-tone wheels on all three cars will be carried over unchanged.   Citroen Basalt, Aircross, C3 Dark Edition powertrain options Expected to offered in turbo guise The Dark Edition variants of the Aircross, Basalt and C3 will likely be mechanically unchanged. All three cars get an 82hp, 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol or a 110hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine; only the latter comes with an automatic gearbox option. The Dark Edition variants will likely be offered in top Turbo guise only and priced Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000 higher than the trim they will be based on. Growing popularity of dark edition models The list of dark edition SUVs seems to be growing constantly. Models like the Hyundai Creta, MG Astor, Honda Elevate, Tata Harrier and Safari, Jeep Compass and Mahindra Scorpio N all have Dark Edition variants, with the Mahindra XUV700 Ebony Edition being the most recent addition. And it’s not just limited to SUVs, as the Toyota Hilux and MG Comet also received dark edition variants recently.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/byds-denza-brand-targets-porsche-952bhp-gt-flagship",
    "description": "Denza was launched in China in 2010 as a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz's parent firm Taycan-challenging Z9 GT to offer EV and PHEV powertrains; will be followed by premium MPV Chinese electric car giant BYD will bring its Denza premium brand to Europe this year, with a line-up headed by the bold, electric and PHEV-powered Z9 GT. The launch is the latest move by BYD to ramp up its European market assault – and its most ambitious, with executive vice-president Stella Li previously telling Autocar it was targeting Porsche and other European upmarket performance brands. Denza will initially sell its flagship grand tourer, which offers 952bhp in EV form, and will be followed by a seven-seat MPV called the D9. Launched in Europe during Milan Design Week, Denza uses the marketing line ‘Technology drives elegance’, with BYD chiefs promising a line-up that feature “elegant European design influences” and cutting-edge technology. Li said the brand would offer “for the first time in this segment, a true focus on efficient, sustainable new-energy powertrains”. While an exact timeline hasn't been set, Denza will come to the UK either late this year or in early 2026, building up a separate dealer network and marketing operation from BYD.  Li said Denza would eventually offer a line-up of four to six models in Europe, also including SUVs and off-roaders. As well as the Z9 and D9, Denza currently offers the N7 and N9 SUVs in China.  While premium brand customers in Europe are regarded as being brand-focused, Li said she thought entering the market would be “not too much of a challenge.” She added: “Selling BYD cars is simple: just bring all the competing cars to a test track and let customers choose for themselves. “The Denza product is ten times better than the competition. We have lots of unique features that legacy brands do not have.”  Li added that “BYD has technology plus design”, claiming that Danza’s styling – led by former Audi designer Wolfgang Egger – would be another key selling point. Z9 GT to lead European invasion The four-seat Z9 GT is a Porsche Taycan and Porsche Panamera rival that sits on an advanced platform called e3 that has been developed specifically for Denza.  It features an 800V electrical architecture that allows of ultra-fast charging, cell-to-body battery integration to increase rigidity and the ability for a drivetrain featuring three electric motors.  Styled by Egger, the shooting brake is 5180mm long and 1990mm wide but sits just 1500mm high. Air suspension is standard, with a double-wishbone set-up at the front and a multi-link arrangement at the rear.  While Denza has yet to confirm European specifications, the Chinese-market electric version features a 308bhp motor on the front axle and a pair of 322bhp motors that can run at up to 21,000rpm at the rear. That gives a combined system output of 952bhp and allows for a 0-62mph time of 3.4sec and, with a 100kWh BYD Blade battery, a range of 391 miles on the Chinese test cycle. The PHEV version, badged Super DM, combines a bespoke 268bhp 2.0-litre turbo petrol engine at the front with a pair of 295bhp electric motors mounted on the rear axle. That gives it a system output of 858bhp, allowing for a 0-62mph time of 3.6sec.  Power for the Super DM’s motors comes from a 38.5kWh battery, which as in the EV uses cell-to-body technology. The PHEV has an official electric-only range of 125 miles and a total range of 684 miles. With the battery depleted, Denza claims the engine can achieve 42mpg. Denza is currently working on a number of upgrades for the Z9 GT before it reached Europe this autumn, promising improvements to the powertrain, performance, range, tyre sizes and storage capacity. Denza claims the Z9 GT’s platform allows for a much greater level of systems integration than traditional cars, giving it enhanced vehicle stability and the ability to safely cope with a tyre blowout at speeds of up to 112mph. The two rear motors on both the EV and PHEV versions can be controlled independently of the front axle and of each other, allowing for the use of a rear-wheel steering system. The wheels can turn in the same direction as each other, in ‘toe-in’ form, where the both rotate to the centre of the vehicle, or ‘toe-out’, rotating away from the centre of the vehicle. The latter allows the car to pivot around its front axle, allowing for a turning circle of a city car-rivalling 4.62m. The Z9 GT can also ‘crab walk’, effectively allowing it to slide sideways into tight parking spaces. Denza claims the cell-to-body design of the platform allows the Z9 GT to offer an extra 15mm of interior space compared with a more traditional EV design. The cabin features a heavy focus on premium materials and technology, including a large 17.3in infotainment screen and a dedicated 13.2in display for the front passenger.  The Z9 GT will be quickly followed to the European market by the seven-seat D9, which Denza claims will “redefine the premium-class MPV market”. Denza’s history and growth Denza was founded in China in 2010 and a joint venture between BYD and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler and launched its first vehicle in 2014. In 2021, Mercedes reduced its shareholding to 10%, with reports suggesting it was unhappy with Denza’s sales. In September last year, BYD bought out that shareholding to take full control of the brand. It has since revamped its line-up and currently offers four models that all sit on BYD's advanced e3 platform.  The Denza name was originally said to translate to \"rising power and momentum\", but the firm now says the name is an acronym that reflects its values: Diverse, Elegance, Novel, Zenith and Aspirational. The model naming strategy also reflects the name, with product lines for each type of vehicle taking one of the letters from the title (D for MPVs, N for SUVs and Z for saloons).",

    "description": "Hybrids combine the convenience of fossil fuel with the appeal of zero-emissions running. Which do we recommend? Recent world events have resulted in some good news for the buying public: new hybrid cars can now be sold in the UK until 2035. At one point it looked like the powers that be would turn off the new hybrid supply in 2030. But why should you care?  Well, dear reader, hybrids deftly combine green emission ratings with low running costs and the ability to fill up in mere moments from a pump. Appealing to private buyers and company car owners alike, the commercial success of hybrids has been quite a thing to witness over the past couple of decades. Hybrids are popular for several reasons. They can save you money at the petrol pump and even significantly drive down how much benefit-in-kind (BIK) company car tax you pay. That's because hybrids boast lower emissions ratings, while others provide a useful electric-only range that helps make most of your daily motoring emissions-free. We rate the Toyota Corolla as the best hybrid money can buy. It’s a car with a truly commendable reputation for reliability, and it offers huge MPG figures without the need to plug in.",

Classics like the Le Mans, V7 Sport, and 850 T3 California are iconic. The 1985 Moto Guzzi SP3 1000? Not quite. Although the SP3 ticks all the right boxes for a classic Moto Guzzi tourer, it misses the mark, visually.

    "description": "The Taiwanese custom scene impresses yet again, with a handsome Hartford VR150 flat tracker from one of the workshops that wowed at the country’s Speed and Crafts show. We also have a rare Honda EZ-Snow snowmobile, a Jawa 350 scrambler, and a vintage Indian Sport Scout flat tracker that’s being auctioned off at Mecum. Hartford VR150 by SMF Custom With a fifth-place finish in the Freestyle class and first in the Modified Harley class, SMF Custom made quite an impression at Taiwan’s Speed and Crafts event. But as it turns out, they brought more than just their award-winning bikes to the show. This Hartford VR150 was on display too, and it’s a real cutie.
