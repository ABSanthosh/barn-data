    "description": "China’s CFMoto has many new bikes that are catching attention worldwide, but none of them have made as big a splash as the 450MT. This is the motorcycle that the company plans to re-enter India with in mid-2025, and we had a chance to get acquainted with it on a ride around the Outer Ring Road in Hyderabad. One of the many things the 450MT has going right is the way it looks. It has a handsome, large and proportionate design that doesn’t look or feel budget in any way. When it comes to looking like a scaled-down big ADV, the 450MT achieves this better than any of its current rivals. The overall fit, finish and quality of materials feel like they’re from a segment above, and you could remove the badges and easily believe that this was a bike from any top manufacturer. Weighing 195kg fully fuelled, it is 13 kilos heavier than the new 390 Adventure but a kilo lighter than the Himalayan 450. Lifting it off the stand echoes the weight figure on paper – definitely not as light-feeling as the KTM but also not as top-heavy as the Himalayan, which is interesting because this has a similarly sized 17.5-litre fuel tank. Seat height is the lowest in the class at 820mm, and it can be further lowered to 800mm by using a different mounting point on the rear shock linkage. Tall riders will probably want to go for the accessory seat, which raises the seating position by 50mm. There are only two bikes in the country at the moment, and they’re being used for validation purposes by CFMoto’s local partner (who has asked not to be named yet), so we didn’t take the risk of riding the 450 off-road. On-road manners were good, with the bike having a light steering feel and being easy to manage at low speeds. This easy nature translates to the handling as well – it’s quite good, although it very much feels like a tall ADV with a large front wheel. The bike displays a tendency to lean over a little abruptly, but I chalk that down to the CST tyres, which work decently well, but you could improve the bike with better tyres. I’d also like more bite from the brakes, which, like the tyres, are more than adequate but not great. The suspension feels set a little on the firm side, but it is fully adjustable at the front and rebound/preload adjustable at the rear. Attacking a set of tall rumble strip speed breakers suggested that this suspension doesn’t feel quite as plush as the Himalayan, but it is better at taking big hits than the KTM 390 Adventure. The engine is one of the highlights. It’s smooth in a way no single can match, and it makes a deep and involving sound that’s similar to the Aprilia RS 457 but also a little different. CFMoto has gone for very short gearing, so the bike feels remarkably tractable at low speeds but a little high-revving above 120kph. A super-light clutch also aids rideability in the city, although those interested in a lot of high-speed touring may want to make some changes to the final drive sprockets. The 6-speed gearbox is smooth, and an upshift-only quickshifter will be sold as an accessory.   Our test bike had quite poor fuelling, but we were warned that this would be the case as the company was working on engine calibration for our local fuel. The second bike behaved far better, and the company assures us that the fuelling will be fully sorted by the time it launches the 450MT. On that topic, the recommended fuel is 95 octane. In typical CFMoto fashion, the 450MT is loaded with features, including a very nice TFT display, a height-adjustable windscreen, cross-spoked rims that support tubeless tyres, and adjustable suspension. From a touring standpoint, the only thing some people may miss is cruise control. A limited opportunity to shoot photographs means that this will be a quick review, but you can check out our video review for more details. Ultimately, the 450MT looks good, is enjoyable to ride and has built a good reputation overseas for quality and reliability. It will come into India as a CKD, and we’re told a sub-Rs 4 lakh price is the target, which we hope the company can achieve because anything more will be a bit of a challenge. Moreover, CFMoto and its local distributor have a big task on their hands when it comes to providing high-quality sales and after-sales experience. Hopefully, that will be achieved. Because this bike really has a lot going for it. Also see: CFMoto 450MT video review",

And yet it doesn’t do so conventionally, which may be why the Honda badge on its nose seems like such a good fit.The car presents a slightly lower-slung, ‘all-road estate’ type of alternative to the likes of the Hyundai Tucson, Volkswagen Tiguan and Peugeot 3008, then. It’s a little less boxy-looking, for those who remain on the fence about SUV aesthetics but like their convenience and practicality, and its dynamic priorities are all about comfort, efficiency and ease of use.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/from-the-archive/remembering-mad-local-car-firms-geneva-motor-show",
    "description": "Long-running motor show played host to a number of wild concepts like these example from Rinspeed Traditionally at this time of year, the automotive industry congregates in Geneva for the world’s most important motor show – but to our great sadness, last year’s event was the last there will ever be. A sad corollary of this is that we won’t get to enjoy our semi-regular laughs at concepts unveiled by Swiss design houses – or should we say mad houses? – Sbarro and Rinspeed. Italian-born Franco Sbarro began his career as a mechanic, then set up his eponymous firm in 1968 – with zero interest in conventionality. Sbarro first caught our attention at Geneva in 1973 with the SV1, an attractive sports coupé composed of NSU, Porsche and Volkswagen components – most prominently, two Ro80 rotary engines mounted side by side behind the rear seats! In 1978, it combined a Fiat four-wheel drive system with a BMW engine in the shell of an “avant-garde cross-country vehicle” – then two years later took this format to a wild extreme, matching a G-Wagen chassis with the 450SE’s V8 engine and adding a third axle. The Wind Hawk was, unsurprisingly, destined for the Middle East – just like the AMG G63 6x6 that Mercedes itself would produce 35 years later. That 1980 show also introduced Autocar to Frank Rinderknecht’s Rinspeed, starting fairly sensibly with a small car for disabled drivers featuring a mechanism that hoisted one’s wheelchair out, up and into a roof-mounted box. Perhaps the coolest thing at the 1982 show was Sbarro’s Super Twelve, a straight-12 hot hatch. Yes, really: the engine was two Kawasaki motorcycle sixes conjoined, making 240bhp. With a tubular chassis and a fibreglass body, it weighed 800kg – resulting in a better power-to-weight ratio than Lamborghini’s Countach. Two years later, it produced an evolution, the Super Eight, with a Ferrari 308 GTB chassis and V8. This one-off came up for auction in 2024 but fell short of its reserve at $160k. Enjoy full access to the complete Autocar archive at the magazineshop.com Sbarro’s next show-stealer was the 1985 Challenge, a supercar of truly bizarre proportions with four-wheel drive, a centrally mounted 5.0-litre Mercedes V8, a retractable windscreen and… inflatable seats. We actually sampled one of six road-registered examples a decade later. It had lost a pair of cylinders but none of the visual impact, and naturally it was “a disappointment to drive, failing to meet your expectations even in a straight line”. The 1987 Monster 4x4 was in a similar vein but had an even bigger Mercedes V8 – 6.9 litres – rotating the enormous wheels of a Boeing 747. Rolling resistance be damned. Rinspeed spent the 1980s mostly creating sensible (well, relatively, that is) tuned versions of Porsches and whatnot, but in 1997 it decided to join in Sbarro’s game, giving us something that “looked like a 1960s front-engined Indycar on acid”. That engine was a V8 from, er, Hyundai, a supercharger taking its output to a hefty 410bhp, and all while the Mono Ego weighed no more than a tonne. It produced something similar for the 1998 show, called the Rocket, again using that Korean V8 but with styling more akin to a pre-war Auto Union grand prix racer – although “we won’t go too near the stand, because these cars often disappoint when you get close”. If they had been unconventional in the 1990s, Sbarro and Rinspeed both really let loose in the 2000s, as exemplified by the latter firm’s millennium duo: a retro hot-rod pick-up truck with an integrated crane, called the Tatooo.com (huh?), and “an odd underwater scooter that looks like it’s from a B-grade Hollywood sci-fi movie”, called the Breathing Observation Bubble. Aquatic machinery became a bit of a theme for Rinspeed, as shown by 2004’s Splash. Creating “a tidal wave of interest” (ahem), this was a chunky roadster that could hydraulically transform into not merely a boat but a hydrofoil, elevating it 60cm above the water. And fuelled by compressed natural gas for good measure. Having made “Dick Dastardly’s next car” in 2003 (“good old Franco is still taking the drugs, it seems”, we joked), Sbarro in 2007 created a six-wheeled pick-up truck by adding an electrically driven third axle to the… Citroën C-Crosser. Obviously. In 2009, Rinspeed presented the iChange (everything new had to be ‘i’ back then, didn’t it?), which could alter its shape depending on how many people were inside – although funnily enough it was “cunningly perched on an elevated stand to keep its shape-shifting qualities hidden from the general public”. We gave up reporting on this dynamic duo after that, so irrelevant were their creations to the road, but their presence still always raised a smile. Ssangyong designer Ken Greenley perhaps put it best when he told us in 1999: “I don’t like any of the cars here, but Geneva wouldn’t be Geneva without Sbarro. I’ll give its stand a four out of 10 for being interesting and thought-provoking.”",

    "description": "Hyundai has teased a one-off race car concept based on the Inster micro-EV. It’s called the Insteroid, and the name summarises the idea behind the concept: Inster on steroids. Hyundai calls it a “playful interpretation” of the Inster and says its design is inspired by video game aesthetics. The car will be fully revealed to the public in early April. The Insteroid is a one-off concept based on the Inster EV micro-EV It gets extensive aerodynamic bodywork and a stripped-down interior Its styling is inspired by video game aesthetics; it’ll be fully revealed in April Hyundai Insteroid exterior and interior design details WRC-spec rear wing, 21-inch aero wheels The most distinguishing feature of the Insteroid visible in the teaser is its massive WRC-style double-decker rear wing. The Insteroid also gets hugely flared front and rear bumpers and fenders with gaping air vents for aerodynamic efficiency. Almost none of the body panels seem to be shared with the regular Inster, and we can also spot a wide-arch body kit that stretches from the front to back. The only things that appear to be common with the Inster EV are the circular LED headlamps and pixel LED tail-lights. The Insteriod rides on 21-inch wheels with aero covers that have three holes in the centre. It also gets a roof scoop and a prominent rear diffuser. Meanwhile, the interior seems completely stripped out and comes fitted with a roll cage. Hyundai says there are ‘fun details’, with plenty to discover in every element, including the control buttons and instrument cluster. The company hasn’t revealed any technical specifications as yet, but we’ll have more details and a complete look at the car’s exterior and interior when it is officially revealed next month.   Also See: Nissan Micra EV, third-gen Leaf revealed Kia EV6 facelift launched at Rs 65.9 lakh; electric SUV has 663km range",

    "description": "A heavily camouflaged test mule of the updated Suzuki Burgman has been spotted testing for the first time. The Burgman will likely feature a redesign and powertrain upgrade, similar to the new Access. Here’s what we can deduce. Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon Sports a different exhaust, suggesting some engine changes Currently priced between Rs 95,800 and Rs 1.16 lakh Suzuki Burgman to be updated soon; spotted testing The Burgman has largely remained unchanged since its launch in 2018 With this update, it is likely that Burgman’s design will see evolutionary updates, similar to the changes we saw on the 2025 Access compared to the previous model. The brake light on this Burgman test mule appears to be similar to the Avenis, but the spy shots reveal that the display has been carried over from the outgoing model. This update is likely to revise the design of the Burgman with some feature additions, just like Suzuki did with the latest Access.  It is likely that the updated Burgman will feature powertrain and chassis upgrades similar to those of the Access. One clue that the engine will see some revisions is in the different exhaust muffler on the test mule, which is quite similar to the latest Access.  The Suzuki Burgman was launched back in 2018; since then, this maxi-scooter has largely remained unchanged. It recently received an update to comply with the OBD2B norms and a new colour, but its overall design has remained unchanged. It is available in two variants: Street (Rs 95,800) and Street EX (Rs 1.16 lakh), where the latter gets a 12-inch wheel. It’s worth mentioning that before the 2025 Access was launched, spy shots of its test mule had been seen for quite a few months. Since this is the first time a spy shot of the updated Burgman has surfaced, its launch is likely some time away. When this updated Suzuki Burgman does launch, expect a small price bump in price over the current model. All prices ex-showroom, Delhi.

    "description": "The Eldorado’s new looks for 1967 were received very well, and generated immediate sales success for Cadillac’s halo coupe. Eldorado had continually struggled to find anything but a niche customer base since its inception in 1953, but it seemed its time had finally arrived. As discussed in our last entry , both 1967 and 1968 were banner years for the Cadillac brand and Eldorado, and the company broke its overall sales record on both occasions.  In 1968 Cadillac sold 230,003 vehicles, and despite a hefty 11 percent price increase 24,528 of those were Fleetwood Eldorados. 1969 brought new styling across the line, and Eldorado strayed away from its sleek origins. But would customers take notice and shop elsewhere? ( Note: The bearded 18th century man glares angrily at the 1969 Eldorado because it is significantly uglier than the previous year.)",
