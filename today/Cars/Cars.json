    "description": "This 1993 Jaguar XJ220 is the final of three examples prepared to Group N specification for privateer racing team Top Run to contest the Campionato Italiano Supercar GT championship during the 1993 season. While two of the cars competed through the season, this car, chassis 003, is said to have remained unraced before being sold in 1994. After the car was featured on BaT in December 2017, its aluminum bodywork was vinyl-wrapped live while on display at the 2024 New York International Auto Show in a white and blue livery inspired by the color scheme worn by the XJ220-N chassis that raced during the 1993 Italian GT season. Wearing silver paint beneath the wrap, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include slotted and ventilated Brembo disc brakes, staggered-dimension BBS wheels, OMP racing seats outfitted with six-point racing harnesses, and an AiM digital dash display. This XJ220-N is now offered on dealer consignment in Newbury Park, California, with a bill of sale.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/dacia-duster-4x4-gain-hybrid-electric-back-axle-2025",
    "description": "Boss says Duster's new hybrid range-topper will be automatic, LPG-compatible and affordable Dacia will introduce an all-wheel-drive version of the Duster with an electrified back axle by the end of this year. Speaking at Dacia's press conference at the 2025 Car of the Year final, where the Duster is shortlisted for the award, company CEO Denis Le Vot confirmed a new technological solution for the firm's all-wheel-drive model. Le Vot said: \"By the end of 2025, we will introduce a new hybrid solution for our 4x4 version. \"We will electrify the rear axle with an e-motor on it. The car will be hybrid and automatic and there will be an LPG version. We will make it available at an affordable price, as is the Dacia way.\" This version of the Duster will top a range that includes, from launch, a 99bhp 1.0-litre bi-fuel three-cylinder engine, a 128bhp 1.2-litre mild hybrid and the top-spec 138bhp 1.6-litre full hybrid from the Jogger. Prices currently top out at just north of £26,000, so the new range-topping 4x4 hybrid is expected to nudge that to nearer £30,000. It is highly likely that the powertrain will make its way into the slightly larger Bigster, which is all but technically identical to the Duster. Other cars that also share the CMF-B platform – including the Dacia Jogger, Nissan Juke, Nissan Qashqai and Renault Captur – could be in line for the same treatment.  Le Vot added that an electric Duster \"would come in time\" but the first electric Dacia will be the Sandero, in 2027. The Duster will have to wait until its next generation to receive an electric powertrain and that is likely to be in 2030/31. Le Vot also confirmed that the new Duster was, at the end of November, the number one SUV for retail sales in Europe across all different-sized SUVs.",

    "description": "New grille matches that on the recently updated Porsche 911 Prototype is spotted testing with new grille and is likely to appear alongside electric model this year Porsche is readying another update for the Cayenne – just one year after it launched the most recent overhaul of its big-selling SUV. The company last year confirmed that the combustion-engined version of the Cayenne will remain on sale alongside the upcoming electric model into the 2030s.  A prototype has now been spotted testing in Germany with a new front grille that resembles the one fitted to the new Porsche 911, as well as prototypes of the electric Cayenne and next-generation Boxster. The test car also sports a set of bulbous foglights, although these are almost certainly not bound for any production car, given they appear to be gaffer-taped onto the vehicle. It’s possible that the prototype previews a minor restyle intended to bring the Cayenne into line with its upcoming stablemates. The prototype may also be testing powertrains revised to meet the Euro 7 emissions regulations that come into force from 1 July this year. When Porsche confirmed the extended lifespan of the ICE Cayenne, it said the model's twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 – used in the S, GT and Turbo E-Hybrid variants – would remain in development “to comply with future legislative requirements”. Porsche chief Oliver Blume said: “The Cayenne has always defined the sports car in its segment. In the middle of the decade, the fourth generation will set standards in the segment as an electric SUV.  “At the same time, into the next decade our customers will still be able to choose from a wide range of powerful and efficient combustion and hybrid models.”",

    "description": "After a string of cheap ’70s bikes, I bought my first decent motorcycle—a nearly-new Honda 250 dual sport. I learned a lot of lessons on that bike, and the toughest one cost me some plastics, a little pride and a fat ding in my pickup truck box. That poor Honda ended up on its side plenty of times, but it’s no fun when the ignition’s off and the incident was 100% preventable. It’s far from the most exciting aspect of owning a bike, but sooner or later you’ll have to transport your motorcycle and there are plenty of ways to get it wrong. Whether by truck, trailer, van or hitch carrier, the basic tenants of safe passage are the same, and the investment in quality gear beats replacing parts.…",

While beauty is decidedly in the eye of the beholder, there’s no debating the Rickman brothers’ performance chops, and not a single item out-of-place on this exceptional 1974 Rickman Kawasaki CR900. In viewing Lot F171 of Mecum’s upcoming Las Vegas 2025 sale, the impact of the retina-searing safety yellow (or green?) paintwork is undeniable. It’s a bold color that feels like it’s just come back into fashion, but it’s correct for the bike and I’ll go out on my first limb of the new year by saying I fucking love it.…",

Such is the story of Axel Budde from Kaffeemaschine Motorcycles. “I started motorcycling on a BMW when I was 18 in 1994. I actually fancied old English motorcycles, but couldn´t afford them,” Axel said. “When I was 20 I was looking for a bigger classic motorcycle, but nothing was really satisfying. The BMW engine just didn´t speak to me, the English bikes were a bit too small, and 4 cylinders did not appeal to me aesthetically.” That’s when a finely aged Italian came into his life, bringing with it the sense of fulfillment he'd been longing for all those years.

    "description": "I’ve been using the ViaTerra Grid 2 for the past two years and rate it as the best full-gauntlet sporty glove from an Indian manufacturer. The new Grid 3 builds on the same formula with a number of small tweaks and revisions. At a glance, it looks very familiar, but study the gloves more closely, and you’ll see that a number of the leather panels and various protectors around the gloves have changed. The finger and knuckle protectors are new, and so is the design of the leather pieces that hold them in place. The company has removed a number of accordion stretch panels from various places at the top of the glove, which has created a sleeker look. The protective scheme is mostly the same, but again, with some small revisions. Like before, the little finger is bridged to the ring finger, but the connection between the two now looks stronger. Now, there’s also a single patch of leather running down the entire outer side of the little finger; the old gloves had two stitched patches. Fewer stitches always mean more material strength. In fact, the fewer the perforations in the leather, the stronger it tends to be, which may explain why ViaTerra has moved to less closely packed ventilation holes in the leather. The weather is far too nice at the moment for me to tell you if this hampers the ventilation in any meaningful way, but so far, so good. What has been reduced slightly in size is the armour around the side of the wrist, though the coverage does not seem to be compromised. There’s a new reflective patch, and old conveniences like touchscreen-sensitive fingertips and a small silicon rain wiper on the left index finger remain. The grippy material on the palm is now larger, and, in general, I find that the fit is slightly more comfortable than the old Grid. ViaTerra claims CE L2-exceeding amounts of knuckle protection Like the Grid 2, these gloves are also quite stiff, particularly around the knuckle area, but they do seem to be an improvement. They certainly aren’t the most comfy gloves out there, but I’ve also spent plenty of full riding days in them without complaint. It’s the small price you have to pay for high levels of protection, something the Grid 3 has in spades. While it is CE Level 1-compliant, the company claims that it exceeds Level 2 requirements in areas like palm abrasion, knuckle-impact protection and wrist-closure strength. At 6,499, these are among the most expensive gloves in India, but they’re also among the best and are deserving of your money.

    "description": "We in the car-reviewing industry are no strangers to a bit of marketing fluff. Our eyes are now desensitised to it, trained to gloss over the flowery writing in every press release, honing in instead on the facts and figures. But there’s something about the way Rolls-Royce does it that’s so enchanting; you want to savour it instead, like letting a sip of wine swirl around your tongue before drinking it. The vocabulary is sophisticated but not overpowering, inviting rather than technical, drawing you discreetly into a life of luxury with every advancing word. I don’t know the exact cubic capacity of the engine, but for a change, I don’t care. Owners are ‘clients’, the best-seller is the ‘most-requested model’, an SUV is a ‘high-sided vehicle’, and acceleration is ‘progress’. Their used-car business is called ‘Provenance’ – it’s just incredible! The reason I bring up Rolls’ bewitching turn of phrase is because it reinforces the fact that it won’t let its standard drop, it won’t make a compromise, and it certainly won’t do entry-level. And as the veil comes off the Series II (Rolls speak for facelift) Ghost, the brand’s ‘more approachable’ saloon, it’s clear they haven’t done any of that. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost design Did you know the core tenet of Rolls-Royce’s design philosophy is to begin with square, upright, straight lines at the front, and finish with smooth curves at the tail? I didn’t, but now I can’t look at any model from the marque’s 120-year history and not see it. In the Ghost, that begins with the unmistakable Pantheon grille up front, the Spirit of Ecstasy tipped forward proudly atop it. Sharp lines frame the rectangular headlamps and a bonnet that is purposefully long, falling vertically down the sides in flanks that enhance its 2.1-metre width and monolithic form. But then, as the window line approaches, the lines soften and dip, flowing into an almost triangular D-pillar and elegant tail. Unlike most facelifts that add styling elements, the Series II Ghost subtracts and simplifies. The front is a lot cleaner now, with slimmer, softer-edged headlamps and a single line of LED light signature. The complex, almost sporty air dam in the front bumper has been supplanted by a slim, single piece low down, though it must be said the Black Badge version you see here does have some passive aggression – beg your pardon, ‘assertion’ – in its air intakes. There are striking new 22-inch wheel designs across the range; a separate selection for the Black Badge that are more ‘open’ to better view the brake calipers. And at the rear, the LED tail-lamps feature the distinctive vertical strakes first introduced in the Spectre EV. Black Badge wheels designed to show off brakes.   2025 Rolls Royce Ghost interior, features The bigger news if you’re an actual Ghost client (See? It’s working) is that the customisation catalogue, called Bespoke, has expanded considerably to include options introduced in the Phantom Series II, Cullinan Series II and Spectre. These range from the subtle to the ostentatious to the downright bizarre. “We don’t like saying no,” explains Phil Fabre de la Grange, head of the Bespoke division, and he’s right. Why shouldn’t a Ghost client have access to the full catalogue? And this only furthers the idea that there’s no such thing as entry-level with Rolls-Royce. Unlike the parent company BMW, Rolls-Royce’s steering rims are as thin as possible. A big new addition is ‘Duality Twill’ – a complex and colourful stitching pattern meant to intertwine the R-R letters with nautical rope knots, which pairs nicely with the new sustainable bamboo-based rayon upholstery. It uses 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to create. There’s a new backlit Spirit of Ecstasy timepiece in the dashboard, and if you look closely at the famous ‘starlight headliner’, a shooting star will streak across at random every now and then. Sunroofs are so gauche. Another detail I love is the move from chrome-ringed fixed digital dials to a modern-looking full-digital instrument screen, which is customisable – once when you order the car. It’s crisp, clean and colour-coded to the interior or exterior of your car, and you can’t change it on the fly. Speaking of the interior, as with every Rolls, it doesn’t shout about its tech in the same way, say, a Maybach does. Buried deep under thick layers of hide, veneer, chrome and shagpile is the best the BMW Group has to offer; in fact, better, as it’s not as complicated as BMW’s i-Drive. Press a chrome button and a wooden table folds out of the front seatbacks, revealing a touchscreen that was until now hidden behind it. Each of the four doors is servo-assisted, and the motors shut softly at the push of a button. Even the beautifully analogue metal organ-stop toggles are connected to a fully digital auto climate control system inside the dash. Even SWB models have huge space and recline more than what’s pictured. No sun blinds, though. I could write a page about the Bespoke audio system alone, with its 18 speakers, 1,400 watts and zero branding. Its clarity and depth coming through those exquisite metal grilles knock the socks off any other high-end car audio you’ve heard, and again, it’s thanks to hidden solutions. It uses cavities in the car’s chassis as resonance chambers, incorporates exciters into the roof liner for greater sound depth, and has microphones that constantly read ambient noise and adjust the amplifier to suit. As for the throne itself, as the coach door swings open to reveal it, it doesn’t look like much at first. It’s fairly upright and doesn’t appear to have the typical luxury-car puffy bolstering or quilting. Slip inside, though – actually not so easy to do thanks to the rear-hinged door – and you’re immediately lulled half to sleep. They’re the type of cushions you just sink into and extend over to the sides, with an added pillow on the headrest. The seatback recline, at first, seems minimal, but that’s until you realise you have to push the seat base forward to unlock the full angle. As you do this, your head descends behind the C pillar, giving you the sort of privacy reserved for royalty. Unbranded ‘bespoke’ audio sounds incredible. Legroom? Even with the standard 3,295mm wheelbase, it’s immense, but there’s also an Extended version with a 3,465mm wheelbase. Seat heating, cooling and massage are options, but interestingly, rear window blinds aren’t. Rolls says most clients are content with tinted rear windows, but of course, these are illegal in India. However, in the spirit of never saying no, they’re working on it. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost performance, engine Alarmingly, to these ears at least, Rolls says that since the Cullinan SUV came along in 2018, the number of chauffeur-driven clients across the model range has dropped from a staggering 70 percent to just 11 percent. Should you, then, as a Ghost owner, want to commandeer your own motorcar, might I recommend the Black Badge, as it introduces a hint of spice to the experience, with no compromise whatsoever to comfort. Power from the six-and-three-quarter-litre twin-turbo V12 gets a bump from 571 to 600hp and torque from 850 to 900Nm, but Rolls is quick to point out that this isn’t some sort of Ghost RS; it’s merely a bit more expressive. This expression is best felt when you press the ‘Low’ button (Sport mode? That’s for plebeians) on the steering-mounted shifter stalk, which tells the 8-speed ZF gearbox to downshift more readily and upshift as late as is fashionable. I can’t, of course, tell you at what RPM any of this happens because there’s no tachometer in a Rolls, just a power reserve meter. Without Low mode, it feels identical to the standard Ghost in every respect. But there is a different kind of pleasure to be found in extending this large V12 (in this large car) as far as it will allow you. It isn’t high-revving, but it doesn’t feel overtly turbocharged either. Power is a swell, like a tidal wave gathering mass and momentum as it makes its way to shore, and I imagine there have been some learnings from the company’s aircraft engines here. At an undisclosed number of revs, it sounds good, too – heavy and mechanical. And interestingly, Rolls says customers want this, especially in the Black Badge. Digital dials customisable. At the time of purchase. Where the previous Ghost was based on the 7 Series, this new one shares no mechanicals with any BMW. It, like every other Rolls, is built on the brand’s aluminium spaceframe Architecture of Luxury, and with that comes clever suspension that has dampers…for its dampers. This, in congruence with self-levelling air springs and a ‘Flagbearer’ system that scans the road and primes the adaptive dampers, has allowed Rolls to fit these 22-inch wheels and sliver-thin tyres with little compromise to ride quality. At worst, you can hear the wide rubber as it hits a sharp bump, but you’ll seldom feel it. Apart from some minor geometry changes to the suspension, the Black Badge’s ‘disruptive nature’ is simply the work of software. It’s what allows the engine to be more ‘voluble’, the gearbox to shift earlier, the steering to be more reactive and the suspension to respond quicker. Agile, however, is a relative term, and by the physics-breaking standards of large grand tourers like a Continental GT or an AMG S63, it feels a little soft. The rear-wheel steering feels essential here, and the steering has some slack, but that being said, once you get it into a rhythm, twirling the thin-rimmed wheel and making all that mass move is, again, joyous in its own special way. 2025 Rolls Royce Ghost price, verdict Pre-configured ‘Inspired Specifications’ can be easily ordered, get special names like Idealist. With the Ghost having gotten so accomplished, what is the point of the flagship Phantom, you might ask? De la Grange likens it to what’s in your wardrobe: “The Phantom is a black-tie tuxedo with dress shoes; it’s for special occasions,” he says. “The Ghost is a business jacket and loafers; it’s something you might use every day.” It makes so much sense for something so far removed from my everyday life. Because in absolute terms, the Ghost is no less of a car. In fact, it’s a greater car than most others available. The lengths Rolls has gone to surpass just about any other luxury carmaker, and the results are plain to see in the level of quality, sophistication and craftsmanship, which few others can match. At Rs 8.95 crore, before options, you should certainly get your money’s worth. So even if you aren’t the type to self-drive your Ghost, or pick an outrageous specification like this, or opt for the Black Badge treatment, or even be swayed by the mesmerising poetry of the Rolls-Royce lexicon, know that you will be in possession of one of the finest luxury motorcars to have ever put rubber to tarmac.

    "description": "Almost a decade after it first came out, the Bajaj Pulsar RS200 has got its first update, and even then, it’s a rather minor one. Priced at Rs 1.84 lakh, an increase of Rs 10,000 from earlier, the RS200 now gets a new tail-lamp design, the same colour LCD dash as the NS400Z, riding modes and a slipper clutch.  Pulsar RS200’s new tail-lamp integrates stop light and indicators Updated bike uses the same colour LCD dash as the Pulsar NS400Z It also gets a slipper clutch and three riding modes now Bajaj Pulsar RS200: What’s new? Not a lot. The Pulsar RS200 remains largely unchanged visually, but Bajaj has given it a brand-new tail-lamp that now uses two separate pods on each side. Each pod combines the indicator and tail-lamp into a single unit, similar to something seen on premium BMW and Harley-Davidson bikes. The rest of the design stays exactly the same, and the RS200 is available in three colours: black, white and red. The Pulsar RS200 is now also endowed with the same colour LCD dash and switchgear as seen on the Pulsar NS400Z, which means you get Bluetooth connectivity for turn-by-turn navigation and call/notification alerts. Along with that, Bajaj has also thrown in three riding modes: Off-Road, Road and Rain. Apart from these updates, the Pulsar RS200 remains unchanged. It continues to be powered by the same liquid-cooled, 199cc, single-cylinder motor that produces 24.5hp at  9,750rpm and 18.7Nm at 8,000rpm and is mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a slipper clutch.  At Rs 1.84 lakh, the updated Bajaj Pulsar RS200 costs a considerable Rs 10,000 more than before and competes with much more modern offerings like the Hero Karizma XMR (Rs 1.81 lakh) and the Yamaha R15 V4 (Rs 1.84 lakh - Rs 2.11 lakh). And at its new price, the RS200 sits almost on par with the much more powerful Pulsar NS400Z, which costs Rs 1.85 lakh.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz India plans to roll out eight models this year, majorly comprising top-end and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Notably, the G 580 and EQS 450 SUVs were launched just today. Its current lineup starts with the A 200 priced at Rs 46.5 lakh, going up to Rs 3.64 crore for the AMG G 63. Last year, Mercedes launched 14 new cars in the country, including the locally produced EQS SUV and the Maybach EQS SUV. Mercedes is India’s largest manufacturer of luxury four-wheelers The GT 63 Motorsport Collectors Edition could also arrive in limited numbers Mercedes has already confirmed to bring the G 580, Maybach EQS 680 Night Series and a CLA concept at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo. Other cars to also be present there include the AMG SL 55, AMG S 63 E Performance and E 450 LWB AMG Line. While we have earlier confirmed that the AMG CLE 53 will launch in the second half of 2025, the below-listed cars could be on the cards for India: Mercedes AMG E 53 The next-generation AMG E 53 plug-in hybrid made its global debut in 2024 and is expected to arrive on Indian shores in the coming months. Previously, we had the Mercedes-AMG E 53 Cabriolet on sale at Rs 1.3 crore; the sedan version was also launched in India in 2021, though it has been discontinued. The new Mercedes PHEV will have a combined output of 585hp and 750Nm, which can be taken up to 612hp with the AMG Dynamic Plus package. Mercedes AMG GT R Image used for representation After making its India debut in 2017 and getting a facelift in 2020, Mercedes pulled the plug on the AMG GT R soon after. The next-generation model is likely to arrive this year but owing to stricter emission norms, it is likely to get some type of hybrid system. The GT R coupe was powered by AMG’s 4-litre twin-turbo V8 making 585hp and 700 Nm, hurling it from 0-100 kph in 3.6 seconds. The top speed came at 318 kph. Mercedes Maybach GLS Night Series While we do have the Mercedes-Maybach GLS facelift on sale right now, the Night Series package will add black chrome elements to the car. Unveiled in 2023, the SUV gets a two-tone paint finish in Obsidian Black and Mojave Silver. There will be a monotone diamond white color scheme on offer as well. Under the hood, the Maybach GLS houses a 4-litre, twin-turbo V8 petrol engine generating up to 579hp and 770Nm of torque.
