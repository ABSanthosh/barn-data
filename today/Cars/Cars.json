    "description": "This 2022 Ford GT is one of 30 Alan Mann Heritage Edition examples built in commemoration of the lightweight 1966 Ford GT experimental race cars constructed by Alan Mann Racing. The car was ordered by the seller through Pat Milliken Ford in Redford, Michigan, and now has 13 miles. Finished in Alan Mann Red over Ebony Alcantara upholstery, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Factory-specified equipment includes the Gloss Exterior Carbon-Fiber Package, 20\" exposed carbon-fiber wheels, six-point harness anchors, and red brushed paddle shifters in addition to an Akrapovič titanium exhaust system, Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes, a retractable active rear wing, a rear diffuser, butterfly doors, Sparco seats, and a touchscreen infotainment system.

    "description": "This 1977 Lotus Esprit S1 is one of an estimated 718 examples produced between 1976 and 1978 and was sold new on May 8, 1978, from Lotus Mid America in Des Moines, Iowa. The original owner sold the car as a non-running project on BaT in September 2017, and it then underwent a $105k mechanical freshening that was completed by Benchmark Motor Studio of Covington, Louisiana, before being purchased by the current owner in 2019. It was subsequently displayed at the LeMay – America’s Car Museum of Tacoma, Washington, in 2019 and 2020. Work had included rebuilding the mid-mounted 1,973cc inline-four and five-speed manual transaxle in addition to suspension, brake, and ignition system overhauls. The car is finished in Oxford Blue over beige cloth, and equipment includes pop-up headlights, integrated driving lights, a clamshell hood, a rear hatch, 14\" GKN Wolfrace wheels, PerTronix electronic ignition, four-wheel disc brakes, an independent suspension, twin single-piece bucket seats, power windows, an AM/FM/cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This Esprit S1 is now offered in Berkeley, California, on dealer consignment with a Lotus Certificate of Vehicle Provenance, service records, a car cover, a tool kit, and a Washington title that lists the car as a 1978 model.",

    "description": "Chery-owned brand heads for the UK with a competitively priced Kona rival The dearth of low-priced petrol cars on sale today can’t have escaped many of us, so it is with interest that we run the road test rule over the Omoda 5 – a decently powerful Chinese answer to the Volkswagen T-Roc and Nissan Qashqai that costs about £25k.If you’ve not yet heard of Omoda, there’s every chance you’ll know of its parent company. State-owned Chery was founded in 1997 and is China’s most prolific exporter of cars, even if BYD has now overtaken it domestically. The Omoda sub-brand is one half of a two-pronged attack on overseas markets. It will offer crossovers with “statement” designs while Jaecoo will look to undercut rivals in the more SUV-flavoured sphere, starting with its Range Rover Velar-aping 7. The marques will share dealerships, of which 100 are planned in the UK by 2026, with 60 already in place.More than that, while Omoda’s cars are currently made in Wuhu, in eastern China, discussions are taking place as to whether a UK plant would be advantageous. The company is already committed to taking over an old Nissan plant in Barcelona, and the 5 itself has been tuned by a team based in Frankfurt – one led by a former JLR engineer.On paper, the 5 therefore looks a credible threat to the incumbents. What we will now learn is whether that also happens to be the reality.",

    "description": "Since they first hit the scene, Auto Fabrica has flirted with the concept of motorcycles as art pieces. The machines they build often feel like elegant concept bikes, but stop short of being so abstract that they become useless ornaments. This Ducati Scrambler 1100 embodies that philosophy. Labeled ‘T23,’ this is, remarkably, the first Ducati that the English workshop has customized. “We wanted to design and build something with a unique style,” says Bujar Muharremi, who runs Auto Fabrica with his brother, Gaz. “It was during the time when we were finishing our first bike with an integrated seat cover—Type 17—and wanted to really explore this idea on a slick concept-style build.” To give themselves a head start, Bujar and Gaz started with a 2024-model Ducati Scrambler 1100 Pro.…",

    "description": "Mahindra has shocked and awed one and all with its first born-electric SUV, called the BE 6e, or ‘be sexy’ as the company likes to call it. Beyond the wordplay, this striking SUV has plenty to impress, including standout specifications, stellar performance, a comprehensive feature set and an enticing starting price of Rs 18.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India). Built on Mahindra’s in-house developed INGLO platform, the BE 6e is packed with cutting-edge technology, such as multi-link rear suspension, adaptive dampers, a durable LFP (lithium ferrous phosphate) battery with BYD’s Blade cells, brake-by-wire functionality and variable gear ratio power steering. It comes with two battery options: a 59kWh unit and a larger 79kWh unit, both powering the rear wheels via an electric motor producing 380Nm of torque. The motor delivers 286hp with the 79kWh battery and 231hp with the 59kWh version. The ARAI-rated range is equally impressive, with the 59kWh version offering 535km and the 79kWh version stretching up to 682km. We took the larger battery variant for a spin to dive deeper into what the BE 6e has to offer. Mahindra BE 6e design The BE 6e boasts a radical, futuristic design that demands attention with its bold aesthetics. Its aggressive front styling is highlighted by sharp, striking elements and oversized LED daytime running lights, giving it a commanding road presence. The illuminated new ‘BE’ logo takes centre stage on the forward-tilted bonnet, adding a distinctive touch. An intriguing feature is the large hood scoop, designed to enhance aerodynamics by efficiently channelling airflow. The BE 6e features flared arches, smooth lines, and flush-fitting door handles along its side profile, creating a clean and sophisticated look. Its aero-inspired 19-inch wheels, thick gloss-black cladding and substantial ride height give it a concept-car-like presence. However, the gloss-black cladding may be prone to minor scratches. To counter this, the lower section beneath the doors has a rough finish with a unique lined pattern, offering added protection against scratches and stone chips. The design incorporates a distinctive trapezoidal window line and a coupe-like sloping roof, further enhancing its futuristic appeal. The dual spoilers – one on the roof and a lip spoiler on the stubby boot – add a sporty touch. At the rear, the styling is minimalistic, free from unnecessary cuts and creases, featuring a matte-finished Mahindra logo and BE 6e badging. The slim, oversized C-shaped LED tail-lamps, with a smoked effect reminiscent of a Range Rover, add a touch of elegance. The jury is still out on whether its radical design will have a universal appeal or just attract a niche, young audience.  In terms of dimensions, the BE 6e is larger and wider than the Tata Curvv EV. In fact, it is even wider than the Mahindra XUV700 and boasts a longer wheelbase to accommodate the big battery pack. It offers a healthy 207mm of ground clearance (unladen), with the battery pack positioned 220mm above the ground for optimal protection. Mahindra BE 6e interior The BE 6e’s design combines bold aesthetics with unique functionality, though it introduces a few practical challenges. The SUV’s tall ride height, sharply raked A-pillars and low roofline make stepping inside it a bit cumbersome, even with doors that open up to 90 degrees. Once seated, you might instinctively use the fabric door straps (which replace conventional handles) to close the door instead of the dedicated recess above them – a habit that could reduce the straps’ lifespan over time. The cabin mirrors the radical design of the exterior. A square-ish two-spoke steering wheel with illuminated touch controls and the brand’s logo immediately draws attention, although it feels a bit odd to hold. The 12.3-inch twin-screen setup is another highlight, positioned above an expansive dashboard that stretches to the sloping windscreen, reminiscent of the Honda Civic. However, this long dashboard offers no utility or storage space. An advantage of its low dashboard and its steeply raked windscreen is the fantastic frontal visibility, lending a sporty driving position. A unique “halo loop” wraps around the driver, evoking a race-car-like feel while also serving as a partition between the driver and the front passenger. However, this design element divides opinions. It reduces utility by obstructing the front passenger’s access to the USB-C ports and eliminating space for a second cup holder. Adding practical features, like buttons or a volume knob on the halo, could have enhanced functionality. Notable design touches include an aircraft-style drive selector, roof-mounted toggle switches and a magnetic holder on the centre console for the stylish key. Power window toggles are a quirky addition but function counter-intuitively: pushing the toggle up lowers the windows and vice versa, contrary to the arrow markings on the panel. The interior is accented with a matte olive green finish on the dashboard, door panels and seats, which pairs well with the black and grey tones. While the cabin looks modern, the gloss-black elements are prone to scratches, and the overall quality and fit-finish could be more premium. The touchpoints and switchgear lack the tactile feel we’ve experienced in global brands. Also, this Mahindra has an array of buttons scattered throughout (some are even on the roof); however, the allocation of functions to these isn’t well thought out. For example, there are five buttons to change regenerative braking levels, but there’s no dedicated button to toggle through the drive modes. The seats combine leatherette with recycled fabric and are supportive, though the cushioning leans firm. The driver’s seat is electrically adjustable, with three memory settings and a dedicated ventilation button, while the passenger seat’s ventilation function must be accessed through the touchscreen. Rear-seat ingress and egress are hampered by the low roofline. While the kneeroom is ample, the headroom is limited for taller passengers, and the thick door pads reduce seat width, making it less comfortable for three adults. The rear seat also lacks sufficient thigh support, and the lumbar support may feel excessive. Adjustable backrest recline adds a degree of customisation for rear-seat comfort, although it could do with a bit more recline. The quirky rear air vents can be opened or closed but don’t allow directional adjustments. Their intricate design may also trap dust, making cleaning a challenge. The BE 6e’s tall ride height and rear-mounted motor result in a high boot floor, complicating the loading of heavy items. The deep boot, rated at 455 litres, has limited height, making stacking luggage difficult. A space-saver spare tyre is neatly stored beneath the boot floor. A front trunk (frunk) adds 45 litres of storage with a maximum capacity of 35 kilograms, ideal for smaller items like charging cables or a car cover. While practical, it’s not particularly spacious. The BE 6e’s innovative design is packed with standout features, but a few compromises in usability and practicality could impact the overall ownership experience. For those drawn to its striking looks and cutting-edge tech, these trade-offs may be worth it. Mahindra BE 6e features On the topic of storage and practicality, the BE 6e gets large door pockets, a bulky central console with two levels – the lower level can accommodate items such as small handbags, whereas the top one has two wireless charging pads, a cup holder, shortcut buttons for the infotainment screen and a deep, cooled armrest console. The glove box is huge, too, and there’s also a USB port in there, through which one can transfer the video recorder footage to one’s mobile device or hard drive. Speaking of which, the vehicle’s 360-degree camera, as well as its in-cabin camera, can double up as a video recorder and be used like a dash-cam, should one so desire. And while on that topic, the BE 6e is stuffed to the gills with very useful and unique features. It gets an advanced head-up display, which uses augmented reality and displays navigation data in real-time, in addition to the speed, ADAS warnings and other details, all of which are configurable. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is full of apps, but only a few are useful. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are part of the package and work seamlessly. However, the user interface for the rest of the system is rather complicated. Accessing simple functions, such as air-con controls or volume, is a two-step process, and even the process of changing the drive mode is rather complicated: one needs to press the physical button, which is placed too far behind on the central console, and then stretch and reach out to the screen’s leftmost section to click on the drive mode of choice (Range, Everyday or Race). Then, to go back to the Android/Apple screen, one needs to press the touchscreen a few times. There’s also a Driver and Occupant Monitoring System (DOMS), which includes a wide-angle camera that one can use for video calls, recreational purposes, taking selfies, or even adding some AI-generated filters. An extremely useful safety function is that it monitors the driver’s eyes at all times, and when it detects that the driver is distracted or looking at a phone screen, it will throw up a prompt on the instrument cluster, asking the driver to focus on the road. Further, the BE 6e gets a crystal-clear 360-degree camera view, and the vehicle’s 3D display also sports the car’s exact body colour. Now, that’s neat attention to detail! Additionally, a fully autonomous self-parking function makes the BE 6e find, steer and park itself in a spot whether the driver is inside it or not. The BE 6e also packs ambient lighting, which is highly customisable. What’s more, the panoramic glass roof (fixed) also features patterned, customisable ambient lighting. A standout feature – undeniably – is the BE 6e’s 16-speaker Harman Kardon system with Dolby Atmos. The sound quality is simply mind-blowing and easily among the best out there, not just in its class but also from a couple of segments above. A noteworthy optional feature is the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) system, which allows passengers to dock their mobile phone or tablet on the back seat and sync it with the front screens. This enables users to watch videos on their devices while they are simultaneously played on the central touchscreen. Additionally, the system supports device mirroring to the front screen, offers control over air-conditioning settings, and provides access to various other functions, all from the comfort of the rear seat. Mahindra BE 6e performance The BE impresses with its exceptional refinement, keeping road and tyre noise well-muted while isolating the cabin from external sounds. Even the electric motor operates quietly, with its characteristic whine barely noticeable. As expected from an EV, acceleration is smooth and effortless. The BE offers three driving modes. Even in the economy-focused Range mode, power delivery is strong enough, allowing the car to accelerate swiftly and maintain pace with fast-moving highway traffic. While Range mode limits the top speed to 130kph, Everyday and Race modes remove this restriction. Race mode fully unlocks the motor’s potential, enabling rapid acceleration to triple-digit speeds. Mahindra claims a 0-100kph sprint in just 6.7 seconds, making the BE 6e the fastest accelerating production car from an Indian manufacturer. Using onboard telemetry, we recorded a time just 0.1 seconds shy of the claimed figure. An exciting feature is the ‘Boost’ function (accessible via a button on the steering), which temporarily unleashes the motor’s full power even in Range or Everyday modes. This added thrust is particularly handy for quick overtaking, especially on two-lane roads. The BE 6e also excels in regenerative braking, offering four levels of intensity. At level 0, the car coasts freely, while the deceleration becomes progressively stronger up to level 3, all feeling seamless and intuitive. A dedicated one-pedal mode provides even more aggressive regeneration, bringing the car to a complete stop without needing the brake pedal. Its braking system uses a sophisticated brake-by-wire setup with an integrated electronic booster. This system seamlessly switches between regenerative braking and conventional friction brakes (front and rear discs) within milliseconds, based on pedal input. Impressively, the brake pedal offers a natural feel, and the braking performance is both consistent and reassuring. Mahindra BE 6e ride and handling The BE 6e achieves a near-perfect balance of ride and handling. Its battery pack, positioned beneath the floor, enhances torsional rigidity and lowers the centre of gravity, giving the car remarkable stability. This strategic weight distribution allows Mahindra’s engineers to implement a soft suspension setup, further complemented by semi-adaptive dampers that adjust stiffness based on the selected drive mode. In the ‘Range’ mode, the dampers are softer and more absorbent, while in the aggressive ‘Race’ mode, they stiffen up to deliver a sportier driving experience. True to Mahindra’s SUV heritage, the BE 6e tackles potholes and broken roads with ease, maintaining excellent composure and rounding off imperfections akin to a luxury car. Body movements are superbly controlled, while its generous 207mm ground clearance and robust 245mm-wide tyres inspire confidence over speed breakers and rumble strips without the need to slow down. At just 2.66 turns lock-to-lock, the BE has a really quick steering. A part of its INGLO platform is its variable gear ratio steering system. Still, the steering has some slack at the dead-centre position (to prevent the handling from feeling twitchy) before it gains weight. As far as effort goes, the steering is light yet very direct. The front-end response is sharp, allowing the BE 6e to change direction with the agility of a smaller, lighter car. The SUV feels confident and composed when cornering, with minimal body roll, and its impressive 5-metre turning radius is remarkable for a vehicle of its size. Being a rear-wheel-drive EV, the BE 6e is very easy to put its power down on the road without excessive wheelspin. This drive layout also ensures a degree of fun and playfulness, especially in corners. The SUV’s ability to mask speed is genuinely very impressive. It excels equally on winding roads and open highways, delivering a driving experience comparable to European luxury SUVs costing two to three times more.  Mahindra BE 6e verdict The Mahindra BE 6e is unlike anything else on the road – whether you love its design or not, it’s impossible to ignore. If you’re in the market for a car brimming with character and undeniable road presence, the BE 6e has you covered. Packed with a host of features and modern conveniences, it offers exceptional value for money with a starting price of Rs 18.90 lakh (ex-showroom). With a claimed real-world range of over 500 km, impressive charging times and the distinction of being the fastest production car from an Indian manufacturer to date, the BE 6e solidifies its position as a standout in its segment. That said, its interior could have been more spacious, and the user interface (UI) and overall user experience (UX) leave room for improvement, but as we’re told by Mahindra, these are still in their Beta testing phase and are likely to be more refined before deliveries begin early next year. At its core, the BE 6e is so well-engineered that it delivers a truly world-class driving experience. Also see:    Mahindra XEV 9e review: A new chapter for Indian EVs",

    "description": "Someone wise recently told me: “A watch tells more than time.” Essentially, this means your watch is an extension of yourself, and different watches fit different people's personas. That saying is actually quite fitting for this bike – the gorgeous Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350. It isn't too different from the Classic 350, but it's targeted at a rather different rider – someone who wants to be unique but doesn't want the compromises that come with this style of bike. RE Goan Classic 350: Design, changes to Classic Design is one of the foremost ways the Goan Classic differs from the standard Classic. Starting at the front, you've got these very retro-looking whitewall tyres, which are found only on a microscopic amount of bikes available on sale today. While the tyres have a retro look, a welcome surprise is that the Goan Classic runs cross-spoke laced wheels, which permit tubeless tyres. The tyres are CEAT’s new Zoom Classic rubber, developed specifically for the Goan Classic. While the front wheel is a 19-incher, like the bike it is based on, the rear wheel is a 16-incher in proper bobber fashion. Then, the Goan Classic trades the Classic's handlebar for tall ape-hanger bars that put your arms almost straight and in line with your shoulders. It also has more forward-set pegs from the Meteor 350, and together, these changes put you in a properly relaxed riding position. The Goan Classic is also the only RE 350 to get the metal switch cubes from the larger 650s. Even the exhaust muffler is new and has a bit of a raspy note to it. You also have a cantilevered rider's seat, which is just 750mm off the ground, making it the second-lowest seat on any Royal Enfield today, after the Super Meteor 650. But my favourite design element is this articulated rear fender that moves with the wheel. The logos and badging on this bike also align with the retro custom aesthetic and add that little bit of extra pizzazz to its design. The Goan Classic’s colour palette is very funky and out there, and those who like to make a statement with their bikes will like the paint options. There are four colours to choose from, but my favourite has to be the Trip Teal (nice naming, RE!). RE Goan Classic 350: Ride and handling, comfort So, how do all these changes affect the riding experience? The short answer is, not much. The Goan Classic feels very similar to the Classic 350, which is a very pleasant feeling, with the only difference being how you're seated. The tall ape hangers work rather well when you're riding, and there's no strain on your arms or shoulders. After a brief accustomization period, I found my rhythm, and I suspect it will be the same for most others. The only small caveat here is that while making a tight U-turn, you need to plan your movements correctly and be a little more mindful of the tall bars. And because of how you're seated on the bike, you'll also bear the brunt of bad roads a little more than the Classic. That said, the Goan Classic is nowhere as uncomfortable as its competitors from Classic Legends. Honestly, aside from the different riding positions, the rest of the riding experience is pretty much identical to the Classic 350. This means it's the same relaxed, comfortable, and smooth yet torquey bike we've come to know and loved over the years. RE Goan Classic: Verdict All in all, the Goan Classic 350 feels like a cut above the rest of the 350s in terms of fit and finish, quality, and uniqueness. This will also be reflected in its price, as it is the most expensive 350cc Royal Enfield. Prices start at Rs 2.35 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai) and go up to Rs 2.38 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai), making it Rs 5,000 - Rs 8,000 more expensive than the top Emerald Chrome Classic 350. With the Goan Classic, you're getting a very unique-looking thing with proven fundamentals, a custom bike straight from RE. So, if you're one of the few people who use their watch not just to tell the time but to make a statement, I think the Goan Classic will be right up your alley.

    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/industry/skoda-auto-volkswagen-india-faces-usd-14-billion-tax-evasion-notice-report-433720#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+News+feed",
    "description": "The Indian government has issued a notice to Skoda Auto Volkswagen India for allegedly evading USD 1.4 billion in taxes by “wilfully” paying lesser import tax on parts for Skoda, VW and Audi cars, reveals a document, making it one of the biggest demands of this nature, Reuters reported. As per the report, a notice dated September 30 states that Volkswagen used to import “almost the entire car” in an unassembled state. The import tax levied in India for completely knocked down units is 30-35 percent, but the company paid a much lower duty of 5-15 percent by “mis-classifying” and “mis-declaring” these imports as “individual parts”. The news wire further said that these imports were made by VW’s India unit, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, for models such as the Skoda Kodiaq and Superb, and luxury cars like Audi A4 and Audi Q5, and VW Tiguan. The investigation has found that different batches were shipped to avoid detection and “wilfully evade” higher taxes, Reuters noted. “This logistical arrangement is an artificial arrangement ... operating structure is nothing but a ploy to clear the goods without the payment of the applicable duty,” said the 95-page notice by the Office of the Commissioner of Customs in Maharashtra. The notice is not in the public domain but was reviewed by Reuters.  The authority noted that since 2012, VW’s India unit should have paid import taxes and levies to the tune of USD 2.35 billion to the Indian government, whereas it actually paid USD 981 million, leaving a USD 1.36 billion gap. In a statement, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India said it is a “responsible organization, fully complying with all global and local laws and regulations. We are analyzing the notice and extending our full cooperation to the authorities.” A government official who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity said that in such cases, the penalty could go to 100 percent of the evaded amount; the company could end up paying roughly USD 2.8 billion if found guilty. Reuters further stated that VW is a small player in India's car market comprising 4 million units a year, and has faced challenges in bolstering sales. This adds to its woes, where its Audi brand is behind competitors BMW and Mercedes in the luxury space. Inspectors searched three of Volkswagen India’s facilities in 2022, including the two factories in Maharashtra, said the Reuters report, adding that documents pertaining to component imports and an email backup of top executives were taken at the time. The managing director of Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, Piyush Arora, was questioned last year and asked “why all the parts required to assemble a car are not shipped together”, but “he was not able to answer this question”, the investigators said in the notice. Reuters could not elicit a response from Arora on this issue. The notice, on the basis of the company’s internal software, said that Skoda VW India regularly placed bulk orders for cars via internal software, which connected it to suppliers in the Czech Republic, Mexico and Germany, among other nations. As per Reuters, the authorities have alleged that after the order was placed, the software broke it down into “main components/parts”, roughly 700-1,500 for each vehicle, depending on the model. The car parts were packed abroad in different containers within a span of three to seven consecutive days under multiple invoices and then reached the Indian port roughly at the same time. “This appears to have been done to pay lesser duties applicable on these individual parts,” the notice said. Volkswagen told investigators it was using such a route for “efficiency of operations”, but the argument was dismissed. “Logistics is a very small and rather least significant step of the whole process ... (Skoda-Volkswagen India) is not a logistics company,” the notice said. Also See: Kia India exports one lakh CKD vehicles KTM’s financial troubles grow, seeks funding upward of 100 million Euros",

    "description": "At the launch of the new Activa e: and QC1 electric scooters, Honda stated that deliveries for these would begin in February 2025. However, a more recent announcement made the next day by Honda Power Pack Energy India Pvt Ltd (HEID) suggests that this will not entirely be the case. Activa e: and QC1 will be sold via existing Honda Red Wing outlets While QC1 will be widely available, Activa e: will be sold only in 3 cities HEID targets to have 500 battery-swapping stations by March 2026 Following the Activa e:’s launch, HEID announced that it plans to set up its battery-swapping stations in Mumbai and Delhi only by April 2025. Given that the new Honda Activa e: cannot be charged at home and can only be powered by batteries from a swap station, it is fair to assume that the scooter cannot be sold in a city that does not have the swapping infrastructure in place. So, while Honda initially stated that the Activa e: would be available in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi from February 2025, it appears that sales will actually begin on that date only in Bengaluru. However, the Honda QC1, which is the other e-scooter with a fixed battery, should be widely available across the country from February onwards. Honda will sell both these electric scooters out of its existing Red Wing dealerships. As for the battery-swapping infrastructure, HEID president and CMD Takuya Taniguchi said, “HEID would focus on three actions, which are continuously expanding its battery-swap network, ensuring reliable service with a highly integrated system monitoring every unique battery and exchanger, and supporting customers to ensure superior battery-swap experience.” HEID has about 85 operational battery-swapping stations in Bengaluru and plans to expand that number to 500 stations across Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai by March 2026.

    "description": "To keep a car running, change its oil every 3000 miles,” says 76-year-old Richard. His advice is nothing new, especially for anybody who owns an old Volkswagen, and he has applied this saying to his 1983 Volkswagen Beetle, which has served him for over 20 years. Some 20 years ago, Richard got a call from a friend saying that there was a Beetle for sale not too far away from him. He decided to take a look, and the moment he saw the Bug, he instantly fell in love with it. Continue...",

    "description": "Photography by: Johnathan Rothman (@thejohnrothman) 1956 Jaguar XK140 Convertible Raced in period by Briggs Cunningham and Denise McLuggage Location: California, USA Country of original delivery: USA Chassis/VIN: S818207 Mileage: 76,025 miles Colour: Red Original colour of delivery: Carmine Red Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Jaguar. The Jaguar XK140 represented the epitome of front-mounted 6-cylinder Jaguars in the mid-1950s. This particular example is without a doubt the most storied one in the United States of America, as it was raced and campaigned by two of the most prolific personalities in the American racing world. The car was first campaigned by renowned Briss Cunningham, who was indisputably one of the most pivotal figures in postwar sports car racing, making a profound impact as a driver, team owner, and constructor. Briggs then proceeded to donate his XK140 to Denise McLuggage, an American auto racing driver, journalist, author and photographer. She pioneered gender equality in motorsports and journalism in the U.S., and was among the very first women taking part in professional automotive racing. Her racing achievements included winning the grand touring category at Sebring in a Ferrari 250 GT in 1961, and a class win in the Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Falcon in 1964. She also participated in the Nürburgring 1000 km sports car race. This car's past is in fact so fascinating that it recently enabled it to earn a very coveted spot in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (MSHFA), where it resided in 2022 alongside other giants of the racing world. What's perhaps even more remarkable, is that the car presents in unaltered condition. It's been kept 'as-is' by its 4 owners (Briggs Cunningham, Denise McLuggage, and 2 other owners, including the present one), and is showing a splendid amount of patina. Everything about this car is original and has remained untouched over the last 58 years - the chassis, body panels, engine, transmission, suspension, wheels, seats, dashboard materials, and more, are all original. And, magically, 58 years later, it still elegantly runs and drives. Continue...",
