    "description": "The Xoom 125 is the latest scooter from Hero and it has all the makings of being the latest success story for the company. Hero Xoom 125 design and style Xoom 125 has a catchy design and good presence The new Xoom makes a strong impression thanks to its design and presence. This is not an excessively large or bulky scooter, but it does stand out. Those big 14-inch wheels wrapped in fat rubber do wonders for the overall silhouette. Hero has also done well to give this scooter its own unique design, and it looks quite different from the Xoom 110, even though the family resemblance is immediately identifiable. Catchy colours and sharp styling help the Xoom 125 stand out on the road. There are four colour options and the matte yellow you see here looks particularly good, even if it's quite clearly inspired by the TVS NTorq 125. Nevertheless, with its sporty stance and striking looks, this is a scooter most young riders would love to be seen on. Hero Xoom 125 engine and performance Motor borrowed from Destini 125 but makes more power here The motor is borrowed from the Destini 125, but it produces a little more power here – 9.9hp and 10.4Nm. On the move, the feeling and sound is of a rather conventional automatic scooter and throttle calibration is very smooth. There is a hint of vibration in the floorboard at around 20kph, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the motor smoothens out beautifully as the speeds rise and it is absolutely refined at about 60kph. Engine is shared with the Destini 125 but is more powerful here. Hero claims a segment leading 0-60kph time of 7.6s, despite the fact that this is one of the heavier 125cc scooters (121kg) and its power figures aren’t segment leading either. It’s hard to verify that claim from the riding experience as well because the power delivery is quite linear. While there is a pretty strong pull at lower revs you have to twist the long-travel accelerator wide open to find it – even then, it doesn’t quite have as strong a surge as you’d find in something like the TVS Ntorq. Just like the 110, the Xoom 125 gets two spacious cubbies on the front apron. The overall performance can be described as quick and refined but not particularly exciting. Top speed should be above a speedo indicated 90kph and the scooter managed to climb up to 80kph without much stress, even on a slight uphill section. As for fuel efficiency, Hero claims 54.9kpl, which is par for the course with this segment.  Hero Xoom 125 chassis, handling and comfort Xoom 125 is one of a handful of Indian-made scooters to ride on 14-inch wheels The Xoom 125 shares the same basic chassis as the Destini 125 and Xoom 110, but with a different wheelbase and steering angle. The big deal here is the use of 14-inch wheels, which makes this the only other locally manufactured scooter to offer them apart from the Yamaha Aerox 155 and the Aprilia SR range.  14-inch wheels lend the Xoom 125 good stability. Big wheels bring in stability and the Xoom feels very well balanced at low speeds, which addresses that nervous feeling you can get from scooters with smaller wheels. Low-speed agility is still quite good despite the long 1,327mm wheelbase, but it certainly doesn’t have the super-light steering feel you’d get from a conventional scooter. There wasn’t a whole lot to judge about outright handling on the crowded Delhi streets we rode on, but this does come across as a confident and fun handling scooter. The Xoom 125 gets a tethered USB charger. The only dynamic aspect I didn’t like was the braking. The actual performance is fine, but the levers feel hard and require some effort to slow the scooter down. As for the suspension comfort, it seems to strike a middle ground between the harsh Aprilia and the soft and plush Ntorq. On Delhi’s smooth, tarmac roads, comfort was good, but we’ll need to see what it’s like on Mumbai’s fast but bumpy concrete surfaces. Hero Xoom 125 seating comfort, features Xoom 125 is a decently comfortable and feature-rich scooter The seating position is decently spacious and while the handlebar will meet a tall rider’s knees at full lock, it’s not bad and is easy to manage. At 777mm, the seat height is low enough, but the seat (and scooter) is fairly wide and riders shorter than 5’6” may not be able to get both feet flat on the ground.  It is decently comfortable but the seat is wide, which could hinder shorter riders from getting their feet on the ground. As for features, unlike the Xoom 110, this scooter thankfully comes with an external fuel-filler cap and there’s even a warning chime in case you forget to close it. Beyond that, some things are nice like the standard LED projector headlamp, or the glovebox with a USB charger and the scrolling LED indicators that come on the top model. However, there are a few missing things like a parking brake lock and a silent-start system. Some may also find the LCD display a bit basic in an age where rivals are moving on to TFT units, but this display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the top model.  LCD display is easy to read and has turn-by-turn navigation on the ZX variant. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict It could be another win for Hero, priced almost on par with TVS Ntorq 125 What needs to improve is the overall quality and attention to detail, and a closer inspection will reveal uneven panel gaps in a few places and cheap feeling, flexible black plastics in others. That being said, the value is excellent and priced between Rs 86,900 and Rs 92,900, this scooter is on par with the lower variants in the Ntorq line-up and about Rs 30,000 cheaper than the only other 125cc scooter with 14-inch wheels in our market – the Aprilia SR 125. The Xoom has some real desirability to it and it is priced very well too. And with such good pricing, I think Hero has pulled off another win with this scooter, much like they have with the Xtreme 125, which is selling superbly well for the company. Like that bike, this is a very good looking thing, and it has real desirability to it – I’d love to have rocked up to college on this scooter back in the day. But there’s more on offer as well, because, just like the Xtreme 125, the Xoom is quick, fun, practical and very good value for money. Also See: Hero Xoom 125 video review",

    "description": "Traversing Mumbai’s congested streets is already harrowing enough, especially during rush hour. And in the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé, this experience is amplified manifold. Picture being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, with other vehicles precariously close to your oversized luxury SUV that costs more than some apartments.On several occasions, my heart raced as the SUV’s 360-degree camera system lit up, triggered by reckless bikers attempting to squeeze through non-existent gaps. I was on my way to meet my brother-in-law, but I had an ulterior motive. When he moved to Dubai in 2022, I suggested he purchase a GLE Coupé – not the AMG variant but the standard turbo-petrol version. It fit his budget and would have complemented Dubai’s opulent lifestyle. He didn’t heed my advice. Now, driving the 2025 AMG GLE through Mumbai’s Western suburbs, I was determined to prove a point. Feels huge when navigating through congested streets. The GLE’s substantial size, especially its 2.1-metre width, is particularly noticeable in city driving. Despite setting the GLE in Comfort mode (as it lacks an ‘Eco’ setting), the onboard computer never showed fuel efficiency exceeding 5kpl in traffic – unsurprising for an AMG-fettled 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbo-petrol engine in a full-size SUV. The ride quality is also less than ideal. Even in Comfort mode, the suspension crashes through potholes, followed by a floaty, vertical movement that tosses passengers around. The front seats are comfortable, but their ventilation is ineffective, and at this price point, the absence of a massage function is disappointing. Moreover, the touch-sensitive steering controls are overly sensitive, often registering unintended inputs. Also, like in most Mercedes models, one must switch off the overly sensitive autonomous braking feature at the start of every journey. Besides sounding sweet, this 6-cyl unit is a strong performer. On the upside, the GLE’s touchscreen interface is one of the best in the business, and the sound quality from the Burmester audio system is equally impressive. Additionally, Mercedes’ integrated starter-generator delivers a seamless and non-intrusive auto stop/start function, making it easier to leave this feature enabled for fuel-saving while idling. After two hours and 20 kilometres, I finally arrived at my destination, relieved to have avoided any scratches on the vehicle. However, it’s worth noting a significant flaw – many modern Mercedes models, including this one, have a noticeable orange peel effect on their paint, giving the body panels an unfinished look that’s unacceptable at this price. When my brother-in-law saw the GLE, he was visibly impressed. The bold LEDs, imposing Panamericana grille and sleek, sloping roofline left him awestruck. The luxurious beige cabin, complemented by wood inlays, silver trims and dramatic ambient lighting, further elevated the experience. While I admired the impeccable fit and finish, I would have preferred a sportier interior with red seatbelts to enhance its AMG character. Also, though the rear seats are spacious, their cushioning is firm, and the upright backrest detracts from comfort. However, the AMG GLE’s highlight is its six-cylinder engine and exhaust note. With the exhaust flaps open, a few solid revs produced a thunderous roar and crackles that disrupted the serene neighbourhood. “I should have listened to you,” my brother-in-law admitted, promptly whipping out his phone to browse websites scouting for used examples in Dubai. Mission accomplished. Firm cushioning, upright backrest angle far from comfy. The following day, we drove the GLE to a popular eatery in Karjat. Traffic on the Western Express Highway was predictably slow, so I opted for the longer but less congested route via the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Coastal Road and AtalSetu before joining the old Mumbai-Pune highway. I’m really glad Mercedes didn’t downsize this six-cylinder turbo-petrol unit. The engine’s performance reserves make highway cruising effortless. It gets to three-digit speeds almost too quickly, and before you know it, you’re well past the speed limit. With the drive mode set to Sport, even the gearbox feels sharper and a touch quicker. The nine-speed automatic performed brilliantly, too, and I never found the need to use the paddle shifters to take manual control. Switching the suspension to Sport mode revealed a firmer yet more composed ride, with the car feeling flat and stable at higher speeds. The steering is sharp, and when driven with verve, the GLE feels surprisingly agile and manoeuvrable for its size. However, its bulk becomes evident during hard braking, with a noticeable nose-dive and a significant weight transfer. Ground clearance in its standard setting is plenty, but the GLE takes it a step ahead with a suspension-lift function to increase ride height further. Honestly, I don’t think this feature is needed for the typical on-road application the GLE AMG will be subjected to. Its bright interiors with wood and aluminium inserts feel luxurious. In conclusion, the Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupé commands attention with its road presence, offers strong performance paired with an exhilarating exhaust note and is a pleasure to drive on open roads. However, its ride quality and rear-seat comfort could have been better, and certain features should have been added to justify its Rs 1.88 crore price tag.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/electric-cars/mercedes-amg-cla-45-return-500bhp-ev-axial-flux-motors",
    "description": "Hot version of new electric CLA will have ultra-slim Yasa motors, a drift mode and a hydraulic rear wing Mercedes-AMG is set to roll out advanced new axial-flux electric motor technology across a new range of “hyper-performance” models - starting with 500bhp-plus successors to the CLA 45 4Matic+ Saloon and Shooting Brake. Previously, AMG's patented axial-flux motors were confirmed for only the company's dedicated electric GT 4-Door and GT SUV models, due out in 2026. But Autocar has learnt that the motors – developed in partnership with Yasa, a British-based engineering firm acquired by Mercedes-Benz in 2021 - are also set to feature in other electric performance variants of the new GLA, GLC and C-Class, among other AMG models. The move aims to position AMG at the forefront of performance EVs and is a direct response to the plans of its BMW M rival to provide future performance models, including new electric versions of the next-generation M3 and X3 M, with four motors developing up to 1000bhp. Mercedes-Benz’s Chief Technical Officer, Markus Schäfer, confirmed the plans at the unveiling of the third-generation Mercedes CLA at a presentation in Rome, where the German car maker previewed the upcoming AMG variant due out in 2026 to the media. “We have established a second pillar when it comes to powertrains - keyword Yasa. This is available to us across all model lines,” Schäfer told Autocar. Central to AMG's “hyper-performance” plans is the axial motor’s low weight and compact dimensions, and it will be brought to at least four models based on Mercedes-Benz’s MMA and MB.EA platforms. At the unveiling of its OneEleven concept car in 2023, Mercedes-Benz claimed the axial electric motors weighed just one-third of its new eATS 2.0 motors, as used in the new electric Mercedes CLA 250+ and CLA 350 4Matic. At the same time, it stated that they require just one-third of the space. Mercedes-Benz sources reveal AMG has developed a number of different 800V drivetrain combinations based around its axial-flux motor technology, including a tri-motor set-up. This is not only expected to provide future performance models with \"significant power and torque\" but also \"advanced torque-vectoring properties.\" This is claimed to play a crucial role in the dynamic behaviour of the new CLA 45 4Matic+, allowing it to direct power to each individual wheel for more predictable cornering characteristics. It also provides scope for AMG to alter the handling, offering either more front-driven or rear-driven properties depending on the driving mode. As with the current model, a drift mode is also planned. Nothing is official just yet, but Autocar has been told that the most powerful versions of Mercedes-AMG’s future compact car line-up will offer more than 500bhp and significantly more torque than today’s CLA 45 4Matic+, which has an electronically turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine producing 416bhp and 369lb ft. In a bid to provide its new electric models with the aural qualities to match their performance, AMG is also working on a new range of synthetic sounds, including a so-called 'V8 Mode', which is designed to replicate the roar of AMG’s traditional V8 petrol engines.  In addition to axial-flux motor technology, AMG is planning to equip its future electric models with an oil-cooled battery that features unique cylindrical cells and chemistry for greater energy density than the batteries used in standard Mercedes-Benz electric models. The new battery will be paired with the next-generation inverter, heat pump and brake energy recuperation technology launched on standard versions of the new CLA.  Other developments planned for the new CLA 45 4Matic+ include an active aerodynamics package with an electrohydraulic rear wing integrated into the trailing edge of the bootlid. As well as providing additional downforce at higher speeds, it has also been conceived to act as an air brake with a tilting function in its most advanced form - as suggested by the prominent bootlid bulge under the camouflage of recently spotted prototypes.  Whether this latter functionality will feature on the range-topping CLA model, however, remains to be seen.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-rethinks-electric-cars-game-changing-492-mile-cla",
    "description": "New motor, new battery and great aero yield 492 miles and 5.0mpkWh Hyper-efficient CLA becomes UK's longest-range electric car, while hybrid promises diesel-style MPG The new Mercedes-Benz CLA has been revealed as Europe’s longest-range and most efficient electric car. Arriving later this year, the entry-level CLA 250+ with EQ Technology will be capable of driving up to 492 miles between charges, Mercedes claims, and will still manage 431 miles if driven exclusively atmotorway speeds. Although pending homologation, these figures should mean the CLA EV leapfrogs all other electric cars available in the UK. That includes Mercedes’ own flagship EQS 450+, which manages 481 miles per charge from a 118kWh battery. That’s priced at a whopping £112,610 – some £70,000 more than the CLA EV’s expected starting price. That remarkable range figure is thanks to Mercedes’ efforts to minimise the CLA EV’s energy consumption: it has a nickel-managanese-cobalt (NMC) battery of just 85kWh in capacity. This means the CLA EV achieves an efficiency figure north of 5.0mpkWh – which many manufacturers consider the key to taking EVs to the next level. PUNCHY BUT FRUGAL The CLA EV’s impressive range figure is in no small part thanks to its aerodynamic design. Although the car is larger than its predecessor in every dimension (25mm wider, 25mm taller and 30mm longer), much work went into minimising its frontal area, and smoothing the flow of air around it. For example, the wheels are set further in-board of the arches than its predecessor. Small inlets on the front bumper (and corresponding outlets at the rear) guide the flow of air around each corner, relatively undisturbed by the alloy wheels’ flush-faced designs. The efforts net a slippery drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.21, just behind that of the EQS (0.20) and ahead that of the Tesla Model 3 (0.22). The CLA EV’s new rear-mounted permanent magnet motor is also significant to its efficiency. It uses a new silicon-carbide inverter that brings greater output in a smaller package, reducing weight, while the engineers claim its torque density is boosted by the magnets being inserted in a double-V formation, concentrating their field. The motor also gets a Porsche Taycan-style two-speed gearbox, rather than the usual single-speed reduction gearing. This has a short (11:1) first ratio for improved off-the-mark acceleration and better efficiency at town speeds and a significantly longer (5:1) second ratio for less consumption at a cruise. The powertrain puts out 268bhp, which allows the CLA 250+ to complete the 0-62mph dash in 6.7sec. The four-wheel-drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ Technology gets an additional 107bhp motor with a single-speed gearbox on its front axle, giving a combined output of 349bhp. This cuts its 0-62mph sprint time down to 4.9sec, making it quicker in a straight line than the V8-engined C55 AMG of 20 years ago. This additional motor is decoupled from the front axle when it isn’t needed, reducing energy losses to friction by 90%. This means the four-wheel-drive CLA EV can still manage 478 miles per charge – a smaller disparity compared with the rear-driven version than is typical of most other EVs. Braking primarily relies on the motors’ regenerative effect (which can provide up to 200kW of stopping power), helping to keep the battery topped up. The CLA EV can be rapid-charged at rates of up to 320kW, thanks to its 800V electrical architecture, allowing for a 186-mile top-up in just 10 minutes. In addition to the 85kWh battery, a 58kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) pack will be added to the line- up shortly after launch. This will almost certainly bring a significant price cut but also reduce the CLA EV’s range to around 300 miles. Autocar can reveal that a hot AMG CLA 45 EV is inbound, too, with a pair of Yasa-developed axial flux motors providing more than 500bhp and a raft of extensive modifications aimed at bolstering its performance and dynamics.  ADVANCES IN COMBUSTION TOO The new CLA will also be offered in hybrid form. Specifically designed to fit in the same space as the EV’s front motor, its powertrain pairs a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a small, 1.3kWh battery and a 27bhp electric motor. These combine to send either 134bhp or 161bhp through the front wheels or, in the range-topping 4Matic model, 188bhp to all four wheels. According to Mercedes, the engine achieves “diesel levels of fuel efficiency”, suggesting an MPG figure comfortably north of 50. As part of a push for parity from Mercedes, the hybrid CLA will be priced on a par with the CLA EV, Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius recently announced. This is thanks to cost savings of some 30% in battery production bringing the EV’s overall price down by around 15%. To that end, pricing is expected to start in the low-to-mid £40,000 range. The EV will go on sale first, around October, with the hybrid following a few months later. Joining the saloon will be a new CLA Shooting Brake. This estate car is earmarked to arrive in the UK early next year with both powertrain options, so its unveiling will most likely take place at September’s Munichmotor show. STAR-SPANGLED In a first for Mercedes, the CLA hybrid and CLA EV will look almost identical inside and out, as well as sharing a model name. This marks an end to Mercedes’ strategy of entirely bespoke EVs being developed to sit alongside their combustion-engined equivalents, such as with the E-Class and EQE. The CLA also ushers in a dramatic new look for future Mercedes models, emphasising the brand’s three-pointed star logo. The motif features in the CLA’s headlights and rear brake lights, and the EV also gets a flush front grille with no fewer than 142 backlit stars. They surround the main front badge, which is also backlit. In the US, the outer ring of the badge itself is lit, but EU legislation prevents this. The CLA hybrid is differentiated by a traditional open grille, needed to provide cooling airflow to the engine. NEW-LOOK INTERIOR Inside, the new CLA takes on a sportier character than its more luxurious stablemates. The front seats have chunky side bolsters, for example, and there are more exuberant material choices, such as a combination of black and white Alcantara and faux leather with red stitching. The dashboard is designed around the latest iteration of Mercedes’ Superscreen, whose three digital displays (a 10.25in one for the instruments in front of the driver; a 14.6in infotainment one centrally; and, optionally, a 14in one for the front passenger) span its entire width. Thanks to Mercedes’ latest MB.OS operating system, the screens can be used to play video games such as Fortnite while on the move or stream shows and films via Netflix and other such services. The system also features the latest iteration of Mercedes’ virtual assistant, which blends various artificial intelligence functions (ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft Bing) to provide more accurate answers to questions. In cars without the Superscreen, the passenger screen will be replaced with a glass panel with LED-backlit star logos, which match the interior’s ambient lighting. Boot space is rated at 405 litres, which is 55 litres down in the old CLA’s but, in a first for a modern Mercedes, the EV gets a frunk that adds another 101 litres of storage space.",

    "description": "A good exhaust note is one of your motorcycle’s most visceral aspects. The connection from your ear drums to your right wrist plays an undeniable part in raising your pulse, making aftermarket exhausts one of the most common mods on a new motorcycle. But if you’re going down that road, just know there’s a lot more to think about than amplified acoustics. A good aftermarket motorcycle exhaust will enhance performance and cosmetics, while a bad one may leave you with a deafening drone and a fix-it ticket. We’ve just added a line of killer stainless steel exhaust systems from Stealth Pipes Inc. to the Bike EXIF Store, ranging from the Honda Monkey to the new M8 Softail. To celebrate the occasion, we’re highlighting five key points to consider when selecting an aftermarket exhaust, and encourage you to consider handmade stainless offerings from Stealth.…",

The man behind Taiwan’s Rough Crafts has a sense of style that would make Johnny Cash’s wardrobe blush, and seldom builds a custom motorcycle that isn’t swathed in various shades of black. We checked; a mere 10 percent of the Rough Crafts bikes featured on our pages buck this trend. So when Mr. Yeh does deviate from this formula, it’s usually for a good reason—like a special request from a client. “He wanted an old school chopper, he wanted it silver, and he wanted the ‘Rough Crafts’ style,” says Winston of the succinct brief he received for the project. The only other request was that Rough Crafts use a modern bike as a donor so that reliability wouldn’t be an issue.…",

    "link": "",
    "description": "This is one of those happy accident stories, where a Le Mans legend added to its rich legacy in the most unusual of circumstances. Over its 100-plus-year history, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has delivered plenty of shocking results, but few rival this one. Not only did it propel a sponsor into the limelight, but it also unexpectedly sparked a motorsport cultural movement that continues to resonate 30 years later. However, as is often the case with motorsport stories from this era, a central figure behind it all eventually ended up in jail. A New Era, A Crucial Loophole The early '90s marked a transitional period in endurance racing. With the World Sportscar Championship folding in 1992, the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO), custodians of Le Mans, sought to redefine the competition landscape. The curtain had fallen on the Group C prototype era, ushering in a focus on GT-style racers. Icons like the Ferrari F40, McLaren F1, and domestic marvels such as the Bugatti EB110 and Venturi 600 LM became the new torchbearers.​ To populate the GT1 class, the ACO mandated the production of at least 25 road-going versions of each race car. Yet, nestled within the fine print was a provision allowing manufacturers to apply for homologation prior to actual production—a statement ripe for exploitation. Porsche, ever the opportunist, recognized the potential of this clause, or, more importantly, this loophole. Continue...",

    "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUkhfi8pxw At sixteen, freedom came wrapped in a small rectangular bit of plastic. Alex Yust got a fresh driver’s license from the Hollywood DMV. It wasn’t just about transportation, it was about going places on his own terms. Still, cycling was his first real escape. He could ride to the beach, to Hollywood, anywhere his legs would take him. It was his first connection to the road, and that feeling never left. The M5 isn’t so different. It’s pure, mechanical, and direct. Feet move rods that open butterflies and push incompressible hydraulic fluid. Hands steer and levers move gear selectors. Like a bike, there are consequences when you push and pull on things. Unlike new cars, with the m5, there's no interference in-between doing, and happening. If his bike is Alex's simplest way to connect with the road, the M5 is the best way to amplify it. Then there’s the question: why does this car exist? Why did BMW take a race-bred engine and stuff it into a 5 Series? When it launched, it was the fastest sedan in the world, a car for those who wanted a family-hauler that could also outrun most sports cars. It was hand-built, absurdly over-engineered, and, in the U.S., available in exactly one color combination: black over beige. Why? Maybe it's that what the Germans thought we deserved, or maybe it was just German pragmatism. While European buyers got a wider range of options, BMW locked American customers into a single spec. No other colors. No manual seat adjustments. Just a black suit over a beige interior, no frills, no distractions. Before the M5, sedans were practical. After the M5, they had to be something more. The super-saloon market was born, and every automaker spent the next decade trying to keep up. Alex’s car isn’t stock anymore. It’s been tweaked, refined, made better. It sits lower, grips harder. It’s carried 212,000 miles of history, across the country, through years of memories, through the hands of his cousin before him. And it’s still here, still moving. Plenty of people have tried to buy it, but he’s not selling. Some things, once they become a part of you, aren’t meant to be let go. Continue...",

    "description": "Toyota is developing a new hybrid engine for its performance sub-brand, Gazoo Racing (GR), which will give its future models a chance to sell in markets with strict emissions regulations. Our sister publication, Autocar UK, reports that the next generation of sports cars from Toyota GR will use a hybrid powertrain based on a new engine that is being tested. New Toyota 2.0-litre turbo-petrol can support plug-in and mild-hybrid setups New hybrid powertrain will be used in motorsport as well New Toyota hybrid powertrain details Based on new 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine The hybrid system is based on the new 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged engine (codenamed G20E), which was tested and showcased in the mid-engined GR Yaris M Concept. The engine can support both plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid setups and features a shorter piston stroke than Toyota’s current engines, making it smaller and lighter. Technical specifications of the engine are yet to be revealed, but we have reported that outputs of over 400hp and 500Nm are expected in the road-going version. In motorsport applications, over 600hp is expected from the G20E engine. Small size and lightweight aid hybridisation Weight is an important factor as a hybrid element can be fitted with minimal penalty, as suggested by Hiroyuki Yamada, a GR engineer working on the project. He added, “We can use hybrid for future cars [which use this engine]. We will use it in our motorsport activities in the future because of emissions. This technology we create will be applied to both motorsport and passenger [car] engines. In the future, we want a more fuel-efficient engine [for GR cars].” The plan to fit GR models with hybrid power has been long mooted by Toyota. In 2023, chief technology officer Hiroki Nakajima told Autocar UK, “Hybrid systems are always a good solution for environmental cars, not just for passenger cars but for sporty cars as well.” New Toyota MR2 could be previewed by M Concept New Toyota MR2 production green-lit in May 2024 As mentioned above, the heavily modified GR Yaris, which Toyota called the M Concept, gets the new G20E engine in its mid-ship and comes with a four-wheel drive system. It should be noted that Toyota states that the M Concept is just a test bed for the new engine. However, given the cost of developing a mid-engine, four-wheel-drive configuration, it is likely to enter production and become the new MR2. In fact, Autocar UK reports that the mid-engined sports car was green-lit for production last May. In terms of design, the all-new MR2 will likely take inspiration from the 2023 FT-Se concept.

    "description": "Last year, Toyota announced that it was developing “ new engines tailored to electrification and the pursuit of carbon neutrality ” in tandem with Mazda and Subaru. While the units would differ immensely from each other, all of them leverage things like electrification and/or alternative fuel types to maximize the efficiency of internal combustion. However, Toyota has let slip that it was actually eyeballing performance applications and that the 2.0-liter turbo was already being tested for use in GR-branded sports cars before moving to the more mainstream models.",
