    "description": "Two years ago, we pit the petrol-automatic versions of the Hyundai Exter and Tata Punch against each other. Then, the Exter had the upper hand thanks to its smoother and more refined powertrain. Today, we revisit this rivalry, but with a twist: both sub-compact SUVs are here in their CNG avatars. While they share several traits, like a dual-cylinder CNG setup, a claimed efficiency of 27km/kg and premium features, including a sunroof, this time, the spotlight is on their real-world efficiency. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG interior and ergonomics  Let’s begin with the Punch. It’s easy to understand why this Tata is among the country’s bestselling cars. The basics are done right – its high-riding stance, wide-opening doors and easy ingress make it especially friendly for elderly passengers. The high seating position offers a commanding view of the road, and the visible bonnet edges further help drivers feel in control. The driving experience is enhanced by light steering, gear shifts that are easy to execute (though not as precise as the Exter’s) and a clutch that doesn’t require much effort. Further, individual front armrests enhance long-distance driving comfort, and a surprisingly impressive audio system adds to its appeal. There’s a lot that the Hyundai Exter CNG and the Tata Punch CNG have in common. Switching over to the Hyundai, it’s clear why it continues to earn praise for its user-friendliness. Every control, from the gearbox to the steering, feels lighter and more polished – just right for urban use. While its seating position isn’t as high as the Punch’s, outward visibility remains excellent, thanks partly to its lower window line. The fit, finish and overall cabin quality are marginally better than the Tata, but the dark, monotone theme doesn’t feel as inviting, and the seats leave a bit to be desired. They feel a little too compact and don’t offer the same level of support as the Punch’s. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG engine and performance  The Punch’s engine performance has never been its strong point, and in its CNG avatar, it feels even more sluggish. While it can keep pace with urban traffic, it begins to struggle when asked for more. The Punch’s real strength lies in its composure at highway speeds; it feels stable and reassuring, which is something it does noticeably better than the Exter. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG specsTata Punch icng Accomplished + sHyundai Exter hy-cng duo SX TechL/W/H3827/1742/1615mm 3815/1710/1631mmWheelbase 2445mm 2450mmBoot capacity 210 litres NAEngine 3cyl, 1199cc Petrol + CNG 4cyl, 1197cc Petrol + CNGPower 73.5hp at 6000rpm 69hp at 6000rpmTorque 103Nm at 3250rpm 95.2Nm at 4000rpmKerb weight 1181kg 1093kg On the move, the Exter feels extremely refined. The 4-cylinder engine is quieter and more eager to rev, and its overall smoothness is hard to ignore. Thanks to shorter gearing and smart engine calibration, you rarely need to shift gears. It pulls cleanly from as low as 1,000rpm, making it ideal for stop-and-go traffic. In our acceleration tests, the Exter Hy-CNG Duo sprinted from 0 to 100kph in 14.85 seconds, a full 3 seconds quicker than the Punch iCNG. Moreover, the Exter is significantly quicker than the Tata when accelerating from 20 to 80kph in the third gear and 40 to 100kph in the fourth. The Exter’s shorter gearing improves drivability but hampers highway efficiency to an extent. On the highway, though, the Exter doesn’t feel as composed as the Punch. There is noticeably more vertical movement over undulations. Also, its engine spins 300rpm higher than the Punch’s, at 3,300rpm, while cruising at 100kph in the top gear. This also explains why its highway efficiency is slightly lower at 30.3km/kg in our test, while the Punch iCNG’s is 31km/kg. However, the Hyundai returned 22.8km/kg in the city because of its better drivability, much higher than Tata’s 20.7km/kg. Both cars delivered an impressive overall average, close to their claimed 27km/kg figure.

We first ran both cars until their CNG tanks were completely empty. After that, we refilled approximately 2 kg of gas in each vehicle and drove them around in real-world conditions within the city until they ran out of CNG. Then, we repeated the procedure and ran them on the highway. Since filling the exact same quantity of gas in each car is nearly impossible, we’ve calculated their efficiency based on the actual distance covered divided by the gas quantity. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG features and safety  For the record, the Tata Punch featured here is the Adventure + mid variant, whereas the Hyundai Exter is in its top-end SX trim. That said, to keep this comparison fair, we’re evaluating both cars based on their respective top-spec versions. Interestingly, Tata offers a broader spread of variants with the Punch iCNG. Its entry-level trims are more affordable than Hyundai’s CNG offerings, though its higher trims are pricier than the Exter. Punch iCNG gets a spare tyre, while the Exter only gets a tyre repair kit. When it comes to features, the Punch iCNG impresses with additions like cruise control and a large 10.25-inch touchscreen, which the Hyundai misses. But the Exter hits back with key safety features such as six airbags, a tyre-pressure monitoring system, hill-start assist and electrically folding mirrors, all of which are absent in the Punch.

That said, the Punch’s boot feels a bit more usable, especially if both cars’ parcel shelves are removed. Moreover, Tata provides a full-size spare tyre, while the Exter makes do with just a tyre repair kit. Tata Punch CNG vs Hyundai Exter CNG verdict  To sum things up, the Tata Punch iCNG is a compelling option for buyers looking for an economical, compact and practical highway cruiser. Its tough build, elevated seating and great audio system add plenty of appeal. Where it falls short is in outright performance and the absence of key safety features like hill-start assist, tyre-pressure monitoring and additional airbags. The Hyundai Exter, on the other hand, is the smoother, more refined and easier-to-drive option in the city. It delivers better fuel efficiency, offers more safety features, and still manages to undercut the Punch on price – despite packing in more equipment overall. It may not lead the sales charts just yet, but it’s the Exter that feels like the better-rounded product, and for that reason, it’s the winner in this comparison.

    "description": "Like its predecessor, the KTM 390 Adventure X undercuts its higher-spec counterpart and aims to deliver 90 percent of the experience at a much more affordable rate. For 2025, this motorcycle is all-new from the ground up, featuring more performance, better features and improved handling for just Rs 11,000 more than the outgoing model. The 390 Adventure X misses out on cruise control.   KTM 390 Adventure X design and quality (7/10) High resolution TFT adds to the appeal of this motorcycle What impressed me was the bright headlight that offers commendable illumination, and it might just be the best in class for now. I’m also happy to see that KTM has equipped this bike with the new TFT and ditched the monotone LCD from the older ‘X’ model. This new screen is vibrant and clear, giving the bike a premium feel. Switchgear quality is also solid, aside from the missing rocker switch for cruise control. The seating posture on the 390 Adventure is upright and commanding   KTM 390 Adventure X riding position and comfort (8/10) The X has the same ergonomics as the 390 Adventure, with a slightly lower seat height Apart from a slightly shorter seat height, the X is identical to the regular 390 Adventure. The posture is upright and commanding yet comfortable. However, the large windscreen isn’t adjustable, so you’re robbed of some of that sweet cooling airflow in this scorching heat at city speeds. Also, the seat remains quite firm, leading to saddle soreness after about an hour or two, which isn’t ideal for long-distance touring. While those shortcomings are worth noting, they’re far from being dealbreakers. The X corners surprsingly well and feels quite planted   KTM 390 Adventure X performance and refinement (8/10) In our tests, the 390 Adventure X managed a 0-100kph time of just 6.04s While this motorcycle packs the same motor as the standard 390 Adventure, it feels a lot more tame and approachable. This is because the X runs on what’s essentially the equivalent of Road Mode on the standard 390 Adventure. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it does make the bike feel rather mellow and un-KTM-like in its performance.  That said, performance is about the same as the standard 390 ADV, and this is the quickest bike in this segment. Despite the alloy wheels, the X can manage mild trails   Another surprise win? Less tyre noise. It was something I noticed on the standard bike, but here, it’s noticeably quieter. One letdown, though, is the quickshifter that requires a fair bit of force to engage and was mostly unusable on our test bike. That said, the X’s light clutch makes shifting manually easy and enjoyable. Moving on to braking, the X performs nearly on par with its counterpart despite missing out on sintered brake pads. Our braking tests showed nearly identical numbers between the two bikes, although the feel at the lever isn’t as good as the standard ADV. Seat height and weight are slightly down by 5mm and 1kg, respectively, which, while not massive, are both changes in the right direction. Unlike the 390 Adventure, the X uses organic brake pads that perform nearly on par   KTM 390 Adventure X ride comfort and handling (8/10) The X's non-adjustable suspension performs better than the higher spec adjustable suspension Despite running non-adjustable suspension and alloy wheels, the X still manages to feel pretty capable off-road. With the same 200mm/205mm wheel travel at both ends, it’ll do nearly all of what the full-spec 390 Adventure can, just with reduced confidence and feedback from the smaller front wheel. In fact, for on-road comfort, both Rishaad and I found ourselves preferring the non-adjustable setup on the X since it felt less fussy and a little more absorptive of poor road surfaces. Graphics and interface make the TFT feel upmarket.   KTM 390 Adventure X features and safety (8/10) Missing list of features aren't dealbreakers in any way The ‘X’ misses out on features like cruise control, riding modes, cornering ABS, adjustable brake and clutch levers, tubeless spoke wheels and an adjustable front fork. Cruise control was the only feature I truly missed and would’ve appreciated. Yes, it makes highway miles easier, but given the cost savings, I can live without it. The 390 Adventure X is considerably more affordable than the standard 390 Adventure.   KTM 390 Adventure X price and verdict (9/10) The ‘X’ costs Rs 77,000 less than the 390 Adventure Given the price difference, the 390 Adventure X makes a very strong case for itself. It delivers almost everything you’d want from the 390 Adventure platform at a pocket-friendly rate. For those skilled enough to push this platform to its limits, KTM still offers the fully specced 390 Adventure and even the Enduro R for hardcore off-road enthusiasts. But if you’re hunting for an affordable, lightweight ADV that punches well above its price tag, the 2025 KTM 390 Adventure X delivers. And if you’re not exactly ‘Ready to Race’, Royal Enfield’s Himalayan costs about the same and offers more all-around usability and comfort, although it feels much bigger and heavier.

    "description": "Spending a prolonged duration of time with a vehicle really brings out the nuances of living with it and paints a more detailed picture of how it will fit into your life. In that regard, the Rizta has fared wonderfully well, but over the past two months, one recurring electronic issue has been dampening its otherwise trouble-free experience. But since I’m the sort to sometimes have my dessert before dinner, we’ll start with the good points.  The first thing is that the charger now comes with an elastic cable that latches into place. Where that helps is that you don’t have the charger’s wires strewn about everywhere any time you need to put something in the boot. It may seem small, but it allows you to neatly store your charger and free up more usable space inside the boot for your other belongings.  Neat little elastic strap locks the charger’s wires into place, making storing it in the boot an easier and neater process. Another neat little touch is the small storage cubby just aft of the big 34-litre boot, where I routinely store my phone, keys and a soft microfibre cloth, which is used every so often to clean the Rizta (blame Mumbai’s incessant construction, road works and the dust they kick up!). Keeping your knick-knacks in this smaller area keeps them from getting tossed about inside the big boot on our woefully bouncy roads, something that is especially useful for our expensive modern electronic devices.  Small cubby allows you to securely store small personal items; it’s especially helpful for modern electronic devices. What puzzles me is that Ather hasn’t given the Rizta an external storage cubby, as I’ve seen on multiple other ICE and electric scooters. There is a lot of space to have one on the front apron, and it would save the user the hassle of opening the boot to store their small items every time they set off. Plenty of space available for an external storage cubby on the front apron, but the Rizta doesn’t get one. But the main issue is that over the past two months, I’ve been experiencing an electronic niggle that puts the Rizta into limp mode without any warning. The display shows nothing out of the ordinary except for the regen braking symbol indicating that it’s turned off. And when this happens, power delivery becomes very dull, and I’m unable to cross 25kph. A faulty connector in one of the sensors means it intermittently goes into limp mode without warning. This issue gets resolved temporarily if I cycle the ignition key, but it’s not an everlasting fix, and it reappears without warning. Upon speaking with Ather’s tech team, we have been informed that this has occurred due to a fault in the connector of one of the sensors, and this is the first time someone has reported this occurrence. This electronic niggle has somewhat dampened my confidence in the scooter, and I have been mindful not to stray outside a 10km radius of my home with the Rizta. We will be giving the scooter to the service team for an overall checkup and to have this issue resolved. Once the Rizta is back with us, the rest of our tenure with it, hopefully, will be trouble-free! Also See: Ather Rizta long term review, 1,200km report Ather Rizta long term review, 700km report",

    "link": "https://www.bikeexif.com/yamaha-xsr900-retro-sportbike",
    "description": "The 90s sportbike revival is in full swing, and custom builders like Marc Bell are setting the pace. A full-time metal fabricator with an unwavering love for retro sportbikes, Marc has built some of the best late-80s and early-90s restomods we’ve seen under the HAXCH Moto banner. If it’s got perfectly proportioned bodywork, a lust-worthy livery, and buckets of retro charm, chances are it’s a HAXCH creation. Marc typically uses period-correct donors, but his latest project breaks the mold. This time, he’s taken a modern machine—a 2023 Yamaha XSR900—and turned it into a snarling, full-fairing homage to the golden age of sportbikes. Dubbed the HAXCH Moto Yamaha XZR900 Thunderbolt, this XSR isn’t a replica of any one classic Yamaha. Instead, it’s an amalgamation of elements from several of Marc’s favorite models, rolled into one.…",

    "description": "One-time microcar maker goes after the Tesla Model Y with a tech-heavy family SUV packing up to 637bhp Let’s get the obvious bits out of the way, then: 2165mm, 1720kg and 576bhp. Those aren’t the headline specs of the new Smart #5 but the differences in maximum length, weight and power between this new five-up family SUV and the diddy Fortwo city car that first bore the Smart badge in 1998.With the third generation of that car – which could fit inside this latest model’s wheelbase with nearly 400mm to spare – now retired and the #5 on its way to dealerships to join the #1 and #3, Smart has completed its transition from a maker of frugal and fun-sized urban runarounds to a purveyor of premium electric SUVs, with a price bracket that spans from £32,000 to a mic-drop £50,000-plus at the top end. We’re not in Hambach any more, Toto.But in this era of Capri crossovers and luxury Lotuses, convention is clearly but a byword for stagnation, and Smart – under the joint stewardship of mother company Mercedes-Benz and Chinese step-parent Geely – is diversifying and expanding its line-up in a bid to carve itself a larger (and vastly more profitable) slice of the pie. This is a company simply adapting its line-up to cater to prevailing market trends, and if that’s not ‘smart’, then what is?",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/m4-cs",
    "description": "Rather than cranking the dial up to 11 as the CSL did, this car aims for a perfect 10 BMW’s recent appetite for extra-special versions of its mainline M cars shows no sign of letting up, and the latest derivative to arrive in the UK is this: the wild-looking M4 CS.This is a model its maker says exists in the “broad space between racetrack experience and soul-stirring road performance”, and there’s certainly evidence to back up that sentiment. The car’s engine, cabin and use of composite materials closely resembles that of the hardcore, Porsche 911 GT3-baiting, rear-drive M4 CSL of 2022, yet here the highly adaptable four-wheel drive system of the regular M4 Competition is retained, as are the back seats that were sacrificed to save 21kg in the track-ready CSL.Garching’s form when it comes to cars like this can be variable, but when it nails the recipe, the results are generally world class, and very special indeed. The previous M4 CS was a success but a qualified one, its honed dynamics not entirely justifying an at times frustratingly spartan cabin. But since then we have also had the M5 CS – a five-star Autocar road test car and, depending on who you ask, perhaps the greatest super-saloon of all time.BMW has never offered cars such as the M4 CS cheaply, and a price the far side of £120,000 will certainly give even M diehards pause for thought, not least because it puts the car into the same airspace as the recent, and very fine, Porsche 911 Carrera GTS. But if this latest CS is as good as we know it could be, it might justify the outlay. Massive performance, handling exploitability and genuine usability in a single package is on the cards.",

    "description": "F1 heads to Monaco this weekend (May 23-25) for round eight of the 2025 world championship. But that’s not all. Motorsport fans are in for a thrilling weekend with the legendary Indy 500 race, MotoGP Silverstone, F2 Monaco and DTM Lausitzring coming up, too. Here’s your complete guide for when and where to tune in from India: 2025 F1 Monaco GP schedule The big talking point for the upcoming Monaco GP is the mandatory two-stop rule, introduced specifically for this race. The change will apply to both wet and dry races, with F1 stating it has been introduced “with the primary intent of improving the sporting spectacle”. Just like it did for Imola, Pirelli will bring its three softest compounds to Monaco. Overtaking is notoriously difficult at the iconic street track, leading to processional races. It remains to be seen if the new rule will spice things up enough. But it should at least avoid a repeat of last year, where a red flag period resulted in most of the grid completing the race without a single pit stop. Oscar Piastri still leads the championship after the Imola GP, but his advantage has been slashed to 13 points over his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. Max Verstappen has also gained ground in the standings after his Imola victory and is now just nine points behind Norris. Where to watch: All F1 Monaco GP sessions will be streamed live on the Fancode and F1 TV apps. 2025 F1 Monaco GP India timingsDateDaySessionTime (IST)May 23FridayFP15pmMay 23FridayFP28:30pmMay 24SaturdayFP34pmMay 24SaturdayQualifying7:30pmMay 25SundayRace6:30pm 2025 F2 Monaco GP schedule Starting position is key at a track like Monaco. So, qualifying will probably be the most important session of the weekend. The F2 field will be split into two groups for this, with the odd-numbered cars in Group A and even-numbered cars in Group B. The championship battle remains tight with Alexander Dunne leading the standings after his Imola race win. Luke Browning is six points behind him in second place, followed by Richard Verschoor, who is a further three points adrift. After a difficult Imola round, India’s Kush Maini is currently 17th in the standings.

So, can it deliver a fifth different race winner in a row? Ducati rider Marc Marquez has won every single sprint race so far this season, but his performance on Sunday has been a lot less consistent, with a couple of high-profile crashes. He currently leads the standings, 22 points ahead of his brother Alex Marquez. Francesco Bagnaia is third overall, 35 points behind Alex. Fabio Quartararo and Yamaha’s form will be another thing to watch out for. Where to watch: All MotoGP Silverstone sessions will be streamed live on Fancode. Fans in India can also catch the live TV broadcast on Eurosport. 2025 MotoGP British GP India timingsDateDaySessionTime (IST)May 23FridayFP14:15pmMay 23FridayPractice8:30pmMay 24SaturdayFP23:40pmMay 24SaturdayQualifying 4:20pmMay 24SaturdaySprint8:30pmMay 25SundayRace5:30pm 2025 Indy 500 schedule Twenty-five-year-old IndyCar rookie Robert Shwartzman took a surprise pole position for this year’s Indy 500. He’s the first rookie to achieve this feat since Teo Fabi back in 1983. What makes this all the more impressive is that this is also his team Prema’s first-ever oval race. The team was at the bottom of the timing sheets at the start of the week but managed to turn around its fortunes in spectacular fashion. Shwartzman will share the front row with two-time Indy 500 winner Takuma Sato (RLL Racing) and Arrow McLaren’s Pato O’Ward. Where to watch: All Indy 500 sessions will be streamed live on the Indycar Live app. An all-access monthly pass for this currently costs Rs 659. 2025 Indy 500 India timingsDateDaySessionTime (IST)May 23FridayFinal Practice8:30pmMay 25SundayRace8:15pm 2025 DTM Lausitzring schedule The DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) sportscar racing series also returns this weekend.

    "description": "Given the enthusiastic response to the Range Rover Ranthambore special edition, JLR is planning another bespoke special edition for India. Speaking to the media, Martin Limpert, JLR’s global managing director, said, “Our Ranthambore edition was well received, and our customers want more India-based specials, so we are planning another, and this one is based on the Himalayas.” Special Edition models add to exclusivity, says the brand Local assembly of Range Rover should make more special editions easier  Details of the Himalayan Edition were not disclosed, but it’s likely to get light paint shades, perhaps white, along with special thematic trim, much like the Ranthambore Edition. For reference, the Ranthambore Edition had a bespoke black finish with contrasting Corinthian Bronze and Anthracite accents, said to be inspired by a tiger’s stripes. Inside, the Caraway and Perlino semi-aniline leather upholstery had embroidery inspired by the stripes on a tiger's spine. JLR made 12 units available, and Limpert says all were sold within the first week. The Range Rover Ranthambore Edition had tiger stripes-inspired aesthetics.    Significance of Special Edition models  “Our customers are very appreciative of these editions, as they add to the exclusivity.” To that effect, the company is also planning to enhance its bespoke services offering, something the local assembly of the Range Rover and the Range Rover Sport should make easier. Limpert also adds that the local assembly was pivotal in JLR’s performance last year. For FY2025, the company registered a 40 percent growth, selling 6,183 units and putting it in the third spot in the luxury segment in India. Within that, the local assembly of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport saw the models' sales grow by 2.5 times.  Also See:  Volkswagen Golf GTI launch on May 26 New Toyota RAV4 revealed with Camry like design cues",
