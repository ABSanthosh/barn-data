Powered by a 6.5-liter V12 linked with a seven-speed ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system, the car is finished in Nero Pegaso over Nero leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip rear differential, carbon-ceramic brakes, a front-axle lift system, 19” and 20” Iperione wheels, bi-xenon headlights, transparent engine cover louvers, a carbon-fiber X-frame, a rearview camera, parking sensors, heated power-adjustable seats, navigation, cruise control, and automatic climate control. This Aventador coupe is offered with a clean Carax report and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. The Aventador was designed by Filippo Perini, and this coupe is finished in Nero Pegaso. Exterior details include a carbon-fiber composite monocoque shell, scissor doors, bi-xenon headlights, transparent engine cover louvers, a rearview camera, parking sensors, and a center-exit exhaust. Forged 19″ and 20″ Iperione wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The car is equipped with a magnetic push-rod suspension and a front-axle suspension lift system, and stopping power is provided by orange-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in Nero leather with white stitching, and carbon-fiber trim accents the interior. Equipment includes cruise control, automatic climate control, and an infotainment system with a 7″ TFT display. The leather-trimmed multi-function steering wheel frames a digital gauge cluster with a central tachometer, a speed readout, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The instrument cluster was replaced in 2024. The mid-mounted 6.5-liter V12 was factory rated at 691 horsepower and 509 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber X-frame was optioned from the factory. The coolant expansion tank and engine harness were replaced in 2021, the exhaust temperature sensor was replaced in 2022, and the battery was replaced in 2024. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential.
