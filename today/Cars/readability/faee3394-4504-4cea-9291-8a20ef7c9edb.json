  "description": "Triumph has revealed the new Tiger Sport 800, which replaces the Tiger 850 Sport in the line-up. A new 798cc, 3-cylinder engine powers the Tiger Sport 800, rated at 115hp and 84Nm of torque, making it more powerful than even the updated Tiger 900 GT. Cruise control, bidirectional quickshifter are standard Three riding modes – Sport, Road and Rain Weighs 214kg, has an 18.6-litre fuel tank Triumph has reinvented its middleweight Tiger Sport model to become even more road-focused with this new 800. This bike rolls on 17-inch wheels at both ends, unlike the 19/17-inch wheels on the 850 Sport. These are shod with sticky sport-touring Michelin Road 5 tyres size 120/70-ZR17 (front) and 180/55-ZR17 (rear). The styling and tyre sizes here are very much in line with the smaller Tiger Sport 660. A 41mm USD fork and monoshock, both supplied by Showa, suspend the perimeter frame of the Tiger Sport 800. The fork can be adjusted for compression and preload, while the monoshock can be tuned for rebound and preload, with a convenient remote adjuster available for the latter.  Braking is handled by Triumph-branded, radially mounted 4-piston calipers mated to 310mm discs at the front and a single piston caliper mated to a 255mm disc at the rear. With its large 18.6-litre tank fully brimmed, the Tiger Sport 800 weighs 214kg, which should give it a decent range on a full tank.  The Tiger Sport 800 isn’t brimming with electronic rider aids, but it's got the basics covered. Three riding modes – Sport, Road, and Rain – are available, along with cruise control, a bidirectional quickshifter, traction control, and dual-channel ABS. The riding aids benefit from the presence of a six-axis IMU, for more precise and lenient intervention. All these functions on the Tiger Sport 800 are controlled via the same display as the Daytona 660 and Tiger Sport 660.    Accessories like a centre stand and colour-matched panniers are available straight from Triumph’s accessory catalogue. Four colours are offered on the Tiger Sport 800 – yellow, blue, black and grey – and the bike will be available internationally March 2025 onwards. An India launch sometime next year or in 2026 is expected, and competitors to the Tiger Sport 800 are the BMW F 900 XR, Ducati Multistrada V2 and the upcoming Kawasaki Versys 1100. The Tiger 850 Sport was priced at Rs 11.95 lakh (ex-showroom, India), so expect the new 800 to find itself in that ballpark upon launch.  Also See: Triumph Speed Twin 900 updated for 2025 Triumph Trident 660 gets more electronics, new colours for 2025",
