  "text": "You already know Chevy’s monster Vette is a record breaker, but how does it really measure up to the Prancing Horse and Raging Bull?2026 Corvette ZR1XChevroletJun 23, 2025 8:00 PM EDTThe Corvette ZR1X breaks new ground, but does it beat out hybrid supercars from the Italians? The Corvette ZR1X is huge news. Its immediate predecessor, the ZR1, had already drawn comparisons to high-dollar and high-performance models from the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini. But with the ZR1X, Corvette encroaches even further into the Italians’ territory, pairing a 1,064-horsepower V8 with an electric motor contributing another 186 horsepower. The question then is how badly, really, is the ZR1X beating out the high-dollar hybrids wearing bull and horse badges? The Corvette’s 1,250 horsepower makes it top dog vs. Lamborghini \u0026 Ferrari Perhaps unsurprisingly, the American comes to the fight packing the most horsepower. The ZR1X churns out 1,250 horsepower courtesy of a twin-turbocharged LT7 V8 working in tandem with a hybrid system lifted from the other hybrid Corvette, the E-Ray. The next highest number, by comparison, is the Ferrari SF90 XX. That car marries a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 with a hybrid system for a total output of 1,016 horsepower. Trailing the competition (if you can call it that) is the Lamborghini Revuelto, which “only” manages 1,001 horsepower from its wicked V12 and a trio of electric motors. Since all three competitors are working more than 1,000 horsepower and all-wheel drive, it makes sense for zero to 60 mph estimates to be insanely fast. What’s also unsurprising is that they’re incredibly close. Car and Driver tested the Revuelto and eked out a 2.2-second zero-to-60 pass. Ferrari’s official estimate for the SF90 XX, the highest-performing model of the SF90, is 2.5 seconds to complete the same deed. GM’s estimate for the Corvette ZR1X is simply “under two seconds.” While that requires testing, even at a somewhat pessimistic two seconds even, the ZR1X is two-tenths quicker than the Lamborghini, the next closest rival. When it comes to top speed, ZR1X is more super than the two Italian supercars. The car’s top speed is an epic 233 mph, which is considerably higher than the Ferrari’s 199 mph and the Lamborghini’s 217 mph. The hybrid Corvette ZR1X remains superior in almost every metric you can find The ZR1X is estimated to weigh around 4,100 pounds, smack dab in the middle of the Ferrari’s estimated 3,800-pound curb weight and the 4,290-pound Lamborghini. All three models leverage insane amounts of carbon fiber and trick aero bits to keep aerodynamics in check. The Vette’s front and rear brake rotors measure a colossal 16.5 inches, 0.4 inches larger than the Revuelto’s front brakes and nearly an inch bigger than the SF90’s 15.6-inch units. There’s one last place where the Corvette ZR1X solidifies its superiority: price. You likely already know the Vette is less pricey than both the Ferrari SF90 XX and the Lamborghini Revuelto, but putting the numbers on paper (er, screen) paints an even more disparate picture. The Revuelto starts around $610,000, an obscenely huge sum. The SF90 XX commands a more egregious $890,000. Chevy hasn’t released ZR1X pricing, but $250,000 seems to be the highest estimate by those in the know. Even at that price, the fastest Vette ever is less than half the cost of its closest rivals. Final thoughts We hate to gush, but the ZR1X outshines all rivals. Ferrari and Lamborghini are the benchmark, but are far from the only ones left blushing. The ZR1X, if GM is to be believed, is quicker than all the Porsche 911 variants and the crown McLaren jewel, the upcoming W1. The latter of which, by the way, requires parting with a ridiculous $2 million. No matter how you look at things, the ZR1X is the current king of performance cars. Bravo, GM.
