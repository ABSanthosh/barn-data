  "text": "The Levitating Cybertruck was quickly sold out from Tesla's online shop, giving way to a price battle on eBay 1 hour ago by Thanos Pappas Tesla has expanded the lineup of Cybertruck-themed lifestyle products with a new sold-out item. The Levitating Cybertruck is a 1/24 scale model of the EV that hovers above a magnetic base. The item was priced at $250, but scalpers already sell it for over double the price on eBay. It looks like Tesla fans have a new object of obsession this holiday season What’s better than owning a Cybertruck? Owning a mini one that floats, of course. Enter the “Levitating Cybertruck,” a desk-sized scale model of the electric truck that hovers mid-air like it’s auditioning for the next sci-fi blockbuster. Yes, it uses magnets. Yes, it’s as absurdly extra as it sounds. And yes, of course, it sold out almost immediately. This 1:24 scale model measures 8.98 inches (228 mm) long and levitates above a 6.14-inch (156 mm) circular magnetic base. Actually, it might look better than the real thing, as there are no wheels, no doors, no awkward panel gaps. Just a sharp, triangular silhouette that screams, “Look at me, I’m futuristic,” without all that pesky functionality getting in the way. More: Is This The Most Cybertrucked Tesla Accessory Ever? The mini Cybertruck features working LED bars on both ends, which you can toggle on or off with a tap of the button on its magnetic base. It’s powered by a Type-C charging cable and AC adapter, but there’s a catch: you’ll need to keep it on a flat, non-metallic surface. Once you’ve mastered the fine art of levitation, the Cybertruck can either hover serenely or rotate—depending on how carefully you place it on the magnet. (Pro tip: don’t sneeze during setup.) Unsurprisingly, this clever little gift idea is already sold out on Tesla’s online shop, though you might want to keep an eye on the official page in case they restock if you’re still interested. But for now, your only option is braving the wilds of eBay, where opportunistic resellers are already cashing in, listing these mini Cybertrucks for anywhere between $449 and a ridiculous $980. For context, Tesla originally sold it for $250. So if you go the resale route, you’ll be paying nearly double (or more) for what is, at the end of the day, just a really fancy desk toy. This kind of resale frenzy is nothing new for Tesla products, which often attract both die-hard fans and scalpers alike. The latter, of course, bank on desirability, and more importantly, scarcity to drive up prices and turn a quick profit. The “Levitating Cybertruck” joins an ever-growing lineup of lifestyle products inspired by Tesla’s electric truck. These include a wind-up racer, an electric ride-on toy for kids (the Cyberquad), the CyberMug, the CyberVessel, the CyberStein, a stealth whistle, and even a Cybertruck-shaped bottle opener. Oh, and let’s not forget the infamous CyberBeer, which judging by the scathing reviews, is better left unopened unless you’re just in it for the novelty.",
