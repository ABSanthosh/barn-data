  "text": "This 1993 Ford F-250 XL SuperCab pickup remained registered in Washington through the selling dealer’s 2024 acquisition and now has 47k miles. It is finished in Vermilion over Dark Charcoal vinyl and powered by a 5.8-liter V8 linked to a five-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a Brahma bed cap, 16″ steel wheels, front disc brakes, an AM/FM radio, a Reliance trailer brake controller, and dual fuel tanks. This F-250 is offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title. The truck is finished in Vermilion (EP) and features a Brahma bed cap with sliding windows and a raised rear section in addition to chrome bumpers, towing mirrors, and side steps. Photographs of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery below. The paint on top of the bed cap is faded. The 16″ steel wheels feature bright hubcaps and are mounted with 235/85 Firestone Transforce HT tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums, with the latter featuring ABS. The front and rear bench seats are trimmed in Dark Charcoal vinyl and accompanied by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and vinyl floor liner. Amenities include a locking glovebox, an AM/FM radio, and a Reliance trailer brake controller. The two-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 47k miles. The 5.8-liter Windsor V8 was factory rated at 210 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The truck is equipped with dual fuel tanks. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage.
