  "text": "Without the right precautions, winter weather can wreak havoc on your car.The best way to protect your car over the snowy season is probably to relocate to Arizona—or at least retire it to a garage-covered hibernation. But short of these ideal solutions, there are still some helpful steps you can take to make winter more bearable for your vehicle and yourself. Here are our top tips on protecting your car over the frosty months ahead.Start with Basic MaintenanceA healthy car is better equipped to withstand winter conditions. Before temperatures plummet, check these key areas:Fluids: Ensure your car’s fluids—especially antifreeze—are at the proper levels. Cold temperatures can also affect your oil’s viscosity, so consult your owner’s manual for recommended winter oil types. Some manufacturers recommend swapping to a thinner oil during cold months.Battery: Car batteries tend to underperform in freezing conditions (just ask an EV driver). Before winter arrives, it's worth checking your car’s battery to ensure it’s fully charged and meets the factory-recommended level of cold cranking amps, an important measurement to guarantee your car has the power to start in the cold.Tires: Cold air reduces tire pressure, which can compromise traction on icy roads. Check your tire pressure regularly and inflate them to the manufacturer’s recommended psi. If you live in a region with heavy snowfall, consider investing in winter tires for added safety. Most experts agree that a two-wheel drive car with a good set of winter tires offers better traction than a four-wheel drive car on all-season tires.The crew of Jams Lawn Care uses GMC Sierra HD pickup trucks to push snow from a winter storm Friday, January 13, 2012, in Bangor, Maine. (Photo by Carl D. Walsh for GMC)Protect the ExteriorWax your carApplying a layer of wax before winter starts creates a protective barrier against road salt and grime. Aim to wax your car once or twice during the season, ensuring the surface is clean beforehand.Anti-icing spraysUse anti-icing sprays on locks, door mechanisms, and even your windshield to prevent ice buildup. Hydrophobic treatments on windows and mirrors can also improve visibility by repelling water before it freezes.Washing your car is important in the wintertimeiStockKeep it cleanWashing your car frequently during winter is crucial to prevent road salt from corroding metal parts. Pay special attention to the undercarriage, where salt can accumulate unnoticed. A car wash with an underbody spray is your best bet for a thorough clean. But, there’s a big caveat here! If you applied an oil-based undercoating to your car (more on this later), you should not be washing the underside of your car until after the winter is over, as the high-pressure water can remove the coating and make the car more susceptible to rust. Invest in a quality car coverIf you don’t have a garage, a good car cover can be a lifesaver. It shields your car from snow, ice, and debris, saving you the hassle of scraping windows or clearing snow off the roof. Modern car covers, like those with superhydrophobic technology, repel water and snow, offering added protection against the elements.To undercoat or not to undercoat?Undercoating is a popular method for shielding your car from road salt, moisture, and corrosion during winter. However, not all undercoatings are created equal, and selecting the right one depends on your needs and how you plan to maintain your car.Oil undercoatingOil-based undercoatings are a practical choice for general rust prevention. They remain fluid, allowing them to penetrate tight spaces and coat wires and harnesses effectively. While they excel at keeping rust at bay, they require reapplication once or twice a year depending on who you ask, making them a higher-maintenance option. An upside to the shorter lifespan is that you can more easily spot rust if it starts developing compared to some other coatings.Waxing your car is also a good way to keep unwanted debris off the paintWax undercoatingFor those seeking a longer-lasting solution, wax-based undercoatings provide a durable layer of protection that can last over five years with proper preparation. These coatings dry to a firm yet flexible finish, offering excellent resistance to corrosion from salt and chemicals. Wax-based products are particularly beneficial for older vehicles with existing rust, as they are self-healing and can fill minor imperfections.Rubberized undercoatingRubberized undercoatings are another popular option, especially for drivers looking for added soundproofing and impact resistance. These coatings form a rubber-like layer that helps protect against water, corrosion, and abrasion while dampening road noise. They are durable, typically lasting three years or more, and can be painted over for a clean, polished look. However, they require meticulous application to prevent moisture entrapment, which could lead to rust rather than prevent it.Choosing the right undercoating involves weighing your car’s needs, the climate you drive in, and your budget. Rubberized coatings generally aren’t recommended for older vehicles, for instance, since they will trap any rust and moisture already present in the undercarriage. While any undercoating can provide valuable protection, proper preparation and application are critical to its effectiveness.Final thoughtsIf you’re anything like me, there are few things more stressful than seeing rust develop on a car (shoutout to my first-generation Miata!). That’s exactly why it's worth taking the time before winter arrives to protect your car, whether that’s moving to a desert or, perhaps more realistically, washing and coating your car—think of it like a gift to your future self come spring.",
