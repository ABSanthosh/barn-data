  "description": "Measuring just under four metres in length, the Skoda Kylaq is the Czech carmaker’s smallest SUV yet and has been conceived with the express intent to woo compact SUV buyers. There’s big rewards for the effort because the compact SUV segment is the fastest growing in the Indian market, making up 30 percent by volume. The Kylaq, in effect, opens Skoda to a whole new buyer base that’s already spoilt for choice with models like the Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV 3XO, Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet. The Kylaq’s job is to deliver everything we like about Skodas in a compact and more affordable package. A caveat first. What you see here is a pre-production model that we’ve experienced at the CoASTT race track in Coimbatore, which explains why it’s covered up on the inside and outside. Skoda doesn’t want you or us to see its baby SUV just as yet. Skoda hasn’t revealed all facts and figures either, so this brief review might come across as sketchy in places. The primary goal of the drive was for Skoda to get feedback on the engine, gearbox and suspension before its signed off for production. Skoda Kylaq name and design First things first, the Kylaq name. Skoda ran a contest across India inviting entries for the name of its new compact SUV. Of the two lakh entries and 20,000 unique names received, Kylaq was selected. Kylaq derives its name from Mount Kailash, which, in Sanskrit, translates to crystal – something the Czech Republic is known for. Onto the way it looks. Even under the garb, it's easy to identify this as a Skoda. There are clean lines all around and frontal lighting will be a clear point of distinction compared to the Kushaq. The Kylaq sports a split headlamp setup with an LED Daytime Running Light arrangement up top and LED projector headlamps lower down. The Skoda grille sits proud on the fascia and lends the front end an imposing look. It's from the sides that you can tell the Kylaq's a sub-4-metre car. Overall length is 3,995mm while the wheelbase measures 2,566mm. For reference, a Kushaq has a 2,651mm wheelbase, so a lot of the length reduction has actually come from between the wheels. Even so, the Kylaq's wheelbase is second only to the Mahindra XUV 3XO in the segment, and that does come with the promise of a good amount of space at the back. The other number of interest is the 189mm ground clearance. It's sufficient, but down on the Tata Nexon's class-best 208mm. Talking specific details at the sides, the Kylaq runs on 17-inch rims and running my hand on the stickering suggests simpler surfacing than what we’ve seen on the Kushaq. Chunky door handles make a good point of contact and I’m happy to report that the solid thunk we’ve come to associate with Skoda's doors has been retained. A chunky C-pillar lends solidity to the design, but what is a clear distinction to the Kushaq are the tail-lamps. The lights are smaller but their squared-out effect works with the clean styling theme. Of the other things, the tailgate is wide and extends fairly low, so loading/unloading luggage should be convenient. Skoda insiders hint that luggage space could be best-in-class, but that's something we'll know only once its final homologated figures are out. Skoda Kylaq interior, features and safety My lips are sealed on the matter of space at the back and, sadly, I can’t tell you much about the rest of the interior either. It was covered in different kinds of materials to hide it from view. But what I can tell you is that the Skoda Kylaq will not only come with ventilation for both seats but also a first-in-class power adjust for both front seats. Under the skin, the Kylaq is closely related to the Kushaq. It's built on the same MQB A0 IN platform and that’s a good thing because the platform has been tested for the highest safety standards. The Kushaq and Slavia, if you recall, are both 5-star Global NCAP-rated cars and Skoda is aiming for that with the Kylaq as well. As standard, the Kylaq will get six airbags, ABS, ESC as well as ISOFIX child seat mounts for the rear seats. Skoda Kylaq engine and performance On to the heart of the matter. The Skoda Kylaq will be a petrol-only model and will be offered with the familiar 1.0 TSI engine from the Volkswagen Group. This three-cylinder, direct-injection, turbo petrol makes 115hp and 178Nm, which are pretty good figures for this class of car. We know the engine from the Skoda Kushaq and Slavia, and the Volkswagen Polo, Taigun and Virtus. And as on its other applications, it’s a very likeable unit here too. It’s an engine with a good degree of fun built into it. The mid-range is punchy and you can also rev the engine happily and heartily. The engine does get thrummy but never obtrusively so. Performance in town and at low speeds is something we can comment on only when we get the Kylaq outside the confines of a racetrack. The Kylaq will be available with two gearboxes. The standard fit 6-speed manual is sporty but I did find clutch travel to be a bit long. For those who don’t want the bother of a clutch altogether, there will be the option of a 6-speed torque converter automatic. It’s a nice gearbox and you can have fun with manual gearshifts via the gear selector too. Skoda Kylaq ride and handling Skoda’s choice of a race track as the venue (pun not intended) for the Kylaq drive might seem unusual, but it did pay off to highlight one of the SUV’s strengths – handling. The Kylaq will be a compact SUV of interest for those who enjoy driving. It’s smooth around the corners, holds triple-digit speeds with confidence and feels maneuverable even in tight turns (we also drove on a go-kart track). It’s got a more measured steering and the setup feels softer than the Kushaq (especially at the back). Overall though, it's more predictable and novice-friendly. In fact, the grip and poise only highlighted the chassis’ competence to accept a more powerful engine. Skoda, maybe a Kylaq RS with the 150hp, 1.5 TSI engine should be added to the to-do list. Of the other takeaways from the track experience was that the Kylaq drives like a proper VW Group car. It feels stable and surefooted at all times. Simulating a panic stop from 80kph also revealed that the Kylaq remains composed and can track true to its intended line. An area where the Kylaq improves on the Kushaq is ride comfort. On a broken stretch of road on the race track’s periphery, the Kylaq felt more absorbent than a Kushaq would. There’s less of the surface that makes it inside, addressing one of the complaints we’ve had on the Kushaq. Skoda Kylaq fuel economy, expected pricing and launch timeline There's no word on fuel economy for the moment and prices will also be revealed only at the Kylaq's launch in 2025. However, Skoda has hinted at a competitive price tag within this segment. Our estimate is that the Kylaq range will start around Rs 8.5 lakh (ex-showroom) with the fully loaded automatic versions coming in around Rs 14.5 lakh. At these prices, the Kylaq will not only go head-to-head with other compact SUVs but also eat into the Kushaq 1.0 TSI's sales. Pricing aside, Skoda says total cost of ownership, which includes service and maintenance costs, will also be competitive. The Skoda Kylaq will be revealed in full on November 6, 2024 and will go on sale between January and March 2025. It’s still some time from production so what we see might not be what we get. Sure, styling will not change but some tweaks to the suspension, engine and gearbox could be expected. But, first impressions are very positive. This could be a model that really brings the numbers to Skoda and takes the competition to established players in the compact SUV segment. My suggestion? Don't buy your next compact SUV without giving the Kylaq a shot. Also see: Skoda Kylaq prototype video review Skoda Kylaq image gallery",

Sure, styling will not change but some tweaks to the suspension, engine and gearbox could be expected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBut, first impressions are very positive. This could be a model that really brings the numbers to Skoda and takes the competition to established players in the compact SUV segment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMy suggestion? Don\u0026#39;t buy your next compact SUV without giving the Kylaq a shot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-video-reviews/skoda-kylaq-prototype-video-review-433221\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSkoda Kylaq prototype video review\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/auto-images/skoda-kylaq-image-gallery-433220\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSkoda Kylaq image gallery\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-433219\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-433219\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-433219\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-433219\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-433219\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-433219\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
