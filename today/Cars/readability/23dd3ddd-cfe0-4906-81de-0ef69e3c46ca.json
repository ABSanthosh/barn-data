  "text": "Future electric Honda models target a more emotional driving experience with the help of technology 13 hours ago by Brad Anderson Honda’s 0 Series EVs will use artificial sounds and seat vibrations to recreate the driving feel of classic ICE vehicles. The e prototype offers simulated exhaust sounds from classic models like the S2000, NSX-R, and even the Honda Jet. The company may sell exclusive EV soundtracks, transforming nostalgia for iconic models into a new revenue opportunity. Honda is a little behind some of its competitors in the world of battery-electric vehicles, but it’s hard at work on an all-new range of EVs, known as the 0 Series. These models will be inspired by the Saloon concept unveiled at the start of the year and will come equipped with features like artificial sounds, and even vibrations to simulate the feel of driving an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. Software is playing an increasingly important role in the world of EVs and will be crucial to help differentiate one EV from another. After all, it’s easier to distinguish between a car with a four-cylinder engine and one with a V10 than it is to make one electric powertrain unique from another. Honda recently invited members of the press to Japan to test an early 0 Series prototype. During the visit, journalists also had the opportunity to play around with a special version of the Honda e. Read: Honda Lays Out Ambitious 0 Series EV Plans, Confirms CES 2025 Concept According to Car \u0026 Driver, the Honda e prototype featured a function allowing it to sound like various Honda performance icons, including the S2000, FL5 Civic Type R, NSX Type S, and the original NSX-R. It even had the option of a soundtrack to mimic the Honda Jet as well as two locked options, one of which was for a Honda CRX, and the other was for a Honda-powered Formula 1 car. The publication noted that the various options didn’t just mimic the respective exhaust notes of these Honda icons, but also used a system to vibrate the driver’s seat. It also changed the digital instrument cluster to show gauges that look just like those of the original car. Plenty of other EVs feature fake soundtracks aimed at providing some extra excitement. The most obvious example is the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N which includes a mode to imitate the snap, crack, and pops of N’s combustion cars. This isn’t the only function that Honda engineers seem to have taken inspiration from. Like the Hyundai, the Honda e prototype’s paddle shifters—originally designed to adjust brake regeneration—can now be repurposed to shift through simulated gears, adding a layer of engagement to the driving experience. Though the journalists weren’t able to test this feature firsthand, it’s noted that the simulated gearing will vary depending on which car profile is selected, making each option feel more authentic to its real-life counterpart. As previously mentioned, the sound profiles for the CRX and Formula 1 car were locked during the test. According to the vice president of Honda’s electrification strategy unit, the company is considering whether it can monetize features like these. In other words, Honda is exploring the possibility of selling certain “premium” functions to customers If there’s one thing Honda seems to understand well, it’s that nostalgia and novelty have always had a price.",
