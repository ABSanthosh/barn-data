  "description": "Skoda India will announce the pricing of all variants of the Kylaq compact SUV on December 2, 2024. The Czech brand had announced the starting price of the Kylaq – Rs 7.89 lakh (ex-showroom) – a few days ago. Skoda India will also start accepting bookings for the Kylaq on the same day. Kylaq prices start at Rs 7.89 lakh Gets four trims, two gearbox options The Kylaq is Skoda India’s smallest SUV and is its most important product as it marks the carmaker's entry into the hotly contested compact SUV segment. Skoda surprised the market with a shocking Rs 7.89 lakh starting price, and sources tell us that prices for the other variants are expected to be competitive as well. The Kylaq will be offered in four trims – Classic, Signature, Signature+ and Prestige. The heavily localised Kylaq has a lot in common with the Kushaq, which has helped Skoda price it competitively. What’s more, dealer sources tell us that the Kylaq will get an automatic gearbox option on all trims. As for equipment, all trims are decently loaded with a good mix of creature comforts and safety features. You can read more about it here.  The Kylaq will come with a sole 115hp, 178Nm 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine mated to either a 6-speed torque converter automatic or a 6-speed manual, with a claimed 0-100kph time of around 10.5 seconds. Key rivals to the Kylaq include the Mahindra XUV 3XO, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet and the Tata Nexon.
