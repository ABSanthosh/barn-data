  "text": "If you're desperate or dumb, you can charge at a snail's pace with a Tesla Supercharger July 22, 2025 at 21:00 by Michael Gauthier The Lucid Air will gain access to Tesla’s Supercharger network later this month. Owners shouldn’t use it as access requires a $220 adaptor and charges at 50 kW. Lucid also introduced the 2026 Air, which features more range in Touring guise. The Lucid Gravity is the brand’s white knight, but the Air is rolling into 2026 with a handful of updates. The biggest is access to the Tesla Supercharger network, although you’d have to be dumb or desperate to use it. While that sounds odd, let us explain. Starting on July 31, Air owners can use a $220 NACS adapter to gain access to more than 23,500 Tesla Superchargers. That seems fantastic, but the Air is only capable of charging at speeds up to 50 kW. This means it could take up to an hour to gain 200 miles (322 km) of range. More: Lucid Air Drivers Will Soon Be Passengers In Their Own Cars That’s ridiculous for a ‘fast charger’ and you’d be far better off using a traditional CCS charging station. Depending on the trim, the Air supports a DC CCS fast charging capability of up to 300 kW and that’s six times higher than at a Tesla Supercharger. Despite being terrible, Lucid’s Emad Dlala claimed “Access to the Tesla Supercharging network … is yet another major milestone.” However, if there are other alternatives, you should avoid Superchargers like the plague. Besides Supercharger access, the 2026 Air Pure comes with an improved air conditioning compressor from the Gravity. It promises improved cooling as well as quieter operation. Buyers will also find a newly standard Lucid Mobile Charging Cable Kit and optional 19-inch Aeronaut wheels, which are available in Platinum or Stealth. The Comfort and Convenience Package has also been updated to include a rear center console display and storage bin. The $79,900 Air Touring builds on that and features higher density battery cells. They help to increase the EPA-estimated range over 6% to 431 miles (694 km). Last but not least, the Air Grand Touring now comes standard with 20-way power front seats with heating, ventilation, and massage functions. Lucid said they “make road trips in the industry’s longest range electric vehicle, at up to 512 miles (824 km) of EPA-estimated range, even more comfortable and relaxing.” 2026 Lucid Air Pricing",
