Bavaria’s super wagon is sharing the spotlight with the new M2 CS, dressed to impress in Individual Velvet Blue. The company’s UK branch is taking us on a tour of the meanest G87 (so far) to show what’s changed over a regular model.The carbon ducktail spoiler isn’t the only modification BMW has made to the body, as the front splitter is also exclusive to the M2 CS. Unlike the F87-generation car, which featured a carbon fiber splitter, this one is made from a combination of plastic and rubber. Why? According to Dirk Häcker, head of engineering at M, it’s not a cost-cutting measure. The new splitter’s construction is a result of the car’s lower nose, which makes it more susceptible to scraping on uneven roads.While some other CS-badged cars offered buyers a choice of different wheel finishes, that’s not the case here. The M2 Competition Sport comes only with matte Gold Bronze forged alloys. Fitted with Pirelli P Zero Trofeo RS tires, the M2 CS is the fastest compact car around the Nürburgring.Unlike its predecessor, which came with a manual gearbox, the new model is an automatic-only affair. The six-speed manual wouldn’t have been able to handle the extra power delivered by the upgraded S58 engine. The eight-speed Steptronic’s gear lever is situated within a carbon fiber center tunnel, which isn’t available on a standard M2. The carbon fiber bucket seats, optional on the regular car, are standard on the CS. BMW includes an Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel with a flat-bottom design, but charges extra for a heated version.Since the Goodwood FoS takes place in the UK, it’s worth noting the M2 CS costs £92,475 locally. That’s nearly £24,000 more than the base version, enough to buy a new MINI Cooper 3-Door with the difference. The price gap is partially justified by the additional standard equipment and extra power. Still, it’s a massive premium that many will find hard to justify, especially given the lack of a manual option.Against all odds, the M2 CS is already proving to be a commercial hit. Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President of Customer, Brand, and Sales at M, told us there’s “huge demand.” For some markets, BMW has allocated a significant number of extra build slots. At the time of writing, the United States is the leading region in terms of sales, followed by Germany and China.Source: BMW UK / YouTube",
