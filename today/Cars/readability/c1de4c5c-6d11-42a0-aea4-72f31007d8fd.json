Power is derived from a Roush Performance 427R V8, which is linked with a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and an 8.8″ Ford independent rear axle. Additional details include 15″ Halibrand-style wheels, disc brakes, a Kenwood head unit, quick-jack bumperettes, LED headlights, a single roll hoop, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and side-exit exhaust pipes with perforated heat shields. This Cobra replica is now offered on dealer consignment with service records, build documents, and a California title. The fiberglass bodywork is finished in metallic red with white center stripes, and exterior details include quick-jack bumperettes, LED headlights, a hood scoop, fender vents, wind wings, a left side-view mirror, a single roll hoop, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and side-exit exhaust pipes with perforated heat shields. The 15″ Halibrand-style American Racing wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires. The car is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering and independent suspension. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel discs. The cockpit is trimmed in black leather with deviated stitching and plaid inserts. A Kenwood head unit is mounted in the backrest, and additional interior elements include a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror, tinted sunvisors, seat grommets, and lap timers. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of AutoMeter instrumentation that consists of a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, oil temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 11k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. Matching luggage is secured in the trunk by red leather straps. The front-hinged hood opens to reveal a Roush Performance 427R V8 fitted with an Edelbrock intake manifold, a four-barrel carburetor, and tubular exhaust headers. The carburetor and spark plug wires were replaced in August 2021, the spark plugs were replaced in February 2023, the radiator was replaced in March 2023, and the fuel pump was replaced in June 2023. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and an 8.8″ Ford independent rear axle. The vehicle has not been inspected by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair or Air Resources Board and is titled as a 2021 model year; it cannot be sold to an in-state private party buyer. There is currently a lien on the car, and the current owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the winning bidder. The selling dealer states that the car is registered as Planned Non-Operation in the state of California. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
