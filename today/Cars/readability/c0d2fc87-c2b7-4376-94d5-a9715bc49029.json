Harley-Davidson has recently changed CEOs, KTM’s future plans depend on the day of the week, and the USA’s dynamic tarrif situation has left dealers scrambling. If you were considering purchasing a new motorcycle this year, your patience may be wavering. While the new market might frustrate buyers, there’s a robust offering of used customs currently for sale across the world—so we’ve rounded up five bikes from the Bike EXIF Classifieds that we’d be proud to own. Whether you’re looking to turn heads at a show or carve corners on your favorite backroad, these machines prove that the best bikes aren’t always found in a dealership showroom. From showpiece to street, your next dream ride might already be waiting—crafted, curated, and ready to roll. 1983 Yamaha XV920 Virago by Michal Szymanski This 1983 Yamaha XV920 Midnight Virago, custom-built by acclaimed craftsman Michal Szymanski, is a show-winning blend of art and engineering with just 30 miles since its full rebuild. A familiar face in the custom motorcycle scene, this bike has earned accolades at top-tier events including The Handbuilt Show, The One Moto Show, and The Quail Motorcycle Gathering—where it was awarded the prestigious Spirit of the Quail award. Michal started with a full overhaul of the 920 cc V-twin engine, upgrading it along the way with a performance Mukuni TM40 carburetor, a second-gen Virago starter system, and charging system components from Ricks Motorsport. Michal then rewired the bike from tip to tail with a full suite of Motogadget parts, including a mo.unit blue controller and turn signals. Performance and design go hand in hand with a modernized chassis, including a custom rear subframe and a completely rebuilt 2007 Yamaha R6 front end with radial brakes and clip-ons, delivering modern handling and stopping power. A Koso TNT 04 multifunction gauge monitors critical functions, housed in a handmade top yoke. Hand-engraved floral details throughout the build elevate its artistic value, making it not just a high-performance machine but a rolling work of art. With over 65 hp, a five-speed transmission, a Hagon rear shock, and one-of-a-kind craftsmanship, this Virago is ideal for collectors, showgoers, or riders seeking a refined, ridable custom with pedigree. 2016 BMW R NineT by Vagabund Moto The 2016 BMW R nineT ‘Tin Man’ by Vagabund Moto is a groundbreaking custom build that seamlessly merges classic BMW engineering with avant-garde design and cutting-edge fabrication. With just 5,000 km on the odometer, this Graz-based masterpiece draws inspiration from Vagabund’s earlier creation, ‘The Whale,’ pushing the envelope even further through its fully handmade aluminum monocoque body. Designed in collaboration with renowned metal shaper Bernard Naumann, the streamlined bodywork integrates a fuel tank, seat pan, and storage in a single flowing form. It’s opened via a remote-controlled, gas-dampened hinge system, revealing high-end electronics that include a Motogadget dash beneath a smoked acrylic panel. Every inch of ‘Tin Man’ reflects uncompromising attention to detail—from the ceramic-coated custom exhaust and Rotobox carbon fiber wheels, to the Messner Moto CNC-machined triple clamp and handmade LED lighting that’s seamlessly integrated into the bodywork. The minimalist Selenite Grey Magno paint with clear-coated inner layers emphasizes the sculptural elegance of the design. Despite its futuristic appearance, the bike retains its OEM drivetrain, ensuring reliability, while radically transforming the visual and tactile experience. A true fusion of art, engineering, and imagination, ‘Tin Man’ stands as one of the most visionary interpretations of the R nineT platform to date. [More] 1979 BMW R65 By Henne Company This fully reimagined 1979 BMW R65 café racer by Henne Company is a striking fusion of vintage soul and modern engineering, with just 50 miles on the clock since its comprehensive rebuild. At its core is a revitalized 649 cc opposed-twin engine, equipped with dual Bing carburetors, an Elektronik Sachse digital ignition, and an EnDuraLast 450-watt charging system. A custom stainless steel two-into-one exhaust adds both performance and a sharp auditory edge. Aesthetically refined, yet performance-driven, this R65 features a relocated seat and tank configuration, using a sleek gray R100-style aluminum tank and a leather and Alcantara-trimmed solo seat. The frame and fork tubes are powder-coated black, and the suspension is modernized with adjustable YSS rear shocks and lowered forks with Progressive springs. Additional premium upgrades include clip-on handlebars, bar-end mirrors, LED lighting, rear-set foot controls, and a full Motogadget mo.unit blue electrical system. Built in collaboration with WalzWerk and finished to exacting standards, this unique R65 is a timeless café racer with character, craftsmanship, and serious road presence. 1982 Honda CB900F By NCT Motorcycles This 1982 Honda CB900F is the result of NCT Motorcycles‘ quest to modernize a 40-year-old machine, making it a contender against modern sportbikes. With just 250 km since its full rebuild, this bespoke machine houses a 980 cc HRC-spec engine producing approximately 130 hp, thanks to extensive internal upgrades including forged pistons and rods, a lightened crankshaft, racing cams, and Keihin CR ITBs. A stainless steel four-into-one exhaust system with an Akrapovič end can completes the performance package. The reworked frame is paired with high-end components sourced from a Ducati Monster 1100 EVO (rear shock, wheels, and single-sided swingarm), plus Brembo brakes and Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa tires for exceptional control and handling. Beyond its performance, the CB900F showcases masterful craftsmanship with hand-formed aluminum bodywork created in collaboration with ER Motorcycles, including a one-off fuel tank and monocoque-style tail. Over 200 hours were invested in metal shaping alone, while a race-style milled gas cap and 3D-printed headlight nacelle add futuristic touches. Motogadget electronics, LED lighting, Spiegler brake lines, LSL clip-ons, and a Lamborghini Urus-inspired custom seat reflect a no-compromise approach to detail. A true collector-grade machine, this NCT build delivers modern superbike performance wrapped in timeless café racer styling. [More] 2017 Indian Scout By Keino Cycles This 2017 Indian Scout Custom is a striking one-off creation by legendary builder Keino Sasaki of Keino Cycles, commissioned by Indian Motorcycle to showcase the Scout’s untapped design potential. With under 100 miles on the odometer, this masterfully reimagined machine fuses the raw spirit of the original Scout with aerodynamic neo-retro design. While the Scout’s engine, transmission, EFI system, and front end remain untouched for reliability, Keino’s artistry is evident in every custom detail—from the hand-laced, powder-coated wheels and halogen lighting, to the handcrafted aluminum bodywork and bespoke seat. The braking system, developed in collaboration with Beringer, includes an innovative in-hub front disc brake—a standout engineering feature. The result is a dramatic departure from the factory bobber aesthetic, refined into a sleek, café racer-inspired showpiece that has been featured in prominent magazines, exhibitions, and motorcycle shows across the country. More than just a promotional build, this Indian Scout custom is a rare fusion of performance and visionary craftsmanship—rideable, collectible, and unforgettable.
