  "text": "What’s old is new again as automakers continue to breathe fresh life into classic models and long-forgotten brands November 9, 2024 at 19:10 by Michael Gauthier Retro-inspired models continue to make a splash as Scout recently introduced the Terra and Traveler. They follow other old school throwbacks including the Ford Bronco and Volkswagen ID. Buzz. The trend of retro designs isn’t new, as similar models were introduced in the 1990s and 2000s. Scout Motors recently introduced the Terra and Traveler, but they’re far from the first retro-inspired throwbacks. Quite the opposite, as we’re in the midst of a new wave of old-school revival. For starters, Scout’s parent company, Volkswagen, has the ID.Buzz, which draws inspiration from the Type 2 Microbus. Americans have also jumped in on the action as Ford brought back the Bronco, while GMC revived Hummer as a series of electric off-roaders. On the other side of the Atlantic, Land Rover launched a new Defender. Not to be outdone, Japan responded with a new Land Cruiser. Meanwhile, in Europe, Renault just recently reinvented two of its most popular classics, the 4 and 5, transforming them into practical, everyday electric cars. Retro revivals are far from new. The 1990s and early 2000s saw a smorgasbord of retro projects, some of which were more successful than others. Among the highlights—and occasional lowlights—were the Chrysler/Plymouth Prowler, which offered a wild, futuristic take on the roadster, and the PT Cruiser, which divided opinion with its quirky, retro-inspired design. More: 7 Details You Might’ve Missed From The New Scout Terra And Traveler Chevrolet also threw its hat in the ring with the SSR, a pickup truck that wore a hot rod’s personality on its sleeve, while the HHR aimed to capture the retro appeal of the classic Chevrolet Suburban with its own unique twist. Then there was Volkswagen’s New Beetle, which resurrected one of the most iconic cars of all time, albeit with a modern touch that arguably strayed far from the original’s simplicity. Fiat revived the 500, staying much closer to the essence of the classic design. BMW, too, got in on the action with its relaunch of the Mini and even Toyota offered the Hilux-based Classic. The latter was launched in 1996 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Model AA. Review: VW ID.Buzz Is The Coolest Minivan On The Block, But There’s A Catch That brings us to our question of the day: which model is the best retro revival? There’s no shortage of contenders, each with its own own merits, but Mini deserves a lot of credit for what they’ve been able to accomplish over the past two decades re-imagining a timeless classic. However, Ford might be the real winner here, as the Bronco captures the essence of the original and has undisputed appeal. The same can be said about the Defender, although perhaps to a slightly lesser extent. With all that in mind, which old-school throwback floats your boat? Head to the comments section and let us know which revival you think reigns supreme.",
