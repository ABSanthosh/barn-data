  "description": "Aston Martin, Hyundai and MG are among the brands making a splash at this year's Festival of Speed The Goodwood Festival of Speed (10-13 July) is taking place this week and looks set to be one of the highlights of the motoring year. It will host big reveals from Lanzante, Hyundai, MG and plenty more besides, as well as an array of debuts from Aston Martin, BMW and Honda. Below is our guide to the most important cars at this year's Festival of Speed. Automobili Mignatta Rina This Italian two-seater pays tribute to the sports cars of the 1960s with a striking speedster body, naturally aspirated 5.0-litre V8 and a manual gearbox.  Everything you need to know about the AM Rina Aston Martin DBX S This new performance-focused version of Aston’s luxury SUV outpunches the Ferrari Purosangue, putting out a substantial 717bhp. You'll be able to see it in the First Glance paddock at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin DBX S Aston Martin Valhalla The Festival of Speed will be your first chance to catch Aston Martin’s new 1064bhp hypercar rolling on home turf. Production of the Valhalla is scheduled to begin imminently. Everything you need to know about the Aston Martin Valhalla BMW M2 CS BMW’s junior sports car gets the Competition Sport treatment, gaining 50bhp more than the regular M2 and packing a generous 479lb ft. An abundance of carbonfibre also helps to reduce its kerb weight to 1700kg and it dispatches 0-62mph in just 3.8sec. Goodwood will mark the first time it’s been displayed to the public in the UK. Customer deliveries will start at the end of the summer. Everything you need to know about the BMW M2 CS BMW Concept Speedtop Last year’s striking Skytop convertible has been transformed into a svelte shooting brake for a lucky handful of BMW loyalists. It has been conceived as an “intentional counterpoint to our current models”, according to BMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk, and is set to make limited production. This may be your only chance to catch one in the metal before they disappear into collections. Everything you need to know about the BMW Concept Speedtop BMW Vision Driving Experience Four motors, five downforce-producing fans and 13,269lb ft of torque: the Vision Driving Experience is BMW’s manifesto for driving enjoyment in the electric age. The firm's performance machines will still be rear-biased, for example, and they will use control electronics that can respond 10 times more quickly than those fitted to previous-generation M cars. This car will make its first UK appearance at the Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the BMW Vision Driving Experience Denza B5  BYD's premium offshoot is going after the Land Rover Defender with the new B5, a body-on-frame 4x4 with a 677bhp plug-in-hybrid powertrain. It will make its debut at the Festival of Speed, ahead of sales beginning next year. Everything you need to know about the Denza B5 Denza Z9 GT The first Denza model to arrive in Europe, the Z9 GT rivals the Porsche Panamera and its electric counterpart, the Taycan. It is available with the choice of an 858bhp plug-in hybrid powertrain or a 952bhp battery-electric set-up.  Read our Denza Z9 GT review Eccentrica Diablo restomod Described by its maker as the ultimate Diablo, this restomod intends to unleash the potential of Lamborghini’s famously tetchy flagship. Its chassis has been reinforced with carbonfibre, the brakes overhauled, traction control added and the V12 tweaked with new camshafts and springs. It has also received a redesign, with ‘pop-down’ headlights, flared wings and exposed exhaust pipes. It will take to the Goodwood hillclimb, marking the first time it will have been seen in action. Ferrari 296 Speciale Billed by Ferrari as the \"most fun-to-drive, emotionally charged\" car it has built to date, the 296 Speciale brings a swathe of upgrades compared with the existing GTB. Power is up by 49bhp, downforce is improved by 20% and it's 60kg lighter than the GTB. That's thanks in part to kit taken from the new F80 hypercar, such as its aluminium pistons and titanium conrods. The Festival of Speed marks your first chance to see one in the UK. Everything you need to know about the Ferrari 296 Speciale Ferrari Amalfi The new Amalfi replaces the Roma, bringing a fresh design and the promise of more accessible performance. It will break cover in public for the first time at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Ferrari Amalfi Ferrari F80 The LaFerrari's successor is virtually a Le Mans hypercar for the road, taking components from the marque's 499P racer to put out 1184bhp. Priced from £3 million and limited to 799 examples – all sold – it will run up the Goodwood hillclimb course. Everything you need to know about the Ferrari F80 GMA T33 Gordon Murray previously used the Goodwood Members’ Meeting to unveil the T33, but now is the general public’s chance to see it in the metal. Priced from £1.37 million and positioned as a more practical foil to the T50, it too packs a naturally aspirated V12, here kicking out 607bhp and revving out to 11,100rpm. Just 100 will be built, although there will be spin-off models, such as a Spider and a more aggressive, track-focused S variant. Everything you need to know about the GMA T33 GMA T33 Spider Weighing just 18kg more than its coupé counterpart, the T33 Spider promises a more visceral experience, thanks to its Targa-style roof and air intake scoop positioned just proud of the roll bar. It will be on display to the general public for the first time at this year’s Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the GMA T33 Spider Honda 0 Series SUV This blocky MPV-like SUV serves as our first look at Honda’s rebirth for the electric age. Named the 0 Series to represent the brand starting afresh, it ushers in a dramatic new look and promises major developments in both efficiency and practicality. The Festival of Speed will mark its first appearance in Europe. Everything you need to know about the Honda 0 Series SUV Honda Civic Type R Ultimate One of our favourite hot hatches is about to bow out, but not before receiving a special-edition variant commemorating its 28-year production run. It’s painted in the Type R’s signature Championship White shade, with contrasting red racing stripes recalling its trademark interior colour. Only 40 will be built, of which a quarter are bound for the UK. Goodwood may just be your best chance to see one before they’re all gone. Everything you need to know about the Honda Civic Type R Ultimate Honda Prelude Honda’s sporting coupé returns with Civic underpinnings, a 181bhp hybrid powertrain and even a simulated sequential gearbox. The production car isn’t due until later this year, but Goodwood will be the first chance to spot it on the move, as it takes to the hillclimb. Everything you need to know about the Honda Prelude Honda Super EV Concept Honda will unveil its vision of a small, fun-to-drive EV at the Festival of Speed. Named the Super EV Concept, it previews a rival for the Hyundai Inster and Fiat 500e, and has already been tested in the UK.  Everything you need to know about the Honda Super EV Concept Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Hyundai will at last reveal the hot Ioniq 6 N at this year’s Festival of Speed, having hinted at the model since it unveiled the RN22e concept car three years ago. The car will bring major styling tweaks such as a huge rear spoiler, wider arches and a more aggressive-looking front fascia and it is likely to use the same 641bhp powertrain as the existing Ioniq 5 N. Everything you need to know about the Hyundai Ioniq 6 N Jaecoo 5 This Range Rover Evoque rival will be the second car in Jaecoo's UK line-up, bringing a 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine. Full technical details be revealed at the Festival of Speed, where the 5 will make its debut. Everything you need to know about the Jaecoo 5 Land Rover Defender Trophy Edition This special-edition Defender harks back to Land Rover’s Camel Trophy 4x4s, with chunky steelie-style wheels, a choice of Sandy Yellow or Forest Green paintwork and even the option of an intake snorkel. It will be seen in public for the first time at Goodwood. Everything you need to know about the Land Rover Defender Trophy Edition Lanzante 95-59 Petersfield-based hypercar specialist Lanzante will reveal its first bespoke model at the Festival of Speed. Based on an existing McLaren platform and penned by former McLaren designer Paul Howse, it will pack 700bhp per tonne and a McLaren F1-style three-seat cockpit. Everything you need to know about the Lanzante 95-59 Maserati launch Maserati will make a \"highly anticipated world debut\" at the Festival of Speed. It has yet to confirm what it will unveil but a preview image appears to show the rear haunch of an MC20, suggesting it may be a new variant of its V6-powered supercar.  McLaren W1 McLaren's striking new flagship picks up the mantle from the P1 and F1 with an electrified 4.0-litre V8 that sends 1258bhp to its rear wheels. Just 399 examples will be built. Everything you need to know about the McLaren W1 MG Cyberster Black This special-edition roadster matches deep-black paintwork with chrome accents. Read our MG Cyberster review MG CyberX A boxy 4x4, this radical concept car hints at MG’s plans to expand into new segments and punch upmarket. The Festival of Speed will host its European debut and could bring more news about any plans to build the model. Everything we know about the MG CyberX MG/IM IM6 MG will reveal a new model at Goodwood and it looks to be one of several models from Audi-rivalling sibling brand IM. Their arrival in the UK would mark a shift in MG’s strategy, boldly taking the brand into new segments and away from its previous budget-focused positioning. Everything we know about the MG/IM reveal Praga Bohema This track-focused but road-legal supercar will take to the Goodwood hillclimb in a bid to topple some of the world’s biggest marques. Packing 700bhp and weighing just 982kg, it’s in with a fair chance. Everything we know about the Praga Bohema Renault 5 Turbo 3E Renault's tribute to the original 5 Turbo is every bit as ludicrous, employing a pair of rear-mounted in-wheel motors for a combined output of 533bhp. It is priced from £140,000 and 1980 examples will be built, in reference to the original 5 Turbo's launch year. A static design model will be displayed at the Festival of Speed. Everything you need to know about the Renault 5 Turbo 3E Toyota GR reveal  Toyota’s GR performance division is gearing up for a big reveal at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in July. Speaking to Autocar recently, Toyota Europe vice-president Andrea Carlucci said “the UK is the most amazing country in terms of pure car lovers, even more than other countries” and he is “attached to Goodwood”. He added: “This year, you will see something – let’s put it like that.” Carlucci declined to disclose further details but said: “We have to bring [many] more cars as GR models to the marketplace and I hope the UK will bring as many as [it] wants.”",
