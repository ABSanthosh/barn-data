At the same time, though, tall people aren’t the only ones who have problems fitting into cars. Sometimes, it feels like automakers just completely forget that short drivers exist, too. Not everyone can be 5 foot, 6 inches, buddy. Thankfully, while our friends at Consumer Reports have some tall drivers on staff, they also have their fair share of short folks, too. Recently, they put together a list of their favorite car for short drivers in a variety of categories. If you’re tired of not being able to find a comfortable driving position, and it feels like modern cars are just too big for someone your size, then this list is a great place to start.The Kia Soul may not fit cleanly into any particular category, but if you’re a short driver who’s in the market for a small car, you’ll want to at least test-drive the Soul. It doesn’t exactly have a luxury car ride, but it’s easy to drive and straightforward to use. If you’re interested in a more luxurious compact car, then look no further than the Audi A3. Sure, it’s small, but its seat and steering wheel offer plenty of adjustment for shorter drivers to get comfortable. It also drives much better than more mainstream compacts.The Toyota Crown also defies traditional segments, pairing a sedan shape with the ride height of a crossover. And while it was mainly engineered with older drivers who don’t have an easy time getting into a car anymore in mind, it also happens to be a great pick for short drivers. Little old ladies everywhere rejoice!If you don’t need or like the higher ride height of the Toyota Crown, then you’re really going to like the Lexus ES. It’s basically a Toyota Camry that married rich, so it’s both ridiculously comfortable and also dead reliable. Shorter drivers should also easily be able to find a good seating position.If you have a big family, most people turn to a big car to get them around. If you thought that meant you wouldn’t be able to find a minivan that’s comfortable for a short driver, though, you would be wrong. The Honda Odyssey answers the call, which is always great to hear, even if Honda did get rid of the built-in vacuum cleaner. Subaru recently redesigned the Forester, and while some have criticized the front end for looking a little bit too much like the Ford Explorer, it’s still a fantastic crossover that’s comfortable and spacious. Considering how open the cabin feels, you may be surprised to hear this one was a favorite of Consumer Reports’ short testers, but it ended up taking the top spot among small SUVs.Are you short and shopping for a luxury crossover? Believe it or not, the folks at Consumer Reports said you should get a Maserati. Yes, you read that correctly. Consumer Reports says to get a Maserati. You have permission. But only if you’re a short driver. If you’re tall, you have to buy something else. Do you like the idea of the Subaru Forester but wish it was shaped more like a traditional station wagon? Well, you’re in luck because while most automakers have given up on selling wagons in the U.S., Subaru continues to offer the Outback. Buy one now, or else that may not be the case in a few years. Wait, that sounded like a threat. I promise it wasn’t a threat. OK, it was a little bit of a threat.Here at Jalopnik, we’re big fans of the humble minivan. It’s been unfairly maligned, and it’s not like anyone looks like a cool, hip rebel behind the wheel of a Toyota Highlander. That said, if you insist on buying a three-row SUV, you’re going to have a hard time doing better than the new Honda Pilot. Short drivers will especially appreciate how comfortable they can get.The Lexus RX is one of the most popular luxury crossovers on the market and for good reason. Lexus offers plenty of comfort and luxury to go with rock-solid reliability and excellent build quality. The RX isn’t the most exciting car to drive, but if you fit comfortably, maybe some things are more important than a thrilling driving experience.The Volvo XC90 is old, and there’s really no way to get around that. If you want the latest features and the most luxurious ride, you’ll want to look elsewhere. That said, if you’re a short driver on the hunt for a three-row luxury SUV, it may end up being the car that makes you the happiest. Oh, and did I mention that it has a gorgeous cabin? Because it does.",
