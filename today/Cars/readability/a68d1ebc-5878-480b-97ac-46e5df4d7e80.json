  "text": "BMW's engineers have made tweaks the camber, dampers, springs, and anti-roll bars February 24, 2025 at 20:04 by Brad Anderson Two different versions of the limited-run model have been launched with distinctive finishes. Total production across the VR46 Sport and VR46 Style models will be capped at 92 units. No changes have been made to the potent 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged six with 543 hp. Long-retired from motorcycle racing, Valentino Rossi is now a BMW M works driver currently competing in the World Endurance Championship. To celebrate the Italian legend, BMW has launched two limited-edition versions of the road-going BMW M4 CS, fittingly dubbed the Edition VR46. Production of the two models will each be limited to 46 units. The two models are known as the Sport and Style, and mechanically, they are identical. However, they each feature a unique design, distinguishing them while also making them stand out from regular M4 CS models. Adorning the M4 CS Edition VR46 Sport is a spectacular Marina Bay Blue metallic finish that rocks huge ‘46’ emblems on the sides bathed in Tanzanite Blue metallic. By comparison, the Style version is dripping in Matte Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic with Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic ‘46’ logos. Read: The 2025 BMW M4 Competition Is An Addictive Triumph Of Speed The special touches don’t end there. Rossi’s famous bright yellow wraps around the outer edges of the kidney grilles and extends onto the brake calipers and wheels. The Sport version also includes fluro yellow trimmings on either side of the roof, while both versions add yellow accents to the tailgate. A large ‘VR46’ detail with Rossi’s signature has also been added to the roof of both models. Found inside are M Carbon bucket seats trimming in Merino leather with a Black/Night Blue combo. BMW has added Sao Paulo Yellow Alcantara on the shoulder areas, and there’s a yellow VR46 logo on the headrests. These yellow trimmings continue onto the M Alcantara steering wheel, while found on the center console is a badge denoting the car as 1/46. Like the regular M4 CS, the Edition VR46’s 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged six-cylinder delivers 543 hp through all four wheels. BMW says the car can hit 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds. Interestingly, the German brand says it has given the VR46 version bespoke wheel camber settings and also made tweaks top the dampers, springs, and anti-roll bars. Tweaks have also been made to the adaptive M suspension. Those who buy one of the limited-run models will be flown out to Italy for a special two-day experience. On the first day, they’ll visit the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia, and on day two, they will enjoy a BMW M Driving Experience at the Misano World Circuit. Prices will start at $155,000 in the US.",
