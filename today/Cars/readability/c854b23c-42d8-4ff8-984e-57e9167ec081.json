  "text": "May 30, 2025 4:00 PM EDTIt’s official! After 10 years in its U.S. lineup, Jeep discontinued the fifth-generation Cherokee in 2023, leaving a mid-sized void between the subcompact Compass SUV and the bigger Grand Cherokee. Though its departure was noticed, its time out of the spotlight was very short, as Jeep recently revealed that an all-new Cherokee is on the way for the 2026 model year. Although Jeep’s parent company, Stellantis, only released two actual photos, a short teaser video, and very limited details ahead of a much more detailed reveal in “late 2025,” the publicly available visuals showcase a very modern, but Jeep-esque design through and through.  The new 2026 Cherokee is a much-welcome return to form compared to the previous generation, which traded Jeep’s signature boxy looks for Fiat-esque design elements. While the last generation’s rounded front end divided Jeep fans into two camps, the new Cherokee plays it safe without necessarily compromising or straying from the Jeep school of design. Like most Jeeps, both old and new, the 2026 Cherokee’s signature seven-slot grille is front and center, but the first feature of the new Cherokee that the eyes meet is its high hood line and flat-looking front end; a clear departure from the conventional crossover SUV looks of the last iteration. While it shares some design elements with the revamped Compass, the all-electric Wagoneer S, and the larger Grand Cherokee, the new model has a boxier and more conventionally “tough” appearance than the car-like looks of crossover rivals like CR-V, RAV4, and Forester. Pictures of the 2026 Cherokee’s rear end are currently not available, but Jeep confirms that the new “reimagined” next-generation Cherokee will have a “new, efficient and powerful hybrid propulsion option,” which is instrumental in Jeep maintaining a lineup with “industry-leading ICE propulsion systems, plug-in, hybrid and all-electric offerings.” A welcome blast from the past? Jeep fans know that the Cherokee pioneered SUVs and modern automobiles. Introduced in 1974 as a smaller alternative to the swanky Wagoneer, the Jeep Cherokee was one of the first vehicles to be advertised formally as a “sports utility vehicle.” Though it rode on the same SJ chassis as its Wagoneer big brother, the humble Cherokee proved a popular option for drivers who wanted a step-up from CJs (the predecessor to Wranglers) with features like an enclosed cabin, room for up to six passengers, and more importantly, four doors, which was introduced in 1977. However, the introduction of the second-generation Cherokee (XJ) in 1984 made the boxy Jeep a cult vehicle with a legacy that extended far beyond the 17 years it was in production. The XJ was the first SUV to feature a unibody construction like a modern-day crossover, which made it much lighter and feel much more “car-like” behind the wheel than the heavy truck-based SUVs of the period. As a result, the Cherokee was popular beyond the recreational off-road market, cementing its status as a popular family vehicle and even spawning the bigger Grand Cherokee in 1992. Although Stellantis doesn’t explicitly state that the new 2026 Jeep Cherokee drew inspiration from the XJ itself, a teaser video shows the new car superimposed against stock and modified XJs, accompanied by text that reads, “Classic for a Reason.” In its release, Stellantis stated that the new “reimagined” Cherokee for next year “respectfully honors its rich history with an innovative eye toward the future as the Jeep brand continues to meet the needs of every driver and every journey.” Final thoughts As we saw a few days ago, Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa as its new CEO, and I hope he will prioritize fast-tracking this new model when he takes over in June. Having an attractive and competitively priced model in the ever-competitive compact crossover SUV market would help STLA gain some legs in a market dominated by the CR-V, RAV4, Forester, and Rogue. In a similar vein to what I mentioned with the 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan, to compete in a crowded, “cookie-cutter” segment of bestsellers is to sell a product with something that takes eyes away from the siren song of Honda, Toyota, Subaru, and Nissan. Volkswagen is going its own way by packing its Tiguan with Audi-levels of luxury features. Still, for Jeep to sell its Cherokees, it needs a special ‘X-factor’ beyond its rich history and off-road capability if the ordinary ‘NPCs’ of the car-buying public will fall in love with Jeep again. Perhaps we’ll find out in “late 2025.”",
