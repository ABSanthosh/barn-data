This GT4.R race car is now offered in Illinois with a vehicle manual, spare parts, and a bill of sale. The GT4.R was built by Pratt \u0026 Miller Engineering of New Hudson, Michigan, in accordance with global GT4 regulations. This example left the factory finished in white and now wears a gray wrap with satin black and blue stripes in addition to various racing decals. The Camaro ZL1-based body has been fitted with wider front fenders, dive planes,  aerodynamic side skirts, Lexan windows, and carbon-fiber components consisting of the front fascia and splitter, hood heat extractor, doors, and rear spoiler, the latter of which features adjustable billet mounts. Damage to the quarter panels and additional close-up photos are shown in the gallery. Forgeline 18″ one-piece forged alloy wheels are finished in gray and mounted with Pirelli P Zero DHF racing slicks. Suspension consists of Öhlins two-way adjustable front struts and rear coilovers as well as adjustable sway bars front and rear. Braking is provided by six-piston Brembo front and four-piston ZL1 rear calipers over slotted Brembo discs. The car is equipped with Bosch Racing adjustable ABS and traction control as well as an air jack system with a Stäubli JAC plug. The cabin features a roll cage with door bars and a Racetech fixed-back racing seat with a hybrid carbon-Kevlar shell and a black cloth cover. The seat is fitted with a Sabelt six-point cam-lock harness and additional equipment includes quick-release safety nets, a FireSense fire-suppression system, and a Tilton floor-mounted pedal set. The car is also equipped with the controls and plumbing for a driver hydration system. The quick-release multifunction steering wheel features a flat bottom, an open top, and controls for functions that include the pit speed regulator, traction control adjustments, and high beam flasher. It fronts a set of Megaline pneumatic shift paddles and a MoTec C187 digital display with integrated shift lights and multi-channel data-logging capability. A carbon-fiber box mounted atop the transmission tunnel houses a panel with an ignition switch, a starter button, and various accessory controls. There is no odometer display, but a 2023 chassis mileage report is included in the gallery. The replacement 6.2-liter LT1 V8 was installed in 2023 and features direct fuel injection, a custom carbon-fiber intake, a custom camshaft, dry-sump lubrication, a Motec data acquisition system, and a customized Bosch Motorsport MS 6.4 EVO engine control unit. A Fuel Safe System racing fuel cell with a Weldon electric pump and a double dry-break refueling valve is mounted in the trunk. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an Xtrac six-speed sequential manual transmission, a Tilton clutch, an aluminum driveshaft, and an Xtrac Salisbury-type limited-slip differential.
