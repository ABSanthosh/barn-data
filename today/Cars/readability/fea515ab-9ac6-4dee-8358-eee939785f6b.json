Powered by a 3.5-liter DOHC V8 linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, it is finished in Rosso Corsa over black Connolly leather upholstery. The car has a gated shifter, a removable body-color targa top, a Capristo exhaust system, 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels, carbon-fiber door sill plates, a Continental stereo, and pop-up headlights. This F355 GTS is now offered on dealer consignment with a Carfax report and a clean Florida title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa, and styling elements include a removable body-color roof panel as well as pop-up headlights, integrated front fog lights, flying buttress C-pillars, an integrated rear decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, a vented engine cover, and air intakes on the doors and rocker panels. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, per the seller. The 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Black-finished Ferrari-branded brake calipers are mounted over ventilated discs at each corner. A brake fluid flush was performed in preparation for the sale. The sport seats are trimmed in black Connolly leather and are joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, carpets, and door panels. Carpeted floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include carbon-fiber door sill plates, a Continental stereo, a gated shifter, automatic climate control, and drilled aluminum pedals. The selling dealer notes that sticky buttons have been refinished. A cover on the passenger side of the dashboard has deformed. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 320-km/h speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. Ancillary instruments in the center stack include an analog clock and gauges for fuel level and oil temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 55k kilometers (~34k miles). The mid-mounted 3.5-liter DOHC V8 features five valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 375 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer notes that an engine-out belt service was last completed in 2022. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Capristo exhaust system has been fitted, and an oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
