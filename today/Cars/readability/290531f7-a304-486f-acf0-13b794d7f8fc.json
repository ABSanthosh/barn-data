  "description": "This German-market 1997 Porsche 911 Carrera S coupe is one of the 60 Vesuvio Edition units that were reported to have been produced, and it spent time in Italy with its original owner until it was imported to the US in 2024. Showing 118k kilometers (73k miles), the car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Vesuvio Metallic over Classic Grey leather upholstery. Bilstein dampers and a Supersprint exhaust system have been added, and additional equipment includes 18\" hollow-spoke \"Technology\" wheels, xenon headlights, a power-operated sunroof, heated power-adjustable front seats, a cassette stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. It was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, and work performed during their ownership has included replacing the front and rear control arms, sway bar links, spark plugs, exhaust gaskets, valve cover gaskets, and distributor caps and rotors. This 993 C2S is offered in Pennsylvania with service records, manufacturer's literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title.",

Showing 118k kilometers (73k miles), the car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Vesuvio Metallic over Classic Grey leather upholstery. Bilstein dampers and a Supersprint exhaust system have been added, and additional equipment includes 18″ hollow-spoke “Technology” wheels, xenon headlights, a power-operated sunroof, heated power-adjustable front seats, a cassette stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. It was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, and work performed during their ownership has included replacing the front and rear control arms, sway bar links, spark plugs, exhaust gaskets, valve cover gaskets, and distributor caps and rotors. This 993 C2S is offered in Pennsylvania with service records, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title. The 993 C2S featured wider bodywork, a split rear grille, and revised bumper covers and side skirts in comparison with the contemporary Carrera. This example is finished in Vesuvio Metallic (L40W) and features steel gray mirror caps, door handles, and rear grilles. Additional exterior details include power-adjustable mirrors, a power-operated sunroof, xenon headlights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a rear window wiper, and dual exhaust outlets. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. The 18″ hollow-spoke “Technology” wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Bilstein dampers have been added, and braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The front and rear control arms and front sway bar links were replaced in 2024. The heated power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Classic Grey leather and complemented by a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. Amenities include a cassette stereo, a HiFi sound system, cruise control, and air conditioning. The passenger-side air flap actuator was replaced in 2024. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 300-km/h speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 118k kilometers (73k miles), approximately 1k of which were added by the selling dealer. The air-cooled 3.6L M64 flat-six features a VarioRam intake system and was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The spark plugs, distributor caps and rotors, exhaust gaskets, and valve cover gaskets were replaced during the selling dealer’s ownership, and results from compression and leak-down tests taken in 2024 are viewable on a service record in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. A Supersprint exhaust system has been fitted. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: L40X – Vesuvio Metallic paint TT – Classic Gray partial leather upholstery C00 – Version for Germany 139 – Seat heating, left 235 – N2 tyres made specially for Porsche 340 – Seat heating, right 408 – 18″ Technology wheels (hollow spoke) 425 – Rear window wiper 490 – Hi-Fi sound system 567 – Top-tinted windscreen 573 – Air conditioner 601 – Litronic (xenon) headlamps 602 – Araised stop lamp 650 – Power sunroof 659 – Onboard computer 680 – Nokia Digital Sound Processing (DSP) audio system 686 – CD-radio Becker Porsche CDR-21 The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and lists a single entry in September 2024.
