  "text": "May 16, 2025 8:00 PM EDTSix-figure supercars aren’t anything new, but this one’s aesthetics put the usual suspects to shame Concept cars are easy. Without pesky things like safety standards or emissions to worry about, OEMs can get the public’s eyeballs on some truly shapely sheet metal. Often, those aforementioned restrictions — or, worse, production costs — significantly tone down the car when it’s time to bring it to market. In a delightful change of pace, De Tomaso pulled the sheet off its anticipated P72 to reveal a road-going version that largely mirrors the voluptuous vehicle we first viewed in 2019. This De Tomaso P72 is production-ready, and it’s a beautiful thing De Tomaso, a manufacturer you likely know from the V8-powered and exotically styled Pantera, debuted the P72 as it celebrated its 60th anniversary at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2019. It took five years to develop, and finally, after six additional years, De Tomaso has given us a look at what the final production car will look like. Unlike many concept cars, the De Tomaso P72 retains much of what made it so initially eye-catching, including an extremely low-slung body, swan-necked mirrors, and an impossibly short front overhang. A full carbon fiber body hides a carbon fiber chassis, keeping weight down and rigidity high. That likely means the De Tomaso P72’s charms are more than skin deep. The looks alone promise a good time, but even just a glance at the spec sheet might have you sweating. A hand-assembled 5.0-liter V8 (Ford-derived, just like the Pantera) sits behind the driver. With help from a supercharger, the mill produces 700 horsepower and 604 pound-feet of torque. De Tomaso says the engine sports forged internals and unique headers, ensuring it has a unique character despite its apparently pedestrian origins. A short-ratio six-speed manual transaxle is the only gearbox offered, and the P72 is rear-wheel drive. A push-rod suspension system with manually-adjustable dampers completes what De Tomaso promises to be a “raw and expressive” driving experience. De Tomaso calls the P72 “an analog statement in a digital world” The Pantera’s successor leans heavily into the relationship between driver and machine. Need proof? Check out the car’s cockpit, which offers Pagani and Spyker levels of mechanical switch gear satisfaction. An exposed gear selector linkage, analog gauges with beautifully crafted milled aluminum bezels, and hand-stitched leather adorning the seats, steering wheel, and dashboard are just a few of the touches that set the P72 apart. As the manufacturer puts it, “free from screens, no infotainment, no overlays, no distractions.” We love it, and we’re willing to bet the 72 lucky owners that get to take home this homage to mechanical magnificence will, too. Final thoughts We’re not sure how many of the 72 examples of the De Tomaso P72 are spoken for, but the automaker claims each one will be extensively customized, tailored exactly to its owner’s specifications. Back in 2019, De Tomaso claimed each one would cost “around €750,000,” roughly $840,000 USD. We’ll have to start saving our pennies. In the meantime, we’ll play around with the De Tomaso configurator. You know…just so we’re ready to order. De Tomaso says deliveries will begin later this year.",
