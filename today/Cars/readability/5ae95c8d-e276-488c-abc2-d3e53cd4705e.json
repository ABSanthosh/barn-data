It was first delivered to Minar Ford in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was repainted black at some point prior to the selling dealer’s 2023 acquisition. It is powered by a 428ci Cobra Jet V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission and a Traction-Lok differential. Equipment includes the Interior Décor Group, the Visibility Group, a power-operated white soft top, a roll hoop, functional hood scoops, and a rear spoiler in addition to front disc brakes, 10-spoke 15″ aluminum wheels, and a push-button radio. This GT500KR is now offered in Massachusetts with a Deluxe Marti Report and transferable New York registration. The GT500KR was added to the Shelby American lineup mid-way through the 1968 model year and shared its styling with the GT500 but was fitted with a higher-powered 428ci Cobra Jet engine. Exterior design elements include an SMC fiberglass hood with a functional ram-air scoop, grille-mounted Lucas lights, a rear spoiler, sequential taillights, and air scoops on the quarter panels. This example left the factory finished in Lime Gold and was repainted black at some point under prior ownership. It has white GT500KR side stripes, a power-operated white soft top, hood locks, fog lights, inboard grille-mounted driving lamps, and quad exhaust outlets. Aluminum 10-spoke 15″ wheels wear Shelby Cobra center caps and are mounted with P215/65 Dunlop GT Qualifier tires. GT500 models utilized an upgraded suspension system with heavy-duty coil springs and an anti-roll bar up front in addition to heavy-duty leaf springs out back. Stopping is provided by front discs and rear drums. The front bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl, and woodgrain trim accents the dashboard, center console, and door panels. A push-button radio is fitted, and a roll bar with inertia-reel seatbelts was standard in Shelby cars. The Visibility Group included under-dash courtesy lights and illumination in the glovebox, trunk, and engine compartment. The glovebox bears a Carroll Shelby signature. Woodgrain trim adorns the steering wheel, which sits ahead of a 140-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. A Stewart-Warner ammeter and oil pressure gauge are mounted in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 33k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. The 428ci V8 was factory equipped with a four-barrel Holley carburetor and has Cobra Le Mans-branded valve covers. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a 3.50 Traction-Lok differential. The Deluxe Marti report displays a June 3, 1968 production date and lists factory colors and equipment along with production statistics. The car is located in a state that does not issue titles for vehicles of its age. It is being sold on its transferable New York registration, which lists the Shelby Automotive vehicle serial number as the VIN. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
