It was first delivered to Moorhead Chevrolet-Buick in Crestwood, Kentucky, and also spent time in Michigan and Florida. Power is provided by a turbocharged and intercooled 3.8-liter V6 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and is finished in black over black and Sand Gray cloth upholstery. Equipment includes 15″ chrome wheels, a rear spoiler, a Delco AM/FM/cassette stereo, air conditioning, and cruise control. This Grand National is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, original purchase documents, manufacturer’s literature, a binder of service records, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean North Carolina title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in black (19) and features a sculpted hood, an automatic power antenna, a rear window defogger, sport mirrors, a decklid spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. Damage to the left and right sides of the vehicle is noted in a June 2018 Carfax entry, and an invoice in the gallery from July of that year shows that the grille filler panel and bumper fillers were replaced and the rockers and doors were refinished. Factory 15″ wheels feature a chrome finish with black accents and are mounted with Goodyear Eagle GT tires with pre-2000 date codes. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The front bucket seats and rear bench are upholstered in black and Sand Gray cloth, with Turbo 6 embroidery on the front seat headrests. Appointments include air conditioning, cruise control, Grand National-branded floor mats, and a Delco AM/FM/cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a horizontal 85-mph speedometer, a digital tachometer, a fuel gauge, and a boost-pressure gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 4,900 miles. The trim around the horn is cracked. The turbocharged and intercooled 3.8-liter V6 was factory rated at 245 horsepower and 355 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists factory colors, options, and a total amount of $17,434. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage and displays history in Michigan and Florida from an initial entry in September 2011. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates.
