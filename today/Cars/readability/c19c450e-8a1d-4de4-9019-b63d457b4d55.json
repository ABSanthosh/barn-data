Features include a power-folding hardtop, a panoramic glass roof, 18″ multi-spoke wheels, bi-xenon headlights, Parktronic, Keyless Go, heated and ventilated seats, a Bose sound system, and COMAND with navigation. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this R230 is offered in Pennsylvania at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature and a clean New York title. The car is finished in Pewter Metallic (723) and a carbon-fiber front lip and rear spoiler have been added. Additional exterior details include a power-folding convertible hardtop, a panoramic glass roof, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, and fender air vents. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. The 18″ multi-spoke wheels are fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport All-Season tires that were mounted in July 2024. The car features Active Body Control (ABC) suspension as well as an Electronic Stability Program (ESP) and Automatic Slip Control (ASR). The cabin features heated, ventilated, and massaging multi-contour seats that are upholstered in black Exclusive leather.

The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 63k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter M275 V12 was factory-rated at 493 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed automatic transmission.
