  "description": "This 1952 Allard J2X is one of approximately 80 examples produced and was completed in November 1951 before being dispatched to Motor Sport Inc. in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Chassis 2193 was purchased in 1973 by an Ohio owner who subsequently commissioned a refurbishment that included a color change to yellow. They retained the car until 2010, when it was sold part-way through a refresh that was completed under subsequent ownership. The car later underwent a refurbishment between 2023 and early 2024 that included a repaint in black and a re-trim of the interior in dark green leather. Following completion of the project, the car won its class at the 2024 Keeneland Concours d’Elegance before being purchased by the selling dealer. Power is provided by a 354ci Chrysler FirePower V8 that breathes through twin four-barrel carburetors and is mated to a three-speed manual transmission. Additional equipment includes alloy drum brakes with inboard rear units, a De Dion rear axle, a front swing axle with forward-facing radius rods, chrome 16” wire wheels, a side-mount spare, and an engine-turned dashboard. This J2X is now offered in Huntington Station, New York, with a removed banjo-spoke steering wheel, a spare set of bright wire wheels, photos and invoices from the 2023-2024 refurbishment, hand-written notes and documentation from the previous long-term owner, and a clean Kentucky title.",

The J2 model was introduced around 1950 as a lightweight sports racer targeting the US market and was succeeded in late 1951 by the J2X, which featured revisions to the front suspension design and engine placement. The J2X’s steel ladder frame was 6” longer than that of its predecessor while sharing its 100” wheelbase, while the updated model’s aluminum bodywork gained a nose panel extended forward of the wheels and a single chin vent instead of two. This example is said to have received a color change from blue to pale yellow in the 1980s and was later refinished in black during the 2023-2024 refurbishment performed by Manns Restoration in Festus, Missouri. The body was stripped to bare metal during the project before receiving welding repairs and straightening of various panels. Features include a hood scoop flanked by louvers, leather hood retention straps, dual windscreens, a driver-side roll hoop, a Monza-style fuel filler cap, and dual exhaust outlets. Silver-painted wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in 6.00-16 Blockley tires, as is a matching spare mounted to the right side of the cowl. The hydraulic brake system utilizes finned alloy drums with duplex actuation up front and inboard rear units. A brake system refresh during the refurbishment included replacement of the wheel cylinders. The left-hand-drive cockpit was re-trimmed during the refurbishment and features dark green leather over a two-place bench seat. Features include black carpeting, latch-and-link lap belts, a circular cowl-mounted rearview mirror, a cigar lighter, and a black zippered tonneau cover. The wood-rimmed Moto-Lita steering wheel sits ahead of an engine-turned dash panel that hosts Smiths instrumentation including a 150-mph speedometer with an inset clock, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and gauges monitoring coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 7k miles, approximately 50 of which have been added under current ownership. The speedometer does not read accurately. The 354ci Chrysler FirePower Hemi V8 breathes through dual four-barrel Carter carburetors. The generator and voltage regulator were rebuilt during the refurbishment, which also included various wiring repairs. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission. Suspension incorporates a front swing axle and a De Dion rear end with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers at each corner. The J2X model featured radius rods attached ahead of the engine, allowing the powerplant’s positioning to be shifted forward compared to that of the J2. The exhaust system was replaced during the 2023-2024 refurbishment. Images and invoices from the refurbishment are viewable in the photo gallery below. Hand-written and typed notes from the previous owner of 37 years are also included in the sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
