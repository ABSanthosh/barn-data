  "description": "Kia has revealed the EV2 concept as the progenitor to the Korean carmaker’s new global entry-level model, which is set to go on sale in 2026. The EV2 will be Kia’s smallest electric car yet. Kia EV2 concept teases company's upcoming entry-level EV It gets radical styling with claw-like headlights and square-spoke alloy wheels The dashboard and windows feature LED animations Kia EV2 concept design The EV2 concept sports an evolved form of Kia’s ‘Opposites United’ design language, with the compact SUV’s front end featuring rakish claw-like dual headlight units and thick plastic cladding on the bumper. Over to the side, the EV2 concept gets alloy wheels with funky square spokes, no door handles, and a pillarless design. At the rear, the EV2 concept has low-set tail-lamps that somewhat echo those of the Syros, as well as a roof spoiler. Kia EV2 concept interior and features Inside, the EV2 concept is equipped with bench seating for the front passengers and folding bench-styled seating in the second row, which can be slid back to free up more legroom. In this configuration, Kia claims that there’s enough space for occupants to sit on the EV2 concept’s flat floor. EV2 concept dashboard has LED animations The dashboard is finished in burgundy and doesn’t have much other than the combined instrument and infotainment screen arrangement. Interestingly, the dashboard and windows feature unique LED animations, and the triangular speakers in the doors are removable and portable. Other notable features include a panoramic sunroof, support for over-the-air updates, and V2L (vehicle-to-load) which allows the EV2 concept to power external devices. Kia EV2 concept battery and range Technical details remain undisclosed, but the EV2 will likely use the entry-level 400V version of Hyundai’s E-GMP architecture, which also underpins the larger Kia EV3 and EV4. Therefore, the EV2 is expected to offer a choice of 58.3kWh or 81.4kWh battery packs, paired with a 201hp single front-mounted motor.The smaller battery pack yields up to 434km of range in the EV3, whereas the larger one can go up to 603km on a single charge. Alternatively, the EV2 could sport the 43.3kWh LFP battery pack found in the PV5 electric van. Kia EV2 India launch details Once the EV2 debuts globally next year, it will replace the Picanto hatchback sold in international markets. An India launch for the EV2 has not been confirmed, but it could be brought here as Kia trademarked eight EV names here in 2023.
