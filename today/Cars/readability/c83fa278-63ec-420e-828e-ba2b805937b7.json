  "text": "Last week, I took you behind the scenes at Vink Motorsport, a BMW-centric race car shop in the Netherlands. Here, Ton Vink and his team meticulously build and restore classic machines from motorsport’s golden eras, preparing them for historic racing meets across Europe. In that feature, I showcased several cars currently in the shop. Today, let’s delve deeper into four more Vink Motorsport builds. Team Eggenberger Motorsport BMW E28 Entering Vink Motorsport, the first car that caught my eye was the Team Eggenberger Motorsport BMW E28 that clinched the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) in 1982. At the season’s start, BMW faced new Group A regulations, rendering the earlier Group 2 635CSi unsuitable. Thus, the newly introduced BMW E28 528i was chosen to compete. Partnering with Switzerland’s Eggenberger Motorsport, BMW developed a kit to transform the E28 for Group A touring car racing. To meet the 1,035kg weight limit for its engine class, the car had all unnecessary components removed. Furthermore, its inline-six engine was expertly tuned to produce nearly 240hp, up from the production model’s 180hp. Driven by Umberto Grano and Helmut Kelleners, the E28 dominated the early rounds of the 1982 ETCC, winning five consecutive races. Although no further victories followed, they amassed enough points to secure the championship title. In Vink Motorsport’s hands, the E28 has undergone a complete rebuild. A re-shell was necessary due to extensive rust around the exterior of the original body, yet many components were salvageable and reused. Parts beyond repair were recreated from original blueprints or donated from another car. Ton and the Vink team can remanufacture certain components, such as uprights or front steering arms. They do this using molds created from original parts of that era, replicating the production methods used by BMW. This means that many previously unavailable parts are now accessible through channels like BMW Classic or the second-hand market. BMW Alpina E30 DTM Next up is a mid-restoration BMW Alpina E30 DTM, one of only two remaining (the other resides at Alpina). After its time in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), this car was sold to a racing team in England, later ending up in a barn until Ton discovered it two years ago. Contrary to my belief in the existence of multiple Alpina E30 DTM cars, most are replicas; many were even constructed by Ton himself. However, this particular car was built and campaigned by Alpina in the 1987 and ’88 DTM seasons. It features many unique details like green mirrors, which were intentionally chosen for easy identification during races. Another notable detail is the onboard radio, which Ton received during a visit to Alpina. A retired mechanic from the car’s racing era was present during the visit and pointed out the exact location of the radio’s mounting, with screw holes perfectly matching those on the chassis beneath the dashboard. These amazing stories, shared by Ton, highlight his passion for ensuring historical accuracy in every project he takes on. BMW E36 325i Coupe DTM Linder This car was unearthed in Thailand, where a Vink Motorsport customer purchased it from a collector. Upon its return to the Netherlands, its dire state necessitated a complete restoration. After a meticulous chassis rebuild by Jan Buijs of Multi-tech, adhering to the original specifications, the car has just returned from the paint shop with fresh coats of Jägermeister orange. In Vink’s canteen, an array of model cars includes a scale version of this exact vehicle, offering a glimpse of its future appearance. Scattered around the shop are various parts from the car, including the hood on the first floor and the front bumper and rear hatch with a spoiler on one of the shelves. Once the car takes shape, I plan to return to Vink Motorsport and capture it in all its glory. BMW M1 Procar Finally, we come to the BMW M1, which started as a production street car but is now undergoing a remarkable transformation into a Procar – a move reminiscent of what BMW Motorsport has done in the past. Vink has been entrusted with this ambitious conversion, and progress is evident in the array of parts lining the shelves next to the car. The only thing left to complete is the engine, which is currently being assembled. The BMW M1 is significant as the first to carry the iconic ‘M’ designation. Produced between 1978 and 1981 in collaboration with Lamborghini, a total of 453 M1s were built, with 399 being street cars and 54 dedicated Procar versions commissioned for Group 5 racing. While the exact number of street M1s converted into Procars is unknown, soon, another will join this elite group. Stay tuned as this BMW M1 undergoes its stunning transformation, adding yet another chapter to the storied legacy of one of BMW’s most legendary models. I hope you’ve enjoyed this second and final feature from my visit to Vink Motorsport. Big thanks to Ton and the team for having us! Jeroen Willemsen Instagram: jaccojeroen",
