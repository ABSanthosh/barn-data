This Belgian-Market 964 Turbo 3.6 was purchased by its current owner, a licensed German retail dealership, in 2024 and is now offered on their behalf in Göttingen, Germany, with the owner’s manual, a stamped service booklet, service records, and Dutch registration. The 964 Turbo featured widened bodywork compared to the contemporary 911 and was fitted with aerodynamic side mirrors and a fixed rear spoiler.
