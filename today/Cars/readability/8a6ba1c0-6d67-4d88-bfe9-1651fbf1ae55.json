  "text": "The Volkswagen Tiguan has been around in its current form for almost a decade now, and its competitors have gotten a lot better during that time. VW aims to upgrade the SUV with a new model, starting in Europe. Orders for the new Tayron opened today on the Old Continent, and VW said it would bring a modified version of the SUV to the United States soon. Like the Tiguan, the Tayron will offer five or seven seats, thanks to a small optional third row. VW said it would offer seven powertrain options for the vehicle, including mild-hybrid, PHEV, gas, and diesel configurations. Four powertrain configurations will be available at launch, including the base gas model, two hybrid variants, and a diesel. All Tayron variants come with a dual-clutch transmission, and all-wheel drive is available. The automaker noted that the SUV would likely change considerably before a U.S. debut, saying it would get a different wheelbase and significantly modified bodywork. Standard features for the entry-level Life trim include a 12.6-inch touchscreen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a digital gauge cluster, LED headlights, an illuminated VW logo, rear sunshades, and 17-inch wheels. Standard safety kit includes blind spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alerts, a parking assistance system, road sign recognition, and more.Pricing for the Tayron starts at a hefty 45,475 euros, or almost $48,000. We don’t know when VW plans to bring the SUV to the States, but it’s expected to land sometime in the middle of 2025.[Images: VW]Become a TTAC insider.
