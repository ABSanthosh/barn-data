  "description": "This feels familiar. This time last year, I was right here, at the CoASTT high-performance centre, sweltering heat searing my skin, with the keys to a 911 in my hands. I was giddy with excitement then, and I am once again now. The difference is that last year, I had for company what I consider the pinnacle of modern 911 engineering, the mighty GT3 RS, and as the Porsche nerds among you know, that version comes near the end of the car’s mid-life cycle. So now the model range has been reset, and we’ve gone from the top of the pecking order back down to the bottom with this 992.2 Carrera. Porsche 911 Carrera exterior design and engineering Only aficionados will spot the wider LEDs that mark out the 992.2. Don’t let the dramatic wing fool you – this isn’t a GT3 but rather a Rs 11 lakh aero kit option.In fact, in classic Porsche fashion, there are a lot of options you can add to your Carrera (this car has Rs 67 lakh worth) to help make it look, feel and perform better. But I’m here to tell you that, even if you don’t, through the power of immaculate engineering, you will still be in possession of one of the finest sports cars on the planet. DRLs, indicators moved into headlamp, so bumper is free for aero, cooling. One of the most underappreciated facets of a 911, I find, is how easy it is for anyone to just get in and go fast. Stepping in, it immediately feels welcoming and familiar. But even if you’ve never driven one before, the great forward visibility, thin A-pillars, visual markers in the form of the raised fenders, a driving position that’s not overly aggressive, a slim-rimmed steering wheel, and an uncluttered dashboard ease you in. Porsche 911 Carrera interior and features Like all modern cars, it too has succumbed to screens; the 10.9-inch touchscreen returns, and behind the steering wheel, the wonderful central analogue tachometer has met its inevitable demise, replaced by a full-digital screen. But even here, Porsche has to be applauded for keeping both screens simple, legible and free of distraction. Sacrilege! Iconic five dials go full digital but remain easy to read. The PCM (Porsche Communication Management; how German) 6.0 interface is one of the cleanest and least complicated while still being packed with features. And though they’ve gone digital, the dials still look like ‘dials’, albeit with a number of configurations, ranging from the classic 911 5-dial setup to a full map display. You can even reorient the tacho to have the redline at the top of the circle. Tactile, twist-to-start knob replaced by boring starter button. There are now no rear seats by default, but they can be optioned for no cost. However, a change I’m less enthused about is the switch from the twist-to-start ignition knob to a regular start/stop button; a small but annoying blow to driver involvement.

The twin-turbo 3.0-litre flat-six certainly doesn’t disappoint. 394hp and 450Nm might sound meek in absolute sports car terms, but trust me when I say they’re more than plenty. Even out on the race track, where all but the fastest cars can feel slow, it never feels lacking. 911 hallmarks remain: great visibility, pointy front end, perfect driving position. Maybe it’s the tremendous sound from the optional sports exhaust, the instantaneous responses, or the ceaseless thrust you get all the way to 7,500rpm. It’s not the goosebump-inducing 4.0-litre naturally aspirated screamer you find in the GT3s, but it doesn’t fall far behind. You could even argue that its more accessible power makes it better for everyday use. Incidentally, compared to the old 992.1 Carrera, they didn’t just pump up the boost pressure and call it a day. It’s got different turbos, borrowed from the outgoing 911 GTS, and new intercoolers out of the Turbo S. Porsche 911 Carrera ride and handling Fantastic as the engine is, I’d argue that what truly makes a 911 is the chassis, and I’m happy to report that it is, as ever, impeccable. A downside is you can’t specify any handling-enhancing options on a Carrera, as you can on higher 911s. Adaptive dampers are standard, but not on the options menu are PDCC (active roll stabilisation), PCCB (carbon-ceramic brakes) or, most disappointingly, rear-wheel steering. Balanced as it is, a firm prod will swing its heavy rear around like a pendulum. So, it’s a testament to how solid the core setup is that it doesn’t suffer for this. 60 years of honing has turned an inherently unbalanced weight distribution into a deftly balanced one. It’s slightly pendulous, not overwhelmingly so, with the rear-engine layout helping the back of the car be a little livelier around corners. The steering has heft and is supremely communicative.  As ever, no engine weight at the front means the steering remains uncorrupted. It’s sharp, it’s got heft, and it is full of micro-communications fed directly to your palms. The car’s limits are high but also clearly spelled out, so as I approach them on the fast right-hander that is C1, I know almost instinctively how far down the throttle travel my foot has to be to induce some oversteer without overcooking it. You gotta love track time! Porsche 911 Carrera price and verdict Really, there’s nothing entry-level about the new Porsche 911 Carrera then. Certainly not its Rs 2.11 crore starting price (ex-showroom); that was how much a previous-gen Turbo cost when it was new. And, of course, once you start rummaging through the options list, the sky is the limit. The base Carrera offers 85 percent of the 911 experience.   Though we didn’t drive it on the road much, you already know what to expect there. The nose-lift kit is an essential option to tick. The ride quality is firm but compliant – stay away from the larger wheel size if that’s a concern. The front boot is more spacious than its 135 litres would suggest. But the simple fact that it’s got me grinning as wide as I was last year with the GT3 RS – and without pulverising me along the way – speaks volumes. It tells me that the humble Carrera is 85 percent of the way there, and moving up the range is an exercise in diminishing returns. That’s not to say you won’t get more out of a Turbo S or a GT3 or even a GTS t-hybrid; but rather that you can’t go wrong with any 911.

It’s slightly pendulous, not overwhelmingly so, with the rear-engine layout helping the back of the car be a little livelier around corners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Porsche_911_Front_Tracking.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe steering has heft and is supremely communicative. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs ever, no engine weight at the front means the steering remains uncorrupted. It’s sharp, it’s got heft, and it is full of micro-communications fed directly to your palms. The car’s limits are high but also clearly spelled out, so as I approach them on the fast right-hander that is C1, I know almost instinctively how far down the throttle travel my foot has to be to induce some oversteer without overcooking it. You gotta love track time!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePorsche 911 Carrera price and verdict \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eReally, there’s nothing entry-level about the new Porsche 911 Carrera then. Certainly not its Rs 2.11 crore starting price (ex-showroom); that was how much a previous-gen Turbo cost when it was new. And, of course, once you start rummaging through the options list, the sky is the limit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Porsche_911_Rear_Wing.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe base Carrera offers 85 percent of the 911 experience.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough we didn’t drive it on the road much, you already know what to expect there. The nose-lift kit is an essential option to tick. The ride quality is firm but compliant – stay away from the larger wheel size if that’s a concern. The front boot is more spacious than its 135 litres would suggest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the simple fact that it’s got me grinning as wide as I was last year with the GT3 RS – and without pulverising me along the way – speaks volumes. It tells me that the humble Carrera is 85 percent of the way there, and moving up the range is an exercise in diminishing returns. That’s not to say you won’t get more out of a Turbo S or a GT3 or even a GTS t-hybrid; but rather that you can’t go wrong with any 911.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso See:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-video-reviews/2025-porsche-911-carrera-video-review-435038\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2025 Porsche 911 Carrera video review\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/porsche-911-carrera-gts-review-hybrid-power-unlocked-432157\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePorsche 911 Carrera GTS review: Hybrid power unlocked\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-435621\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-435621\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-435621\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-435621\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
