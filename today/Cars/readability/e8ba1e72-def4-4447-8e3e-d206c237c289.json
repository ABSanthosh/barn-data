  "text": "Published:  December 13th, 2024 Quick, what's the best-selling Volkswagen SUV at present?If you said Atlas or Tiguan, sorry. Go claim your consolation prize.The answer, of course, is Taos. So with that in mind, the 2025 Volkswagen Taos has gone under the knife and gained some more get up and go. Changes are minimal -- a new grille, new front and rear bumpers, standard LED headlights, and a newly available front light bar make up the changes on the front end, and the rear gets a light-up VW logo and connecting taillights.There are new wheel designs for the available 17-, 18-, and 19-inch wheels; and the SE Black Package is back.Inside, the dashboard gets revised with a \"floating\" infotainment system and automatic climate control is now available on the SE trim -- no more need to step up to the SEL.You can also get new colors inside and out, such as a blue interior.Finally, the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine gains 16 horsepower up to 174 via a bunch of minor tweaks including a larger intercooler and revised piston rings and fuel injectors. Torque is unchanged at 184 lb-ft.Perhaps the biggest news is that the seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic transmission is no longer in use on all-wheel-drive models. Now both the front-drive and AWD models an eight-speed automatic.Also standard across VW's car line is IQ.Drive suite of advanced driver-assist features. That includes Travel Assist, Front Assist, blind-spot monitoring, rear traffic alert, adaptive cruise control, lane assist and emergency assist. Park distance control and light assist are available. (Full disclosure: Volkswagen flew me to San Antonio, Texas and fed and housed me for a night so that I could drive the new Taos. I left behind the winter cap but took home a little sewing patch.)The trim walk is simple: S, SE, SE Black, and SEL. S models come with 17-inch wheels (18s for AWD), LED lighting all around, heated steering wheel, Bluetooth, VW App Connect, and more. AWD S models get heated front seats with an All-Weather Package. SE adds dual-zone climate control, adaptive lighting, remote start, roof rails, heated front seats, satellite radio, wireless charging, wireless connection for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, park distance control, and an available Sunroof Package.The SE Black adds a black roof, black spoiler, grille light bar, panoramic sunroof, and 18- or 19-inch wheels depending on whether it's FWD or AWD.SEL models add the light bar, panoramic sunroof, leather seats, cooled front seats, ambient lighting, navigation, larger gauge screen, and dynamic road-sign display.Base price for the S with FWD is $24,995 and $26,695 for AWD. The SE is $27,895/$29,595 ($30,145/$31,845 for the SE Black), and the SEL is AWD only at $34,965. I only had the chance to drive a front-drive SE and my first thought was that it felt almost identical to the previous-gen Taos. Not surprising, since the suspension/chassis/platform sees no real change. What this translated to on the freeways and two-lanes outside of San Antonio was a sporty compact SUV that handles well enough to amuse but not so well that you don't daydream of a performance version.The ride was just fine on the smooth Texas roads, and as is often the case with VW models, the steering felt quite light. Wind noise from the A-pillar was a tad too intrusive, though tire/road noise was only noticeable on certain types of pavement. The interior is now infected with VW's dreaded haptic touch, but the company has at least worked to improve its responses.The extra ponies from the powertrain didn't seem to be too noticeable, but that's fine -- there's enough here for most commuting duty. Speaking of being not noticeable -- the move away from the DSG means no more lurching into park. The eight-speed works without you feeling it.While I didn't drive an AWD model, my colleague over at AutoGuide did, and riding shotgun when he was in Sport mode (the SE FWD I drove had no such option), I could hear the engine sing as it held onto revs while the transmission held onto gears.Fuel economy is listed at 28/36/31 for FWD models and 25/33/28 for AWDs. The SE FWD I tested cost $32,025 with the only option being Cornflower Blue* paint ($455) and $1,425 in D and D fees.*The vehicle used for photos was not the one I drove. Gallery: 2025 Volkswagen Taos My take on the Taos doesn't change just because the styling does -- and by the way, the refresh is mild enough that many folks won't even notice. It's a well-packaged compact crossover that offers more sport than anything in its competitive set save the Mazda CX-30. If you prioritize fun-to-drive in your small SUVs, the Taos is worth a look. Not surprising, of course, for a vehicle that shares its bones with the Golf. I don't love VW's obsession with haptic-touch controls, and a touch more refinement can't hurt. And if sportiness is your ultimate purchase driver, the Mazda might earn your dollars.That said, if balance matters to you, the Taos was already a pretty good package, and now the mechanicals are mildly improved.Sometimes there's no choice but to stay the course.[Images © 2024 Tim Healey/TTAC.com]Become a TTAC insider.
