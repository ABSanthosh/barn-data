According to the shop, the bay was rented out to a third party working on the Chevrolet. With the Corvette already having a salvage title, the dispute has escalated to small claims court. A man in Garland, Texas ,was evidently present when a local shop accidentally dropped his Chevrolet C6 Corvette from a lift. Now, both the shop and the car owner are at an impasse. To make matters worse, the shop may not even have insurance to cover the damage. So, what’s the “right” solution here? That’s still up for debate, but it’s clearly a hot mess. According to a post on Reddit, the shop was in the process of hoisting the Corvette high into the air to work on it before it fell off. As a result, the sports car sat idling on its driver’s side. It seems as though someone called the authorities because a police officer is in at least one photo of the aftermath. Allegedly, the officers suggested that the issue would need to be settled in small claims court—but we’ll come back to that. Read: Clueless Thief Trapped Inside Corvette C8 Begs Owner For Help The shop in question, which is said to be Quick Fix Auto, posted on Facebook to deny that it had any responsibility for the incident. “We have been asked many questions about the Corvette incident and the posting on Facebook and I just want to come on here and say that all we do is rent out a bay from this business and we just focus on tire \u0026 wheel installation, we had no involvement with the incident. From what we know the situation is being handled by the owner and people involved Thank you,” it reads. A Redditor appears to have found a statement from that third party. In part, it says that the car owner wants $17,000 for the car. The third party offered $5,000 or to simply fix the vehicle. On top of all of this, it’s important to note that this Corvette already had a salvage title when it fell off of the lift. One more thing; it has some 175,000 miles on the odometer. A cherry example of a C6 Corvette this wasn’t before it even rolled in. Via Reddit/Facebook Now, let’s take a look at the current Corvette market. The highest mileage C6 available on Autotrader right now has 164,000 miles and the asking price is $18,900. Other cars with similar mileage there sit around that same value. Cars.com tells a similar story. One 2008 Corvette with 152,189 miles has an asking price of $17,995. Notably, none of these cars listed have the same combination of mileage, pricing, and a salvage title so it’s tough to get a clear valuation on the one that fell in Garland. Lastly, despite our attempts to get official comments from everyone involved, what we’ve got here is the classic case of he-said, she-said. So, what’s your take? Is $17,000 too much to ask, or should the owner just take the $5,000 and run? Let us know in the comments below. Image Credit: CorvetteMan69",
