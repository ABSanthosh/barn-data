  "description": "Remember the new Hero Destini 125? Yes, the one we rode almost six months ago. Well, Hero has finally launched the scooter, with prices starting at Rs 80,450 for the base VX variant. The Destini is available in three variants, and Hero claims a 59kpl mileage figure for the model.  The Destini 125 gets an all-new design Three variants are available  It runs on 12-inch wheels at both ends Hero Destini 125 launch details The Destini is powered by the same air-cooled, 124cc, single-cylinder mill making 9hp and 10.4Nm of torque, mated to a CVT gearbox. While this engine is the same as the one on the previous Destini, Hero has made a lot of internal changes to help improve refinement, resulting in lower NVH levels. Another big mechanical change is that the Destini 125 now rolls on 12-inch wheels at both ends, just like the Xoom. With this generation change, the top ZX variants also come with a 190mm front disc, another first for the Destini. The under-seat storage on the Destini 125 can hold 19 litres. Hero has equipped the Destini with a lot of new features in this generation, such as auto-cancelling indicators, a boot light, and backlit switchgear. The bike also gets Hero’s patented i3S start/stop tech, which would have played a role in helping the Destini achieve the claimed 59 kpl mileage figure.   The base VX variant comes with a front drum brake and a digital-analogue dash, while the higher ZX variants get a front disc and a fully digital, Bluetooth-compatible display. All variants come with dedicated colour schemes, and the ZX variants get different types of chrome finishes.  The most affordable variant of the Destini is the VX, priced at Rs 80,450, followed by the mid-ZX variant at Rs 89,300, and finally, the range-topping ZX+ variant at Rs 90,300. Rivals to the Hero Destini 125 include the popular Suzuki Access 125, TVS Jupiter 125, Yamaha Fascino 125, and Honda Activa 125. Also See:  Hero Destini 125 review: Destined to succeed?
