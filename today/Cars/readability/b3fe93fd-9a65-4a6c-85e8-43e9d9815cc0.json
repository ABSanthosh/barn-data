  "description": "This 2005 Ford GT is one of 2,022 built for the model year and is a no-top-stripe example. It was first owned by Barry Meguiar, President of Meguiar’s Inc. and former host of Car Crazy, and purchased by its current owner on BaT in September 2023. Finished in Mark II Black over Ebony leather upholstery, the car is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. It was factory optioned with forged aluminum BBS wheels, red-finished brake calipers, and a McIntosh stereo system, and additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. This Ford GT now has 5,700 miles and is offered on dealer consignment in Illinois with owner's manuals, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Utah title.",

It was first owned by Barry Meguiar, President of Meguiar’s Inc. and former host of Car Crazy, and purchased by its current owner on BaT in September 2023. Finished in Mark II Black over Ebony leather upholstery, the car is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. It was factory optioned with forged aluminum BBS wheels, red-finished brake calipers, and a McIntosh stereo system, and additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. This Ford GT now has 5,700 miles and is offered on dealer consignment in Illinois with owner’s manuals, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Utah title. The Camilo Pardo-designed GT was styled as an homage to the Le Mans-winning GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features aluminum body panels over an extruded-aluminum space frame and roll-bonded floors. This example is one of 238 finished in Mark II Black for the model year, and it is not equipped with over-the-top racing stripes. The side stripes have been removed, and features include Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are mounted with 235/45 and 315/40, respectively, Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires produced in 2015. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and rubber mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjustable seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column, and the GT40-inspired instrument array houses a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 5,700 miles, approximately 900 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. A replacement Optima Redtop battery was installed under current ownership. Work to address a “whine noise” and test the charging system and electric draws was carried out in April 2025, with the associated service record provided in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. The underside of the front hood has been signed by Barry Meguiar, and the rear firewall bears the signature of Chris Theodore, former Ford Vice President of Product Development.
