This modified SVT Raptor has 5k miles and is now offered in Colorado on dealer consignment with a Ford window sticker, modification documentation, an owner’s manual, spare parts, and a clean Wyoming title. The four-door truck is finished in Oxford White and features the Waldoch Raptor-X package including an N-Fab tubular front bumper with PIAA driving lights, a graphics kit, billet door seals, and a color-keyed grille, fender flares, and vents. Additional exterior equipment includes Hennessey VelociRaptor 650 badging, xenon headlights, a sunroof, front- and rear-view cameras, a power-sliding rear window, running boards, a keyless entry keypad, and a receiver hitch. The optional Raptor Plus Package added a backup camera and trailer brake controller. The Waldoch Raptor-X 20″ wheels are mounted with 35×12.5″ Cooper Discoverer STT tires. The Raptor is equipped with aluminum front control arms and Fox Racing internal-bypass shocks with increased suspension travel and additional modifications include a big brake kit and a 2″ leveling kit. The cab features heated and cooled power-adjustable front bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in Black leather and cloth along with a blue-accent instrument panel appliqué. The front headrests feature Hennessey embroidery and interior amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control, power-adjustable pedals, remote start, navigation, a six-disc CD stereo, SYNC infotainment, cruise control, and auxiliary switches. A carbon fiber dashboard and door bezels were fitted as part of the Waldoch Raptor-X package. Plaques on the dashboard and in the engine bay identify this truck as a VelociRaptor 650 with serial number #003. The leather-wrapped steering wheel has a red centering stripe and frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,900-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, transmission temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The 6.2-liter V8 was modified by Hennessey Performance with installation of a 2.9-liter Whipple supercharger, American Racing long-tube exhaust headers, a Corsa Performance exhaust system, an air-to-water intercooler, a performance intake, a retuned ECU, and upgraded fuel injectors. An oil change and inspection were carried out in June 2025. Power is delivered to the rear or all four wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The rear axle features an electronically locking differential with 4.88:1 gears. The removed 4.10:1 gearing accompanies the truck. Documentation displayed in the gallery provides total costs and includes Hennessey sales orders for the VelociRaptor 650 package, big brake kit, Corsa exhaust system, and American Racing headers in addition to a Ford window sticker, a 2013 purchase agreement, a Waldoch Crafts Raptor-X build sheet, and more.
