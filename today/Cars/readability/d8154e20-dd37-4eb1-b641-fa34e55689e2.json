  "description": "The MG Windsor has reached a new production milestone; MG Motor India has announced today that it has produced 15,000 units of the EV at its Halol plant. The brand has also revealed that just 15 percent of MG Windsor buyers have opted for the Battery as a Service (BaaS) scheme, and that the brand receives approximately 200 bookings a day for the EV, prompting an increase in production. MG Windsor BaaS sales MG Windsor buyers prefer to buy the EV outright than opt for battery rental scheme That just 15 percent of Windsor buyers choose the BaaS scheme indicates a clear preference to buy the model outright. The table below shows that with the recent hike in Windsor prices, there is a uniform Rs 4 lakh difference between the total ex-showroom price and how much those who opt for the battery rental scheme would pay upfront. However, it should be noted that there has been a corresponding increase in the cost of renting the battery as well, from Rs 3.5 per km to Rs 3.9 per km.

As our MG Windsor battery rental feature explained, BaaS is essentially is a finance scheme backed by specific third-party financiers, and each has their own terms and conditions. Resale of an MG Windsor bought via the BaaS programme also becomes more complicated. The brand does offer a buyback scheme, with a value of up to 60 percent of the car, under its MG Shield plan to alleviate some of the concerns regarding selling a used Windsor. It should be noted that depending on one’s usage, the BaaS scheme may be beneficial as customers can choose their preferred package. There are various options for different periods, such as a 3-year, or 5-year or 8-year plans. Top-spec MG Windsor Essence trim accounts for 80 percent of bookings IMAGE SOURCE Along with confirming that the brand receives about 200 bookings for the Windsor every day, MG Motor India has also said that about 80 percent of bookings are for the top-spec Essence variant, which is priced at Rs 16 lakh. The entry-level Windsor Excite and mid-spec Exclusive variants, together, account for 20 percent of bookings. Sales of the Windsor have been helping MG Motor India significantly as, in the first three months of being on sale, the EV already accounted for 49 percent of the brand’s total. In fact, by the end of December, MG Windsor wholesales had crossed the 10,000 unit mark. Demand for the MG Windsor has prompted plans to increase production capacity at the company’s plant in Halol, Gujarat. Biju Balendran, deputy MD, JSW MG Motor India, said that they are increasing the capacity to meet rising demand, and confirmed, “We are undertaking certain facility modifications to ensure readiness for new products under MG Select, which is due for launch in the first half of this year. Hence, we anticipate a production slowdown during the month of February, which may temporarily affect our wholesales during this period.” The company will soon announce prices for the first MG Select model, the Cyberster, and then will launch the M9 MPV, by March.   All prices, ex-showroom, India Also see: Tata Nexon EV vs MG Windsor: performance compared MG Windsor EV real world range tested, explained MG Astor 1.3-litre turbo-petrol engine axed",
