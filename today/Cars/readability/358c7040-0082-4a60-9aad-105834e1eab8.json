  "description": "Chinese motorcycle giant CFMoto has been making waves in overseas markets with a series of well-equipped, good-to-ride motorcycles that are sold with enticingly low price tags. As the company gears up to re-enter the Indian market after a short-lived first attempt in 2019, it invited us to its global launch event to experience some of its latest products. CFMoto 675SR-R design, engine The first of these was the new 675SR-R, which, on the surface, looks like a rival to the sub-100hp street-oriented sportbikes like the new Triumph Daytona 660, the Suzuki GSX-8R and the Honda CBR650R. This is why CFMoto’s decision to let us ride the bike on the mighty Portimao racetrack seemed puzzling at first, but it started to make sense once we met the bike. Unlike the above-mentioned rivals, this bike takes on more of a sporty identity with much more committed ergonomics that are closer to a proper supersport. The 675cc three-cylinder engine also sounds very supersport, and the immediate assumption is that it has been ‘benchmarked’ from the erstwhile Triumph 675 motor. However, the spec sheet reveals that the bore and stroke figures are quite different here, and this motor actually finds its roots in CFMoto’s 450cc twin-cylinder engine that receives one more cylinder here: 450 + 225 = 675. What you get is an engine that produces 88.6hp at 11,000rpm and 68Nm at 8,250rpm. The sound from the compact exhaust is similar to the Moto2 howl that you get from the Triumph and Yamaha triples, and it’s quite a loud note as well. CFMoto 675SR-R handling, performance Portimao is a wild circuit with huge crests and drops and plenty of blind sections, with no reference points to whether the next corner goes left or right. It took me a couple of sessions to learn the track well enough to be able to commit to proper speeds, and the 675 never felt out of its depth as the pace went up. The power on offer was perfect for my lack of track knowledge, and it resulted in a fast motorcycle but not one that was overwhelmingly so. What needs improvement is the throttle connection, which feels a bit too sharp on the initial opening and, occasionally, a little inconsistent. Midrange torque should be impressive on the street, but with the rollercoaster-like undulations on this track, it was vital to keep the revs up. However, the rev limiter hits quite hard, and running into that with the bike leaned over between corners was a little unsettling. Aside from these issues, the performance was strong and enjoyable, and I saw just over 220kph before braking for the first corner. The front suspension is fully adjustable. With twin 300mm front rotors and J Juan calipers, the stopping performance was actually quite impressive. There was good power and feel, although this circuit has more of a flowing nature without too many brutal hard-braking zones. The main issue with the brakes was that the ABS could be quite intrusive, and many riders elected to deactivate it for the final run by pulling the fuse. CFMoto 675SR-R ergonomics, underpinnings The SR-R weighs 189 kilos, and the seat height is 810mm – both pretty good numbers for a motorcycle like this. Suspension is handled by KYB components: a fully adjustable 41mm USD fork and a preload and rebound adjustable monoshock. The tubular steel chassis and aluminium swingarm, along with the KYB suspension, resulted in a sharp yet predictable riding experience, with the bike turning well and holding a line across this fast-flowing circuit. It didn’t feel out of its depth when thrown into some really fast corners, including the final turn – which is a long downhill right-hander that leads into the main straight – at nearly 180kph.  Aero makes up a big part of the 675’s design. Even the CST tyres were surprisingly good, and while the past experience with these Chinese tyres hasn’t been positive, the new semi-slick tyres on the SR-R were never a cause for concern. Chassis-wise, the only limiting factor was the footpeg feelers that ground down once the pace went up. CFMoto says that removing them will not be a problem, but it wanted to keep them on the bikes for this event as they help protect parts like the exhaust in case the bike goes down and slides along the tarmac.  CFMoto 675 SR-R features It’s no surprise that this is a well-equipped motorcycle, and it has a sharp, functional TFT display, along with dual-channel ABS, two-level traction control and a tyre pressure monitoring system. The traction control was smooth enough that I left it in its lower setting on the track without any issues. A cable-operated throttle means the SR-R only has a quickshifter, but CFMoto says it is working on a ride-by-wire system that will enable a blipper as well. There’s also an optional “T-Box” module with a 4G SIM that unlocks a myriad of connected features.  TFT display is smooth, informative and easy to read. CFMoto 675SR-R price, India launch On its own, the CFMoto 675SR-R is a good motorcycle that will probably be quicker than any of its sub-100hp rivals around a racetrack. There are a few blemishes in it that need to be polished out, but they’re all fixable, and at the rate that CFMoto is churning out new and impressive bikes, I don’t think it will be long before the company does so. But as you would expect with CFMoto, the real kicker here is the price, which, at 7,590 euros, is just 200 euros more than a Honda CBR500R. CFMoto is planning its India launch by the middle of this year, and while the 675 is not immediately on the cards, it is being considered for our market. If the company can manage to undercut its Japanese and British rivals by around Rs 2 lakh, as it does overseas, that will make this a very tempting option indeed. CFMoto 675NK quick review We also had the opportunity to ride the 675SR-R’s naked sibling, the 675NK. This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. The 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R. We got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.

This bike is very closely based on its faired sibling, and it has the same chassis, suspension, tyres and engine. Power output is also unchanged at 88.6hp and 68Nm, and the NK even weighs the same 189kg. The main differences are in the design and the riding position, with the NK taking on a traditional streetfighter look and benefiting from a more comfortable riding position, thanks to the higher-set handlebar. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250312052501_1.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe 675NK is mechanically identical to the 675 SR-R.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe got to ride this bike on a large FIA-spec go-kart track, and it exhibited all the strong points displayed by its faired sibling. However, there were some inconsistencies in the throttle feel between the two bikes. Prices aren’t confirmed yet but expect to see the same aggressive positioning that places it against Japanese rivals from a segment below.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso See:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/cfmoto-india-re-entry-in-mid-2025-likely-with-450mt-434629\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCFMoto India re-entry in mid-2025 likely with 450MT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-434825\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-434825\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-imghref-id-434825\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-images-container-434825\"\u003eImages\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-434825\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-434825\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
