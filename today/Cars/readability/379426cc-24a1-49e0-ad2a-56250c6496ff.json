I’d be surprised if there were more Hondas on display rocking their original motors than engine-swapped examples. K20, K24, B18, and B16 engines are everywhere these days as if there’s a secret team at Honda keeping the production lines alive. And that’s before we even get to the topic of Honda swaps in other makes. Whether it’s FWD, RWD, AWD, naturally aspirated, or turbocharged, there’s bound to be someone who’s completed some form of conversion. There’s even a guy out there designing a ‘K36′ inline-six engine. Pure madness. It’s hard to stand out with a Honda build these days, but Ryan Basseri and the team at Rywire Motorsport Electronics are doing just that with not one, but two outrageous Civics headed for the 2024 SEMA Show in November. First, let’s take a look at Ryan’s Milano Red EK Civic hatchback, which is still in the early stages of its build. So, how did this project come about? “I’ve always wanted to build an EK for myself, so this was a great way to kill two birds with one stone – easy brand recognition and development [of electric drive systems],” Ryan says. This isn’t Rywire’s first foray into electronic systems or electric cars. The company has built a reputation for its expertise in automotive electrical work; look through its product catalogue, and you’ll find hundreds of applications. With so much variety (think wiring kits to power distribution modules), it’s no surprise that Ryan and his team are always advancing their expertise. Enter their most ambitious project yet: an S2000 retrofitted with a Tesla motor and Chevrolet battery. Ryan explains: “The S2000 was a bare chassis given to me by a buddy. I was going to build a Civic first, but the S2000 was the path of least resistance.” “I wanted to learn how EV systems work, and the S2000 was a decent choice given the motor selection and fitment,” Ryan recalls, clearly having learnt a thing or two from the project and finally applying that knowledge to a Civic. While the EK sports timeless modifications, the S2000 looks like something from the future, tucked away in Rywire’s headquarters. “The goal for the S2000 was to have it scream ‘electric!” says Ryan. And Rywire nailed it with radical custom bodywork. But that’s not the aim for the hatchback. The 16-inch Desmond RegaMaster EVO wheels, wrapped in Toyo Proxes R888R tyres, add a fantastic touch. Those with a keen eye might have spotted the 5×114.3 hub conversion accommodating the five-stud wheels. Behind them, a Spoon Sports front big brake kit and bespoke KW Motorsport coilovers all around. At this stage of the build, the suspension components have had their initial fitting, the setup featuring PCI control arms and linkages and S1Built rear trailing arms for AWD. Yes, you read that right – AWD. You’re looking at the foundation of a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive EK Civic. I’ll share more specifics once we feature the complete build, but expect roughly 600hp from the dual motors, with an 85kWh battery good for about 400 miles of range, and a 0-60mph time I can’t quite comprehend. The engine bay is fascinating, even in its semi-complete state. There’s something so alien about an enormous electric motor residing where you’d expect to see a recognisable B-series engine. Funnily enough, though, the most interesting details are the ones that can be recognised. The splash of purple from the KW top mounts is one thing, but the beefy CSF Race radiator is something else entirely. You find CSF cooling solutions in many big-power builds, however, these products almost seem wrong in an EV. Remember, though, electric motors and batteries generate a lot of heat. As with the coilovers, brakes, and chassis components, Ryan has sourced parts from the top of the aftermarket world to create this wild Civic. I’m excited to share the build progress, especially given the innovative approach being taken. With classic touches from US and JDM EK Civics, paired with cutting-edge parts for the EV swap, this build is a labour of love for Ryan. As earlier mentioned, this isn’t the only Civic the RyWire team is preparing for SEMA.
