  "description": "The monsoon is a tough time for any motorcycle helmet. Even the best lids in the world eventually succumb to the odour buildup that comes from having wet interiors for prolonged periods of time. Fogging is another issue, and it can happen even in a hot city like Mumbai if the visor is closed in heavy rain and you’re stuck in a traffic jam. This is the ideal time to try out some helmet-specific care products, and Big Bad Bikes sells a little kit from Muc-Off for just that purpose. Helpfully named the Helmet Care Kit, you get three products and two fancy microfibre cleaning cloths. The products include an anti-fog spray, a foam cleaner and another small spray bottle for cleaning your helmet, goggles and visor. Let’s start with the foam cleaner, which shoots out a thick blast of foam that you are supposed to fill your helmet (or gloves/boots) with. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe away the excess before leaving the helmet to dry. The foam does a really good job of getting rid of the odours and giving the helmet a fresh feel, and it’s something I’ll make sure to have around every monsoon. The anti-fog spray also worked a treat, and the effect lasts for quite a few days as long as you don’t touch or wipe down the surface. It’s also claimed to help water bead away if you spray it onto the outside of your visor, but this effect wasn’t as impressive as I’d like. My go-to product for that hydrophobic coating on a visor remains the Motosolutions Rain Coat cream that we reviewed a few years ago. As for the little bottle of helmet and visor cleaner, it works as advertised and is helpful at getting stubborn stains or dead bugs off. Then again, I usually get the same job done with a mild soap solution, and while the Muc-Off cleaner takes a little less effort, it’s not a game-changer. Muc-Off makes some really interesting products, and many of them are biodegradable, which is always a nice thing. On the other hand, its products are also expensive, and this kit will cost you just over Rs 2,700. Happily, you don’t need to buy the whole kit, and if you’d like just one or two products in particular, they’re all also sold separately by Big Bad Bikes.
