  "description": "What does the collector car community need more than anything else? Young technicians, of course. There is a severe lack of youths finding themselves in automotive restoration positions. Without the hands needed to repair, maintain, and preserve classic vehicles, car culture has a real employment crisis on its hands. Yet paradoxically, there are more than enough young. And passionate car enthusiasts considering a career with classic cars. So, what’s the problem? Why aren’t these young people ending up in exciting car careers? Unfortunately, overcoming the hurdles required in order to make it as a budding technician is extremely challenging. Not to mention leaving no practical means to enter the trade. This is where the Piston Foundation enters the chat. [avatar user=\"Piston Foundation\" size=\"120\" align=\"left\"  link=\"https://pistonfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\"][/avatar] Visit the Piston Foundation website The solution The Piston Foundation was founded in 2021 to solve the workforce shortage plaguing the collector car community. We’re creating a career pathway that will support aspiring technicians from the classroom to the car shop floor. Here’s how we aim to do it: The Piston Scholarship provides financial aid to those enrolled in a 2- to 4-year auto tech or restoration program. Technical education is expensive and those tuition costs can pose a real barrier to entry into the world of cars. Students who apply and are accepted for a scholarship may receive up to $5,000 to help fund their automotive education. To date, we’ve granted scholarships to 33 promising students and are looking forward to announcing our 2024 class of scholars later this summer. The Piston Academy Apprenticeship takes hands-on training to the next level by taking qualified restoration graduates and placing them in a full-time job at a Piston-partnered shop. Even graduates from the best restoration programs won’t have gained all the necessary hands-on experience to land a full-time, billable job. As such, the biggest barrier new apprentices face is the disparity between what they can be paid in an entry level role and the cost of living needed to reside in their city of work. The Piston Academy’s apprenticeship program provides a training grant so apprentices can gain the necessary work experience and shops can afford to invest in a new wave of talent. The apprenticeship is currently in a trial stage with a widespread model potentially slated for 2025.

Asking the question to Piston Foundation President and COO Jeff Mason: \"The Piston career initiative supports aspiring technicians with both education and job networking. This way, they can learn the skills that earn them a job in the collector car industry. We measure our success by the number of scholarship applications we receive, the number of returning Piston Scholars,  the school-year completion rate of our scholars, and the number of graduated Piston scholars working in the industry. Since our career program began in 2022, Piston has awarded 53 scholarships totaling $197,500 to auto restoration students at schools in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and our applicants have come from 37 states. In 2024, Piston received its highest number of scholarship applications yet, indicating a strong interest in these careers. Nine of this year’s 20 scholars have earned an award more than once, with one three-time recipient. The completion rate of Piston Scholars since 2022 is 98% and all nine of our scholars who have graduated from their school programs are now working in the industry. The Piston career initiative is making the impact our donors want to see by creating a pipeline of talent who will help the car community continue to thrive.\" Continue...",
