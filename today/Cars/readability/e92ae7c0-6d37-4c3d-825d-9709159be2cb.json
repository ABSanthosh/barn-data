  "description": "Soon after the launch of the KTM 390 Enduro R here, KTM responded to negative feedback about the reduced suspension travel for India by confirming that it would also launch the export-spec bike with the full-length suspension. That bike has now been launched at Rs 3.54 lakh ex-showroom. Costs Rs 15,000 more than the India-spec model Comes with 230mm suspension travel For India, Bajaj reduced the suspension travel on the KTM 390 Enduro R to 200mm/205mm at both ends. This resulted in a lower 860mm seat, and while the suspension was still capable, purists were unhappy with the compromise. Now, they can get their hands on the full international-spec bike for just Rs 15,000 more. The main difference is that the suspension travel is now 230mm at both ends. As a result, seat height goes up by 35mm to 895mm, and ground clearance also increases from 253mm to 277mm. Beyond that, the bike is largely the same, and it continues with the Mitas EO7 Enduro Trail+ tyres. Kerb weight is unchanged at 177kg as well.    The KTM 390 Enduro R is based on the same platform as the KTM 390 Adventure, and it can be considered a stripped-down ADV more than a hardcore Enduro. The bike gets a smaller 9-litre fuel tank and a slim TFT display to go with its dirt-bike-inspired bodywork. However, the main chassis and the engine are the same as the 390 Adventure, with a 399cc single-cylinder engine that makes 46hp and 39Nm of torque.  You can read our first ride review of the India-spec KTM 390 Enduro R here, or click here to read the comparison review with its similarly priced rival, the Kawasaki KLX 230.  Also see: KTM 390 Adventure X with cruise control launched at Rs 3.03 lakh",
