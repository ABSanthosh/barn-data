  "text": "Fortunately, the interior of this 740i, a great place to spend time, has been left untouched 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson This 7-Series has an odd dual-colored wrap with fluorescent yellow and purple. Complementing the new wrap are tightly-spoked wheels and yellow brake calipers. Some color combinations are a match made in heaven, while others make you wonder what kind of twisted minds put them together. Take purple and yellow, for example, two colors that, on their own, can work wonders in certain settings but, when paired together, can look like a neon nightmare. So, naturally, a vinyl shop in the US decided to test the limits of taste by slapping these two hues onto a BMW 7-Series. Now, let’s talk about the7-Series. The current generation of BMW’s flagship sedan isn’t exactly a looker, sporting massive kidney grilles, oddly-shaped lights, and altogether ungainly proportions. But, thanks to a purple and yellow wrap, this 740i somehow cranks that awkwardness up to 11. Read: This BMW Prototype Hides A Solid Secret Adorning the lower half of the body is a fluorescent yellow wrap, while all the parts above the shoulder line are finished with a purple wrap. It isn’t easy for any car to pull off a tennis ball-colored finish, unless it’s an Abarth 500e, so it’s hardly a surprise it doesn’t work on a full-size luxury limo. Photos 404 Elite Autos/Instagram We’ll give credit where it’s due. The purple is actually a decent shade. It’s got this bright, metallic finish that makes it sparkle under the sun. Had the entire car been wrapped in this color, it probably would have looked great. Alas, that’s not the case. The wrap isn’t the only change made by 404 Elite Autos. The car also sits on a set of tightly-spoked aftermarket wheels with a black finish, sitting over color-matched yellow brake calipers. The cabin looks original, which we guess is a good thing. That’s because as wacky as the 7-Series may look from the outside, it has a very premium interior that’s among the best in its class. Plus, if you’re sitting inside, you have the advantage of not being exposed to the questionable bodywork and that paint scheme. Photos 404 Elite Autos/Instagram",
