  "text": "The 30-story tower will be home to a stylish garage designed by Horacio Pagani July 24, 2025 at 21:01 by Michael Gauthier The Pagani Residences has unveiled an ultra-luxury garage worthy of Pagani owners. It features a unique exterior design as well as an interior that looks like an art gallery. Residents will be able to purchase private garages, which have fancy doors and two bays. Automotive-themed luxury residences have exploded in popularity and we’ve seen numerous brands throw their hat into the ring. Pagani is among them as they teamed up with Riviera Horizons for an exclusive tower in North Bay Village, Florida. While we haven’t heard much about the project since it was announced last year, the development is moving forward and they’ve given us a glimpse at their luxurious garage. Just like Pagani cars, the garage promises to transcend simple description and be a “true architectural gallery designed for those who appreciate high-performance vehicles.” More: Miami’s $2.4 Million Pagani Residences Blend Luxury With Hypercar Exclusivity This isn’t just marketing hyperbole as they tapped a man who knows a thing or two about hypercars. We’re talking about Horacio Pagani himself. He created a unique exterior façade, which combines perforated aluminum with elliptical accents. The latter are a nod to the Pagani Ellipse, which is a common theme throughout the garage. Besides giving the building a unique presence, the perforations serve a purpose as they allow natural light to flow into the garage. The openings also help to improve ventilation, which will certainly be welcome during hot and humid summers.   The interior looks more like an art gallery than a garage as we can see stylish lights and high-end accents. If a standard parking space isn’t secure enough, residents can purchase a private garage. The latter has a stylish glass and metal door that makes it seem more like an exhibit than a parking space. The private garage has two bays and features an elliptical “Welcome Home” message. Elsewhere, there appears to be tire storage space (or decorations) integrated into the walls. The 30-story tower will be home to 70 all-corner residences with two to four bedrooms. They’ll be fully furnished and feature terraces as well as an Italian-designed Schiffini kitchen with a large island. Other highlights include Gaggenau appliances, high-end wood flooring, and “ensuite bathrooms with extraordinary bay views.” Clients can also opt for two-story penthouses that span between 10,723 and 12,156 square feet (996 to 1129 square meters). These grand residences have larger terraces, higher ceilings, and a private pool with a hot tub.",
