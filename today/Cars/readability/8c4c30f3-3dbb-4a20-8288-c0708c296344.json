  "description": "This 1986 Tiga is one of 10 GT286 sports racing prototypes built by Tiga Race Cars Ltd. for competition during the 1986 season in either the FIA Group C2 or IMSA Lights classes. Chassis 321 was delivered new to US driver and team owner Charles Morgan, who campaigned it through a 1986 season that was highlighted by a class victory at Watkins Glen. The car then raced for Ares Sports through the 1987 season before being acquired by Bobby Brown Racing, who campaigned it into the early 1990s and fitted it with spyder-style bodywork before its retirement from racing in 1995. After changing hands in the mid-2000s, the car was disassembled for a refurbishment that reportedly included a rebuild of its chassis tub by Tiga Race Cars in England. It was purchased in an unfinished state in 2019 by the seller, who subsequently completed the project before campaigning the car to a class win at the 2023 Le Mans Classic. Finished in a multicolor livery over reproduction body panels, the car is powered by a 4.2-liter Buick V6 that features MoTeC engine management and is mated to a Hewland FGC five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include AP ventilated disc brakes, inboard coilover dampers, staggered-width 16” alloy wheels, a molded seat with a six-point harness, and a fire-suppression system. This Tiga GT286 is now offered in Essex, England, with a Tiga history report, an FIA Historic Technical Passport, invoices, a collection of spares, and a bill of sale.",

Additional features include AP ventilated disc brakes, inboard coilover dampers, staggered-width 16” alloy wheels, a molded seat with a six-point harness, and a fire-suppression system. This Tiga GT286 is now offered in Essex, England, with a Tiga history report, an FIA Historic Technical Passport, invoices, a collection of spares, and a bill of sale. Tiga Race Cars was founded by Tim Schenken and Howden Ganley in 1974 and produced both open- and closed-wheel cars for a variety of formulae before introducing a World Sportscar Championship Group C2 contender in 1983. After successes in 1985 that included a class win at Le Mans and a Group C2 championship title, Tiga introduced a larger successor to compete in both Group C and IMSA Lights in 1986. Referred to as the GC286 or GT286 depending on which of the two series it contested, the model was based on an aluminum honeycomb chassis over which carbon-composite body panels were wrapped. This example’s chassis tub is said to have been rebuilt on a Tiga jig prior to the seller’s purchase. Reproduction bodywork includes a carbon-fiber and Kevlar tail section and a fiberglass front panel and is finished in a white, black, red, and orange Buick motorsport livery. Features include faired-in headlights, dual NACA ducts at the edge of the nose, high-mount side mirrors, a dual-plane rear wing, and a rear diffuser. Multipiece 16″ alloy wheels are wrapped in Avon racing slicks. Stopping is handled by AP disc brakes with slotted and ventilated rotors and four-piston aluminum calipers at each corner along with front cooling hoses and dual master cylinders with adjustable bias. Suspension incorporates inboard-mounted coilover dampers and adjustable anti-roll bars at each end, and the suspension system was analyzed in 2022 by GSD RaceDyn in Berkshire, England. The cockpit houses a single molded seat equipped with a red OMP six-point harness. Additional features include a right-hand shifter, a fire-suppression system, and an electrical cutoff switch. The MOMO steering wheel sits on a quick-release hub ahead of a Stack ST8100 unit with a 10k-rpm tachometer and configurable digital display. The carbon-fiber dashboard panel also hosts toggle switchgear and aircraft-style fuses. The car is not equipped with an odometer, and total mileage is unknown. The mid-mounted 4.2-liter Buick V6 is said to have been built in 2023 by George Montgomery in Dayton, Ohio, and features dry-sump lubrication, dual radiators flanking the engine bay, and MoTeC M800 engine management with internals concealed within a period Buick ECU casing. The results of an April 2023 dynamometer test are viewable in the photo gallery below and show peaks of 426.4 horsepower and 328 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Hewland FGC five-speed manual transaxle that was overhauled by Mark Bailey Racing in Wiltshire, England, in 2022. A collection of spares that accompanies the car includes two sets of wheels and various other parts. The car is shown above during the 2023 Le Mans Classic, where it won its class in Group C competition and finished third in its class in a Group C sprint race. Trophies from the race shown in the gallery are not included in the sale. The car’s FIA Historic Technical Passport lists an expiration date at the end of 2032. Additional documents shown in the gallery include a history report provided by Tiga Race Cars Ltd. The car does not have a title, as it is not legal for street use. It is being offered for off-road use on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
