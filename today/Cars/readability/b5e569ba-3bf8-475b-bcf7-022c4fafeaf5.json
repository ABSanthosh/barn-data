  "description": "The Jeep Meridian is set to get a facelift, and as previous spy shots had shown, it’ll get subtle design changes, more features than the outgoing model, and come with an ADAS suite. The big news, though, is that the Meridian will be available in 5-seat and 7-seat forms. Jeep India has announced the commencement of bookings for the refreshed SUV for Rs 50,000. Jeep Meridian facelift gets altered grille design Interior gets new trims and upholstery 2.0-litre diesel engine expected to continue unchanged Autocar India reported in August that the Meridian will get a 5-seat version. The 5-seat Meridian should help Jeep price the large SUV a bit more competitively – the outgoing model’s starting price was Rs 31.23 lakh (the range tops off at Rs 39.83 lakh). However, it remains to be seen how the Meridian will be positioned compared to the Compass (Rs 18.99 lakh-32.41 lakh), on which it is based. This article was published in the August 2024 issue of Autocar India. The teasers on Jeep India’s website show that the Meridian facelift gets a mildly altered grille design – the honeycomb mesh in the seven-slat grille now has chrome studs. New alloy wheel designs for the 18-inchers are also expected, along with other minor tweaks, as seen in the previous spy shots. The biggest change on the Meridian facelift will be the addition of a Level 2 ADAS suite. Other feature additions include an expanded list of connected car tech. The cabin has a three-layer dashboard with a grey finish instead of the outgoing model’s beige one, and the chrome strip has been replaced with a copper finish strip. The 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen will continue, as will the 9-speaker Alpine audio system, wireless charger, front ventilated seats and other creature comforts and tech. Jeep India has confirmed that the Meridian facelift will get a 9-speed automatic option, along with 4x2 and 4x4 variants. We expect the outgoing model’s 170hp, 350Nm, 2.0-litre diesel engine to continue. The brand has been evaluating a petrol engine for the Compass in India, which could feature in the Meridian as well. However, this is unlikely to happen at launch. All prices, ex-showroom, India Also see: Next gen Jeep Compass teased ahead of 2025 global debut Jeep Compass Anniversary Edition launched at Rs 25.26 lakh We aspire to play in the sub Rs 20 lakh segment: Stellantis India MD \u0026 CEO",
