  "text": "The California driver was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, but police say he is expected to survive November 6, 2024 at 19:55 by Stephen Rivers A Mazda driver who evidently evaded police drove off of a cliff in Carlsbad, California. The man went to the hospital with life-threatening injuries but will likely survive. The car itself is barely recognizable after its fall. California police witnessed a bizarre sequence of events on Monday involving a Mazda driver who seemed intent on turning a routine traffic mishap into a cinematic spectacle. The saga began with a fence collision and a quick getaway, escalated with a police evasion, and concluded with the car hurtling off a cliff onto the beach below. Miraculously, the Mazda’s occupant survived the plunge and, despite severe injuries, is expected to recover. According to the Carlsbad Police Department, an officer saw the Mazda crash into a fence in the 2400 block of Impala Drive at around 4 p.m. Authorities say the driver “fled the scene recklessly,” and so officers attempted to make a traffic stop. However, the motorist didn’t stop. Just west of Avenida Encinas, the officers actually broke off pursuit for safety reasons.

Officers immediately called for emergency services and then descended the cliff on foot to provide life-saving measures. NBC San Diego spoke to a local who saw parts of the chase. “I at first thought it was a regular traffic stop when I saw him, but when I saw the four police vehicles following him, I was like, ‘This is definitely something different,'” the person said. “I saw the car go off the cliff. It sounded like an explosion, honestly. It was similar to a firework. It was just one big thud. It sounded like a wave breaking — a really hard wave. It was insane.” Rescue teams eventually extracted the driver and rushed them to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. At this stage, they’re expected to survive. For the time being, it’s unclear what led the driver to make so many errant choices. Interestingly, police don’t believe at this stage that drugs or alcohol were involved. What is clear is that the Mazda did an amazing job of sheltering the driver and sustaining their life until rescue workers could arrive.  Road Closure Alert 4:55 p.m. – Carlsbad Blvd in both directions from Cerezo Dr to Island Way, as well as westbound Palomar Airport Road from Avenida Encinas, are closed due to a vehicle that went over a cliff. Please use an alternate route while we conduct our investigation. — Carlsbad Police (@CarlsbadPolice) November 5, 2024 Image Credit: CBS 8 San Diego",
