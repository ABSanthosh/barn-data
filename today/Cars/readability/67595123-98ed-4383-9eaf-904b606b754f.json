  "description": "CNG-powered car sales touched a record high in 2024. Sure, the rising cost of petrol has fuelled a sharp increase in their demand, but manufacturers have also done their bit to draw in buyers. In contrast to the few taxi-spec CNG options available a few years ago, now there’s a wide variety of CNG models across different price bands and even body styles. Joining the CNG bandwagon is the new fourth-generation Maruti Swift priced between Rs 8.20 lakh and 9.20 lakh, which places it a notch higher than its natural rival, the Hyundai Nios CNG (Rs 7.68 lakh to Rs 8.38 lakh), almost in the premium hatchback territory. To find out whether Maruti has really upped its game, we pit it against the Tata Altroz iCNG (Rs 7.60 lakh to Rs 11.00 lakh) that’s already made its mark in its segment. So, which CNG hatchback should you put your money on? Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG exterior design Altroz larger than Swift Respectable 210-litre boot despite CNG tanks below; Instrument cluster execution could have been better; Front armrest adds to driver comfort; LED headlamps missing even in the top variant. The Altroz is larger than the Swift in every dimension, and its wheelbase is substantially longer, too. It is also the more stylish and well-proportioned hatchback that continues to turn heads, commendably nearly five years since launch. With its chiselled body lines, sharp creases and aggressive stance, the Altroz exudes a bold and premium look. Its wide grille, sleek headlamps and sporty 16-inch alloy wheels enhance its road presence. On the other hand, the Maruti Swift retains its signature silhouette, but the fourth-generation model features a curvier, more youthful design. Its rounded headlamps, prominent grille and sculpted bodywork lend it a fresh appeal. While it may not be as striking as the Altroz, it has a charm that resonates well with younger buyers. Swift CNG fuel-filler an eyesore and access is hampered The buttery smooth manual gearbox is a joy to use; CNG filler placement looks like an afterthought; Refined, peppy and efficient engine; The lack of boot space and cladding is disappointing. What is an eyesore is the exposed CNG filler cap on the Swift’s rear right fender. It gives the impression of being an aftermarket CNG job, which it isn’t. Also, to access the CNG filler, one needs to use a separate physical key provided along with the standard keyless remote; the internal release lever only unlocks the fuel filler lid, which is located on the other side. The Altroz is more sophisticated in this respect. Its CNG filler is tucked away beside its fuel filler, neatly covered by the tank lid. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG interior space and comfort Altroz feels more premium on the inside than Swift A layered dash design, coupled with light colours and textured bits, lends an upmarket feel; Seat is slightly higher set; cushioning is firmer; Wide cabin; it’s easier to seat three adults. Inside, the Tata Altroz continues its premium appeal with a layered dashboard, textured plastics and a floating infotainment screen. The dual-tone colour scheme and premium upholstery add to its sophisticated feel. However, the XZ variant’s instrument cluster with the 4-inch digital speedometer flanked by the readouts for the CNG and fuel levels on one side and the digital tachometer on the other doesn’t blend seamlessly. The Maruti Swift doesn’t feel quite as special inside. While the layout is functional, the plastics feel a bit basic, and the all-black theme doesn’t do much for the ambience either. The analogue instrument cluster with retro-styled needles is easy to refer to, as is the touchscreen, though the latter’s oversized bezel is an eyesore. Altroz is more spacious and comfortable Although functional, the all-black cabin with rudimentary plastics doesn’t feel upmarket; Nicely sculpted seat, but cushioning is soft; Supportive seat; not as spacious as Altroz. Both cars have broad and supportive seats with similar adjustability. But with relatively firmer seat cushioning and a central armrest, the Altroz has an edge in terms of comfort. Expectedly, the Tata is noticeably more spacious, thanks to a wider cabin and a longer wheelbase; if you frequently travel with five passengers, the Altroz will be the comfier pick. Twin-cylinder CNG kit makes Altroz's boot usable However, the real ace up the Altroz’s sleeve is Tata’s clever twin-cylinder tanks nestled beneath the boot floor. Not only are the cylinders hidden from view, but this clever arrangement liberates a respectable 210 litres of room for luggage. The Tata is also the only one here to pack in a spare wheel, albeit beneath the body. Tata’s twin-cylinder layout frees up a lot of usable boot space. The Swift’s single CNG tank, placed in the boot, takes up most of the space there, leaving barely enough room for a soft cabin bag. Also, the lack of cladding in the boot, with the CNG and its mounting visible, isn’t a pleasing sight. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG price and features Mid-spec Altroz XZ iCNG costs Rs 50,000 more than top-spec Swift ZXI S-CNG Maruti offers the Swift S-CNG in three variants, with prices ranging between Rs 8.20 lakh and Rs 9.20 lakh. However, unlike the petrol iteration, there isn’t a base and a fully loaded equivalent variant. Tata, on the other hand, offers the Altroz iCNG across the board, undercutting the Swift with a starting price of Rs 7.60 lakh and going all the way up to Rs 11 lakh for a fully loaded variant. To keep things close in price, we’ve considered the top Swift ZXI S-CNG (Rs 9.20 lakh) and the mid-spec Altroz XZ iCNG (Rs 9.70 lakh). Features common to both include auto headlamps, rear wiper and washer, 7-inch touchscreens, 6-speaker audio system, automatic climate control, rear air-con vents and ESP, to name a few.

Features unique to the Swift ZXI are side and curtain airbags, hill-start assist, LED headlamps, a wireless charger, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and some connected car features. Of course, buyers have the option of higher variants of the Altroz, which have most of the features listed here, besides boasting a sunroof, a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen and a delightful Harman audio system, among other bits. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG performance Swift CNG's engine more refined than Altroz Maruti’s three-cylinder engine is far smoother and more refined. Both models use 1.2-litre, 3-cylinder petrol engines and 5-speed manual transmissions. When driven using compressed natural gas (CNG), the Maruti unit develops 70hp and 102Nm, while the Tata one makes 74hp and 103Nm. It’s the Maruti’s mill that’s quieter and vibration-free. On the move, too, it does its job extremely smoothly, and only when you spin it closer to the redline will you hear the typical thrum associated with a three-pot. The engine also scores well on drivability by delivering its torque lower down, and as a result, it doesn’t warrant constant gear shifts to get a move on. Further, the car’s light clutch and buttery-smooth manual transmission not only remove the stress from driving but also make for an overall joyful experience. Altroz's clutch heavier and gearbox is more vague than the Swift  Unlike the Swift, which uses petrol to fire up the engine (by default) and then switches to CNG automatically with an audible mechanical ‘clang’, the Altroz starts in CNG mode, thanks to a single ECU (engine controller unit) setup. While the start-up process is pretty seamless, in this company, the Tata unit emits a gruff note, which progressively gets louder as the engine speed increases. Also, while the Altroz makes do with shorter gear ratios (than the Swift), particularly second and third, drivability leaves much to be desired. You need to work the gears to keep up with traffic. Even building speed in second gear after crossing a speed breaker is a slow process – something that can get annoying in traffic. While the Altroz doesn’t feel as light on its feet as the Swift, it delivers a strong rush of power beyond 2,500rpm, which makes the engine feel more willing, especially while overtaking. But unlike the Maruti’s rev-happy unit, this engine feels strained and outside its comfort zone when spun faster. Another sore point in the Altroz’s experience is its long-travel clutch pedal, which, although light, can feel a bit tricky to modulate to begin with, and even its gearbox feels a bit vague and doesn’t slot into gates as smoothly as the Maruti’s.

Interestingly, the Altroz redeemed itself in the 20-80kph in third gear and 40-100kph in fourth gear slogs, clocking times similar to the Swift. Both cars perform noticeably better when driven in their respective petrol modes, recording nearly 1 second quicker times. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG efficiency Swift S-CNG more fuel efficient in the real world than Altroz iCNG While the 0-100kph will hardly be a deciding factor for CNG buyers, what will matter is the car’s efficiency and, subsequently, the running costs. While Maruti claims that the Swift S-CNG will deliver an efficiency of 32.85km/kg, Tata quotes a 27.8km/kg figure. To put these numbers to the test, we emptied the cars’ tanks, filled them with a certain quantity of CNG, and ran them dry in the city; we repeated this process for our highway run. The Altroz drives like a bigger car thanks to its exceptional ride-handling balance. In urban conditions, the Swift S-CNG delivered 24.35km/kg, whereas the Altroz iCNG managed 20.56km/kg. The delta between the two was much closer in our highway tests, where the Swift managed 31.38km/kg, and the Altroz returned 29.65km/kg. Notably, neither gets an automatic engine stop-start function to save fuel while idling or has any drive mode to maximise efficiency. The Altroz has the larger CNG tank capacity of 60 litres; the Swift’s is 55 litres. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG handling and ride quality Altroz's ride quality better than Swift at higher speeds  In order to accommodate the added weight of their respective CNG tanks, both cars feature a stiffer suspension setup than their petrol-only versions. The Altroz continues to exude a sense of toughness, and its ride quality, whether at low or high speeds, remains comfortable and compliant. Its quick ratio steering lends a sporty handling character, as does its excellent body control. In isolation, the Swift’s suspension does a great job within urban confines, but at highway speeds, you feel sharper movements inside, which are nicely ironed out in the Tata hatchback. Excellent drivability and better efficiency make it the better performer.   Swift's brake pedal feel is better but Altroz's stopping distance is 2m less What’s nice is that the Swift’s steering feels light and easy, and with this new generation, its returnability (unaided return to the original position after a turn) feels very natural. The Swift’s brake pedal, too, feels a tad more natural, while the Altroz’s could come across as a touch too sudden. That said, in our panic braking tests from 80kph, the Altroz stopped 2 metres earlier than the Swift, indicating a stronger stopping power. Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG verdict Maruti Swift S-CNG              Rating – 8/10 Tata Altroz iCNG        Rating – 8/10 The Swift, even in its CNG avatar, remains a driver’s delight on account of the feel from behind the wheel. Compared to the Altroz CNG, its performance is stronger, refinement is better, and true to its roots, its efficiency is higher. But while the Swift is an excellent and economical runabout, the CNG iteration’s dearth of luggage space and a missing spare tyre make it impractical, particularly for highway journeys. And that’s where the Altroz steals a march with its twin CNG tanks tucked neatly below the boot floor. Furthermore, the Altroz has a larger cabin and gives you a big-car feel, particularly due to its excellent ride and handling balance. The engine isn’t refined, but the car’s many and significant strengths more than compensate for it. And then, there’s the entry-level pricing, which undercuts the Swift by a substantial margin, and even though the Altroz’s top spec is pricier, it packs in pretty much every feature you’d expect, easily justifying the premium. So, while the Swift S-CNG is buttery smooth and more efficient, the Altroz iCNG comes across as a more rounded package with a broader appeal, which is why it wins this comparison test.

When driven using compressed natural gas (CNG), the Maruti unit develops 70hp and 102Nm, while the Tata one makes 74hp and 103Nm. It’s the Maruti’s mill that’s quieter and vibration-free. On the move, too, it does its job extremely smoothly, and only when you spin it closer to the redline will you hear the typical thrum associated with a three-pot. The engine also scores well on drivability by delivering its torque lower down, and as a result, it doesn’t warrant constant gear shifts to get a move on. Further, the car’s light clutch and buttery-smooth manual transmission not only remove the stress from driving but also make for an overall joyful experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAltroz\u0026#39;s clutch heavier and gearbox is more vague than the Swift \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike the Swift, which uses petrol to fire up the engine (by default) and then switches to CNG automatically with an audible mechanical ‘clang’, the Altroz starts in CNG mode, thanks to a single ECU (engine controller unit) setup. While the start-up process is pretty seamless, in this company, the Tata unit emits a gruff note, which progressively gets louder as the engine speed increases. Also, while the Altroz makes do with shorter gear ratios (than the Swift), particularly second and third, drivability leaves much to be desired. You need to work the gears to keep up with traffic. Even building speed in second gear after crossing a speed breaker is a slow process – something that can get annoying in traffic. While the Altroz doesn’t feel as light on its feet as the Swift, it delivers a strong rush of power beyond 2,500rpm, which makes the engine feel more willing, especially while overtaking. But unlike the Maruti’s rev-happy unit, this engine feels strained and outside its comfort zone when spun faster. Another sore point in the Altroz’s experience is its long-travel clutch pedal, which, although light, can feel a bit tricky to modulate to begin with, and even its gearbox feels a bit vague and doesn’t slot into gates as smoothly as the Maruti’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv oncopy=\"return false\" onpaste=\"return false\" oncut=\"return false\"\u003e\u003ctable\u003e\u003cthead\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\"\u003eMaruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG: acceleration, efficiency, braking\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/thead\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSwift S-CNG\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003eAltroz iCNG\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-20kph (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e1.23/1.24*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e1.75/1.25*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-40kph (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e3.22/3.04*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e4.14/3.44*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-60kph (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e6.26/5.91*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e6.85/6.27*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-80kph (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e9.77/9.00*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e11.40/10.38*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-100kph (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e15.54/13.95*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e16.71/15.15*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-120kph (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e22.52/21.03*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e25.63/21.46*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e20-80kph in 3rd gear (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e14.75s/14.54*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e14.26s/13.22*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e40-100kph in 4th gear (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e21.50s/20.64*\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e21.61s/19.39*\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eBraking distance (metres)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e32.02\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e30.04\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eBraking time (seconds)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e2.8\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e2.64\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSound at idle - AC off (dB)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e68.8\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e70.7\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSound at idle - AC mid (dB)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e73.8\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e71.3\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSound at idle - AC full (dB)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e75.2\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e75.2\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSound at max revs - 1st gear (dB)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e84.8\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e85.8\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSound at 50kph in 4th gear (dB)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e85.1\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e87.6\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eSound at 80kph in 5th gear (dB)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e85.7\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e88.5\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFuel economy: City (km/kg)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e24.35\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e20.56\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFuel economy: Highway (km/kg)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e31.38\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e29.65\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eFuel economy: Average (km/kg)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Swift S-CNG\"\u003e27.87\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"Altroz iCNG\"\u003e25.10\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Figures are in petrol mode\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn our performance tests in CNG mode, the Swift sprinted from 0 to 100kph in 15.54 seconds, 1.2 seconds quicker than the Altroz.

Compared to the Altroz CNG, its performance is stronger, refinement is better, and true to its roots, its efficiency is higher. But while the Swift is an excellent and economical runabout, the CNG iteration’s dearth of luggage space and a missing spare tyre make it impractical, particularly for highway journeys. And that’s where the Altroz steals a march with its twin CNG tanks tucked neatly below the boot floor. Furthermore, the Altroz has a larger cabin and gives you a big-car feel, particularly due to its excellent ride and handling balance. The engine isn’t refined, but the car’s many and significant strengths more than compensate for it. And then, there’s the entry-level pricing, which undercuts the Swift by a substantial margin, and even though the Altroz’s top spec is pricier, it packs in pretty much every feature you’d expect, easily justifying the premium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG data log\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Swift_vs_Altroz_CNG_Data_CNG.png\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Maruti Swift CNG vs Tata Altroz CNG data log\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, while the Swift S-CNG is buttery smooth and more efficient, the Altroz iCNG comes across as a more rounded package with a broader appeal, which is why it wins this comparison test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-maruti-suzuki-cng-mild-hybrid-flex-fuel-small-car-under-evaluation-434651\"\u003eNew Maruti Suzuki CNG, mild hybrid, flex fuel small car under evaluation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/nissan-magnite-cng-launch-by-april-this-year-434705\"\u003eNissan Magnite CNG launch by April this year\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/industry/future-of-small-cars-lies-in-cng-market-and-for-cafe-compliance-hyundai-coo-434399\"\u003eFuture of small cars lies in CNG market and for CAFE compliance: Hyundai COO\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-434723\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-434723\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-434723\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-434723\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
