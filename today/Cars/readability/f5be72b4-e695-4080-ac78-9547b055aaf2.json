  "text": "China's Electra E5 has been given a light refresh that includes an all-new shark nose front end 29 seconds ago by Michael Gauthier Buick has revealed the facelifted Electra E5 for the Chinese market. The crossover offers more than 373 miles of estimated electric range. In top-spec form, it accelerates from zero to 62 mph in 6.4 seconds. General Motors offers an assortment of electric vehicles ranging from the Chevrolet Equinox EV to the ultra-luxurious Cadillac Celestiq. However, Buick is the odd man out as they don’t offer a single electric vehicle in the United States. It wasn’t supposed to be that way as Buick was planning to launch an EV in 2024. The model was delayed last summer and GM CEO Mary Barra implied the move was related to slower than expected electric vehicle adoption. However, it was widely believed the company had planned on importing the Electra E5 from China, before the United States slapped a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs. More: Buick Delays Plan To Launch First EV In America Fast forward to today and Buick has unveiled a facelifted version of the Electra E5. It appears to be a major improvement as the crossover benefits from a streamlined and less fussy design. The changes are immediately apparent as the model trades its faux grille for a new shark nose front end. They’re joined by a sportier bumper with soft curves and subtle chrome accents. The rest of the design largely carries over, but there could be minor changes such as updated wheels. Buick didn’t get into many details, but said the crossover benefits from “47 enhancements across design, performance, intelligent technology, and everyday convenience.” The E5’s exterior dimensions remain unchanged from the pre-facelift model, measuring 4,892 mm (192.6 in) long, 1,905 mm (75.0 in) wide, 1,684 mm (66.3 in) tall, with a 2,954 mm (116.3 in) wheelbase. Buick added the crossover will have a range in excess of 373 miles (600 km). Of course, that isn’t too surprising as the current model offers a 79.7 kWh battery pack that provides up to 620 km (385 km) of range. Customers can also get 68.4 and 65 kWh batteries as well as front and all-wheel drive. In its most potent form, the current E5 can accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 6.4 seconds. While pricing hasn’t been announced yet, it’s expected to be in line with the outgoing model, which starts at 169,900 yuan, or approximately $23,700 at current exchange rates.",
