  "text": "Watch as a seemingly distracted cyclist plows into a DMC DeLorean May 17, 2025 at 21:11 by Stephen Rivers Cyclist crashes into a DeLorean parked in a bike lane, causing significant damage. Distraction appears to be the cause, as the cyclist fails to slow before impact. The incident highlights the dangers of distraction for both cyclists and drivers on roads. Some studies suggest that well over half of the people on the road look at their phones while driving. Distraction is a huge issue on public streets today, but it doesn’t just affect those behind the wheel of a car. Cyclists sometimes have that issue too, and this video is proof of it. We just wish the rider in question wasn’t hitting a classic DeLorean. It’s unclear where this happened, but based on the license plates and signage in the video shared on Reddit, it could very well be in Scandinavia. What really matters, though, is that we clearly see a DeLorean parked on a shoulder with a bike lane between it and the main road. Why it’s stopped there with its doors wide open is anyone’s guess. More: Lynx DeLorean DMC-EV Has High-Tech Interior And $250k Price Tag What’s very clear is that a cyclist appears moments after the video starts and seems to not slow down at all before crashing hard into the rear of the car. The DeLorean, for what it’s worth, looks pretty good after the impact. The bike, an older Colnago that appears to be partially carbon fiber, didn’t turn out so well though. The head-tube snaps off along with the front wheel, and the rider crumples to the ground. Honestly, the only thing that would make this make sense is if the DeLorean just appeared out of nowhere right before the crash. Maybe it would have some flames around the tires and some time machine accouterments attached. Alas, that was not what happened. Let me just say as an avid cyclist and car nerd who has had the distinct pleasure of reviewing a DeLorean, this sucks for everyone. No cyclist I’ve ever met or heard of would ever intentionally do what we see here. Even if they were spiteful about a car parked in an actual bike lane, which does not appear to be the case here, this is unlikely. Most riders, in my experience, wouldn’t want to risk damaging their bike, much less themselves. On the flip side, who knows why the DeLorean owner was pulled over in the first place. It could’ve very well been that the car had a mechanical issue, and this whole thing just adds salt to that potential wound. The cyclist didn’t bother to ask themselves the same question; they merely reacted out of fear or pain, which, in a way, is understandable. Not very polite, though. Credit: Trikkdaddy/Reddit",
