  "text": "Drop Top Customs is gearing up to introduce a convertible conversion package for the new Charger Daytona EV December 27, 2024 at 19:01 by Michael Gauthier Drop Top Customs is working on a new Dodge Charger Daytona Convertible. The model is slated to be introduced shortly, but initial pictures leave a lot to be desired. The Challenger Convertible conversion package cost $23,999 but there’s no word on whether or not the Charger Daytona will be more expensive. Dodge and Drop Top Customs partnered on Challenger convertibles in 2022 and the pair are joining forces once again. This time they’re working on a new convertible based on the electric Charger Daytona. Drop Top Customs isn’t saying much at this point, but confirmed their design team is working with Dodge to create an “iconic convertible conversion” for the electric muscle car. The company went on to say the convertible will be unveiled around the same time as deliveries begin. More: Dodge’s New Charger Coming To Europe And The Middle East In 2025 However, images are already on Facebook and they’re accompanied by a message saying it’s “about time to introduce the new Droptop Daytona!” As you can see, the resulting model is based on the two-door liftback and features a retractable black roof. While the images aren’t high quality, the soft top’s shape mimics the traditional hardtop but doesn’t look particularly good. We’ll presumably learn more in the coming weeks, but the Challenger conversion cost $23,999 before shipping. This netted customers a power retractable roof with a heated rear window. The package also included fully operational quarter windows, a reinforced structure, and a slightly smaller trunk as roughly 20% of the original was taken over by the soft top mechanism. It’s about time to introduce the New DroptopDaytona! What do you think?Posted by Drop Top Customs by Convertible Builders on Monday, November 11, 2024 While plenty of questions remain, the Charger Daytona R/T starts at $59,595 and features a dual motor all-wheel drive system with 456 hp (340 kW / 462 PS) and 404 lb-ft (547 Nm) of torque. Buyers will also find a 100.5 kWh battery that delivers 317 miles (510 km) of range. Customers can also opt for the $73,190 Charger Daytona Scat Pack. It has 630 hp (470 kW / 637 PS) and 627 lb-ft (849 Nm) of torque, which lowers the 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) time to 3.3 seconds. Unfortunately, the range also plummets to 260 miles (418 km).",
