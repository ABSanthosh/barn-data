  "text": "Bankruptcy often brings a good deal of chaos to a company’s last days in operation, which is exactly what happened as the hammer came falling down on Fisker. The electric automaker recently abandoned its Southern California headquarters, leaving behind a mess and creating opportunities for squatters to set up in the empty space. The landlords of Fisker’s Manhattan Beach, California headquarters say the company left trash, vehicle models, and dangerous waste materials as it departed the building. They don’t want to be responsible for the mess, which they say could cost tens of thousands of dollars to remove. Making matters worse for the building’s owners, squatters have been breaking into the building.TechCrunch reported that Fisker had sold some of its assets to an auction company, but no one seems to know who owns the items left behind. The automaker’s efforts to avoid bankruptcy were unsuccessful and included a plan to team up with another automaker, with Nissan as the reported other half. Fisker’s attempts to fire-sell the Ocean EV at significant discounts may have moved a few units, but it didn’t keep the company from its financial issues. Owners have also found that repair parts are nonexistent, and some discovered that the company expects them to pay for warranty repairs. The SEC took notice of the company’s difficulties and said that it had subpoenaed Fisker as part of an investigation into potential federal securities law violations.[Images: Fisker]Become a TTAC insider.
