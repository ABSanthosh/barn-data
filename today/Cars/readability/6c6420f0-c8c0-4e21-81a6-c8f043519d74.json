Additional equipment includes Showa suspension, turn-signal mirrors, dual vertically stacked headlights, a clear windscreen, a monoposto tail section, and a silver-finished steel trellis frame. This 999 is offered on dealer consignment with red and black keys and a clean New York title. The Pierre Terblanche-designed bodywork is finished in yellow over a silver-painted steel trellis frame. Equipment includes a silver-finished frame, a clear windscreen, a monoposto tail section, and a side stand, and it has been modified with a carbon-fiber front fender, a rear fender eliminator kit, an SSR gas cap, and carbon-fiber heel guards. The selling dealer notes cracked paint on the tail section, a crack in the upper headlight lens, and scratches on the clutch cover, left-side mirror, and right-side fairing. Brembo-Marchesini 17″ wheels wear Michelin PilotPower 2CT tires. Suspension consists of an inverted 43mm Showa fork as well as a piggyback monoshock mounted to the swingarm via a progressive linkage. Braking is from dual four-piston Brembo calipers clamping 320mm floating rotors up front and a single two-piston caliper with a 245mm solid rotor at the rear. Aluminum clip-on handlebars are mounted below the top triple clamp and frame an adjustable piston-style steering damper. Instrumentation consists of a white-dial 13k-rpm Magneti Marelli tachometer, a row of indicator lights, and a digital information screen that displays speed, time of day, a lap timer, and engine temperature. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles. The 998cc Testastretta L-twin was factory rated at 124 horsepower and 75 lb-ft of torque and features four desmodromically actuated valves per cylinder, Marelli electronic fuel injection, and a two-into-one exhaust system with G.P.R. carbon-fiber under-tail mufflers. Power is transferred to the rear wheel through a six-speed transmission and a drive chain. The dry clutch sports a SpeedyMoto pressure plate and open cover.
