  "text": "Jul 26, 2025 1:25 PM EDTA Bold New Era for Lambo, With a Few Setbacks The Lamborghini Revuelto represents a major shift for the Italian marque. Replacing the long-running Aventador, it is Lamborghini’s new flagship hypercar – and the first with a plug-in hybrid drivetrain. Under its carbon-fiber skin lies a naturally aspirated V12 paired with three electric motors, pushing output to a staggering 1,001 horsepower. Lamborghini calls it a High-Performance Electrified Vehicle (HPEV), promising the visceral thrills of a combustion-powered supercar with a modern, electrified edge. Customer deliveries of the Revuelto began in 2023, and despite a price tag well above half a million dollars, it’s sold out until 2026. However, just two years into production, the Revuelto is already facing its third safety recall. Latest Recall: Doors That May Unexpectedly Close Just published this week, the most recent recall affects 27 units from the 2024 and 2025 model years. According to the documents released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the spherical pins that hold the gas struts for the iconic scissor doors may not have been properly installed. This defect could cause the pins to loosen, allowing the doors to close unexpectedly or resist opening – both not cool, especially when you’re trapped inside the car. According to the automaker, a deviation in the assembly process caused the problem. Unfortunately, there aren’t any signs that the Revuelto’s screws are already loose, so owners should probably consider their hypercars affected just to be safe. Vehicles built after June 26, 2025, are not affected, since production procedures were updated to ensure proper torque application during assembly. Lamborghini has not reported any injuries or incidents related to this defect. Owners will be instructed to visit dealerships, where technicians will inspect and retighten the pins – of course, free of charge. Three Recalls and Counting Per the NHTSA records, there were two previous recalls for the Revuelto. The first one was issued in October 2024, when Lamborghini recalled 455 units due to a defective connecting rod in the passenger-side windshield wiper system. The rod could bend or detach from the motor, causing the wiper to malfunction and leading to impaired visibility during poor weather. The second recall was issued in December 2024. According to records, there were improperly tightened screws on the oil circuit connection flange from the radiator to the oil tank. Like the others, inconsistencies during production were the root cause of the problem, though this issue was deemed a fire risk. Fortunately, none of these recalls have involved injuries or crashes.
