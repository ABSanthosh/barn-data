It aims to encourage Slide School students to participate in this championship. This was the inaugural edition, and it began at the Motoverse 2024, with riders competing with an FT411 motorcycle purpose-built for flat-track. The championship concluded with a tie between Anish Shetty and Sathya Raj Arumugam, with 39 points each. However, Shetty was announced as the champion as he won the third race of the final round. Arumugam was adjudged the first runner-up, and Karan Drishya was the second runner-up with 29 points. The Jaipur track, located on the city’s outskirts, will be used for rider training through the brand’s Adventure School and Slide School programmes, besides being a training ground for the brand’s factory teams.
