  "description": "Alongside the bigger 390s, we have also gotten our hands on the specifications of the upcoming KTM 250 Adventure. This bike sits on the same new platform as the 2025 390 Adventure and 390 Adventure X. The engine makes a little more peak output than before It gets off-road ABS and bidirectional quickshifter Gets all-new design and bodywork for 2025  The 2025 250 Adventure will be powered by the same engine seen on the latest 250 Duke, which makes 31hp and 25Nm of torque. There is also a repositioned under-belly exhaust in place of earlier stubby upswept unit.  This updated engine is now nestled in a two-piece steel trellis frame and lacks an aluminium sub-frame, which is present on the updated 390s. It rides on a 19-inch front and 17-inch rear setup. The suspension setup has also been changed, and it now gets 200mm of travel up front and 205mm at the rear, which is the same as the new 390 Adventure models. Braking duties are handled by a 320mm disc and a 240mm disc (F/R) with dual-channel ABS. In typical KTM fashion, it gives riders the option to switch off the rear ABS via the Off-road mode. Compared to the previous model, the bike’s kerb weight remains unchanged at 177kg. The 2025 bike has also seen a marginal drop (0.5 litres) in fuel capacity, which is rated at 14 litres. The 250 Adventure gets an update to its feature list as well, with the biggest addition being the same 5-inch TFT display, also seen on the 390 Duke and the latest 390 Adventure. For the first time, the 250 Adventure features ride-by-wire, which allows it to be fitted with a bidirectional quickshifter.  In terms of design, the 250 Adventure is all-new for 2025, bringing it more in line with the bigger models in KTM’s line-up. Another change is a projector headlight setup in place of the outgoing bike’s halogen light.  For now, KTM has only revealed the technical details of the KTM 250 Adventure, but we do expect a bump in price when it goes on sale. For reference, the outgoing model is priced at Rs 2.48 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). Also see: KTM CEO Stefan Pierer steps down",
