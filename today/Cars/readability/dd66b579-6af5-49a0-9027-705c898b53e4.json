  "text": "The off-roader has a five-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson This cute Jimny has a turbocharged 657 cc three-cylinder engine with 63 hp and 66 lb-ft. The off-roader was imported into the US in April 2022 and has been driven 37,000 miles. A beige and white two-tone exterior paint scheme makes the Suzuki even more striking. While Suzuki Jimnys are a common sight in Japan, Australia, and Southeast Asia, spotting one in the United States is a rare treat. Sure, this particular Jimny is a 1991 model, but don’t let that fool you, this tiny off-roader can likely handle terrain that would leave many modern 4x4s eating dust. This left-hand drive 1991 Jimny Turbo made its way to the United States back in April 2022, thanks to the 25-year import rule. A year later, it was sold on Bring a Trailer for $10,750, which, considering its rarity and charm, doesn’t seem out of line. Now, the current owner is looking to part ways with it and has listed it on Marketplace, originally asking for $21,000, but has since reduced the price to $19,500 at the time of this writing. Read: This 6×4 Suzuki Jimny Is The Ultimate Off-Road Toy And It’s For Sale Has the Jimny’s value really doubled in the past two years? Probably not. We’re doubtful anyone’s going to bite at the lowered $19,500 asking price, especially considering it’s a left-hand drive model. But let’s be real, when selling a car privately, it’s usually better to start high and gradually drop the price, rather than lowball it and end up kicking yourself later. Photos Marketplace, Bring a Trailer As a 1991 Jimny Turbo, the pint-sized Suzuki is powered by a turbocharged 657 cc, inline-three-cylinder engine that produced a rather measly 63 hp and 66 lb-ft (89 Nm) of torque when it left the factory. Obviously, some of those horses would have escaped over the years, but it should be adequate for a small 4×4 like this. Mated to the engine is a five-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. A look at an old listing reveals the Jimny was originally painted in white but later resprayed in a combination of beige with a contrasting white roof, side skirts, and wheels. It’s also benefited from a suspension lift, has a large roof rack, and yellow driving lights. If you were in the market for a quirky, off-road-ready Jimny, how much would you pay for this little beast? Drop your thoughts in the comments below, we’re curious to know.
