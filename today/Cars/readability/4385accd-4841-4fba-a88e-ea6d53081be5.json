  "description": "This 1996 Ford Escort RS Cosworth spent time in Finland and Canada before being imported to the US by the current owner in 2021. Finished in Zinc Yellow over black leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four equipped with a Wolf Racing ECU and a Mongoose 3” exhaust system. Power is sent to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes a carbon-fiber lip spoiler, a rear wing, a power-operated sunroof, heated Recaro front seats, air conditioning, a Blaupunkt CD head unit, AP Racing front brake calipers, GAZ coilovers, and 18” OZ Racing wheels. Work under current ownership involved replacing the timing belt, water pump, valve cover gasket, engine and transaxle mounts, and a CV joint. This RS Cosworth is now offered on dealer consignment with handwritten notes, import documents, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Maryland title.",

Finished in Zinc Yellow over black leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four equipped with a Wolf Racing ECU and a Mongoose 3” exhaust system. Power is sent to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle, and equipment includes a carbon-fiber lip spoiler, a rear wing, a power-operated sunroof, heated Recaro front seats, air conditioning, a Blaupunkt CD head unit, AP Racing front brake calipers, GAZ coilovers, and 18” OZ Racing wheels. Work under current ownership involved replacing the timing belt, water pump, valve cover gasket, engine and transaxle mounts, and a CV joint. This RS Cosworth is now offered on dealer consignment with handwritten notes, import documents, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Maryland title. The Escort RS was based on a modified Sierra Cosworth platform, and just over 7,000 examples were built at Karmann in Germany during a four-year production run. This car is said to be one of 10 finished at the factory in Zinc Yellow (U4), and the rear hatch, quarter panels, and rocker panels were repainted under prior ownership. A carbon-fiber lip spoiler and “hockey sticks” have been added, and other details include a vented hood, a raised rear wing, a decklid spoiler, a power-operated sunroof, flared fenders, headlight washers, a rear window wiper, and pop-out quarter windows. Silver-finished 18×8” OZ Racing alloy wheels are wrapped in 225/40 Michelin Pilot Sport MO tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs with AP Racing front calipers and 14” two-piece rotors. GAZ coilovers were fitted in 2021, and a CV joint and CV boots were replaced in 2023. The cabin features heated Recaro front bucket seats and 60/40 split-folding rear seats trimmed in black leather with perforated inserts. A Blaupunkt San Francisco CD70 head unit with a steering wheel-mounted control module has been installed along with a Magnat amplifier and speakers. Additional appointments include air conditioning, power windows, and a Wolf Racing shifter knob. A JL Audio subwoofer is mounted in the cargo area. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 270-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature, while a voltmeter, boost gauge, and oil pressure gauge are mounted atop the center stack. The five-digit odometer has rolled and shows 124k kilometers (~77k miles), approximately 4k of which have been added under current ownership. The Cosworth 2.0-liter DOHC inline-four features four valves per cylinder, and it is said to have been modified with a Garrett “big turbo” as well as a Wolf Racing ECU. The polished valve cover is accented by a body-color center panel, and a Mongoose 3” exhaust system has been added along with a carbon-fiber turbo cover. The timing belt and water pump were replaced in 2022, and the valve cover gasket and engine mounts were replaced at AR Autowerks of Beaufort, South Carolina, in November 2023. Power is sent to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle, the mount for which was replaced in 2023. Undercoating was applied under prior ownership in Finland. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists a single entry in Ontario, Canada in 2019. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
