  "text": "Police are continuing to search for answers to explain why the Cybertruck exploded 3 hours ago by Brad Anderson Some media reports claim authorities are investigating the blast as a possible act of terror. The Tesla Cybertruck appears to have been carrying several fireworks at the time. Elon Musk says the automaker is investigating the matter and has ‚Äúnever seen anything like this.‚Äù One person has been killed and at least seven injured after a Tesla Cybertruck exploded and caught fire while parked outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Local authorities and the FBI are investigating the incident but do not believe there is any further threat to locals. The explosion occurred shortly after the electric pickup truck pulled up in front of the hotel‚Äôs lobby. CCTV footage shared to X captured the devastating blast. In the clip, fire can be seeing ripping through the Tesla and it appears that several fireworks were also set off by the explosion.

ABC News reports that police are investigating the explosion as a possible act of terror. The driver of the Tesla was killed. An individual who witnessed the explosion and fire said they saw the Tesla pull up to the lobby before it ‚Äúlowered itself like a bus.‚Äù ‚ÄúI and my husband were literally standing where the luggage is in the footage. I just saw it pulled up, and it lowered itself like a bus, and boom it goes. It first looked like fireworks or something but then I immediately feared our life thinking it could be a bomb and ran,‚Äù they wrote on X. üö®New footage of the Tesla Cybertruck exploding in front of the Trump hotelIt looks like fireworks explodedThis was intentionalSomeone was sending a message to Trump \u0026 Elon pic.twitter.com/aTpe0oM6jg‚Äî DC_Draino (@DC_Draino) January 1, 2025 While posting to his social media company, Elon Musk said ‚Äúthe while Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now.
