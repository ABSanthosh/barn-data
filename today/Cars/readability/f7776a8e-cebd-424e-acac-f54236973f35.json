  "text": "Zagato's TZ3 combines Italian design with raw American power and near-unmatched exclusivity 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Zagato created only nine TZ3 Stradales, each built on a Dodge Viper platform. Under the gorgeous coachwork lies a 640 hp 8.4-liter V10 with 6-speed manual. Last year, this very car was sold for $632,000 at an auction in the States. Some cars are rare. Some are beautiful. And a few, like this one, are both, with the dial turned all the way to eleven. The famed Italian design house Zagato has built some of the most stunning vehicles ever conceived, and 15 years ago, it delivered one of its best: the Alfa Romeo TZ3 Stradale. Bigger, brawnier, and arguably more alluring than the 8C Competizione of the time, the TZ3 was limited to just nine units worldwide, making it exponentially more exclusive. Now, one of these elusive cars is up for sale. Read: You’ve Seen This Supercar Before, But Never With A Body Like This Each TZ3 started out life as a Dodge Viper that had every single exterior part replaced. The front end has a gaping grille, aggressive headlights, and a gorgeous hood that looks absolutely sensational. Zagato also worked its magic on the profile of the car, extending the roofline and expanding the size of the glasshouse. Thanks to the enlarged cabin, Zagato was able to craft a distinctive rear end for the Z23, bathed in exposed carbon fiber. This car is painted in Dark Blue Metallic, which suits it absolutely perfectly, and has spent most of its life in an Arizona collection. Young Motorcars Step inside, and the Dodge Viper DNA is still very much present. While the surfaces have been reupholstered in elegant black and brown leather, the layout remains familiar. The original switchgear, steering wheel, and shifter are all intact, offering a curious blend of Italian tailoring and American muscle. Just like the Viper it’s based on, there’s an 8.4-liter naturally aspirated V10 under the body, an engine originally developed with help from Lamborghini back when Chrysler owned the Italian brand. In this spec, it produces 640 horsepower, all sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. This particular TZ3 has just 1,863 miles on the odometer and is listed for $675,000 at Young Motorcars. Interestingly, this very TZ3 was sold by Gooding \u0026 Company at its Pebble Beach auction last August. It traded hands for $632,000 and hasn’t been driven a single mile since. Young Motorcars",
