  "description": "Yamaha has taken the wraps off its updated 2025 R3 overseas, and while this isn't an entirely new bike, it does carry some significant changes.  Same engine, underpinnings as older bike Now gets a slip and assist clutch, optional quickshifter New LCD brings in Bluetooth connectivity The most obvious change is the new appearance that follows the latest R design philosophy, also seen in the new Yamaha R9. This includes sleek LED DRLs flanking a single projector headlamp housed within a MotoGP-style central air intake, much like the Yamaha R15 V4. The side fairing panels have also been revised to go with the new theme, and Yamaha says they’ve reworked the tail section as well. The mechanical changes are much smaller, with the same high-revving 321cc parallel-twin engine and no significant changes to the chassis either. While Yamaha doesn’t confirm whether the power figures have changed, they do state that the bike now features a slip-assist clutch. This will help improve high-speed riding on the racetrack, but should also result in a lighter clutch lever in the city. Yamaha also offers a quickshifter as an optional extra, although it only works for upshifts since the R3 still uses a cable throttle. Also See: Yamaha R3 review: Capable, simple \u0026 sweet The bike continues with its KYB USD fork and monoshock, and there are no major changes to the riding position. However, Yamaha has made the front section of the rider seat narrower and used slimmer side panels under the seat. The company says that this will help shorter riders get their feet down more easily. That said, the R3 has always been a very friendly bike for short riders, and this change will only improve that.  The final change comes in a new LCD dash. While the R3 continues to miss out on a colour TFT, something that every other rival now offers, this LCD is now Bluetooth compatible. The new Yamaha R3 is available in three colours, two of them being the familiar Team Yamaha Blue and Matt Stealth Black, and the third is a striking new Lunar White/Nebula Blue.  There has been no mention of this bike’s availability in India yet, but a launch sometime next year is reasonable to expect. The Yamaha R3 is currently sold in India as a CBU import and is priced at a rather high Rs 4.65 lakh (ex-showroom, India).   Also See: Aprilia RS 457 vs Yamaha R3 comparison",
