  "text": "The trucks will be featured on Adventure Garage with Bear Grylls, which begins airing next year 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Bear Grylls and RealTruck have unveiled two modified pickups for the SEMA Show. The F-150 and Tacoma have an assortment of upgrades including sport bars, lifted suspensions, and heavy duty front bumpers. Both trucks will be featured in an upcoming television show called Adventure Garage with Bear Grylls. The countdown to the SEMA Show continues as Bear Grylls and RealTruck have joined forces to create rugged versions of the Ford F-150 and Toyota Tacoma. Both are designed to promote Adventure Garage with Bear Grylls, which will begin airing in 2025. The trucks will debut on November 7 and were built by the Superlift Suspension team with guidance from Grylls. While the company didn’t release a full build list, the 2024 Tacoma has been outfitted with an assortment of accessories from RealTruck’s various brands. More: The 2024 Toyota Tacoma Is The Swiss Army Knife Of Pickups As It Offers Hybrid Power, Manual Trans, And 6′ Bed In particular, you can see a RealTruck Sport Bar outfitted with Go Rhino Xplor auxiliary lights. They’re joined by a beefy front bumper, a sizable lift, and Raceline wheels wrapped in meaty tires. The truck has also been equipped with aftermarket floor mats and tools. The 2021 Ford F-150 follows a similar playbook, but looks far more extreme. It features Bushwacker fender flares, a Go Rhino Element front bumper, and Dominator Xtreme DT side steps. They’re joined by a sport bar, a roof rack, and auxiliary lights. Speaking of the latter, there’s a LightShield Pro hood-mounted light bar. We can also get a glimpse at what appears to be a lifted suspension. As for Adventure Garage with Bear Grylls, it’s being billed as an “electrifying TV series” which sees the noted explorer enter the world of extreme vehicle transformations. Details are limited, but each episode will focus on modifying a vehicle into “something completely rugged for the mission’s adventure – be it the scorching sands of Dubai, the rugged Grand Canyon, or a custom vehicle for a humanitarian partner working in Africa.”",
