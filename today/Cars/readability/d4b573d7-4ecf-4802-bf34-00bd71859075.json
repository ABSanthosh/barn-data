The car rides on 13″ Mahle-BBS wheels, and it is further equipped with front disc brakes, front and rear impact bumpers, an analog clock, and an Alpine cassette stereo. It is said to have spent time in Arizona, Washington, and Idaho before being acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. Work in preparation for the sale involved changing the transmission fluid, resurfacing the flywheel, and replacing the battery, rear main seal, and clutch components. This E21 shows 194k miles and is now offered at no reserve with an owner’s handbook, a spare set of 13″ steel wheels, partial service records, and a clean Idaho title. Finished from the factory in Sierra Beige (012), the car was repainted under prior ownership approximately 20 years ago. Details include chrome-finished impact bumpers with black accents as well as quad headlights, a left-side mirror, a rear window defroster, and pop-out rear vent windows. Blemishes are noted on various body panels. The 13″ Mahle-BBS wheels were powder-coated in super chrome in 2018 and are mounted with 185/70 Barum Brillantis 2 tires showing a mixture of 2015 and 2018 date codes. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The front bucket seats were reupholstered in Gobi Tan vinyl under previous ownership. Appointments include an analog clock, a heater, and an Alpine cassette stereo. The selling dealer notes that the air conditioning compressor has been removed and that cracks are evident in the dashboard. The four-spoke steering wheel frames a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 6,400-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The selling dealer notes that the directional indicator remains illuminated when the key is removed. The six-digit odometer shows 194k miles, approximately 75 of which have been added by the selling dealer. The 2.0-liter M10 inline-four was factory rated at 110 horsepower and 112 lb-ft of torque. The fuel pump and filter are said to have been replaced under previous ownership, and the battery was replaced in preparation for the sale. A photo of the engine stamp can be viewed in the gallery below. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Work in preparation for the sale involved changing the transmission fluid, resurfacing the flywheel, and replacing the rear main seal, clutch, pressure plate, and pilot and throw-out bearings. A spare set of 13″ steel wheels mounted with older 185/70 Wynstar Phaser R13 tires is included in the sale. An owner’s handbook and partial service records also accompany the vehicle.
