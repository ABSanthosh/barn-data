  "text": "The new 911 Club Coupe for PCA features a manual gearbox, unique styling, and the base Carrera engine 1 hour ago by Thanos Pappas Members of the Porsche Club of America get access to a special 911 edition. The 911 Club Coupe is based on the Carrera T trim with a manual gearbox. Unique exterior and interior details come from Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur. There’s no shortage of variety in the Porsche 911 lineup, but even among its many trims and special editions, there’s still room for one more. Thus, Porsche has introduced a new model tailored specifically for enthusiasts who are part of a very exclusive club. Also: Porsche’s New 911 4S Has More Of Everything Except A Gear Lever The 2026 911 Carrera T Club Coupe is a limited-run special edition, with just 70 units available exclusively to current members of the Porsche Club of America (PCA). Created to mark the 70th anniversary of the world’s largest Porsche owners’ organization, this model is the third PCA-exclusive 911. It follows earlier editions from 2005, based on the 997-generation Carrera S, and a 2015 model built on the 991-generation GTS. Lightweight, Manual, and Built for Enthusiasts As its name suggest, the new Club Coupe is based on the Carrera T trim of the 992.2 generation that was introduced last year. That means it comes with a standard manual gearbox and a lightweight configuration, making it very enticing to purists. A new exterior color called Sholar Blue Metallic gives the car a distinct identity. The paint pays tribute to Bill Sholar, who founded the PCA in 1955. Additional visual details, all handled by Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur, include red accents on the front bumper and engine cover, which also bears a special “70 year PCA” badge. Club Coupe lettering in Brilliant Silver decorates the doors. Another highlight is a beautiful set of new alloy wheels measuring 20 inches at the front and 21 inches at the back. These are finished in Satin Black with contrasting accents in Brilliant Silver, giving a unique appearance to the 911. Inside, owners are greeted by illuminated side sills featuring Porsche Club of America lettering. The PCA 70 year logo can be found on the door projectors and the center console lid, with a Club Coupe signature on the dashboard. Of course, the car retains the GT Sport steering wheel and walnut shifter of the standard 911 Carrera T. More: The Best Thing About Porsche’s New ’70s Heritage Edition Is Its Seats The cabin is dressed in black leather upholstery with Speed Blue and Guards Red stitching. However, those who chose an optional extended equipment package will stand out even more thanks to the tartan fabric inserts on the seats, as well as a bespoke owners manual and a special key. Finally, owners have access to a limited-edition timepiece by Porsche Design with a matching specification to the car. Standard Performance with Carrera T Underpinnings The Club Coupe doesn’t have any mechanical modifications over the Carrera T, which already came with a host of performance goodies. Those include the PASM Sport Suspension, which lowers the car by 10 mm compared to the standard 911, a mechanical limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring, rear-axle steering, the Sport Exhaust system, the Sport Chrono Package, and upgraded brakes. Under the rear decklid is the familiar twin-turbo flat-six producing 388 hp (393 PS) and 331 lb-ft (449 Nm) of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through the standard six-speed manual, with no automatic option available. One unit will remain at the Porsche Museum and is not included in the production total. The 70 customer cars will be split between the United States and Canada. Production begins this fall and will run through spring 2026, with pricing details to be released closer to launch. Porsche",
