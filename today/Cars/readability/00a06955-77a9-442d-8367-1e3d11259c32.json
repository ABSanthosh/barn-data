  "description": "Renault 5 is priced from £22,995; winning Techno trim with 52kWh battery is £26,995 Autocar sibling and consumer champion crowns retro hatchback for desirability, comfort and value The Renault 5 has been named What Car? Car of the Year for 2025. The electric hatchback impressed the judges from Autocar’s sibling title for being comfortable, desirable and “very well priced”. It’s the first Renault to take top honours at the annual ‘motoring Oscars’ since the original Scenic won in 1997 and marks the French brand’s fourth victory since the awards began in 1978. It's also the fourth EV to have won What Car?'s Car of the Year award, following the Kia e-Niro (2019), Kia EV6 (2022) and Volkswagen ID Buzz (2023). “It’s a car that you can buy with your head and your heart, and one that proves you don’t have to spend a fortune to get a great electric vehicle at a time when the costs of motoring are more challenging than ever,” said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. This comes after the 5 and its hot hatch sibling, the Alpine A290, were jointly named Car of the Year 2025 by a panel of 60 European journalists including Autocar editor Mark Tisshaw.
