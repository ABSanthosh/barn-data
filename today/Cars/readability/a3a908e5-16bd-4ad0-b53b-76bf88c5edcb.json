  "text": "\"It is essential to consider the potential consequences of your actions,\" said the sheriff in a now-deleted post July 26, 2025 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers A West Virginia Sheriff asked the public to stop warning speeders with high beams. The department acknowledged it as free speech but questioned the morality of the act. Following online backlash, the department deleted the post and disabled comments. Flashing your headlights to alert oncoming traffic of a hazard is one of those unofficial rules of the road that many drivers follow without much thought. The warning could be about anything, from a deer up ahead and debris in the lane to, more commonly, a police officer tucked away with a radar gun. In much of the United States, this practice is considered a form of protected speech, recognized by many courts under the First Amendment. More: Why Did San Francisco Police Trap Over 100 Cars During Midnight Meet? One Sheriff from a tiny little town in West Virginia also recognizes that, but wants drivers to consider the morality of such a move. Or at least he did before backlash led the department to delete his public plea. A Cautionary Message, Then a Quick Retraction Chief Charles Wilson of the Barrackville Police Department reportedly said in a now-deleted post that “While your intention may be to exercise your right to free speech and warn others of a potential fine, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of your actions.” Local outlet WBOY says Wilson warned citizens that “people who do this might be aiding drivers who pose a public safety threat, such as those who are driving under the influence, are fleeing a crime scene or “engaging in illicit activities.” That type of thinking isn’t uncommon in law enforcement circles. Nevertheless, it landed Chief Wilson in a bit of internet hot water. A Legal Counterpoint, and a Bit of Perspective After WBOY reported on the situation, lawyer, YouTuber, and car guy Steve Lehto reported on it as well. He called out the odds here. “What are the odds that that [sic] car that just happens to come by when you saw the speed trap was fleeing a crime scene or was under the influence or was engaging in illicit activities?” he says. Of course, he continues to point out that refraining from using your lights to warn other drivers could just end up helping the Barrackville PD make some more money from ticket revenue. Evidently, this could be a new strategy for the tiny town of 1,211 people. According to posts that are still up on the department’s Facebook page, the department made a total of five traffic stops in all of July 2024. Of those, it handed out three whole citations. Local Reaction and Lingering Questions As media coverage grew, so did criticism of the department’s message. The deleted post, and others from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office, have drawn comments from users calling out Chief Wilson’s original statement. We reached out for comment, but hadn’t received a response at the time of writing. Credit: Barrackville Police Department",
