  "text": "While the two Porsches have undoubtedly suffered extensive water damage, it's possible a few parts might still be salvageable October 21, 2024 at 20:31 by Brad Anderson Floodwaters from Hurricane Milton swept two Porsches into the pool of a Florida homeowner. Both the 911 GT3 and Boxster likely suffered significant damage from saltwater exposure. The two flood-damaged models may appear at a salvage auction in the coming weeks. Hurricane Milton ripped through parts of the US and Mexico earlier this month, leaving behind a trail of destruction with damages estimated to be in the region of $30 billion. Among the many unfortunate victims was a Florida homeowner who was hit particularly hard by the hurricane, as two Porsches ended up in their now-filthy and flooded swimming pool. A video showing the aftermath of the house’s pool area has been making the rounds on social media today. We don’t know where the house is located in Florida, but it seems as though flood waters rushed through the property and pushed the two Porsches—a 911 GT3 and a Boxster—into the pool. Read: Resurrecting A Submerged 471-Mile Porsche Cayman GT4 RS Is A Herculean Task Based on this short video alone, it’s difficult to determine the full extent of the damage done to the two sports cars. However, it’s safe to assume that the Boxster is worse off as most of its rear end is submerged below the water, and it appears to be teetering on one of the pool’s sharp corners. As for the 911 GT3, the front end of it has been dunked in the pool but remarkably, it has managed to avoid completely falling into the water. Now, before you get too excited about potentially trying to buy the GT3 at a salvage auction and saving the engine, it’s worth remembering that if flood waters from the hurricane did indeed push the car into this precarious position, the engine has likely already been flooded with salt water. If anyone ever wants the engine to run again, it’ll likely have to be completely stripped down, cleaned out, and rebuilt. That should be possible with enough time, money, and patience, but it’s not a project a novice should undertake. In all likelihood, the owner/owners of the Porsches will be paid out by their insurance companies for the cars and move on. For those interested in picking up a used exotic that was damaged by Hurricane Helene or Hurricane Milton, we suggest bookmarking Copart and IAAI, as they should start flooding (no pun intended…) salvage lots soon.
