Further equipment includes pop-up headlights, fog lights, Koni shocks, four-wheel disc brakes, and center-lock 15″ Cromodora alloy wheels. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2024, and it now shows 36k miles. This 512 BB is offered by the selling dealer in North Salem, New York, with an owner’s manual, service records, and a clean New York State title. The Berlinetta Boxer model was styled by Pininfarina’s Leonardo Fioravanti and was introduced at the 1971 Turin Auto Show. The car features a steel-paneled cabin section paired with a tubular chassis. Aluminum is incorporated for the front and rear clamshells and door panels, while the lower panels are fiberglass. The cars were not officially offered in the US and were imported and federalized in-period via the gray market. Originally finished in red, this example was repainted in its current Blu Sera Metallizzato finish under previous ownership. It features pop-up headlights along with fog lights set behind the front grille. A front spoiler, Vitaloni California side mirrors, NACA side ducts, and quad exhaust outlets are further details. Paint meter readings from around the body are shown in the gallery. Center-lock 15″ five-spoke alloy wheels are secured using three-eared knock-off hubs and were refinished in 2023. Michelin XWX tires measuring 215/70 are mounted at all four corners. The car rides on a fully independent suspension with unequal-length double wishbones and Koni shocks, while stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin features Daytona-style seats upholstered in beige leather, along with a color-coordinated center console and door panels. The car is further equipped with Borletti air conditioning and power windows. The split-spoke Nardi steering wheel is paired with a gated dogleg shifter. Veglia instrumentation includes a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as a 320-km/h speedometer and auxiliary gauges that extend to the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 36k miles, approximately 50 of which have been added under current ownership. The 4.9-liter F102B flat-12 features aluminum construction, dual overhead camshafts per bank, dry-sump lubrication, and quad triple-barrel Weber carburetors to produce a factory-rated 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. A fabricated engine bay heat shield was added in April 2015, and an engine out timing-belt service was performed in January 2023. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. A replacement flywheel, clutch assembly, harmonic balancer, and pilot and release bearings were installed in January 2023. A removed federalization tag and California Bureau of Automotive Repair sticker will accompany the car along with an owner’s manual and service records that can be viewed in the gallery.
