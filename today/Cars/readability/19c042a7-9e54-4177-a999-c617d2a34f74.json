  "description": "Our market is no stranger to the long-running Toyota Camry as the sixth-gen model was introduced way back in 2002. From the seventh-gen (2013) onwards, the luxury sedan was locally assembled at the brand’s plant in Bidadi, Karnataka. The Camry we're driving today is in its ninth-gen avatar, and it has seen many of its competitors fall by the wayside; Hyundai’s Sonata and Honda’s Accord are no longer on sale, and the Skoda Superb is quite a bit more expensive as it's a CBU. While the Camry is Toyota’s sole sedan on sale in India, the Japanese brand considers it one of its flagship offerings. The sedan has not only been on sale here for 22 years but it's also Toyota’s longest running nameplate in India. In essence, this new Camry, which arrives with an edgier design, more tech – from infotainment to ADAS – and a more powerful, yet more frugal hybrid powertrain, has the segment to itself. Toyota Camry 2025 design and chassis Cues from upmarket Lexus models seen on the new Camry. Despite being a new-gen model, it shares the same TNGA-K underpinnings and suspension setup as its predecessor, although Toyota claims there are improvements in almost every area. The design is definitely all-new though – it sports the Japanese brand’s new ‘Hammerhead’ styling, which gives the sedan a more pointed nose that's accentuated by the slim LED headlights and Daytime Running Lamps. The bonnet gets more prominent creases, flows sharply down, and has the Toyota logo (sans the blue highlights seen on the previous model) just below the point where the bonnet opens. The front bumper’s angular air dam and its diamond pattern are reminiscent of premium Lexus cars. A new prominent shoulder line runs from bonnet to boot, the star-like 18-inch machine-finish alloy wheels add to the stance, and the rear features new C-shaped LED tail-lights. Overall, the new Camry’s design is more aggressive than the outgoing model. Low-profile 235/45 section tyres don't hamper ride quality. What makes the new Camry look even sportier, is the Sprint Edition, which Toyota offers as a dealer-level fitment, but hasn't quoted an official price for. The Camry Sprint comes with contrasting black elements replacing the chrome ones, and a black roof.  Toyota Camry 2025 interior   Tan leatherette upholstery and the new dash layout make the new Camry feel more premium. Step into the new Camry’s cabin and the tan and grey dual-tone theme along with the silver highlights make the interior feel a little more premium and cheerful compared to the outgoing model’s black and light beige theme. The steering wheel and slatted dash design are new and while the latter’s piano black finish does look upmarket, it’ll be a dust magnet and pick up fingerprints easily. The central AC vents have now moved below the smart-looking (and very accessible) climate control buttons, which themselves sit below the new 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen. A wireless charging pad and two USB-C ports are positioned right in front of the gear knob. A highlight of the previous Camry was its comfortable seats, and the new model retains the well-bolstered units. The front seats get 10-way power adjust helping you find the right driving position and the ventilation function keep one's back and bottom cool. Rear passengers will have no complaints about the headroom, legroom or shoulder room. You get powered reclining seats, which is unique at this price point, and controls for the three-zone climate control via a screen in the rear armrest. However, the rear bench is best for two as the armrest takes up space even when folded away, as do the rear AC vents and USB-C charging ports. Rear seat space is excellent for two and the reclining seats are well-bolstered.   Toyota Camry 2025 features and ADAS It gets a boss mode that allows anyone to adjust the front passenger seat, a 9-speaker JBL system and a single-pane sunroof instead of a panoramic one. The new infotainment system is slicker to use than the outgoing model’s 9-inch unit and the clarity is much better; in fact, the screen’s resolution is so good it makes the 360-degree camera's display seem slightly grainy. While the unit supports wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto is wired only. Toyota has also added a connected car suite that allows one to remotely start the Camry, access seat ventilation functions, and open and close the boot, among other safety features. 360-degree camera's resolution not as good as the touchscreen's. One big addition to the new Camry is an ADAS suite, which Toyota calls Safety Sense 3.0. The system features a forward collision avoidance function with pedestrian detection, adaptive and standard cruise control, lane-keep assist, a road-sign read-out and an automatic high beam function. On Bengaluru’s well-marked highways, the lane-keep assist worked unobtrusively to ensure the Camry kept to its lane, while the autonomous braking system provided ample warning before it started kicking in progressively. Like its predecessor, the new Camry gets nine airbags and rear parking sensors; the front parking sensors are new. Toyota Camry 2025 performance and mileage Toyota claims the upgraded hybrid powertrain not only produces more power but is also more frugal than the outgoing Camry. The 2.5-litre four-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine now makes 187hp, 9hp more, at 6,000rpm, but the torque figure is the same 221Nm. When paired with a 136hp, 208Nm electric motor, its total output is 230hp; 12hp more than its predecessor. Toyota claims a 0-100kph time of 7.2 seconds, which is acceptable for this class. Hybrid system's combined output has increased by 12hp. That extra power isn’t easily noticeable when driving the new Camry, and in any case, this is a sedan enjoyed best at seven-tenths of its full potential. A sedate driving style really makes the hybrid system’s seamlessness in switching from the electric motor to the petrol engine shine through. When driven in this manner, especially in Eco mode, the new Camry also seems to run on battery power for longer and switches to it more frequently – even on the highway. Speaking of drive modes, Eco prioritises using the battery, while the engine kicks in earlier in Normal and Sport for marginally better performance at the cost of efficiency. While the 10-step eCVT’s simulated gears give the driver a greater degree of control, the rubber band effect can be felt if pushed hard. Toyota has improved on the sound-deadening as well and refinement is good in general, though the engine starts to sound buzzy at higher revs. EV-like instant torque ensures adequate pulling power while overtaking. It should be noted that how one drives greatly affects the Camry’s fuel-efficiency figure. In the few hours we spent with it, which included more highway than urban driving, the Camry delivered almost 20kpl, which is impressive for a 1.6-tonne car. Toyota Camry 2025 ride and handling As before, a highlight of the Camry is its supple ride quality, which, surprisingly, isn’t hampered by the low-profile 235/45 R18 tyres. Toyota claims an unladen ground clearance of 145mm, and this is enough to clamber over large speed breakers without scraping its underbelly. Whether at speed or at a crawl, the Camry makes light work of road undulations and only the really rough stuff filters into the cabin. 145mm of ground clearance is adequate and it doesn't scrape over large speed breakers. Compared to the outgoing model, body roll is better contained and the stiff chassis, along with the decently feelsome steering, provide confidence on a winding section. For a car that’s over 4.9-metres long, the 11.4m turning circle isn’t too bad, and the Camry is nearly as easy to drive in tight spaces as it is on an open road. Toyota Camry 2025 price and verdict With the ninth-gen Camry, Toyota has certainly improved on a proven formula. It looks edgier, and it’s nicer to be in. While it may not be for those looking for an enthusiastic drive experience, it is also marginally better to drive than before, not to mention more frugal. That it’s also far better equipped than its predecessor for not much of a premium (just Rs 1.83 lakh) makes the new Camry’s case even stronger. Considering its price tag now overlaps with the likes of the Audi A4, the new Camry should be considered as a more frugal alternative to those German luxury sedans.

Toyota has improved on the sound-deadening as well and refinement is good in general, though the engine starts to sound buzzy at higher revs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Toyota Camry side pan\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Toyota-Camry-2025-review-side-pan.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Toyota Camry side pan\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEV-like instant torque ensures adequate pulling power while overtaking.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that how one drives greatly affects the Camry’s fuel-efficiency figure. In the few hours we spent with it, which included more highway than urban driving, the Camry delivered almost 20kpl, which is impressive for a 1.6-tonne car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToyota Camry 2025 ride and handling\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs before, a highlight of the Camry is its supple ride quality, which, surprisingly, isn’t hampered by the low-profile 235/45 R18 tyres. Toyota claims an unladen ground clearance of 145mm, and this is enough to clamber over large speed breakers without scraping its underbelly. Whether at speed or at a crawl, the Camry makes light work of road undulations and only the really rough stuff filters into the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Toyota Camry speed breaker\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Toyota-Camry-2025-review-speed-breaker.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\" title=\"Toyota Camry speed breaker\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e145mm of ground clearance is adequate and it doesn\u0026#39;t scrape over large speed breakers.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompared to the outgoing model, body roll is better contained and the stiff chassis, along with the decently feelsome steering, provide confidence on a winding section.
