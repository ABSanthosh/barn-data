The car was optioned new with the Competition Package and is equipped with replacement 19″ M cross-spoke wheels, Bilstein PSS10 adjustable coilovers, Ground Control camber plates, stainless steel brake lines, a power sunroof, xenon headlights, automatic climate control, and a Harman Kardon sound system. The VANOS system was updated in 2014 and the rod bearings were replaced in 2018 before the car was acquired by the seller on BaT in January 2020. This E46 M3 has 88k miles and is now offered with a service manual, a first aid kit, a service history summary, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean New York title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Interlagos Blue Metallic and is equipped with Shadowline trim as well as xenon headlights, fog lights, a glass sunroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED tail lights, a trunk lid spoiler, tinted windows, and quad exhaust outlets. The roof and plastic roof rails were repainted along with the hood under previous ownership. Paint chips are present on the front bumper cover, and the previous listing noted a ding in the left rear quarter panel. Replacement 19″ M cross-spoke Style 163M wheels were installed in 2017, and they are mounted with 245/35 front 275/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The car was factory equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and braking is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs. Suspension modifications include adjustable Bilstein PSS10 coilovers and Ground Control camber plates, and stainless-steel brake lines were added under previous ownership. The front sport seats were reupholstered in Anthracite M Texture Alcantara and Black Nappa leather under previous ownership, and Milled-Effect Aluminum trim accents the dash and door panels. Interior appointments include cruise control, M3-branded floor mats, automatic climate control, a CD stereo, and a Harman Kardon sound system. There are marks in the soft-touch finish on the center console. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features M-color stitching and a retrofitted yellow centering stripe, and it frames a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 88k miles, fewer than 200 of which were added under current ownership. The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was factory rated at 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The double-VANOS system was serviced in 2015, the rod bearings were replaced along with assorted power steering and cooling system components in 2018, and a replacement battery was installed in preparation for the sale. Photos of a service history summary are included in the gallery below. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The front subframe is said to have been reinforced in 2018. The Carfax report lists an open manufacturer safety recall related to the passenger’s front airbag.
