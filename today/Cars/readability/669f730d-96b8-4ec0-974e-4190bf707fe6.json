  "text": "While Kia and Hyundai have acknowledged challenges in the EV market, both have continued pushing forward with new models and tech. Kia used its recent EV Day event to show a handful of new electric models, including the EV2, a small electric crossover. We don’t have a lot of detail on the vehicle yet, but Kia said it would feature a sustainable interior with LED lighting and rear-hinged doors. Many features may not make it out of the concept stage, but Kia’s EV2 show car featured pop-up luggage dividers, removable speakers, and a window messaging system.The EV2’s rear-opening doors and pillarless design should make the cabin feel open and airy, and the seats can be shuffled around to create a lounge-like space. Interestingly, the window messaging system lets users project phrases to people outside the vehicle, which would almost certainly lead to violence if it came to the United States. Kia also showed off the new EV4, which will arrive as a sedan and hatchback. We got some details on that model at the EV Day event, but the automaker hasn’t given much info on the EV2’s range and performance. We also don’t know if the crossover will come to the States, as Kia has so far only said that it would arrive in Europe and other regions in 2026.[Images: Kia]Become a TTAC insider.
