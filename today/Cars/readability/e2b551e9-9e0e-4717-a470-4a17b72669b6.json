  "description": "This 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS was specified in paint-to-sample Gulf Blue over a black leather and Alcantara interior with red stitching, and it was ordered with the Weissach Package, which reduces weight and enhances downforce via bodywork revisions and increased use of carbon fiber. Power is from a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six linked with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car was also ordered with dynamic LED headlights, a front-axle lift system, Satin Black-finished 20\" and 21\" center-locking alloy wheels, a Bose surround-sound system, a fire extinguisher, the Sport Chrono Package, illuminated carbon-fiber sill plates, and Racing Yellow seatbelts for the carbon-backed bucket seats. This 991 GT2 RS has 168 miles and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in California with the owner's manual, a driver's seat cover, additional accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the owner's name.",

Power is from a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six linked with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car was also ordered with dynamic LED headlights, a front-axle lift system, Satin Black-finished 20″ and 21″ center-locking alloy wheels, a Bose surround-sound system, a fire extinguisher, the Sport Chrono Package, illuminated carbon-fiber sill plates, and Racing Yellow seatbelts for the carbon-backed bucket seats. This 991 GT2 RS has 168 miles and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner in California with the owner’s manual, a driver’s seat cover, additional accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the owner’s name. Weight savings were targeted with the GT2 RS program, and Porsche fitted multiple carbon-fiber components including the hood, front fender vents, side intakes, side mirrors, and rear wing. The Weissach Package reduces weight further through the use of carbon fiber for the roof panel and the anti-roll bars. Downforce is increased with a large rear wing, underbody diffuser, and a deeper front fascia, while NACA ducts in the front trunk lid aid in brake cooling. This example is finished in paint-to-sample Gulf Blue and features LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System. Satin Black-finished 20″ and 21″ center-lock GT3 wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The car is equipped with adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Stability Management, and rear-axle steering. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes were standard on the GT2 RS and feature yellow calipers and cross-drilled rotors. The optional front-axle lift raises the car on command to help prevent scraping. The black leather and Alcantara interior features red stitched accents as well as Racing Yellow seatbelts for the carbon-backed bucket seats. Options include a fire extinguisher, a Bose surround-sound system, Voice Control, Alcantara-trimmed sun visors, and illuminated carbon-fiber sill plates. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel has a yellow centering stripe and features lightweight shift paddles, while the optional Sport Chrono Package added a red-dial stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 168 miles. The twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six was factory rated at 700 horsepower and 553 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. Features include an intercooler spray system, a titanium rear exhaust muffler, a carbon-fiber engine cover, and an extended-range fuel tank. The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage.
