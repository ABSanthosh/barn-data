  "text": "Thinking about leasing a 2025 Acura RDX? Find a detailed breakdown of the current national lease offer plus our quick thoughts on the 2025 RDX.When it comes to crossovers, the options are vast. You can go budget-friendly with models like the Toyota RAV4 or Honda CR-V, or aim for the high-end with luxury offerings like the Maserati Grecale or Porsche Macan. But sitting comfortably in the middle is the Acura RDX, offering a balance of performance and premium features.A good lease deal could make the decision easier, but how much does a 2025 Acura RDX cost per month — and is it worth the price?2025 Acura RDX lease offer for OctoberIf you’re in the right area, are rocking the right credit score, and tick all of the other qualifying boxes you can snag a 36-month lease on a 2024 RDX SH-AWD 10-speed automatic for $429 per month. This doesn’t include the $4,999 you’ll have to fork over when the paperwork is signed, nor does it include taxes and fees. In terms of options, you’re limited to what the dealer has in stock. The offer expires on October 31, and you’ll need to take possession of your RDX by then. So you can’t postpone the lease for a few months while you have one built in the color you want. Quick thoughts on the 2025 Acura RDXThe 2025 RDX is Acura through and through. You get a lot of tech as standard, which may appeal to buyers who typically add optional extras and drive up the final bill. It’s also great for lease deals, as you’re often limited to what’s already in stock and ready to go.Acura’s powertrains aren’t bad either. They’re not class-leading, but they tend to pack enough of a punch to get the job done. With 272 horsepower, the turbocharged 2-liter I-4 powering Acura’s crossover checks that box. The vehicle has also received praise for its handling. The A-Spec package starts at $50,300, the Advance Package at $52,450, and the A-Spec Advance Package at $54,450.On the downside, despite firmly occupying the premium segment and being positioned as a performance and luxury brand, Acura often falls short when it comes to true luxury elements.That said, with BMW cheapening its interiors and experimenting with more unconventional designs, Acura has an opportunity to pull ahead — especially with the next-generation RDX. If Acura can focus on refining the luxury experience, it might just have an edge in this competitive segment.2025 Acura RDX trim optionsWith five trim options, the 2025 RDX is similar to most of Acura’s other vehicles. The base model is simply called the RDX and has an MSRP of $44,700. Above that is the Technology Package, priced at $47,300.All trims have the same powertrain and come with AWD as standard. The differences between the trims lie in tech, comfort features, and appearance. The top-end trim, however, includes a suspension upgrade with an adaptive damper system.Competition to considerThe luxury crossover segment isn’t the largest category of SUVs, but there’s still plenty of competition for the Acura RDX. Alternatives include the Lexus RX, Genesis GV70, BMW X2, BMW X3, and the Lincoln Corsair — though 2025 may be the last year we see the Corsair as Lincoln shifts its focus toward larger vehicles.Final thoughtsAcura packs a lot of tech into the standard RDX, but the company’s pricing places its crossover squarely in the middle of a very competitive segment. When people are spending more than $50,000 on a car — which they will be if they’re considering one of the RDX’s top trims — they’re likely to expect a level of refinement that Acura has struggled to deliver in recent years.The lease offer, however, may be exactly what the RDX needs. If you’re paying full price, you can snag a BMW X2 for $2,000 less, which, for many, might seem like the sensible choice. However, this lease involves less money down and costs around $70 less per month — assuming you qualify for the best offers from both manufacturers. That may just be enough to sway buyers in Acura’s favor.",
