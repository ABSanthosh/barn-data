  "text": "The new truck was expected to arrive in 2027 and would have presumably been a 2500 or 3500 REV 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Ram was working on an electric heavy duty pickup that would have slotted above the 1500 REV. The model was reportedly axed last year, leaving suppliers fighting to recoup their investments. This has sparked a $25 million lawsuit that pits Valeo against American Axle \u0026 Manufacturing. Two years ago, Ram introduced the 1500 REV at the 2023 New York Auto Show. It was originally slated to arrive in the fourth quarter of 2024, but has now been pushed back to 2026. That’s a heck of a delay and it appears Ram was also working on an electric heavy duty pickup. The truck was slated to join the lineup in time for the 2027 model year, but the program was reportedly axed in 2024. More: Ram Confirms 25 New Models In 18 Months And It Starts With A Bang In June This is an interesting development as heavy duty trucks are known for diesel-power and huge towing capabilities. The latter is a significant weak spot for EVs, leading us to question who in their right mind would want an electric heavy duty pickup. Ram appears to have answered that question with ‘no one’ as the truck was quietly killed off. However, we’re learning about it today thanks to a lawsuit discovered by Auto News. According to the publication, Valeo is suing American Axle \u0026 Manufacturing for refusing to cover “sunk costs” related to the vehicle. Valeo reportedly spent millions developing electric motors and inverters that would be used in e-beams from American Axle. American Axle announced a contract with Stellantis in 2023 and said the upcoming model – which was a mystery at the time – would have “both front and rear e-Beam axles that include AAM’s integrated 3-in-1 e-Drive technology.” They added the vehicle would arrive late in the decade and feature a motor, inverter and gearbox integrated into a single assembly. While it would have been interesting to see what Ram came up with, the two suppliers are now fighting over a reported $25  (£18.6 / €21.9) million. Valeo reportedly wants to be paid for their work, while American Axle is said to be claiming the two firms never had an enforceable contract.",
