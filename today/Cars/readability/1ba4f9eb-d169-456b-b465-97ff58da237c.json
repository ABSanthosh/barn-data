The Toyota AE86 is a perfect example of this; it’s many things to many people and, with the right changes, can become an incredibly capable machine despite its inherent shortcomings. While some owners stay true to the purist approach, preserving the original 4A-GE engine and associated running gear (guilty again), what if you never had those parts to start with? Case-in-point: the AE86 you see here, owned by Robbie Durant. That name might be familiar to some; Robbie co-drove alongside Travis Pastrana in the American Rally Association (ARA) rally championship before the pandemic, spending over two decades in the navigator seat. This AE86 is more than just a car for Robbie – it serves as a rolling portfolio for his expertise in electronics and wiring. His work spans everything from Formula 1 to WRC cars, and this project is a showcase of that skill. The car started as a rolling shell from Dytko Sport in Poland, a company renowned for its expertise in the “Professional design and building of unusual cars for rallying and racing.” The shell had already undergone significant modifications, including Nissan S14 subframes front and rear, as well as a roll cage. More work was needed to bring the car to its current form, including additional strengthening to ensure the build met the high standards required for what is essentially a business card on wheels. The exterior is relatively understated, with a vintage TRD-inspired livery. Composite panels have replaced the original metal bonnet, front fenders, and boot lid to save weight. European AE86 enthusiasts may recognise the Hasselback lip attached to the front bumper, a rare dealer kit option back in the day. Drawing further inspiration from Robbie’s rallying background, the Corolla wears 15-inch Braid wheels wrapped in 205/50R15 semi-slicks. CBY-style arches replace the stock units to accommodate the wider wheel and tyre package. Öhlins DFV dampers feature at all four corners of the car, and since these photos were taken, the front brakes have been upgraded with AP Pro5000 callipers with 2-piece discs – designed to fit inside a 15-inch wheel. But it’s in the interior and engine bay where Robbie has been able to truly demonstrate his skillset. MoTeC supplied the M880 ECU, C127 Dash, PDM16, and a CAN keypad, all expertly integrated with Deutsch connectors and a custom wiring loom encased in Raychem R25 tubing. This high-end electronics package leaves little to be desired, featuring full data logging, a 25MHz GPS for speed and track mapping, and brake pressure sensors. All critical controls are neatly arranged on a custom panel mounted to the steering wheel, with the CAN keypad housed in a 3D-printed mount. A few parts with motorsport heritage have also found their way into the car, a Prodrive Group A Impreza hydraulic handbrake and a passenger footplate salvaged from a Prodrive-built WRC Mini Clubman among them. Corolla purists, brace yourselves – there is no Toyota 4A-GE in the engine bay. Instead, a Honda F20C from an S2000 takes pride of place, gulping air through Jenvey individual throttle bodies and exhaling through a bespoke exhaust system. Fueling comes courtesy of a 45-litre fuel cell in the boot, with Nuke Performance pumps and fittings keeping the flow steady. Depending on noise regulations, a side exit exhaust notched into the sill allows for an alternative exhaust route when permitted. Otherwise, Robbie runs a conventional rear exit system. The combination of car and driver has proven very capable, contesting for the fastest time at events like the Curborough Sprint Day. While this car may never satisfy those who value originality above all else, the execution speaks for itself. From a motorsport perspective, selecting the right parts for the task at hand means the AE86 shell could just as easily have been an Opel Kadett, Mk2 Ford Escort, or something similar. Though the Corolla’s character has changed drastically from its 4A-GE and live axle roots, never having had those parts under his ownership and therefore no nostalgia to reflect upon, Robbie has been able to focus solely on building a truly fast and well-executed car – one that looks good doing it, too.
