  "description": "The Indian electric vehicle market has been buzzing with new launches month after month. However, EV passenger vehicle sales saw a slight slowdown in November, with 8,596 units sold compared to 11,165 units in October 2024. As the year comes to a close, car brands and dealers are pushing sales with attractive discounts and benefits on almost all models. Here’s a look at some enticing discounts on offer for mainstream electric cars and SUVs in India this month. Tata Motors EV discounts for December 2024 Save up to Rs 3 lakh Tata Motors has one of the biggest EV line-ups in India, with every model available at attractive discounts and benefits this month. The Tiago EV and Tigor EV for MY24 come with discounts and benefits of up to Rs 1.15 lakh, including exchange bonuses for some variants. On the other hand, the Tiago EV and Tigor EV for MY23 get much higher discounts of around Rs 2 lakh, along with an additional exchange bonus of up to Rs 1 lakh, depending on inventory. The Punch EV also gets discounts on MY24 models, ranging from Rs 25,000 for lower variants to Rs 70,000 for the top variant. Do note that these benefits also include exchange bonuses for some variants. While the Nexon EV for MY2024 does not have any official discounts, we are told that some dealers are offering benefits at their end depending on unsold stock. For MY2023 models, Tata Motors is offering discounts of a whopping Rs 3 lakh on the pre-facelift Nexon EV Prime and Max variants. The facelifted MY2023 Nexon EV gets discounts of around Rs 2 lakh. MG Motor India EV discounts for December 2024 Save up to Rs 2.25 lakh off The MG Comet is available with multiple discounts and offers up to Rs 75,000 at some locations. We are told this number could be higher at outlets with a higher number of unsold inventories. Similarly, for the ZS EV, dealers are offering discounts in the range of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2.25 lakh, depending on stock. There are no discounts on the newly launched MG Windsor EV. Mahindra EV SUV discounts for December 2024 The only Mahindra electric SUV available with a discount is the XUV400, which gets benefits worth Rs 3.10 lakh on both battery options.
