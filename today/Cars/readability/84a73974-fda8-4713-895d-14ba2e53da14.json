We kick off with a superbly nipped and tucked BMW R nineT 100 Years edition from the USA, before crossing the pond to check out a Triumph Trident 660 from France. Spain’s Tamarit Motorcycles wraps things up with another pitch-perfect Triumph Thruxton RS. BMW R nine T 100 Years by Denys Nevozhai Obsessed with motorcycles from a young age, Denys Nevozhai spent his childhood sketching bikes and envisioned a career in automotive design. The design career never eventuated, but his love of motorcycles stuck. So when he bought this BMW R nine T 100 Years edition, Denys loved it, but also saw potential for more. “I envisioned a sleeker, more athletic café racer,” says Denys. “Something that wouldn’t look out of place parked outside a Berlin techno club at 3 AM. Younger. Sharper. A celebration not of the past, but of the next 100 years.” With its upright riding position and centenary paint job, the 100 Years version of the R nine T is best described as gentlemanly. To de-age the boxer, Denys started by blacking out the front end and replacing the factory Brembos with a pair of 4-piston calipers from ISR. The front fender is a 3D-printed item from Vagabund, and the LED headlight is from Koso. ISR supplied the matching brake and clutch master cylinders, which sit on adjustable clip-ons from Gilles Tooling. Denys co-designed the unique top fork yoke with MessnerMoto, while the mirrors, bar-end turn signals, and dashboard are all from Motogadget. The black and chrome factory paint remains, even though Denys was kept up at night deciding whether or not to keep it. (We’re glad he did, because BMW did a fantastic job with the mirror finish and black fade.) The R nineT intake snorkel has been replaced with a sleeker alternative, and the airbox has been deleted in favor of a pair of large pod filters. This has opened up the middle of the bike to great effect, adding a sense of lightness that the factory bike doesn’t have. The passenger pegs and their associated bracketry have also been removed to slim down the back end. BMW adorned the 100 Years anniversary model with a slew of Option 719 parts from their accessory catalog, so Denys kept the rocker covers and footpegs. The slithering black exhaust from MASS is one of Denys’ favorite parts, chosen for its Buell-like design (it was the part that convinced Denys to buy an R nine T in the first place). The exhaust leaves the single-sided swingarm clear, giving us a view of the rare BMW HP2 Sport wheels. Sourced from two different countries after months of searching, Denys sent the wheels to Hugo Eccles at Untitled Motorcycles, who handled the intricate paintwork. A sprinkling of goodies from Powerbrick and Öhlins finish the bike off in style. Taking more than two years to distill into reality, Denys poured over every detail until he landed here. Amazingly, even though he has loved motorcycles since he was a kid, this is Denys’ first bike. He bought it just after turning 40, which is one hell of a way to satisfy half a lifetime of longing. [Denys Nevozhai Instagram] Triumph Trident 660 by FCR Original There’s no argument from us that the Triumph Trident 660 is one of the best mid-capacity bikes on the market. But when Triumph resurrected the Trident moniker, we were expecting something more classically styled. The gang at FCR Original felt the same way, so they chose to do something about it. Starting with a factory-fresh Triumph Trident 660, the FCR team imbued it with a retro aesthetic—starting with the bodywork. The front end wears a custom bikini fairing, that incorporates the stock headlight and sits above a custom front fender. Adjustable clip-ons replace the stock handlebars, fitted with bar-end mirrors and a Brembo master cylinder. The rear end has been completely updated, with a custom fiberglass tail unit taking pride of place. FCR has done a bang-up job of making sure the design flows effortlessly into the factory tank and side covers. The seat wears custom upholstery, and the license plate has been moved to the back of the seat on a custom bracket. Sharing this space with the tail light and rear indicators, the back end is the kind of kit we were expecting from Triumph themselves. The discrete radiator is flanked by a set of laser-cut guards, which is where the tiny front turn signals are hiding. The factory exhaust has been ceramic-coated in black to hide its visual bulk, and the engine breathes through a K\u0026N filter. The passenger pegs have been removed, and the rider footpegs are aftermarket units from SW Motech. You’ll be glad to know that this isn’t just a one-off creation. FCR has developed what you see here into a kit, so that Triumph Trident 660 owners around the world can turn the beloved triple into a svelte café racer. Starting at $4,528, the kit isn’t exactly cheap—but at least it’s something you can do in an afternoon using basic hand tools. [FCR Original] Triumph Thruxton RS by Tamarit Motorcycles The prolific Spanish custom workshop Tamarit is back with another drop-dead gorgeous Triumph. This time, they’ve chosen to amplify an already bonkers bike—the Triumph Thruxton RS. The Thruxton RS was discontinued last year, but it shared most of its specs with the model’s swansong—the Thruxton Final Edition. The RS and Final Edition versions got more power, a revised torque curve, better suspension, and top-shelf Brembo brakes than the base model Thruxton. Most people would be satisfied with all these extra goodies, but that’s not the Tamarit way. Up front, a new fairing sits pretty on polished brackets. Designed in the Tamarit studio, the lower section is almost shrink-wrapped around the engine, giving it a classically modern vibe. An integrated belly pan scoops up air and channels it through the fairing. A small LED headlight peeks through the center of the fairing, while a dark screen covers the Motogadget Motoscope Pro gauge cluster. The tank and seat unit have been combined to form a monocoque, with the aft section hiding a small lithium battery. To access the electronic components, the monocoque rises up on a hydraulic actuator, which is both convenient and exceptionally fun. Twin taillights are integrated into the rear hump, matching the custom exhaust. The subframe was removed in favor of a custom-made section that doubles up as a base for the monocoque. The stock Showa big-piston front forks were swapped out for fully adjustable Öhlins forks, but the Brembo M50 calipers remain. A gorgeous set of carbon fiber wheels from BST were bolted on, but not before the swingarm was swapped for a longer unit from a Triumph Scrambler 1200. The rear section was then modified to run a single rear shock, which not only looks cool, but also saves a ton of weight. The engine was treated to a set of forward-facing pod filters and a custom exhaust that snakes its way through the frame to terminate under the seat. The frame, exhaust, and swingarm were then chrome plated, contrasting nicely against the black and white paint. A splash of yellow on the seat stitching, tank, and spark plug caps break the otherwise monochrome livery. [Tamarit Motorcycles]",

A gorgeous set of carbon fiber wheels from BST were bolted on, but not before the swingarm was swapped for a longer unit from a Triumph Scrambler 1200. The rear section was then modified to run a single rear shock, which not only looks cool, but also saves a ton of weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine was treated to a set of forward-facing pod filters and a custom exhaust that snakes its way through the frame to terminate under the seat. The frame, exhaust, and swingarm were then chrome plated, contrasting nicely against the black and white paint. A splash of yellow on the seat stitching, tank, and spark plug caps break the otherwise monochrome livery.
