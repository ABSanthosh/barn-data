Finished in white over tan and black leather upholstery, the car was optioned with the $17k panoramic roof and is further equipped with a radar detector, adaptive bi-xenon headlights, 20″ forged alloy wheels, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, carbon-ceramic brakes, front and rear parking sensors and cameras, heated power-adjustable front seats, a touchscreen infotainment system, navigation, automatic climate control, and cruise control. This FF is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Pininfarina-styled “shooting brake” grand tourer body is finished in white and has adaptive bi-xenon headlights, a panoramic roof, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear parking cameras and sensors, a rear diffuser, and quad exhaust outlets. Xpel paint protection film was applied to the front end in 2020, and the lower portion of the front bumper cover has imperfections. A replacement windshield was installed in September 2023. The 20″ forged alloy wheels were repaired and refinished in October 2023 and feature Cavallino Rampante center caps. They are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tires. The car is equipped with magnetorheological dampers, and stopping power is provided by black Ferrari-branded Brembo calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors. A brake fluid flush was performed in February 2024, at which time the brake fluid reservoir cap was replaced. The cabin houses seating surfaces trimmed in tan and black leather with diamond-stitched inserts and Cavallino Rampante-embroidered headrests. Appointments include heated power-adjustable front seats, twin bucket rear seats, a touchscreen infotainment system, a radar detector, navigation, automatic climate control, machined aluminum pedals, and cruise control. Sticky interior surfaces are noted by the seller, and the dashboard was reupholstered in November 2024. The leather-wrapped flat-bottomed steering wheel fronts paddle shifters and features a manettino drive-mode selector, an engine-start button, and additional controls. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,200-rpm redline and dual multifunction display screens. The digital odometer indicates 30k miles, approximately 22k of which were added under current ownership. A replacement paddle shifter was installed in 2020. The 6.3-liter Tipo F140EB V12 was factory rated at 651 horsepower and 504 lb-ft of torque. Work in February 2024 included changing the oil in addition to replacing the drive belt, thermostat, air filters, and lower radiator hoses. Power is sent to all four wheels through Ferrari’s 4RM system which utilizes a rear-mounted seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle in partnership with a front-mounted two-speed transaxle. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Foreign Cars Italia in Greensboro, North Carolina, along with factory equipment, colors, options, and a total suggested retail price of $343,156. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The car last passed an emissions inspection in June 2024. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
