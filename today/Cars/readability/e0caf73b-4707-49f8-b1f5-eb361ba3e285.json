  "text": "KGP Photography|Car and DriverOur spy photographer got their first look at the next-generation Mazda CX-5, which we expect to launch for the 2026 model year. The design language of the updated model stays true to the current CX-5, with the most obvious changes made to the headlights and taillights. While the larger CX-50 Hybrid borrows its gas-electric powertrain from the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, Mazda is poised to launch an in-house system for the CX-5. The Mazda CX-5 is old. In fact, it has been around in its current form since 2017. While it's atypical for any car to stick around for that long without major changes, it's not so surprising for the CX-5. That's because while the CX-5 has been sold alongside the slightly larger CX-50 for the past three years, it continues to be Mazda's bestseller. So, despite the CX-5's age and the in-family competition, Mazda is poised to release a new generation of the popular crossover—and we've finally captured spy photos.KGP Photography|Car and DriverFrom an exterior-styling perspective, the big changes look more like a mid-cycle refresh. That means the CX-5's overall size and shape carry on without any significant alterations. The front of the ute sports new headlights that stick to the brand's design language while adding a vertical element. The same can be said for the rear, which has a new set of taillights that flare up at the borders like the pointed ears on a corgi. Changes to the interior styling remain under wraps for the time being. KGP Photography|Car and DriverWe'll also have to wait a bit longer for confirmation on any changes made under the hood. Mazda's mid-year financial documents in 2024 showed plans for a newly developed in-house hybrid system for the CX-5; the CX-50 Hybrid shares a powertrain with the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid. While the Mazda system has yet to be confirmed, we expect it to be introduced with the new CX-5 generation. As things currently stand, the CX-5 offers two four-cylinder engines. The standard non-turbo churns out 187 horsepower, and the optional turbo version boosts power up to 256 ponies. The 2025 CX-5 lineup is already on sale, so we expect the refresh to arrive for the 2026 model year. More information will be revealed closer to the launch date. Jack Fitzgerald’s love for cars stems from his as yet unshakable addiction to Formula 1. After a brief stint as a detailer for a local dealership group in college, he knew he needed a more permanent way to drive all the new cars he couldn’t afford and decided to pursue a career in auto writing. By hounding his college professors at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he was able to travel Wisconsin seeking out stories in the auto world before landing his dream job at Car and Driver. His new goal is to delay the inevitable demise of his 2010 Volkswagen Golf.",
