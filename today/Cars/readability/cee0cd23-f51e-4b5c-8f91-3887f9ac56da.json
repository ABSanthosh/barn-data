  "text": "The new Big Bear Edition celebrates the Golden State and mixes luxury with capability 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Jeep has introduced the new Gladiator Big Bear Edition, which is exclusive to California. The model features a body-color hard top, leather seats, and 32-inch mud-terrain tires. Pricing starts at $46,090 and power comes from a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 with 285 hp. The Jeep Gladiator promised to shakeup the mid-sized truck segment, but it’s been a disappointment as the company only sold 42,123 units in the United States last year. That pales in comparison to the 192,813 Tacoma pickups that Toyota was able to sell. That’s not a good showing, but Jeep is fighting back with a new Big Bear Edition. Designed exclusively for California, the model is based on the Gladiator Sport S and pays homage to the Big Bear Lake Recreation Area. More: 2025 Jeep Gladiator Ditches Manual, Moves Further Upmarket Since this is just a special edition, changes are fairly limited and include Big Bear hood decals as well as rear tailgate badging. They’re joined by rock rails, a body-color hardtop, and black 17-inch wheels wrapped in 32-inch mud-terrain tires. While Gladiators aren’t known for being luxurious, the Big Bear Edition comes nicely equipped with a heated steering wheel as well as heated front seats wrapped in black McKinley leather. They’re joined by a 12.3-inch infotainment system, an eight-speaker audio system, and a universal garage door opener. Other highlights include an automatic climate control system and a 7-inch cluster display. Power comes from a 3.6-liter V6 engine producing 285 hp (213 kW / 289 PS) and 260 lb-ft (352 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a standard four-wheel drive system. Production is limited to 5,000 units and the 2025 Jeep Gladiator Big Bear Edition is now available at California dealerships. However, it’s not cheap as pricing starts at $46,090 before a $1,995 destination fee. In other California news, Stellantis donated $500,000 to the United Way of Greater Los Angeles Wildfire Response. The devastating fires occurred in January and killed dozens of people and caused tens of billions of dollars in damage.",
