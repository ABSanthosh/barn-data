Country of original delivery: Belgium Chassis/VIN: 13309 Mileage: 6,560 km (4,076 miles) Colour: Rosso Original color of delivery: Marrone Metallizzato 106-M-73 Price: Call for Price The car As part of its Private Sales initiative, Petrolicious is proud to offer a unique collector-grade Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, represented the epitome of front-mounted V12 Ferraris from 1968 to 1996. Launched in 1968, it marked the only front-mounted V12, 2-seater Ferrari for almost 30 years. The car featured a 4.4L, 352-horsepower V12 Colombo engine (the penultimate model to utilize this engine), clear-lensed headlights, and circular rear lights. This car, born in stunning Marrone Metallizzato paint (on black interior), benefitted from very special treatment from Ferrari, as it was once owned by a relative of Didier Pirroni (Formula 1 driver for Ferrari in the early 80's), who directly commissioned his employer to perform a nut-and-bolt restoration on this Daytona. This resulted in what is arguably one of the earliest known restoration projects undergone by Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona initially featured fixed headlights behind a plexiglass cover (Plexi) for a sleek, streamlined front-end design. However, in 1971, regulatory changes (particularly in the U.S.) required Ferrari to replace these with pop-up headlights to meet new safety standards, as the Plexi setup was deemed less durable. The change created a subtle design shift, with the Plexi version now considered more desirable among collectors due to its rarity and, arguably cleaner, more distinctive look. Continue...",
