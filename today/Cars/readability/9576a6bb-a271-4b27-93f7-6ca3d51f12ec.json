  "text": "Shocking news! Mercedes buyers don't want anonymous, electric jellybeans January 7, 2025 at 19:01 by Michael Gauthier Mercedes had a mixed year in the United States, but sales climbed 9% in 2024. Crossovers led the way and G-Class sales exceeded 10,000 units for the first time ever. EV sales plummeted with the EQB, EQE, and EQS lineups all posting significant declines. Sales figures continue to trickle in and the latest come from Mercedes-Benz. They paint an interesting picture that shows a preference for gas-powered performance instead of eco-friendly EVs. Starting with the latter, Mercedes-AMG posted a record fourth quarter with sales of 16,169 units. The G-Class also had its best year ever as customers snapped up 10,987 SUVs. More: BMW XM Had A Terrible First Full Year With Just 1,974 Units Sold In The US While that’s good news, Mercedes bet big on electric vehicles and this appears to be a bust. EQB sales were down 36% for the year, while the EQE lineup fell 39%. The range-topping EQS lineup was even harder hit as sales plummeted 52% to a disappointing 6,963 units. Even the eSprinter is struggling as the company only found 828 buyers. Crossovers were unsurprisingly the best-selling models of 2024. The GLE took the sales crown with 67,928 units and was closely followed by the GLC, which racked up 64,163 sales. In a distant third place was the C-Class, which moved 35,590 units for a slight increase of 1%. The company’s other sedans experienced a decline as the CLA was down 2%, while the E-Class was off by half as much. The S-Class fared far worse as sales fell 25% to 8,809 units. Coupes and convertibles found solid footing as the new CLE lineup generated 14,333 sales. The AMG GT climbed 77% to 3,491 units, but the SL fell 56% to 1,608. Overall, Mercedes-Benz USA finished the year on a positive note as passenger vehicle sales were up 9% to 324,528 units. That trailed BMW (371,346) and Lexus (345,669), but the brand beat Audi (196,576), Cadillac (160,204), Acura (132,367), Volvo (125,243), Lincoln (104,823), and Infiniti (58,070). 2024 Mercedes U.S. Sales",
