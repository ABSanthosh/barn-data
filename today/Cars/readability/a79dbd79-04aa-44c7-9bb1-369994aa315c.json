  "text": "Jaguar boss Rawdon Glover said the company's new electric platform is not designed to accept hybrid setups or gas engines, per a report by Autocar.Glover also revealed that he hit 160 mph on a test track in the 986-hp top-of-the-line version of the upcoming I-type grand tourer.According to Glover, the design will remain remarkably similar to the dramatic Type 00 concept revealed last year.Jaguar's rebranding and plans for an electric grand tourer—previewed by last year's Type 00 concept—have been polarizing, but there's no going back for the British automaker. In an interview with Autocar, Jaguar's managing director Rawdon Glover explained why the brand must commit to EVs and divulged a few more details about the upcoming electric GT, which might adopt the name I-type.Jaguar's Future Is Electric OnlyOther automakers have reacted to cooling growth rates for EV demand by postponing or canceling plans for new electric models. For example, earlier today Maserati confirmed it's ditching the MC20 Folgore electric supercar project. But Glover said that \"there is no flexibility\" for Jaguar since the Jaguar Electric Architecture that will underpin its entire future lineup cannot support hybrid or gas powertrains. JaguarA prototype for the electric Jaguar four-door grand tourer.\"We made the decision back in 2021 to have an electric architecture dedicated to us,\" he explained. \"There isn’t the opportunity to put a V-8 into it or something else.\" Glover expressed confidence in the EV market, however, stating that \"a lot of things will change\" over the next decade and that \"EV will be the right platform for us and the powertrain of choice\" for the market. \"Advancements in technology and infrastructure are going to make a big difference,\" he predicted.Lofty Power and Price In regards to the car itself, Jaguar's head honcho said he had driven the range-topping version of the I-type on the test track at up to 160 mph. Autocar reported this variant produces 986 horsepower, and Glover described it as the \"most fun I've had\" while serving atop the brand. \"It was stunning in terms of its speed, its acceleration, its performance, but also how it delivered the power with a real sense of character,\" he said. Despite the heady power figures, the I-type will not be designed as a sports car. Instead, Glover sees it as a car that \"you can drive confidently at pace for extended periods and still come out feeling great.\"While the GT car will ride on the new dedicated Jaguar Electric Architecture, Glover confirmed it will share its electric motors and battery with other JLR models. \"Economically, there’s no way around that,\" Glover conceded. We wouldn't be surprised if some of the I-type's components are shared with, say, the upcoming Land Rover Range Rover EV.Illustration by Avarvarii|Car and DriverA render of how the production version of the I-type could look.The design won't be a significant departure from the Type 00 concept, although the production car will sprout a second pair of doors. \"There is strong lineage\" between the concept and production models, most notably with the proportions, long hood, front fascia, and the taillight graphic, which consists of a series of horizontal lines that Jaguar is calling the \"Strikethrough.\" The Type 00 concept's cabin has a pair of large screens that could completely fold out of sight, and perhaps something similar could reach production, as Glover said that the car won't be \"bombarding the driver with technology.\"While Jaguar had previously said the electric GT would hit the road in late 2026, Autocar now reports the Jaguar will be revealed by the end of this year and start production in the middle of 2026. We had previously expected the starting price for the I-type to be around $200,000, but it could end up being significantly lower, with Glover quoting a price of roughly $128,000. Jaguar's GT will be the first of three new models, with the next two debuts expected to be a large sedan and an SUV.Caleb Miller began blogging about cars at 13 years old, and he realized his dream of writing for a car magazine after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University and joining the Car and Driver team.
