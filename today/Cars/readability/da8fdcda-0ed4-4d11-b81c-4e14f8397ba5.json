While most of us ride to escape from it all, disconnecting completely is not always an option. Sometimes we need to be available for a spouse at home with the kids. Or our phone is our navigation. While we are not advocates of distracted driving, we recognize that sometimes there is a need to see your phone while you ride. The market’s awash with scores of systems for keeping you connected, and aside from determining which company you trust most with your device, you’ll need to consider your hardware. Is there room on your handlebars for another clamp, or do you need to look elsewhere? Do you want wireless charging? With more than our fair share of miles under our belt, we know which features make the grade for us, and we’ve compiled a list of five motorcycle phone mounts that we feel will satisfy most riders.  motogadget CAYO Dokk The CAYO Dokk by motogadget is a premium German-engineered smartphone mount designed specifically for motorcycle use. Built with precision and style, the CAYO Dokk is available in multiple mounting options, including mirror, clutch, and handlebar mounts, giving riders installation flexibility. In addition to motogadget’s reputation for high-quality accessories, a big draw for the CAYO Dokk is the simple spring-loaded attachment lugs, which make mounting your phone quick and easy. Riders can choose between charging and non-charging variants, with the charging model offering inductive wireless charging and integrated vibration decoupling, ensuring phone safety even on rough terrain. The system is compatible exclusively with the CAYO cell phone case, which is available for both iPhone and Android devices. Whether you opt for the full-featured charging model or the ultra-compact, minimalist version, the CAYO Dokk remains lightweight, discreet, and engineered for peak performance. [motogadget] Quad Lock Handlebar Mount Quad Lock motorcycle phone mounts are engineered for riders who demand personalization and rugged, upgradeable performance. Featuring a patented dual-stage locking mechanism, these mounts offer rock-solid security for your smartphone, even at high speeds or on rough terrain. Quad’s twist-and-lock mounting system is tried and true, and while it’s a slightly more involved procedure than some competitors, it’s proven in the harshest conditions. Designed to integrate seamlessly with your bike, Quad Lock mounts are available in glass-filled nylon, black aluminum, and chrome finish, allowing you to match your setup to your motorcycle’s style. With standard and oversized handlebar options, you’re guaranteed a precise fit. The system does require a proprietary phone case, but that’s where customization begins. Quad Lock offers a fully modular, à la carte setup so you can select exactly what you need—whether it’s a handlebar clamp, brake reservoir mount, mirror mount, or stem mount. Optional add-ons like vibration-damping, charging accessories, and weather protection covers make the system even more versatile. Plus, with a wide range of lifestyle accessories available, you can expand your Quad Lock use beyond the bike for a consistent phone-mounting system. [Quad Lock] RAM Mounts Quick-Grip XL The RAM Quick-Grip XL is a rugged, spring-loaded phone holder designed to accommodate a wide range of large smartphones and electronic devices. It features adjustable side supports that ensure a secure grip while allowing for one-handed insertion and removal of your device. The Quick-Grip XL handlebar kit includes a short RAM double socket arm and a zinc-coated handlebar U-bolt base, which fits rails from 0.5″ to 1.25″ in diameter, providing a solid and versatile mounting solution. RAM’s signature ball and socket system offers nearly infinite adjustability, letting you fine-tune the position of your device with ease. Constructed from marine-grade aluminum and high-strength composite, the Quick-Grip XL is built for long-term durability in even the harshest environments. It does not require a proprietary case, making it compatible with virtually any smartphone and allowing for wide forward and backward device compatibility. However, the basic kit lacks vibration damping, so you’ll have to pony up for the Vibe-Safe holder for motorcycles with high-powered engines and iPhones with sensitive camera modules. Backed by a lifetime warranty, this mount is ideal for riders who prioritize flexibility and durability over built-in vibration protection. [Ram Mounts] FREAKMOUNT BILLET 2.0 The FREAKMOUNT BILLET 2.0 is a high-performance, no-fuss magnetic phone holder developed especially for cruisers and classics with steel fuel tanks. Milled from durable billet aluminum and featuring spring-loaded clamps, it automatically grips your phone with a secure, snug hold—no tools or special phone cases are required. The design is forward- and backward-compatible, accommodating a wide range of devices, including bulky models like the Samsung S24 Ultra with Otterbox Defender cases. Its magnetic base firmly attaches to metal gas tanks, allowing for the quickest and easiest mounting. Built with stability and speed in mind, the FREAKMOUNT BILLET 2.0 is rated up to 240 mph. Its dual independently moving sides help dampen road and engine vibrations, reducing lateral movement and keeping your phone stable even in rough conditions. Available in six vibrant colors, the Freakmount is crafted for supreme simplicity and style. [FREAKMOUNT] Peak Design Motorcycle Bar Mount Born from a passion for travel and photography, Peak Design crafts smart products for savvy adventurers. Peak Design’s motorcycle cell phone mounts combine precision engineering with rider-centric functionality, offering mirror, clutch, and handlebar mounting options in both charging and non-charging variants. Designed to work exclusively with the Peak Design phone case—available for iPhone and Android—these mounts provide a rigid and secure hold, and feature optional charging hardware via cutting-edge Qi2 wireless charging. The SlimLink system allows effortless, one-handed phone removal, even while wearing gloves, while integrated vibration damping protects sensitive phone components during rides. Rooted in a culture of user-focused design and independence, Peak Design was founded in 2010 by Peter Dering after a life-changing trip around the world sparked his first Kickstarter project. Since then, the company has utilized crowdfunding to stay connected to its community and true to its creative vision. That same ethos is built into every motorcycle mount they produce—innovative, durable, and crafted for real-world performance without compromise. [Peak Design] Whether you’re a weekend wanderer or a daily commuter, having a reliable phone mount can be the difference between a smooth ride and a frustrating detour. From high-tech systems with wireless charging and vibration damping, to simple magnetic solutions that go on in seconds, today’s motorcycle phone mounts offer something for every style of rider and bike. The key is choosing the one that fits your needs, because let’s face it: the only thing that should be flying down the road at 5,000 RPM is your engine, not your phone.
