  "text": "This 2013 Dodge Challenger SXT has been modified with a Dodge Viper–sourced 8.4-liter V10 mated to a six-speed manual transmission, and features black-finished SRT-style 20″ wheels, Wilwood brakes, adjustable coilovers, Hellcat hood and bumper covers, a front splitter and canards, a decklid spoiler, a rear diffuser, later-model taillights, and an SRT-branded steering wheel. The car is finished in white over black cloth upholstery and was previously listed on BaT in July 2023. The seller acquired the car in August 2023 and subsequent work at Prefix Corporation of Auburn Hills, Michigan, included rewiring the AEM engine controller, adding two knock sensors, servicing the air conditioning, repairing the reverse lock-out function, and fitting an AEM display and revised throttle bodies. This Viper-powered Challenger is now offered with service records and a Florida title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in white and features a Hellcat vented hood and bumper covers, a front splitter with stabilizer bars, front canards, a replacement grille, tinted glass, an SRT-style decklid spoiler, later-model taillights, a rear diffuser, and quad exhaust outlets. Viper logos are present on the hood, graphics on the nose read “Powered by Prefix,” and “ACR” decals adorn the front fenders. Work under current ownership consisted of removing the rear wing and fitting a replacement decklid. SRT-style 20″ wheels are finished in black and mounted with Fullway HP108 tires measuring 275/30 up front and 315/35 out back. The car has been fitted with a Wilwood big-brake kit with red-finished calipers as well as slotted and cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The modified suspension features adjustable coilovers. The seating surfaces are trimmed in black cloth upholstery joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpeting. Amenities include automatic climate control, power windows, power mirrors, and power door locks as well as a factory AM/FM/CD stereo. The air conditioning was serviced under current ownership and an AEM data screen with shift lights is mounted above the center of the dashboard. An SRT-branded steering wheel features a red centering stripe and fronts a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 5,800-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges. The digital odometer shows 9k miles, and true mileage is unknown. The Carfax report shows a mileage discrepancy and the seller notes that the cluster was likely installed and reset when the V10 engine was fitted. An 8.4-liter V10—reportedly sourced from a fourth-generation Dodge Viper—was installed in place of the car’s original 3.6L V6 in 2016. Prefix Corporation of Rochester Hills, Michigan subsequently carried out work that included updating the power steering and replacing the radiator, thermostat, and temperature gauge. Work under current ownership consisted of rewiring the AEM engine controller, revising the engine calibration, and installing an air conditioning control module, two knock sensors, and Generation 5 throttle bodies. An oil change was performed in August 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec six-speed manual transmission. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists open recalls and the aforementioned mileage discrepancy. The report indicates that the car was “Titled or registered as rental vehicle” in February 2013. The Florida title lists a “Not Actual” mileage brand. You are not connected to real-time updates.
