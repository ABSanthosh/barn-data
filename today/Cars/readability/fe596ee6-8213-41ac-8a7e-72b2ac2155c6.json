  "text": "Photos of the aftermath reveal the extent of the damage, suggesting the Jag might well be a write-off March 23, 2025 at 21:02 by Thanos Pappas A Ford Everest climbed over a stationary Jaguar F-Type after turning at an intersection. The accident was caught on dashcam footage, showing that the SUV’s driver was at fault. The Jaguar sports car suffered severe damage, while the rugged Ford lost a wheel. Looks like the automotive gods have delivered yet another bizarre collision, this time between a Ford Everest and a Jaguar F-Type in Brisbane, Australia. If you’ve ever wondered what happens when a bulky SUV meets a low-slung sports car, here’s your answer. The accident took place earlier this month. Dashcam footage from the Jaguar, essentially a front-row seat to a crash test, shows the F-Type standing still when it was hit. Spoiler: it wasn’t the Jag’s fault, but you wouldn’t guess that by looking at the damage.

The Jaguar was positioned behind the Volkswagen. As the Everest made its right turn, it unexpectedly accelerated. With the wheels still turned, the SUV crashed into the stationary F-Type and then collided with a Chery Tiggo 4 Pro SUV behind it. According to a report from our colleagues at CarExpert, another car was approaching from the opposite direction, likely causing the Ford driver to panic and hit the accelerator pedal. Dashcam footage shared by the Dash Cam Owners Australia page on Facebook reveals just how extensive the damage was. The Jaguar will require a new bumper, headlight, hood, front fender, driver’s side door, and rear quarter panel, racking up a hefty repair bill. And that’s just the visible damage. Given how expensive repairs are these days, we’re going to take a wild guess and call this a write-off.

The driver of the Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, on the other hand, got off easy, with just a few scuffs on the nose of their SUV. Despite the severity of the crash, no injuries have been reported. Still, the Jaguar driver surely had a moment of pure panic watching a Ford Everest SUV awkwardly clamber over the F-Type’s long hood. Screenshots: Dash Cam Owners Australia / Facebook",
