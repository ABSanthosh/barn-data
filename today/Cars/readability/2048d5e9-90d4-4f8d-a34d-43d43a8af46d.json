It was purchased new by the current owner from Morgan West of Santa Monica, California, in December 2005, and now has 4,800 miles. The car is finished in metallic green over tan leather upholstery, and power comes from a Ford 3.0-liter DOHC V6 linked to a five-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes front disc brakes, 16″ wire wheels with knock-off hubs, a leather hood strap, a green soft top, and a rear-mounted spare tire. Inside, the left-hand-drive cockpit features driver and passenger airbags, air conditioning, an Alpine stereo, and green carpets. This Morgan is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with the original sales contract, a tonneau cover, a top boot, side curtains, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the owner’s name. The Morgan Roadster was introduced in 2004 to replace the Rover V8–powered Plus 8. The aluminum bodywork on this example is finished in metallic green and mounted to a steel ladder-frame chassis. Exterior details include chrome bumpers, a louvered hood, a leather hood strap, a green soft top with tan piping, triple windshield wipers, a Le Mans–style fuel filler, a high-mount brake light, and dual exhaust outlets. A green tonneau cover, top boot, and side curtains are included in the sale, and they are pictured in the gallery below. Chrome-finished 16″ wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-off hubs, and they are mounted with 205/55 Michelin Premier A/S tires that were installed in 2016. A spare wheel is secured under a green canvas cover out back. The car rides on front coil springs and rear leaf springs, and braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The cockpit features seats trimmed in tan leather with green piping. Tan leather extends to the door panels, dash pad, transmission tunnel, and doorsills, while green carpeting lines the floors. Equipment includes a burl wood dash panel, an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, door-panel storage pockets, and removable headrests with green Morgan embroidery. The car is equipped with airbags, and an enamel Morgan West medallion is affixed to the dashboard. The four-spoke steering wheel fronts white-dial instrumentation consisting of a 180-mph speedometer and a Morgan-branded 8k-rpm tachometer. Smiths gauges for coolant temperature, voltage, fuel level, and oil pressure are positioned in the center of the dash. The digital odometer shows 4,800 miles. The Ford 3.0-liter V6 features an aluminum block and dual overhead camshafts. Output was rated at 225 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and 200 lb-ft of torque at 5,400 rpm. The battery was installed in 2021, and an oil change was performed most recently in early 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The air-conditioning condenser is located under the car and cooled by dual electric fans. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
