  "description": "The 2024 Kawasaki KLX230 marks a significant entry into the Indian market as the first road-legal Japanese dual-sport. On paper this bike is designed to cater to off-road enthusiasts who might also want to use the bike for urban commutes, offering a blend of rugged performance and everyday usability. I’ve spent significant time riding the KLX230 through the broken streets of Mumbai, some local trails and a couple of highway stints. Here’s what I’ve discovered during that time. The KLX230 embodies a true dual-sport aesthetic with its slim profile, minimal bodywork, 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels and towering stance. The overall design looks purposeful and eye-catching, especially in this shade of lime green. A small issue that triggered my OCD was how much of a dirt magnet this dual-tone seat was as it showed signs of discolouration very early on in its life.   Taillight looks rather old and retro This dual-sport is rather sparsely equipped for its price and is as barebones as it gets for a road-legal machine. You get an LCD screen that displays only the basics like a speedometer, odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. If I was nitpicking, I would have liked a rev counter and a distance-to-empty indicator to aid with any extended trail rides. The switchgear is also simple in design and misses out on a pass light switch. Our test unit also had an unresponsive ABS button. However, these are minor issues that hardly ever hindered my overall experience with this motorcycle. On paper, the KLX230 is no powerhouse, but in the real world, it feels surprisingly engaging and quick. This 233cc air-cooled motor packs sufficient torque and low-end grunt for everyday riding while also being easy to handle for new riders. The 7.6 litre tank is small but the KLX230 is quite fuel efficient. Throughout my time, the KLX230 rarely ever felt underpowered or slow. Unlike its closest rival Hero, the KLX230 is a much more lively experience and rewards you with a loud exhaust that barks and pops. The short gearing works rather well off-road and in the city. The 6-speed gearbox has you constantly shifting gears to stay in the meat of the powerband, adding yet another layer of involvement. In our tests, the KLX230 showed in-gear acceleration figures that were quicker than even the KTM 250 Duke. It is also 2 seconds faster from 0-100kph than the Xpulse 200 4V, thanks to its massive 20kg weight advantage. It’s also worth noting that this motorcycle hits a top speed of 121kph in 6th gear with the engine at the rev limiter.  Despite being so engaging, this motor is also quite refined and even returns some good fuel efficiency. In our tests, the KLX230 managed to give us a respectable figure of  42kpl on the highway and 39kpl in the city. However, it is worth mentioning that the KLX230 isn’t the best commuter and its sharp throttle and eagerness to jump off the line do require more restraint in bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the highway, the KLX230 can comfortably cruise at 80kph and perhaps even hold 100kph if you can bear the wind and vibration. While its 7.6-litre tank is rather small, the fuel-sipping nature means you can still comfortably get over 200km on a tankful. While the 880mm seat height may appear quite daunting on paper and in person, the soft suspension allows riders that are even 5’8” to flatfoot while in the saddle. Shorter riders who are heavier can certainly take advantage of this setup or opt for an optional lower seat. Speaking of which, I found the seat comfort adequate for shorter rides but pillion comfort is non-existent due to the seat’s narrow shape and lack of cushioning. For the rider, most of the cushioning is right upfront which may provide some comfort but leaves you in a more aggressive riding position. The standing ergonomics also seem better suited for shorter riders and left me feeling a little restricted. Instead, I preferred sitting right behind the tank while off-road, giving me much better control. The non-adjustable suspension provides 240mm of front and 250mm of rear travel, effectively absorbing bumps and ensuring a relatively comfortable ride. At this price, an adjustable fork would have been a nice addition. Thanks to its 139kg weight, the KLX230 is a boon to handle and muscle around off-road. It feels agile and can be quite forgiving, allowing for quicker and easier corrections while off-road. It’s also a hoot to jump and glides over most humps or bumps on the road. It only takes a particularly deep pothole at higher speeds to break its stride. The KLX230 is also a comfortable motorcycle for most commutes, hindered only by its ergonomics.  The MRF tyres performed well enough but a better set of dual-sport tyres would enhance its capabilities both on and off-road. While the braking performance is decent, the way it happens may trigger a sense of basophobia. Due to the soft front suspension, even a mild tap at the lever can make the front end dive down dramatically. This was particularly scary under hard or emergency braking conditions, despite the fact that the motorcycle reliably comes to a halt. While initially concerning, this soft setup eventually got more predictable and stopped being as bothersome towards the end.   At Rs 3.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India), on paper, the KLX230 doesn’t offer great value. Factor in the limited service network and potentially expensive spare parts, this isn’t a motorcycle you would want to damage. However, if you’re willing to accept those things, what you’re getting is a friendly dual-sport that is exciting to both look at and ride. Plus you get the peace of mind of having a piece of reliable Japanese engineering in your garage that is built to outlast you. Another silver lining is the plethora of after-market accessories available for you to tweak the KLX to your liking and potentially solve any above-mentioned shortcomings. So if your pockets are deep enough, the KLX makes a fun yet versatile bike to add to your garage.",
