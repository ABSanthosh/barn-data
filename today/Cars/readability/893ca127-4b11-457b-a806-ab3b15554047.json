The first model, apparently codenamed PZ1K and likely to be some sort of rugged-ish machine in the style of an old Nissan Xterra, won’t see the light of day until November 2028 while an Infiniti variant of the same car is now slated for about four months after that time. The rug was already pulled on plans for Maxima-sized EV sedans in this country, though that decision was predicated on soft demand for that type of body style on this side of the pond. This latest move is arguably in direct response to decrees contained in the so-called Big Beautiful Bill which was signed by Trump on Independence Day. In it, the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on new machines and a $4,500 chit on used ones have evaporated.As for these two Nissans, the company says the approximately ten-month delay in production amounts to nothing more than a slight adjustment. Cynics in the room will note the new date of November 2028 neatly aligns with when the next American election is supposed to occur, determining who will occupy the White House. Read into that what you will. Through to the end of the second quarter this calendar year, Nissan has sold 209,114 vehicles from that brand, plus an additional 12,327 units with Infiniti logos. That’s a drop of 6.1% and 12.7% respectively compared to the same time frame twelve months ago. Its sales leader was the Rogue, finding 109,563 homes; the all-electric Ariya sold 11,619 units while the Leaf found about four thousand takers.[Images: Nissan]Become a TTAC insider.
