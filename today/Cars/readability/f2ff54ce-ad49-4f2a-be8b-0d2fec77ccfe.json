  "description": "After recently debuting its new E-Clutch technology on its 650cc platform, Honda will soon add the same technology to the CL250 and Rebel 250.  Honda E Clutch allows for seamless gearshifts without using the clutch It adds nearly 3kgs to the Rebel 250 and CL250  Honda 250s to soon get E-Clutch E-Clutch a beneficial system to have on a beginner-friendly bike The E-Clutch technology is a semi-automatic transmission system that allows the rider to fore-go the use of the clutch allowing for a smoother ride, while retaining the ability to shift manually using the gear shifter. This means that the rider can pull away from a stop, shift up and down gears, and come back to a halt all without pulling in the clutch lever. This system is not a fully automatic one, like BMW’s ASA, Yamaha’s Y-AMT and Honda’s very own DCT seen on the Africa Twin, X-ADV and Gold Wing. While this tech had only previously been applied to Honda’s larger, more sporty motorcycles, the CBR650R and CB650R, its application on small bikes like the Rebel 250 and CL250 makes a lot of sense, as it eliminates the trials and tribulations of a traditional manual gearbox. Engaging and disengaging the clutch is always tricky for beginner riders and Honda's E-Clutch system acts like a safety net while still allowing the rider to retain manual control as they progressively get better at clutch control.  Aside from the addition of the E-Clutch, the rest of the motorcycles’ specifications will remain same, except the weight, where both motorcycles gain about 2.8kg due to the addition of the E-Clutch unit.  Also See: Honda CB650R, CBR650R now only available with E Clutch in India",
