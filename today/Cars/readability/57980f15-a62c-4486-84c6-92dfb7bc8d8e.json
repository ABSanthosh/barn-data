  "description": "This 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera RS was sold new in Germany and relocated in the early 2000s to France, where it was acquired by the current owner in 2023. Finished in Guards Red, the car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six mated to a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. It rides on magnesium 17\" Cup wheels and is further equipped with a seam-welded chassis, an aluminum front trunk lid, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. Inside, fixed-back Recaro bucket seats are trimmed in black and gray multi-tone leather and are accompanied by Willans multi-point harnesses, a roll cage, and Sparco drilled pedals. Service completed since 2021 involved servicing the distributor along with overhauling the brake calipers and replacing the rotors and rear tires. This 964 911 Carrera RS is now offered on dealer consignment in Toulon, France, with manufacturer's literature, service records, and French registration.",

Finished in Guards Red, the car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six mated to a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential.

Inside, fixed-back Recaro bucket seats are trimmed in black and gray multi-tone leather and are accompanied by Willans multi-point harnesses, a roll cage, and Sparco drilled pedals. Service completed since 2021 involved servicing the distributor along with overhauling the brake calipers and replacing the rotors and rear tires. This 964 911 Carrera RS is now offered on dealer consignment in Toulon, France, with manufacturer’s literature, service records, and French registration. The Carrera RS was reintroduced with the 964 chassis and featured a seam-welded bodyshell as well as an aluminum front trunk lid, rolled fenders, and thinner side and rear windows than those used on the standard Carrera. This example left the factory in Guards Red (L80K) and has since been refinished. Brake cooling ducts have been installed in place of the faux fog lights, and features include Carrera RS side lettering, side marker lamps, dual side mirrors, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. A selection of paint meter readings and flaws in the finish are shown in the gallery below. Magnesium 17″ Cup wheels are mounted with Pirelli PZero tires measuring 205/50 up front and 255/40 out back, the latter of which were replaced in 2024. The Carrera RS features a lowered and stiffened suspension with Bilstein coilovers as well as adjustable front and rear sway bars. Stopping power is provided by an anti-lock system featuring four-piston calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The calipers were overhauled in 2024, at which time the rotors and pads were replaced. Peeling paint and other blemishes are noted on the wheels. The cockpit houses fixed-back Recaro bucket seats outfitted with Willans multi-point harnesses and trimmed in black and gray multi-tone upholstery. The car was delivered from the factory without airbags, air conditioning, or sound-deadening material, and the simplified door panels feature roll-up windows and pull straps. A roll cage and Sparco drilled pedals are further appointments. The leather-wrapped four-spoke steering wheel frames a central tachometer, a 300-km/h speedometer, a clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 95k kilometers (~59k miles). The 3.6-liter M64/03 flat-six was equipped from the factory with a lightened flywheel and was rated at 260 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Additional features include a sport-tuned Bosch engine management system and a cooling fan driven by a single belt. The seller notes that the distributor was serviced in 2021, while the battery was replaced in 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle that features steel synchronizers, closer ratios than the standard Carrera, and an asymmetrical limited-slip differential. Manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a tool kit will accompany the car. The vehicle is being sold on its French registration, which serves as an ownership document in France.
