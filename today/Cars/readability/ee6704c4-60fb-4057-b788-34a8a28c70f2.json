Its crossplane architecture delivers oodles of usable torque—and somehow manages to feel rowdy and manageable all at once. Yamaha has slotted that motor into everything from the retro-flavoured XSR900 GP to the touring-ready Tracer 9. The one gap in Yamaha’s MT-09 lineup? An adventure bike. Ever since Yamaha pulled the wraps off the Ténéré 700, we’ve been waiting for them to create a bigger version of it… a Ténéré 900, if you will. Just like the MT-07 engine’s tractable nature has made it ideal for adventure duty, the MT-09’s torquey donk has all the makings of a brilliant all-terrain ripper. If only. Fortunately, Purpose Built Moto is on the case. Based on the Gold Coast in Australia, they’ve taken a 2019-spec MT-09 and turned it into the Ténéré 900 that Yamaha hasn’t built (yet). “Often, when a conversation starts between me and a client, the idea evolves around what they want out of the project,” says shop boss Tom Gilroy. “The idea for this one spawned from a love of triple engines, the sound and power they make, and the want for an adventure machine. Tyson [the client] had some clear ideas, but it was up to us to figure out the best way to make this happen.” PBM’s minds immediately went to the Yamaha Ténéré 700—and building a three-cylinder version of it seemed like a no-brainer. “The MT-09, as it sits, is lighter than the Ténéré 700 and makes more power,” Tom explains. “So if we were to beef up the suspension, lift the bike, fabricate a rally tower, and convert the wheels to off-road sizes wrapped in knobby tires, that would probably make a lot of sense—or at least be a lot of fun.” PBM’s first port of call was the Yamaha MT-09’s suspension and wheels. A set of KTM 1190 Adventure forks went onto the front without too much fuss, but the rear end of the bike proved to be more of a challenge. The bike was sent to Charlie Costanzo at Costanzo Racing Tuned to have the front end dialed in and to have a custom-spec rear shock built. But that was just half the battle. “A little heavy engineering was needed to have the rear operating correctly,” Tom explains. “I had to design and fabricate some new shock linkages for the lower shock mount, as well as re-engineer the central frame brace and top shock mount to allow the suspension to actuate properly through its full range of motion. Some of this stuff is a bit like black magic to me, but between myself and Charlie we can pretty much figure anything out; it’s mostly Charlie.” Next, the MT-09 was treated to dirt-appropriate wheels and tires. It now rolls on 21F/18R Excel rims, wrapped in Motoz Tractionator RallZ tires. Twin Brembo brake calipers do duty up front, and the bike is set up so that Tyson can swap in a set of 17” for spirited asphalt adventures. With the MT-09 standing tall, Tom started figuring out the exhaust system. He sourced a pair of Yoshimura mufflers, mounted them underneath the seat, and fabricated a section to connect them to the stock three-into-one collector. To nail the rally raid aesthetic, PBM ordered a Ténéré 700-specific rally tower from Italy, complete with LED lights and a clear windscreen. Once the team had adapted it to fit the MT-09, they fabricated aluminum side fairings to link the OEM fuel tank to the new tower, while maintaining the angular vibe of the OEM body panels. The front-end was finished off with a pair of yellow Perspex wind deflectors, which are neatly integrated with custom brackets that also accommodate the original dashboard. The cockpit also features a Quad Lock wireless smartphone charger and vibration dampener, attached to a handmade mounting plate. High and wide handlebars, fitted with PBM mirrors and aftermarket levers, complete the package. Lower down, the crew relocated the foot controls to a more appropriate placement for adventure riding, and upgraded them with grippy MX-style pegs. PBM also fabricated the aluminum front fender and fork guards, along with a sharp rear fender that continues the sharp enduro-inspired styling. Details include an integrated LED taillight, a pair of PBM LED turn signals, and a discreet license plate bracket. A seat worthy of a triple-cylinder dirt bike sits up top, upholstered in gripper vinyl by regular PBM collaborator, Jamason at Timeless Auto Trim. With the exhaust headers running close to the rider’s legs, the team crafted a set of aluminum side covers to complement the existing heat shields. Other handmade details include a generous sump guard and a set of crash bars, made from chromoly tubing. Not pictured are the bike’s new luggage racks, which can be fitted in minutes to hold a set of Kriega bags. Once PBM was done dressing the MT-09, Tom and Tyson stared at the raw metal bodywork and started debating how to paint it. “We threw ideas around, from classic Yamaha Dakar liveries to vintage MX graphics,” says Tom. “We finally landed on a blue and yellow Yamaha throwback that would use the iconic speedblock design, mixed with a flat Yamaha blue and pops of yellow.” “Justin from Pop Bang Classics broke out the paints, mixed up some incredible colors, and took our paint renders from a laptop screen to reality. I was shocked at the color Justin produced—so crispy and flat that all of our custom sheet metal looked like plastic.” As soon as the paint had dried and Purpose Built Moto’s Ténéré 900 was all buttoned up, Tom took it for a shakedown run. Since we’re well acquainted with the MT-09’s motor, it didn’t surprise us to hear that he had the time of his life. “I only have on-road experience, but my God is it fun,” he confirms. “Ripping the throttle will bring the front wheel up without hesitation, and, once traction control is turned off, the bike is a wild animal, tamed only by the rider’s throttle control.” We’re sold. Now if only Yamaha would take note… Purpose Built Moto | Facebook | Instagram | Images by Tristan Tolley \u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e﻿\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e﻿\u003c/span\u003e",

Once the team had adapted it to fit the MT-09, they fabricated aluminum side fairings to link the OEM fuel tank to the new tower, while maintaining the angular vibe of the OEM body panels. The front-end was finished off with a pair of yellow Perspex wind deflectors, which are neatly integrated with custom brackets that also accommodate the original dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cockpit also features a Quad Lock \u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/4eNnbZg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ewireless smartphone charger\u003c/a\u003e and vibration dampener, attached to a handmade mounting plate.
