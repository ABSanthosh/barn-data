  "description": "TVS never stops updating its flagship 310cc models, and for 2025, the naked RTR 310 gets some small visual and electronic changes. The overall character of the bike remains unchanged, but these additions have made a noticeable improvement to the refinement of the riding experience. TVS Apache RTR 310 Design and Features - 9/10 India’s most feature rich bike gains some new tech The visual changes are limited to new handguards with aluminium frames, sequential turn indicators and a new transparent clutch cover like on the RR 310. There are also four new colours, although two of these will cost you extra; more on prices later.  The keyless fob is part of the Dynamic Pro Kit. The final physical feature addition is a keyless start and handlebar system, which is available on one of the two optional BTO (Built to Order) packages. However, there are multiple electronic changes as well.  Even the base variant comes standard with a TFT display. The 5-inch TFT display gets some revisions to its display layout. For the most part, it operates well, although there is a bit of a delay between your request for a riding mode change and the screen acknowledging it. One optional extra that is no longer available is the cooled seat. It was a great attempt at a valuable feature, but the comfort factor was a problem that couldn’t be solved. The new Apache RTR 310 otherwise continues to be a sharp and handsome motorcycle with an aggressively raked rear seat, an aluminium subframe and a powerful LED headlamp. TVS Apache RTR 310 Engine and Performance - 8/10 Still packs stronger performance than the spec sheet suggests, but with some improvements One of the most significant upgrades here is that TVS has recognised that the RTR 310 felt a little ‘untamed’ and has worked on increasing the smoothness of the throttle response. The company has created what it calls torque filtering, whereby the ride-by-wire system monitors not only how much the throttle is open but also how quickly it has been opened and then decides on the engine response accordingly. In function, it works quite well because the throttle response in city traffic, even in Sport mode, is now smoother and more predictable. The previous RTR was fun, but it never felt like it wanted to settle into a calmer state, which could get tiresome on a daily commute. Now, the bike feels more relaxed when you want, but the system gives you great response when you ask for it with a quicker throttle opening. TVS has achieved the objective of smoothing the throttle response, but the feeling of the system remains quite synthetic, and it lacks the natural feel of a throttle cable.  The clear clutch case adds to its style quotient. The addition of launch control is a new feature, and while it’s hardly something people will use often, it is a fun gimmick to have. Another electronic aid is Drag Torque Control, which basically assists the slip/assist clutch in smoothing out multiple aggressive downshifts. This is something already seen on some big bikes, and it opens the throttle valve slightly to feed the engine a small amount of fuel, which counteracts the reverse torque coming from the wheel under hard downshifts. Again, this is something most customers won’t notice, but you can switch the system off in the menus, and there is a perceptible difference in the smoothness at the rear wheel when hammering in three or four fast downshifts. The 312cc engine is otherwise mostly the same, and it remains at 35.6hp, unlike the RR 310 that was recently bumped up to 38hp. What has changed is that the RTR 310’s final drive gearing now matches the RR 310, which means the rear sprocket size has reduced by four teeth. The bike is still quite short-geared in nature but no longer excessively so. Its overall styling remains unchanged, barring a few small additions. Performance and refinement levels from this 4-valve liquid-cooled engine are largely the same since the last update in 2024, when TVS worked on reducing the perceptible vibrations. This is an exciting and quick-revving motor, and you will still feel varying levels of buzzing in the seat, fuel tank and footpegs at different points in the rev range. Thankfully, it is no longer as harsh as it was when it was first launched in 2023.  You can read our previous road test to get an understanding of the performance on offer here, and the RTR punches above its weight, even out-accelerating more powerful rivals like the Triumph Speed 400. A beautifully smooth bi-directional quickshifter only adds to the experience.  Engine2025 TVS Apache RTR 310Engine312.12 cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledOutput35.6hp at 9,700rpmTorque28.7Nm at 6,650rpmGearbox6-speed   TVS Apache RTR 310 Suspension Comfort, Handling and Brakes - 8/10 No changes to the way the bike handles The new RTR 310 carries the same chassis, suspension, brakes and tyres, and it also weighs the same 169kg, so there’s no surprise that it continues to ride as before. The seating position is well-judged for the road, with a mildly sporty lean down to the wide handlebar but good comfort in the footpeg placement. The 800mm seat height is friendly for short riders, and even tall folks will fit well on this bike. Things are a little different on track because there’s not a lot of room to slide back and tuck down. This is both thanks to the big pillion seat bump-stop and the large TFT that you’ll find right in front of your helmet when crouched down. Despite these compromises, on-track handling is really very good, and the bike feels light, agile and quick-turning but also comfortingly stable.  Our test bikes had the optional adjustable suspension, which most riders won’t need on the road, but it can be a good benefit on track. Another small improvement I noticed was that while this RTR’s traction control used to be unnecessarily intrusive (even in Track mode), that’s no longer the case, and I didn’t find the need to turn it off.  The Michelin Road 5 tyres provide a surprisingly sharp and fast transition in how the bike leans over to its side, but there’s superb grip once you’re there. The brakes feel the same as well, in that they have a slightly dull initial bite but good power once you put some effort into the lever.  The Michelin Road 5 tyres offer superb grip. However, as before, the RTR’s on-track limit arrives a little too early thanks to the footpegs scraping the tarmac. This was improved to some extent by removing the feeler bolts, but it didn’t solve the problem. Adding more suspension preload would have helped increase the cornering clearance, but it wasn’t something we had time to try at this event.  At the end of the day, the TVS RTR 310 is a very encouraging bike on track, and I wanted to keep reeling in the laps, but it’s not designed to particularly excel there. For those who want a sporty street naked that they clearly intend to take to the racetrack, the KTM 390 Duke will be the more rewarding choice. And on that note, it’s time to move to the price. Key specs2025 TVS Apache RTR 310Kerb weight169kgSeat height800mmFuel capacity11 litresGround clearance180mmWheelbase1358mm TVS Apache RTR 310 Price and Verdict - 8/10 More kit and features for a lower price than before  The good news is that TVS is offering introductory prices that are Rs 10,000 less than they were before. However, the RTR’s pricing is a rather confusing topic because it places the bike in two different lights. This bi-directional quickshifter adds to the overall experience. On the one hand, the base bike at Rs 2.4 lakh ex-showroom Delhi is a fantastic value because it offers much stronger performance than the likes of the KTM 250 Duke and still has valuable features like the Michelin Road 5 tyres, 5-inch TFT, traction control and cruise control. Our pick would be to pay the extra Rs 13,000 for the bi-directional quickshifter because it really does enhance the experience. Above that, you have the choice of adding the BTO Dynamic kit, which adds adjustable suspension, tyre pressure monitoring and a brass-coated chain. This takes the price to Rs 2.75 lakh. Instead of the Dynamic kit, you can add the Dynamic Pro kit, which introduces keyless start and a huge array of electronic rider aids that include cornering ABS, cornering traction control, anti-wheelie, anti-stoppie, and a whole lot more. This will increase the sticker price to Rs 2.85 lakh. If you add both the kits, the price goes to Rs 3.03 lakh. On top of this, the Fiery Red colour will set you back by a further Rs 5,000, while the Sepang Blue costs a massive Rs 15,000. At this point, the RTR 310 costs significantly more than a KTM 390 Duke, and while we salute TVS’ efforts towards introducing segment-leading technologies, they’re not essential with this performance level, and they push the price into the realm of unreasonableness. Opting for the fully loaded variant with BTO packs can push the price well beyond Rs 3 lakh. To sum up, then, the RTR 310 is either a surprisingly good value motorcycle that punches above its weight or an excessively expensive motorcycle that is completely out of its depth. It all depends on which variant you choose.   PriceVariantColourPriceBase without QuickShifterBlackRs 2.40 lakh TopBlack, Red and YellowRs 2.57 lakhDynamic KItBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 2.75 lakhDynamic Pro KitBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 2.85 lakhDynamic + Dynamic Pro KitsBlack, Yellow, Red and BlueRs 3.03 lakh Also see: 2025 TVS Apache RTR 310 video review",

The seating position is well-judged for the road, with a mildly sporty lean down to the wide handlebar but good comfort in the footpeg placement. The 800mm seat height is friendly for short riders, and even tall folks will fit well on this bike.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eThings are a little different on track because there’s not a lot of room to slide back and tuck down. This is both thanks to the big pillion seat bump-stop and the large TFT that you’ll find right in front of your helmet when crouched down. Despite these compromises, on-track handling is really very good, and the bike feels light, agile and quick-turning but also comfortingly stable. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eOur test bikes had the optional adjustable suspension, which most riders won’t need on the road, but it can be a good benefit on track. Another small improvement I noticed was that while this RTR’s traction control used to be unnecessarily intrusive (even in Track mode), that’s no longer the case, and I didn’t find the need to turn it off. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eThe Michelin Road 5 tyres provide a surprisingly sharp and fast transition in how the bike leans over to its side, but there’s superb grip once you’re there. The brakes feel the same as well, in that they have a slightly dull initial bite but good power once you put some effort into the lever. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"TVS Apache RTR 310 rear shot \" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250719013411_2 (23).jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"TVS Apache RTR 310 rear shot \"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Michelin Road 5 tyres offer superb grip.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eHowever, as before, the RTR’s on-track limit arrives a little too early thanks to the footpegs scraping the tarmac. This was improved to some extent by removing the feeler bolts, but it didn’t solve the problem. Adding more suspension preload would have helped increase the cornering clearance, but it wasn’t something we had time to try at this event. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eAt the end of the day, the TVS RTR 310 is a very encouraging bike on track, and I wanted to keep reeling in the laps, but it’s not designed to particularly excel there.

This takes the price to Rs 2.75 lakh. Instead of the Dynamic kit, you can add the Dynamic Pro kit, which introduces keyless start and a huge array of electronic rider aids that include cornering ABS, cornering traction control, anti-wheelie, anti-stoppie, and a whole lot more. This will increase the sticker price to Rs 2.85 lakh.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eIf you add both the kits, the price goes to Rs 3.03 lakh. On top of this, the Fiery Red colour will set you back by a further Rs 5,000, while the Sepang Blue costs a massive Rs 15,000. At this point, the RTR 310 costs significantly more than a KTM 390 Duke, and while we salute TVS’ efforts towards introducing segment-leading technologies, they’re not essential with this performance level, and they push the price into the realm of unreasonableness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"TVS Apache RTR 310 rear shot \" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250719014320_6 (11).jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"TVS Apache RTR 310 rear shot \"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOpting for the fully loaded variant with BTO packs can push the price well beyond Rs 3 lakh.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-fdaafa50-7fff-6ce1-2780-3e38de642457\"\u003eTo sum up, then, the RTR 310 is either a surprisingly good value motorcycle that punches above its weight or an excessively expensive motorcycle that is completely out of its depth.
