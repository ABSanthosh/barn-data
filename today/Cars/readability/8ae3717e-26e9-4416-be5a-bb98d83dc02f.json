  "description": "This 1968 Chevrolet Corvette convertible was acquired by the seller in 2021 and subsequently fitted with an LS-based V8, which is noted to displace 7.0 liters and was assembled with Darton sleeves, an LS7-specification crankshaft, and forged pistons. The engine is backed by a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and a Dana 44 rear end. The car rides on 18\" American Racing Draft wheels and a Street Shop chassis that has QA1 coilovers as well as C4 Corvette-specification suspension and brakes. It was refinished in blue under prior ownership and has since been equipped with a side-exit exhaust system. Sound-dampening material was also applied to the interior, which features black vinyl upholstery, Vintage Air air conditioning, an Ididit steering column, Dakota Digital gauges, and power windows. This C3 convertible is now offered with a body-color removable hardtop, invoices, and a clean Tennessee title in the name of the seller's family trust.",

The engine is backed by a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and a Dana 44 rear end. The car rides on 18″ American Racing Draft wheels and a Street Shop chassis that has QA1 coilovers as well as C4 Corvette-specification suspension and brakes. It was refinished in blue under prior ownership and has since been equipped with a side-exit exhaust system. Sound-dampening material was also applied to the interior, which features black vinyl upholstery, Vintage Air air conditioning, an Ididit steering column, Dakota Digital gauges, and power windows. This C3 convertible is now offered with a body-color removable hardtop, invoices, and a clean Tennessee title in the name of the seller’s family trust. The car was delivered from the factory in International Blue, and the seller reports that it was repainted under prior ownership. A side-exit exhaust system was installed following the seller’s acquisition and a revised rear fascia was added. A black soft top is fitted, and a Richard454 electric headlight kit has been retrofitted. Scratches and blemishes are noted, and the windshield wipers are not installed. The Street Shop chassis was specified with QA1 coilovers, C4 Corvette-specification front and rear suspension, and rebuilt C4 calipers that are fitted over cross-drilled and slotted discs at all four corners. American Racing 18″ Draft wheels are wrapped in BFGoodrich g-Force Sport tires. The cabin has been lined with sound-dampening material, and the bucket seats are trimmed in black with perforated inserts. Appointments include Vintage Air air conditioning and power windows. The seller notes that wiring for rear speakers is present, though rear speakers are not installed. The three-spoke steering wheel is mounted on an Ididit column and frames Dakota Digital HDX instrumentation that includes a 160-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer, while a clock and auxiliary readouts are mounted in the center stack. The digital odometer shows 599 miles, which is said to represent the miles added since the completion of the build. The seller notes that an LS2 block was modified under current ownership to displace 7.0 liters utilizing Darton sleeves, replacement bearings, and an LS7-specification crankshaft, titanium rods, and forged pistons. It was installed in 2021 and also fitted with a Holley Sniper intake manifold, a Holley accessory drive kit, a DeWitts radiator, and an American Autowire harness. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and a Dana 44 rear end. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information: Date J22 – May 22 production Trim 414 – Medium Blue vinyl upholstery Paint 978 – International Blue A body-color removable hardtop will accompany the car.
