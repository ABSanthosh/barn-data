In this story, we’ll take you behind the scenes of our content creation process and give you a glimpse of the tools we use to make it all happen. We will cover most of the tools we use to shoot content not only for the website you’re reading this on, but also for social media and Youtube.Capturing the ActionOur work demands tools that can keep up with fast-paced shoots and deliver cinematic results. That’s why we rely on a curated selection of cameras and accessories to capture every moment. Overall, we value being nimble and efficient while on the move, without compromising on quality. It’s equally important for us to capture photos and videos in various formats without spending excessive time setting up our gear. This year, we focused on a few core cameras to meet those needs effectively.1. DJI Osmo Pocket 3The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 is a compact, handheld gimbal camera designed for smooth, high-quality footage. It features a 1-inch CMOS sensor capable of recording up to 4K at 120 frames per second, ensuring crisp and detailed videos. The 2-inch rotatable touchscreen allows for quick switching between horizontal and vertical shooting, enhancing versatility during shoots. Additionally, its three-axis gimbal stabilization ensures steady footage, even during dynamic movements.What do we use it for? Not just for vlogging and interviews, but also for creating social media reels. Our latest obsession? Car rollers. In the past, we relied exclusively on action cameras mounted on a lead car to capture the subject from multiple angles. Now, we can accomplish all of that with just one versatile camera. You can find the camera on Amazing, for example, at $519.2. GoPro Hero12 BlackPhoto: GoProThe GoPro Hero12 Black is a rugged action camera known for its durability and advanced features. It boasts a 1/1.9-inch sensor capable of capturing 5.3K video at 60 frames per second and 4K at 120 frames per second. The camera introduces HDR (High Dynamic Range) for both video and photos, delivering vivid imagery. With HyperSmooth 6.0 video stabilization and a 177° field of view when paired with the Max Lens Mod 2.0, it ensures ultra-wide, stable footage. The redesigned power management system offers improved thermal performance and up to twice the runtime compared to previous models.Why do we love this? It’s waterproof, allowing us to shoot in any conditions, and it’s perfect for race track action or high-speed scenarios. Plus, it eliminates concerns about external forces affecting a gimbal, making it incredibly reliable in demanding environments. You can find it on Amazon for $399.3. Sony A7 IV with 24-105mm GM LensPhoto: SonyThe Sony A7 IV is a full-frame mirrorless camera that balances high-resolution imaging with speed and versatility. It features a 33-megapixel sensor and supports 4K video recording at up to 60 frames per second. Paired with the 24-105mm f/4 G Master lens, it offers a versatile focal range suitable for wide-angle shots and close-ups, making it ideal for capturing detailed car features and dynamic scenes.Of course, there are plenty of mirrorless cameras on the market, even within Sony’s lineup, but we appreciate the A7 IV for its versatility—it excels at capturing both stunning photos and high-quality videos. While having dedicated cameras for specific situations is ideal, the reality in the field is different: time is crucial, so the ability to switch seamlessly between photo and video modes is essential. Sony also offers a wide range of excellent lenses, such as the acclaimed 24-70mm GM II, but the 24-105mm stands out as a true all-rounder and an exceptional travel companion.Amazon now sells the Sony A7 IV with a 16% discount for $2098 while the 24-105mm GM lens sells for $1098.4. RØDE Wireless PRO KitPhoto: RodeThe RØDE Wireless PRO is a wireless microphone system designed for high-quality audio recording. It features 32-bit float on-board recording with 32GB of storage per transmitter, allowing over 40 hours of audio with high dynamic range. Timecode synchronization simplifies audio alignment in post-production, while Intelligent GainAssist ensures balanced audio levels automatically which is especially important in the world of car content creation.With a transmission range of up to 260 meters (850 feet) using Series IV 2.4 GHz digital transmission, the system ensures stable and secure audio. The kit includes two transmitters with built-in microphones, external Lavalier II mics, furry windshields, and a smart charging case that provides extended battery life. This versatile system is compatible with cameras, smartphones, and computers, making it ideal for content creators.We’ve been using the RØDE Wireless PRO Kit since it first came out and not once it has let us down. We also love the fact that we can use it to take audio notes on the go and then later transcribe them. Or even better, record an interview straight into the iOS Notes app which can now transcribe it automatically for us. The is now available on Amazon for $363 or directly from Rode.Bonus Feature: RØDE Wireless MicroRØDE just launched the Wireless Micro kit for content creators. How is it different than the PRO kit? It’s ultra-compact designed specifically for smartphone content creators compatible with both USB-C and Lightning devices, allowing direct connection to smartphones without the need for cables.  It’s a plug-and-play system for those looking to record high fidelity audio without the whistles and bells of the more expensive PRO Kit.
