  "text": "There's a lot to love about the blue-collar supercar, but there are also some weak points.The Corvette has undergone an impressive transformation from the everyman’s sports car to the everyman’s supercar. There is no shortage of things to love about the car, but if you look hard enough, there’s always something to improve on. Even in our brief time behind the wheel, the C8’s pros and (admittedly few) cons made themselves immediately known.Reason to love it #1: 6.2-liter V8 engine and phenomenal performanceWith 490 horsepower on tap and a mid-engine V8 that only powers the rear wheels—no AWD nonsense here—the C8 Corvette is, on paper, the quintessential performance car. Thankfully, the driving experience exceeds expectations, and the Corvette’s reputation for value-per-dollar performance remains untarnished. Razor precise handling, communicative chassis dynamics and steering feel, and gobs of power make it a true treat to drive.The delightful LT2 V8.ChevroletReason to love it #2: The C8’s style further brings supercars to the massesWriters more erudite than myself have claimed the C8 Corvette “democratizes the exotic car,” and I wholeheartedly agree. But staggering performance figures are only half the equation; the other half is looking the part. Spending too much time in auto-centric corners of the internet may have you believing that everyone sees the C8 immediately as a consolation prize. In the real world, that’s simply not the case.I’m not totally in love with the C8 Corvette’s styling, but the people who are definitely let you know. Everywhere we went with the car, we got all kinds of positive attention, including screams, nods, and everything in between. Old, young, it didn’t matter—everyone seemed happy to see the Vette. It’s another example of the C8 Corvette being the most accessible “exotic” ever, and we love it for that.Almost exotic.Steven PaulReason to love it #3: Grippy seats and unobtrusive techOnce you’ve gotten yourself positioned in the C8, the car rewards you with seats that other sport seats should aspire to be. They’re well-bolstered but not impossible to get into, and the perfect balance of firm but soft. Our car’s GT seats weren’t as aggressive as the available GT2 or Competition Sport seats, but those seem unnecessary unless you’re hitting the track regularly.You’re also rewarded with “just-right” levels of connectivity. You’ve got two screens in front of you, but the gauge cluster reads traditionally and isn’t filled with unnecessary info. The center screen measures just eight inches across, but it’s big enough and well-positioned enough to be easy to glance at for navigation or answering phone calls.GT seats are just fine, unless you're planning track work.Steven PaulReason to love it #4: Shockingly good outward visibilityIf you’ve driven a Corvette with its engine in its usual spot, you’ll probably immediately understand this positive. We love the V8, but its presence in a front-engine sports car necessitated a long hood. That isn't necessary with the midship V8 in the C8, and it improves forward visibility tremendously. Even peering out the back isn’t too bad, thanks to the car’s misleadingly manageable dimensions.Reason to think twice #1: Material and build quality feels less-than-luxuryAs soon as you touch the steering wheel, operate the paddle shifters, or close the door a bit harder than intended, you’re reminded that the C8 Corvette is, well, still a Corvette. Materials leave a little bit to be desired if you’re used to vehicles from European automakers. The fit and finish is largely fine, but there are some weird aesthetic choices, like a leather “flap” that overlaps on the dashboard from the door panels.Almost all of our C8 complaints revolve around the interior - and we were really looking for them.Steven PaulReason to think twice #2: Driver-centric cockpit can isolate passengersThe C8 Corvette is unmistakably all about the driver. That fighter jet feel is cool, but it also makes life a bit difficult for those riding shotgun. My partner felt like she was crossing international borders just to grab her drink from the cupholder, which is less than ideal if you like to share the driving experience. A slightly lower partition would’ve accomplished almost identical positive results for drivers without alienating our better half.Final thoughtsThe C8 Corvette is excellent from all angles—except, maybe, if you’re in the passenger seat. But minor qualms with the car can’t stop us from recommending it to anyone who wants supercar-level performance without the superlative price tag.Love reading Autoblog?
