It will be held on December 6-7 in its usual haunt – Vagator.  As always, the event will feature a wide range of activities, including amateur racing competitions like flat tracking and obstacle courses, various stalls for both motorcycles and biking gear, seminars on riding led by touring veterans, and live music performances. Also, there will be a variety of bikes on display, from raging superbikes to charming retro ones.   The previous edition saw the launch of the Aprilia RS 457 and Kawasaki W175 Street, with manufacturers like Harley-Davidson, Suzuki, and Triumph having dedicated stalls. The festival also has a diverse range of food available, ranging from Goan delicacies to fast food.   Last year's edition featured thrilling attractions like an FMX show and the Wheel of Death.
