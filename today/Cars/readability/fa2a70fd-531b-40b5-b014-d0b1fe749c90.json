  "description": "Now that it has dropped in price to more accessible levels, is it time to invest in a 911 GT3 before it becomes a modern classic? The 911 GT3 released in 2017 is heralded as one of Porsche’s greatest hits and it still quickens pulses and turns heads today.So high was demand when it was new that you could not get your hands on a 991.2 (Porsche speak for the facelifted seventh-generation 911) GT3 for love nor money.Some buyers cashed in and immediately flipped their cars to make a profit, so many GT3s quickly reappeared on sale – but for around £50,000 to £70,000 more than their list price.It’s easy to see why demand outstripped supply: this sports car delivers unwavering grip, poise and balance, both on track and off it. But now that it has dropped in price to more accessible levels, is it time to invest in a GT3 before it becomes a modern classic?Cast a cursory glance at this limbered-up 911 and you would be forgiven for mistaking it for its predecessor.A light nip and tuck to the front and rear bumpers are the only visual changes, but peel back the skin and you will see we are dealing with a very different beast.Nestled in the shadow of that hulking rear wing is a 4.0-litre flat-six engine rather than a 3.8-litre one.The swap was made to address the reliability issue that plagued the pre-facelift ‘991.1’ and it’s a key reason why you should find the extra dosh for a post-2017 model.The 4.0-litre lump isn’t just a carryover from the GT3 RS or spellbinding 911 R, either. It is a motorsport-derived 911 Cup car engine with new crankshaft, pistons, liners and bigger seals.The bigger motor also ditches its predecessor’s hydraulic valve lifters, which, in combination with the other mods, means it can spin more freely – all the way to a screaming 9000rpm redline.Peak power comes in at 8250rpm, so you have to work it quite hard, but how you get up there is your choice: you can have a snappy seven-speed PDK or a sensationally tactile six-speed manual gearbox.The quicker acceleration on offer with the auto makes more sense if you’re an avid track-day driver. But for the complete GT3 experience, it has to be the more engaging manual, which is also slightly lighter and gets a conventional limited-slip differential for an extra hit of playfulness.Your choice of brakes also depends on your GT3’s intended use: carbon-ceramics are best for road driving as they’re lighter, but track cars should have steel items because they’re cheaper to replace.And if you don’t want some of the car’s racier cues, then you might wish to consider the more reserved Touring version, which features a GTS-style hidden rear spoiler instead of a fixed wing.Around 50 right-hand-drive Tourings made their way to the UK so they’re exceptionally rare and command a hefty premium over the bewinged car.But if your heart is set on a Touring, performance car specialist Litchfield can convert a standard GT3 into one using Porsche-approved parts for just under £18,000 – a relative bargain considering the £200k you would have to fork out for a factory car.The cabin of the GT3 is pure motorsport. Slide into the 918-style bucket seat of a car fitted with the Clubsport package (which also added a roll-cage, harness and fire extinguisher) and you are swaddled in carbonfibre and Alcantara trimmings.Tourings, meanwhile, are a little more luxurious, with mostly leather-trimmed elements and Comfort seats.There are plenty of Clubsport models in the classifieds, but bear in mind that the cage takes up valuable luggage space, which you may want to use.Yes, the GT3 is the sort of sports car that you can drive to the Nürburgring and set a killer lap time, and then carry on to the south of France for a holiday without breaking a sweat.",
