  "description": "This 1973 Jaguar E-Type Series III roadster is powered by a 5.3-liter V12 linked with a replacement five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. After being sold new in the US, it spent time in Germany before returning to the US in the late-1990s, and it was purchased by the current owner in 2002. The car is finished in Old English White over black leather and features a black soft top, a top boot, four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, 15” knock-off wire wheels, and a JVC stereo. The engine was rebuilt in 2011 and has been fitted with a later-style fuel injection system, and service in preparation for the sale included replacement of the trunk seal, exhaust mounts, tires, and rear radius arm bushings. This Series III E-Type was listed on BaT in June 2024 and is now offered again on dealer consignment with an Oregon title.",

After being sold new in the US, it spent time in Germany before returning to the US in the late-1990s, and it was purchased by the current owner in 2002. The car is finished in Old English White over black leather and features a black soft top, a top boot, four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, 15” knock-off wire wheels, and a JVC stereo. The engine was rebuilt in 2011 and has been fitted with a later-style fuel injection system, and service in preparation for the sale included replacement of the trunk seal, exhaust mounts, tires, and rear radius arm bushings. This Series III E-Type was listed on BaT in June 2024 and is now offered again on dealer consignment with an Oregon title. The car is finished in Old English White and features a black soft top, a black top boot, uncovered headlights, a louvered hood, US-spec bumpers, a rear luggage rack, and a power antenna. Chips and scratches are noted on the doors and front and rear valences, and damage is visible behind each rear wheel. The 15″ wire-spoke wheels are secured with knock-off spinners and are wrapped in 205/70 Vredestein Sprint Classic tires that were mounted in preparation for the sale. The Series III E-Type was factory equipped with power steering, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with inboard-mounted rear rotors. The rear radius arm bushings were replaced in 2024. The seating surfaces are upholstered in Black leather. Interior amenities include a JVC stereo, a locking glovebox, and a heater. The steering wheel and seats were serviced, the trunk seal was replaced, and the blower motor was repaired in preparation for the sale. The air conditioning compressor has been removed. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation consisting of a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline. An analog clock along with auxiliary gauges for voltage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level are mounted in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 43k miles. The 5.3-liter V12 was rebuilt in 2011 and is fitted with a later-style Bosch fuel injection system. Compression test results from May 2024 are pictured in the gallery below. Originally equipped with an automatic transmission, the car now sends power to the rear wheels through a T5 five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The dual exhaust system was replaced in 2006, and exhaust hangers were replaced in May 2024. A reproduction tag in the engine compartment is stamped with ID number 1521996, while the door pillar tag displays VIN 1S21996. The Oregon title lists the VIN sequence UD1521996, while the sequence displayed on the windshield pillar tag reads UD1S21996. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates.
