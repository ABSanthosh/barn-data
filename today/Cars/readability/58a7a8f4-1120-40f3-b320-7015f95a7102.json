  "text": "Genesis has built a reputation for itself based on exceptional build quality – a key ingredient in any upscale off-roader. Why not take the opportunity to hit rivals like Lexus and Land Rover where it really hurts by challenging their off-road icons?In a world littered with crossovers, essentially station wagons on stilts with raised roofs,  genuine SUVs with serious off-road capabilities have become increasingly popular as they offer the real-world livability of a crossover with the authenticity of a true 4x4.These types of vehicles have since become icons in their own right, like the legendary Land Rover Defender and the seemingly indestructible Lexus GX. Since Genesis has built a reputable name for themselves associated with top-notch build quality and tech, why not show off their talents with an off-road SUV icon of their own? Genesis Off-Roader (Rendered)Cole AttishaGenesis already has excellent powertrain options for the task at handBenchmarking its most direct rivals once again, it seems the most appropriate powertrain options for a Genesis off-road SUV would be a standard turbocharged four-cylinder and an optional turbocharged six-cylinder.Land Rover employs this strategy with the Defender (albeit with some additional V8 options), and Toyota employs this strategy by giving the Land Cruiser the four-cylinder and placing the six-cylinder in its Lexus counterpart, the GX550. Luckily, Genesis has fantastic engines already available in its lineup to strategize similarly.For the standard powertrain, Genesis's turbocharged 2.5L straight-four should be plenty, producing a sufficient 300 horsepower and 311 lb-ft of torque. For those with a heavier right foot, the mild-hybrid, turbocharged, and e-supercharged 3.5L T-GDI V6, which produces 409 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque, would be available as an optional upgrade.Both engines would be paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and electronically controlled four-wheel drive. Genesis Off-Roader (Rendered)Cole AttishaElectric powertrains could expand its appeal and add to its list of rivalsBy offering an electrified variant of the dedicated off-roader, Genesis could expand its competitive horizons and take on the likes of the Rivian R1S and the all-new Scout Traveler. Just like the petrol engines, Genesis already possesses a plausible EV powertrain in their lineup in the Electrified GV70. Equipped with a 77.4kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery that sends electricity to a 320kW dual drive motor (front-wheel 160kW / rear wheel 160kW), this power plant produces a hefty 483 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque which is sent to all four wheels. These power figures would be competitive with the Rivian R1S Dual Standard, albeit the Genesis would offer a more luxurious interior environment and more comfortable ride, commanding a slightly higher price tag accordingly. 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe HyundaiBody-on-frame architecture would set it apart from its softer siblingsThanks to the existence of models like the Highlander and TX, Toyota and Lexus were able to retain the body-on-frame architecture that underpins the Land Cruiser and GX550, allowing those models to retain their authentic off-road talent. Similarly, Genesis has a pre-existing lineup of unibody crossovers that offer more city-friendly driving dynamics. For those who want a more hardcore off-road SUV, an old-school, body-on-frame platform would ensure the Genesis is as rugged as its most vicious competitors. A proper, body-on-frame off-road SUV would add some much-needed fun and excitement to Genesis's admittedly excellent – but relatively soft – model lineup. Additionally, it would mark an attempt by Genesis to add some icons to its stable. Most of their current models are somewhat generic and the lineup is generally formatted to match the lineups of the German brands it aspires to be. Final thoughtsAn iconic off-road SUV could do what the GX and LX have done for Lexus in creating a long-lasting legacy of rugged, durable machines that can keep up with an active lifestyle and take a serious beating. Do you think that a Genesis off-roader would make a solid addition to the brand's lineup, or would it be destined to fail in the shadow of its more established rivals?
