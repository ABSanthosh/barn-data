  "text": "Published:  October 9th, 2024 Earlier today, Matt went deep on why it seems like more and more folks are skipping out on auto insurance. Never mind that doing so seems pennywise and pound foolish and is illegal for car owners in most jurisdictions. While I can't and don't condone this practice, it's understandable that people pinched by a cost of living that keeps rising while their paychecks stay stagnant might try to save money.I ask, however, not whether this is a good idea or not -- it isn't -- but rather, what you folks are seeing for insurance costs in your area. Given that this is the internet, please don't share specifics or information that gives away your privacy. Just give me a ballpark number here. Oh, and keep in mind your demographics, location, and the type of vehicles you're insuring -- a 25-year-old unmarried man with a speeding ticket on his record is going to pay a fair bit to insure a Ford Mustang GT. Meanwhile, a 55-year-old married man who lives in the same area and drives a Camry and has a fairly clean driving record will likely pay less. So, go ahead and let it fly. You know what to do.Sound off below.[Image: Andrew Angelov/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission. More by Tim Healey Published October 9th, 2024 6:00 PM Comments Join the conversation Is \"too dam much\" an allowable answer? I live in a safe area and have seen large annual increases in recent years. 2013 Charger (V6), no tickets/violations, less than 8000 mi/yr (retired so not commuting anymore), fixed income, single driver (wife disabled). I'm paying roughly $1536/yr.",
