  "description": "Tata Motors has had a busy few years with a slew of EV launches and revitalised SUVs, but if there’s one model that seemed left behind it’s the Altroz. Sure, it received a new dual-clutch gearbox, a (now-discontinued) turbo-petrol engine and a CNG variant in the time since its launch in 2020, but the basic package itself has largely been untouched. Things change with the Altroz facelift you see here. Fresher styling, a redone interior and a massive feature upgrade bring the likeable Tata premium hatchback to the present. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift exterior design and engineering - 9/10 The facelift adds new-age glam to a very appealing design. The updated Altroz conforms to Tata’s sharper new style sheet, and the effect is great. Making the biggest impact up front is the new bumper that sports more pronounced cuts and creases at the side vents and fog lamp enclosures. The fog lamps are smaller, sit lower down and have been upgraded to LEDs on top-spec versions. A slimmer grille with a textured finish is part of the updates too and flows slickly into the swept-back headlamps. While the headlamps are familiar in shape, the internals have been redone with new LED DRLs and, on top-spec versions, full-LED lighting. Headlamp shape remains similar, but internals are new; LED fog lamps on top trim. New alloy wheels (with EV-like aero streaks) are part of the updates but aren’t the only changes at the sides. Tata Motors has gone the distance with new doors with softer lines as well as a slimmer iteration of the black band that underlines the windows. It’s a cleaner look but the updated Altroz has lost some of the original’s sporty tipped-forward stance. Flush-fitting front door handles are new but aren’t the easiest to use, requiring a firm press to get the lever out. As before, the rear door handles are mounted on the C-pillar and, again, take some getting used to. Altroz facelift has sheet metal changes in the form of new doors with softer lines. Styling at the back has been revamped, although at first glance, you might think just the rear bumper is new. However, while the tail-lamp housing is unchanged, lighting is from slim LEDs inside. Top models also get a light bar that up the wow factor. Just wish Tata gave the Altroz chunkier rubber. The 185-section tyres take away a bit from the stance. Notably, 195-section tyres were dropped over the Altroz’s life perhaps in the interest of upping economy. Slim 185-section tyres take away from the stance of the hatchback. The Altroz is built on Tata Motors' ALFA architecture. Side protection has been beefed up with this update to meet the more stringent requirements for a 5-star crash test rating in today’s Global NCAP and Bharat NCAP protocols. The original Altroz was a 5-star Global NCAP rated car and Tata will sure be gunning for full marks for the 2025 model. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift interior space and comfort - 8/10 Lots of shared elements with other Tata models, but it's premium and modern Light colours and new textures lend the cabin a premium feel. Where the Altroz takes a big step forwards is on the inside. Sure, there are a lot of elements common to other Tata models but the combined effect is that of an up-to-date and premium interior. The digital instruments, 10.25-inch touchscreen, a two-spoke steering with an illuminated logo and new centre console go a long way to enhance the look of things inside. The dashboard has also been spruced up with lighter colours and new textures, and there’s nice use of ambient lighting, too. Fit and finish is good, but keeping the light upholstery clean will require some commitment on your part. Also, the gloss black panel for the climate control system is easy to scratch, so it could lose its sheen soon. Gloss black HVAC panel could be prone to losing its sheen over time. Tata Motors has enhanced the seats with greater thigh support, and this does aid comfort over long drives. Drivers will miss steering reach adjust (it still adjusts for angle only) and will also find that the thick A-pillar hampers visibility at crossroads. Doors that open 90 degrees (a feature on ALFA architecture cars) make getting in and out easy, but it’s quite a reach to shut the door when fully open. Rear seat space is satisfactory (a Hyundai i20 is roomier) for average-sized adults, but taller occupants will find headroom just about adequate. Also, the rear seat is a touch upright. Front seats now have better thigh support, enhancing comfort over long drives.  The Altroz does well to offer enough storage spaces inside the cabin, including a handily large glovebox. 345 litres of boot space is a class-best stat and what’s particularly impressive is that even the CNG versions offer a very usable 210 litres of room, made possible by Tata’s clever use of two slim CNG tanks, in place of a larger single tank. Rear seat space is satisfactory for average-sized adults   2025 Tata Altroz facelift features and safety - 8/10 Few niceties missing, but overall it's a techy and feature-packed hatchback The Tata Altroz is available in four trims (or personas as Tata calls them), namely Pure, Smart, Creative and Accomplished S, with the last three further available with ‘+’ add-on packs. However, only the Altroz DCA can be had in fully loaded Accomplished S+ form, which makes it the only one with features like 10.25-inch digital dials (integrated with a map view and blind view monitor), connected tech and an onboard air purifier. 10.25-inch touchscreen is slick and responsive.  Our Accomplished S trim test cars did not disappoint on kit, though. The 10.25-inch touchscreen is responsive and quick, and worked without glitch. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included and the 360-degree camera’s resolution is good too. Wireless charging is a part of the package and there are also 65W type-C chargers at the front and rear that can power a laptop. Ambient lighting adds some colour to the dash and you can further brighten proceedings with a sunroof (offered as an option on the Smart and Creative trims). Of the other things, the part-digital instruments with a 7-inch MID are informative as well. Leatherette upholstery is no longer offered on the Altroz and a bigger miss is the exclusion of front seat ventilation that was only recently rolled out on the Altroz Racer. Ambient lighting has been put to good use to spruce up the dashboard. Standard safety kit includes 6 airbags, electronic stability control, Isofix child seat mounts and 3-point seat belts for all seats. Irritatingly, the rear seats lack load sensors and the seat belt reminder buzzes even if the seats are not occupied. Higher-spec models add in auto lights and wipers, tyre pressure monitors and height adjustable rear headrests.  2025 Tata Altroz facelift performance and refinement - 7/10 CNG variant is only best for urban use; highway duties are handled better by the diesel With the update, Tata Motors has made some changes to the engine and gearbox options on offer. The turbo-petrol engine-powered Altroz Racer has been dropped (at least for now) and there’s a new AMT option on the 1.2-litre petrol engine. To put the powertrain matrix in words, the 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, petrol engine (88hp and 115Nm) can be had with a 5-speed manual gearbox, a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic and a new 5-speed AMT. The Altroz CNG uses the same 1.2 engine as its base (power drops to 73.5hp and 103Nm in CNG mode) and it can be had with a 5-speed manual; a 5-speed AMT comes soon. And finally, there’s a 90hp and 200Nm, 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbo-diesel that can only be had with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Featured here are the CNG and diesel versions of the Altroz. Altroz CNG performance not particular peppy, but it's better than the numbers suggest. Drivers will appreciate the option to start the Altroz in CNG mode and you’ll realise performance is better on the go than the power numbers will have you believe. Sure, it’s not particularly peppy, but keeping up with the flow of traffic and general city driving is well taken care of. It’s an unexciting engine, but that’s unlikely to be a deterrent for a CNG buyer who is primarily interested in the low running costs. A light clutch helps the experience in town. The Altroz CNG does feel out of its comfort zone on expressways, where the lack of ready power becomes evident. You do have the option to switch to petrol mode when you need more from the engine, but high-speed performance remains humdrum. Revving the engine hard will have the noise levels rise sharply with an audible whine from under the engine bay. Altroz CNG feels out of its comfort zone on expressways.  The Altroz diesel is better suited for those with lots of highway running. The engine delivers a wide spread of power and the 200Nm of torque sure comes handy when you want to make your way past traffic. Thing is, the diesel engine is loud. You can hear a clatter at idle, and it remains quite noisy throughout the rev band. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift efficiency/range - 7/10 Tata hasn’t released official fuel economy numbers for the 2025 Altroz. We did test the Altroz CNG earlier this year and got real-world figures of 20.56km/kg in city driving and 29.65km/kg on the highway. The Altroz petrol and diesel feature a fairly small 37-litre fuel tank. The CNG’s twin cylinders have 60 litres of gas capacity.   2025 Tata Altroz facelift ride comfort and handling - 9/10 Ride and handling balance is best in class; highway manners are confident  Ride and handling have been highlights on the Altroz since day one and the story is no different even today. There is a slight firmness that comes through from the suspension and tyres at low speeds, but when the surface deteriorates, the Altroz shines. It gobbles potholes with ease and there’s a toughness from the package that you don’t get in any other hatchback. There's a feel of robustness in the way the Altroz rides. High-speed manners are also polished and confident, and what adds to the experience is the handling. You get a great sense of connect from the steering, with the Altroz changing direction with grace. The steering requires little effort to twirl at low speeds too. What is a downer is the insufficient noise insulation. Over high speed cruises, there’s quite a bit of road noise as well as wind noise emanating in the region of the wing mirrors.    2025 Tata Altroz facelift price and verdict - 8/10 Up-to-date and more premium, but few shortcomings still  Tata has launched the Altroz at Rs 6.89 lakh (ex-showroom) with the range-topping version priced at Rs 11.49 lakh. Pricing is in the same ballpark as comparable engine-gearbox versions of rivals like the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and Hyundai i20. The comprehensive updates with the facelift lend the Altroz a more upmarket vibe.  Buyers with lots of running or diesel fans will find a good fit in the Altroz diesel, while the CNG makes great sense for city dwellers looking to keep running costs in check without compromising on creature comforts. The petrol engine isn’t up there with Suzuki’s K12 unit but is fine for city use. AMT and dual-clutch auto options also promise added convenience. What’s a pity is that Altroz buyers don’t have the option of a sporty turbo-petrol engine that would really complement the slick handling.  While refinement could be better, the comprehensive update addresses some of the Altroz’s more glaring shortcomings like features. There’s a more upmarket vibe to the package now making the Altroz more compelling than ever before. Also See: Tata Altroz facelift video review",

It’s an unexciting engine, but that’s unlikely to be a deterrent for a CNG buyer who is primarily interested in the low running costs. A light clutch helps the experience in town. The Altroz CNG does feel out of its comfort zone on expressways, where the lack of ready power becomes evident. You do have the option to switch to petrol mode when you need more from the engine, but high-speed performance remains humdrum.
