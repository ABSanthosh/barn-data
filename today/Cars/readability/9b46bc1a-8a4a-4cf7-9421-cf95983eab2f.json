Close Hot hatches are the Goldilocks performance cars – they're fast, mischievously good fun, whole-heartedly practical and some are even quite affordable. What is not to like? The best hot hatches come from a recipe that has been around for decades: take an otherwise ordinary hatchback, up the performance and upgrade its powertrain and chassis technologies.  Some car makers even hand them over to their own in-house performance sub-brands to work their magic. Think Mercedes-AMG, Hyundai N, Toyota's Gazoo Racing and Ford Performance. Hot hatchbacks are equally capable of zipping through city streets or tackling winding roads, offering exhilarating driving experiences without sacrificing everyday usability.  You should make the most of them while you still can. Increasingly strict emissions regulations mean hot hatches are no longer the overtly affordable performance machines they once were.  Although internal combustion still rules the roost, there’s a definite sense that these petrol-engined machines are the last of the breed. Two cars on our list are actually electric.  But which should you choose? We think the Toyota GR Yaris is the best hot hatch money can buy today, offering stunning cross-country pace, engaging handling and compact proportions.  Read on for our full top ten list of the best hot hatches on sale today. Whether you're after speed, style, or versatility, these cars have it all. Design9Interior7Performance10Ride \u0026 Handling10Costs8 Pros Exceptional performanceCompact dimensions and engaging handlingThe fact that it exists! Cons No longer the bargain it once wasGravelly engine when left to its auto devicesBoot requires a hefty slam to close Best for: All-round abilityFirst launched in 2020, the Toyota GR Yaris is the current pinnacle of the hot hatchback and the best you can buy today.Powered by a 1.6-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine, the GR Yaris initially produced 256bhp and 266lb ft of torque, but an update in 2024 upped the stakes to 276bhp and 288lb ft. And it's better than ever. Available with the choice of a manual or an automatic transmission, the four-wheel-drive GR Yaris whizzes from 0-62mph in 5.2sec and will go on to a top speed of 143mph. The GR Yaris isn't just a hot hatch; it's a seriously capable performance car and a genuine five-star entertainer. That said, the first-generation car was also fantastic to drive and probably just as fun. Interior ergonomics have also been improved with the addition of Toyota's latest infotainment and digital instrument displays, while the driving position has been lowered slightly. Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior9Performance10Ride \u0026 Handling10Costs7 Pros Driving ergonomics are pedigree sports car in feelWonderfully tactile chassisFizzing powertrain loves to spin out Cons Stiff chassis can struggle for traction in the wetNot always the most playful characterExpensive Best for: Track day thrillsThe previous version of the Honda Civic Type R was one of our favourite hot hatchbacks, so expectations were high for this one - and happily it didn't disappoint. This new edition is a more grown-up proposition than the old car, even if the BTCC-style rear wing still suggests it's a bit of a hooligan.Under the bonnet, the familiar turbocharged 2.0-litre engine gets a lighter flywheel, a revised intake and a freer-flowing exhaust that help lift power from 316bhp to 325bhp, while the six-speed manual gearbox has a tweaked gate for even slicker shifting.The dual-axis front suspension and multi-link rear axle are very similar, but the track is now 15mm wider, which works in partnership with a 15%-stiffer bodyshell to combine even sharper handling with greater compliance.It's certainly quick, with 0-62mph done and dusted in 5.4sec and 170mph just about within reach. Yet it delivers this performance with real sophistication and civility.So why doesn't it top this list? Well, for starters, Honda has hiked the Type R's price significantly. The previous version started at around £33,000 but you will need £50,000 for this one - and numbers are extremely limited.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior8Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling9Costs8 Pros A seriously versatile hot hatchMore expressive in its steering and handling than mostChunky engine adds soul Cons Handling is a little cartoonishManual gearbox isn't the best aroundIt won't be around much longer Best for: Everyday road performanceThe Blue Oval has had some memorably brilliant, chart-topping hot hatchbacks over the last couple of decades – and while the current Focus ST isn’t quite as sharp and involving as the Yaris and Civic above, it absolutely honours the fast Ford legacy. It’s a good deal more affordable than the Civic, too.The Focus ST has direct, agile handling, purposeful-feeling firm body control and abundant vocal and motive performance-car character. It's the kind of hot hatch built to make even the more mundane road miles enjoyable, and it succeeds at that. Perhaps that's the right balance for an ST model: more the effusive everyday road performance car than the really purposeful, big-hitting track machine.This generation is the first to gain adaptive dampers and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential for its driven front axle. The latter remains fairly rare on cars of this price point and certainly adds to its handling appeal.If you're tempted, put your order in now: the smaller Ford Fiesta ST has already died, along with the standard Fiesta, and the Focus range is due to be axed later in 2025.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior8Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling9Costs9 Pros Cross-country pace to leave you breathlessSuperb four-wheel-drive security Cons Low-speed ride borders on the brutalCockpit looks slick but isn’t so easy to operate Best for: Daily drivingVolkswagen's highly regarded super-Golf, the four-wheel-drive Golf R, has taken a big step forward in this latest form. As well as its 316bhp 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, its arsenal is packed with performance-enhancing equipment. Most Golf Rs get adaptive dampers, which can switch between B-road ironing and teeth-rattling modes at the touch of a screen. Meanwhile, the fully torque-vectored four-wheel drive system can juggle drive not just front to rear but also asymmetrically across its rear axle.That rear diff gives it staggering agility, and in the softest damper mode it rides remarkably well.The Mk8 Golf R takes on quite a different character to the Mk7. It has lost some of the just-so compromise of suppleness, stability and pace that made the last version of the car so popular, while even greater body control and adhesion have come in to make up the balance - and greater driver involvement too.For those who liked the 'one fast car for every journey' charm of the Mk7, the Mk8 may feel a little too serious and perhaps just a touch aloof at lower speeds. But there's no denying that the car's outright dynamic capabilities have expanded quite a way. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign9Interior8Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs7 Pros Outrageously fast in any circumstancesComparatively opulent cabinIt's a practical four-seater Cons Outrageously expensiveOverly complex chassis-configuration universeA bit too rabid for some Best for: Pure powerLet the following statement sink in: the Mercedes-AMG A45 S is a four-wheel-drive hot hatchback that costs more than £60,000 and has a 2.0-litre four-pot that makes 416bhp and 369lb ft.Not only does that mean Affalterbach's most rabid hot hatch has the most powerful series production four-cylinder engine on the planet, it also has an engine with a higher specific output than that of the Ferrari 488 Pista. It is, in a sense, utterly ridiculous.Be that as it may, there's still a phenomenal, yet usable, driver's car lying beneath all its wings, fins and flares. Straight-line performance is undoubtedly immense, but more of a surprise is how well-mannered its complex, steroidal driveline is when you're simply tooling about.Body control is rock-solid at speed, but there's genuine compliance in the chassis too. Grip is outstanding, meanwhile, and the accuracy, weighting and textural feedback from its electrically assisted steering rack is easily up there with the best in class.As a multi-talented hot hatchback, the A45 S is undoubtedly a triumph. But it has wandered so far from the realms of relative affordability that crowning it the class champion would have been a touch problematic.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs9 Pros Well-sorted balance of ride and rear-drive handlingNicely judged level of performance on most UK roadsShows electric cars can be fun Cons Conservative ESP tuning limits the fun......as does the lack of an engine in some respectsFun is limited by range Best for: Electric motoringMake no mistake: the Cupra Born VZ makes this top 10 on merit rather than as a makeweight that has any positives suffixed with the phrase 'for an EV'. Not only does the Born look the hot hatch part, it drives it too. There's real talent here.Based on the same platform as the Volkswagen ID 3, the regular Born gets a rear-mounted motor that delivers up to 227bhp and instant torque. The Born VZ meanwhile boosts performance to 322bhp and 402lb ft. It feels genuinely quick up to 60mph, and while accelerative force diminishes beyond this point, few fast car fans will be disappointed.It also steers keenly, with quick turn-in and poised, low-roll handling that allows it to scoot through a series of corners quickly and accurately - although a little less intervention from the electronic safety net would help unleash some of its rear-drive balance.Elsewhere, it does the other hot hatch things well, with a spacious and versatile interior plus decent everyday comfort and refinement. Better still, with the larger 77kWh battery, the Born promises a very respectable 341 miles on a charge.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Impressive rolling refinementHandsome, distinctive looksStrong in-gear performance Cons Too many essential functions are accessed through the touchscreenConfusing trim levelsNot too dynamically distinct from the Seat Leon Best for: Rolling refinementSimilar to the Volkswagen Golf GTI, the Cupra Leon adds a dose of performance to the regular Seat Leon hatchback. There are no fewer than seven trim levels for this hot Leon, but the headline powertrains are a brand new 329bhp engine and a 268bhp plug-in hybrid powertrain, both of which offer stonking performance to challenge the GTI and the Civic Type R. We like the Leon and think it offers great styling, rapid outright pace and a balanced and comfortable chassis. It's not quite the bespoke Cupra the brand claims it to be, but it's still practical and well-designed, with terrific rolling refinement. It's not all perfect. It is slightly let down by its aversion to buttons and its interior quality isn't up there with the class's best. Its steering is also slightly dull, disappointingly. But it's a great all-round proposition and well worth considering if you're after a refined hot hatch. Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior7Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Engaging handlingGood performanceCompetent ride Cons Frustrating interior techNo manual gearbox Options can stack up price-wise Best for: Go-kart dynamicsThe Mini Cooper S has always been a solid hot hatch option, and it's a similar story with the model's latest iteration. Powered by an eager 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine, the Cooper S gets 201bhp and 221lb ft of torque. That makes it one of the least powerful models on this list, but it's still highly capable and enjoyable to drive. And it will still hit 0-62mph in 6.3sec.It sports sharp handling, which is matched by its capable chassis. While Cooper S models of old felt overly firm for most drivers, the new car feels much more livable.And unlike any of the other cars on this list, it has a convertible variant on the way. That alone wins it some extra brownie points in our book - especially with summer just around the corner. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior7Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs6 Pros Stellar five-pot engineSurprisingly fine-ridingProdigious all-weather performance Cons Gloomy interiorVery expensiveCan feel a bit blunt to drive Best for: LuxuryIs the idea of an Audi A3 that’s capable of 180mph more or less absurd than one that might cost you as much as £65,000 after options? There is something extraordinary about even the very proposition of the latest generation of Audi's ultra-hot hatchback.For a start, it has a cracking, characterful five-pot motor fit to grace to engine bays of dedicated sports coupés (as it did in the TT RS).Then there's the new torque-vectoring back axle, which operates in a similar way to that of the A45 S and can, in certain conditions, result in a longitudinally engined hatchback that can be genuinely steering on the throttle.The RS3 combines these elements with a chassis that is controlled but far from brittle, and perhaps that is the real magic of this recipe. It's fundamentally usable day-to-day, despite the wild performance on offer and a very punchy exterior aesthetic.That said, the AMG edges it in our estimations, owing to its warmer cabin and more feelsome driving experience.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs7 Pros Elastic performanceImpressive poise and agilityHot hatch fun with plenty of refinement Cons Restless rideMisses the old car’s more rounded and resolved characterLack of driver involvement Best for: Fuel economyPrevious versions of Volkswagen's long-lived Golf GTI have featured prominently in this line-up of the greatest affordable performance cars, but this one is a slightly different kettle of fish.Volkswagen went in search of greater handling response and driver appeal with the eighth generation of its hot Golf but had only questionable success in finding it.Meanwhile, it adversely affected the sweet-riding, easy-to-use temperament that the GTI has traded on for so long, introducing an unwelcome firmness to its ride.Don't get us wrong: the GTI is still a good, enjoyable everyday driver. Its 242bhp 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine remains a little short on power compared with the rest of the cars here, but it makes for strong and responsive thrust, which the chassis allows you to deploy pretty freely.The car's new firmer springing makes it work better on smoother surfaces than typical UK country B-roads, but adaptive dampers do allow for some adjustment of the ride. Steering is nicely pacey but still a little light and numb; undemanding in everyday use but not as absorbing as it might be.In Clubsport trim, the GTI's key vitals rise to 296bhp and 295lb ft, its final drive ratio is reduced and its suspension is firmed up. It becomes a more grippy, direct and incisive-handling car without losing much by way of everyday cruising habitability – but still not the best-balanced or the most exciting or involving driver's car in this list.Finance this car with DrivenfiHOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST HOT HATCHBACK When choosing a hot hatchback, you'll want to consider these main factors: performance, ride, handling and costs. Hot hatches are all about driving pleasure and dynamic ability, so stick to the models in our top ten if you're on the hunt for a new one. For power, there's one winner: the Mercedes-AMG A45 S. For all-round ability, we recommend the Toyota GR Yaris. And for daily driving, the four-wheel-drive Volkswagen Golf R is your best bet.  HOW WE TESTED AND SELECTED Each car on this list has been selected by a judging panel of Autocar journalists for its prowess in a specific area. Collectively, our journalists have tested every hot hatchback on sale today. For each entry, we have explained why each hot hatchback deserves its place. FAQs What is a hot hatchback? A hot hatch, short for 'hot hatchback', is a high-performance version of a hatchback car. Known for their powerful engines, sporty handling, and aggressive styling, hot hatches offer a thrilling driving experience while maintaining the practicality of a hatchback. They add an extra dose of performance but retain their compact size, making them perfect for driving in both urban and rural environments. They're a favorite among car enthusiasts who want a balance of speed, agility, and everyday functionality. What is the difference between a hot hatch and a regular hatchback? One of the best things about hot hatchbacks is how they retain all the qualities of a regular hatchback, such as their practicality, technology and styling. The main difference is the car's performance, which is uprated to more intense heights. Other changes can be made to the styling, often made to look more aggressive, but the basic silhouette of the car will remain.  Are hot hatchbacks practical for daily driving? Despite their performance upgrades, hot hatchbacks are often used as daily drivers. Some cars, including the Golf R, Golf GTI and Toyota GR Yarus, are all comfortable to drive. Thankfully, hot hatches still maintain the practicality of regular hatchbacks. That said, hot hatchbacks offer worse fuel economy than their regular counterparts. Some of them aren't terrible in this regard, but it's still important to do your research if you're commuting long distances.  Are hot hatchbacks harder to maintain?  Not necessarily. Hot hatchbacks are usually based on the same basic chassis technology as their regular counterparts, so would likely carry similar levels of reliability. Some features you might need to be extra careful with include the wheels. Hot hatchbacks often use lower profile tyres with larger wheels, which are very easy to scrape on kerbs, for example.  What's the fastest hot hatchback on sale today? As of 2024, the fastest hot hatchback (from a standstill) available in the UK is the Mercedes-AMG A45 S. It accelerates from 0-62 mph in just 3.8 seconds. It's matched by the Audi RS3, which matches the Merc.

Known for their powerful engines, sporty handling, and aggressive styling, hot hatches offer a thrilling driving experience while maintaining the practicality of a hatchback.\nThey add an extra dose of performance but retain their compact size, making them perfect for driving in both urban and rural environments. They\u0026#39;re a favorite among car enthusiasts who want a balance of speed, agility, and everyday functionality.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the difference between a hot hatch and a regular hatchback?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nOne of the best things about hot hatchbacks is how they retain all the qualities of a regular hatchback, such as their practicality, technology and styling. The main difference is the car\u0026#39;s performance, which is uprated to more intense heights. Other changes can be made to the styling, often made to look more aggressive, but the basic silhouette of the car will remain. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAre hot hatchbacks practical for daily driving?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nDespite their performance upgrades, hot hatchbacks are often used as daily drivers. Some cars, including the Golf R, Golf GTI and Toyota GR Yarus, are all comfortable to drive. Thankfully, hot hatches still maintain the practicality of regular hatchbacks. That said, hot hatchbacks offer worse fuel economy than their regular counterparts. Some of them aren\u0026#39;t terrible in this regard, but it\u0026#39;s still important to do your research if you\u0026#39;re commuting long distances. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAre hot hatchbacks harder to maintain? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nNot necessarily. Hot hatchbacks are usually based on the same basic chassis technology as their regular counterparts, so would likely carry similar levels of reliability. Some features you might need to be extra careful with include the wheels. Hot hatchbacks often use lower profile tyres with larger wheels, which are very easy to scrape on kerbs, for example. \n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s the fastest hot hatchback on sale today?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\nAs of 2024, the fastest hot hatchback (from a standstill) available in the UK is the Mercedes-AMG A45 S.
