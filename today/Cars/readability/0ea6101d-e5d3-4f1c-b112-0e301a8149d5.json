Finished in Starlight Black over black vinyl upholstery, the car is equipped with the WS6 Special Performance Package, adjustable front coilovers, four-wheel disc brakes, 17″ Year One snowflake wheels, a Hurst shifter, a digital stereo, air conditioning, removable t-top roof panels, a shaker hood, a Texas Speed camshaft, an Edelbrock throttle body, a Cold Case aluminum radiator, PRC cylinder heads, Holley fuel rails, long-tube exhaust headers, and a dual exhaust system with Pypes mufflers. The car was refurbished and modified in 2024 and was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025. This Firebird Trans Am is now offered in Wisconsin at no reserve with PHS documents and a clean Illinois title. The car was repainted in Starlight Black during the 2024 refurbishment. Exterior equipment includes Firebird hood graphics on the shaker hood as well as a front spoiler, removable t-top roof panels, a rear spoiler, and painted mirror caps. The gold 17″ Year One snowflake wheels are mounted with Nitto NT555 G2 tires. The vehicle is equipped with power steering as well as the WS6 Special Performance Package, which included power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, a quick-ratio steering box, and a larger sway bar. The selling dealer tells us that the WS6 steering box was replaced along with other suspension and steering components and that adjustable front coilovers and drilled and slotted rotors have been fitted. The seating surfaces were retrimmed in black vinyl upholstery, which extends to the door panels. Amenities include an engine-turned dash fascia, a full-length center console, a Hurst shifter, a digital stereo, aftermarket air conditioning, and black rubber floormats. The leather-wrapped Formula steering wheel fronts a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, an analog clock, and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 19k miles. Total mileage is unknown. The 6.2-liter LS3 V8 was installed in 2024 and features a Holley oil pan, valve covers, and billet fuel rails as well as a Cold Case aluminum radiator, 4150-style intake manifold, PRC Brawler cylinder heads, Hooker stainless steel mid-length exhaust headers, and MSD ignition wires. The selling dealer tells us that the engine has been fitted with an Edelbrock throttle body, a Brian Tooley Racing trunion upgrade, a Texas Speed custom-grind camshaft, dual valve springs, titanium retainers, ARP head bolts, Mahle 10.3:1 pistons, and a Holley EFI fuel tank with a 400 fuel pump. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission, and a limited-slip differential with 3.73:1 gears. The selling dealer tells us that a Holley cross-member, a McLeod hydraulic clutch conversion kit, and an LS7-style clutch and flywheel are installed. A stainless steel dual exhaust system with an X-pipe and Pypes mufflers is fitted. A build sheet copy shows initial delivery to Bridges Pontiac of Hayward, California, as well as factory options and colors. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
