It is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Lapis Blue Metallic over Graphite Grey leather. Features include a Metropol Blue soft top, 17″ Boxster S II wheels, a speed-activated rear spoiler, heated power-adjustable seats, a Becker Porsche CDR-23 stereo, and automatic climate control. The fuel tank and the evaporative emissions vent purge valve were replaced in May 2024. This 986 Boxster S is now offered at no reserve with copies of the 2004 and 2006 Boxster Commemorative books, a car cover, a damage-free Carfax report, and a clean Maine title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Lapis Blue Metallic and features a Metropol Blue soft top. Additional features include a speed-activated rear spoiler, side air intakes, and body-color roll hoops. There is an indentation near the left-rear wheel well. The 17″ Boxster S II wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires up front and Continental ExtremeContact tires out back. The rear tires were replaced in July 2024. Braking is handled by four-piston Porsche-branded calipers fitted over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The cabin features heated power-adjustable seats upholstered in Graphite Grey leather, and additional features include a Becker Porsche CDR-23 stereo and automatic climate control. The driver’s seat leather shows signs of wear. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a central tachometer, a 180-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 51k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.2-liter flat-six was factory rated at 258 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. The fuel tank and the evaporative emissions vent purge valve were replaced in May 2024, and the battery was replaced in August 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: LM5W – Lapis Blue Metallic C02 – Version for USA XMK – Exterior color roll-over bar 342 – Seat heating 424 – CD compartment 446 – Wheel caps with colored Porsche crest 476 – Porsche Stability Management (PSM) 490 – Sound system (Harmann analog) 502 – Produced at Valmet plant in Uusikaupunki, Finland 551 – Wind deflector 584 – Storage box (incl. speakers) on engine cover The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and lists at least one open manufacturer recall.
