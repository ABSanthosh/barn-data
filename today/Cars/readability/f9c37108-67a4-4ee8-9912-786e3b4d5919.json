The car was refinished in its factory shade of Starmist Blue, the interior was retrimmed in its factory specification of Starmist and Dresden blue upholstery, the Town and Country radio was repaired, wire wheels and whitewall tires were mounted, the power brake booster was rebuilt, and an electric fuel pump was installed. The car is powered by a 312ci V8 paired with a three-speed Fordomatic automatic transmission, and it has a Colonial White-finished removable hardtop with porthole windows as well as a blue soft top, power steering, power-adjustable seats, and power windows. Driven approximately 1,500 miles over the last 15 years, this Thunderbird is now offered with the removed factory wheels and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car had been painted red at some point before the seller’s acquisition, and in 2012 the body was stripped and it was refinished in its factory shade of Starmist Blue. The dark blue soft top is shown in its raised position above, and the white hardtop is displayed in the gallery along with the included storage rack. The seller mounted 14″ wire-spoke wheels with Coker whitewall tires. The power booster for the brakes was also rebuilt. The power-adjustable bench seat was retrimmed in its factory-specified Starmist and Dresden blue upholstery. The carpeting and dashboard pad were also replaced along with the door trim, and the Town and Country radio was repaired. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a centrally mounted 140-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer indicates 33k miles, though the seller does not believe it is accurate, and total mileage is unknown. The tachometer cable is noisy and the tach needle bounces. The D-code 312ci Y-block V8 is topped with a four-barrel carburetor and was factory rated at 245 horsepower. The seller states that the carburetor was cleaned, the fuel tank was flushed, and an electric fuel pump was installed in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Fordomatic three-speed automatic transmission. The seller notes the bottom of the car was undercoated by a previous owner, and they scraped most sections and refinished those areas Starmist Blue. Some undercoating remains in spots. The removed factory wheels and covers are included in the sale. Decoding the data plate reveals the following production information: D – 312ci V8 Color F – Starmist Blue Trim XL – Pleated Dresden Vinyl \u0026 Pleated Starmist Vinyl You are not connected to real-time updates.
