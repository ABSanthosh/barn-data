  "description": "Mercedes-Benz has confirmed that the AMG CLE 53 4Matic+ Coupe will launch in India on August 12, confirming our prior report. The CLE line-up for the Indian market currently comprises the CLE 300 Cabriolet and will soon be bolstered by the hotter AMG CLE 53 in coupe form. Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Coupe price in India likely to be around Rs 2 crore It gets a much sportier design with wide fenders; interior gets AMG-specific touches, too Powered by 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-6 mild-hybrid mill developing 449hp and 560Nm Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe exterior design Looks a lot more menacing than the CLE Cabriolet Much like other AMG models, the CLE 53 sports a Panamericana grille with vertical slats, flanked by swoopy LED headlights. The front bumper, expectedly, looks much more aggressive than that of the mild-mannered CLE Cabriolet, with a larger air dam. Over to the side, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe’s flared fenders stand as a design highlight, and there are air exits behind the front wheel arches. Wide fenders lend distinctive look to the rear We expect the AMG CLE 53 Coupe to come with 19-inch alloy wheels as standard, with 20-inchers offered as an optional fitment. The rear end looks quite striking thanks to the added width from the flared fenders, and it also features a unified but not connected tail-lamp cluster, a quad-exhaust setup, a gloss-black diffuser and air exits on either side. Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe interior and features Sportier steering wheel, Alcantara trim, and lots of red stitching The overall interior layout of the AMG CLE 53 Coupe is shared with the CLE Cabriolet, including the 11.9-inch portrait-oriented infotainment touchscreen, a 12.3-inch digital driver’s display, a trio of central AC vents, and more. However, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe gets an AMG-spec 3-spoke steering wheel draped in Alcantara and leather with red stitching, as well as two extra touch controls. Alcantara, carbon-fibre and red stitching have been used throughout the cabin, too, and the dashboard and seats sport an all-black colour scheme, unlike the tan upholstery in the CLE Cabriolet. In terms of creature comforts, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe offers wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, 64-colour ambient lighting, a Burmester surround sound system, electrically adjustable seats with memory function, a wireless charger, a heads-up display, and more. Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe engine and gearbox Twin-turbo straight-6 with mild hybrid system The AMG CLE 53 Coupe is equipped with a 3.0-litre twin-turbo straight-6 paired with a 48V mild-hybrid system, making for a combined output of 449hp and 560Nm (40Nm extra in the Overboost mode). A 9-speed dual-clutch gearbox funnels this grunt to all four wheels via Mercedes-AMG’s 4Matic+ system. 0-100kph in 4.2 seconds From a standstill, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe can hit 100kph in a claimed 4.2 seconds and go on to a top speed of 250kph, which can be increased to 270kph with the optional AMG Performance Package. Mercedes AMG CLE 53 Coupe price and rivals Will compete with BMW’s smallest M car Pricing for the AMG CLE 53 Coupe is expected to land around Rs 2 crore (ex-showroom). Once launched, the AMG CLE 53 Coupe will rival the BMW M2, which costs Rs 1.03 crore. All prices ex-showroom, India.
