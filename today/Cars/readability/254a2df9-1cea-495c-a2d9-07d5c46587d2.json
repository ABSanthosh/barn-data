  "description": "The updated Honda Shine 100 has been launched with prices starting at Rs 69,000. Along with a new colour option, this model also complies with the latest emissions norms, in line with other recently updated Honda two wheelers. Honda Shine 100 receives a new black with orange paint scheme At Rs 69,000, it costs Rs 2,000 more than the outgoing model Honda Shine 100: what’s new? In terms of design, the Shine 100 retains the same styling as the outgoing model. It continues to be available in a single variant with five colour options, with the only change being the replacement of the earlier “black with gold” colourway with a new “black with orange” scheme. Powering this commuter is the existing 7.38hp, 8.04Nm, 98.98cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that's paired with a 4-speed gearbox. Despite now complying with stricter OBD2B emissions norms, the engine’s power and torque figures remain unchanged. Priced at Rs 69,000, the updated Shine 100 costs Rs 2,000 more than its predecessor. The Honda Shine 100 has been the brand’s entry level commuter offering. Launched back in 2023, the Shine 100 has been received well and has been a contributing factor towards Honda Motorcycles securing the top-spot in terms of February sales.
