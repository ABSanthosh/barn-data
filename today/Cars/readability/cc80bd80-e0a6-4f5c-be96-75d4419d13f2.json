  "text": "The mid-size pickup is now Toyota's third best-selling vehicle 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Toyota’s redesigned mid-size truck is flying off dealer lots as sales surged 188.2% in March. The Crown lineup is struggling as the sedan dropped 66.8%, and the Signia is off to a slow start. RAV4 sales fell 8.4%, but a redesigned model was recently spied undergoing testing. The redesigned Toyota Tacoma is a smashing success as sales skyrocketed a staggering 188.2% in March to 23,949 units. The good news doesn’t end there as Tacoma sales are up 177.5% through the first three months of the year. In fact, the Tacoma’s runaway success meant it was Toyota’s third best-selling vehicle last month. It was only beaten by the RAV4 (41,509) and Camry (29,661). Surprisingly, the mid-size pickup even outsold the ever popular Corolla (21,495), which begins at $22,325. Review: 2025 Toyota Tacoma Hybrid Spices Up Winning Ingredients Speaking of sedans, Toyota didn’t have the luck of the leprechauns as the Camry, Corolla, Crown, and Mirai all posted declines. The Crown, in particular, saw sales plummet 66.8%, while not even a single Mirai was bought last month. While the Subaru BRZ got a sales boost, Toyota’s GR86 fell 16% to 1,146 units. The Supra was also down 11.4% to a mere 179 sales. The only bright spot in the car lineup was the Prius, which saw sales jump 77.4%. On the SUV side of the equation, the bZ4X’s price cut appears to have spurred sales as the EV saw a 102.9% jump to 1,678 units. The affordable Corolla Cross saw a 39.8% increase, while the Highlander dropped 52.1%. While it’s probably too early to read into the 4Runner numbers, the Land Cruiser racked up 5,860 sales in March. That’s a promising development, although the Crown Signia is trailing the numbers that used to be generated by the Venza. Speaking of people movers, the Sienna saw a 73.5% jump in sales as 9,033 minivans found a new home last month. In total, Toyota sold 196,240 vehicles in March for a 6.6% increase from last year. However, the company is only up 0.1% for the quarter at 487,226 units. Toyota US Sales",
