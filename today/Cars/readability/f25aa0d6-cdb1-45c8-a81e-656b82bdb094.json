  "text": "All three bodykits from the Taiwanese firm are named after Greek gods October 30, 2024 at 20:23 by Brad Anderson Taiwanese tuner Custuning is debuting three Tesla bodykits at SEMA, each named after Greek gods. One of the kits offered for the Tesla Model S includes flared arches and several carbon fiber parts. Custuning also offers performance upgrades for Teslas, including wheels, brakes, and suspension. There’s no shortage of aftermarket accessories available for the Tesla Model 3, Model Y, and Model S, thanks partly to US-based firms like Unplugged Performance. A Taiwanese firm by the name of Custuning is now throwing its hat into the race and has previewed three Tesla bodykits it will unveil at next week’s SEMA Show. The lineup kicks off with an upgrade package for the Tesla Model Y, dubbed Notos. If your Greek mythology is sharp, you’ll know Notos as the ancient god of the south wind—a fitting symbol of speed and power, according to Custuning.

A more aggressive hood has also been designed and new side skirts are included. Found at the rear is a bold diffuser and a larger lip spoiler. The car heading to SEMA is equipped with a slew of other performance parts from the firm, including lightweight forged wheels, eight-piston front brake calipers, and adjustable air suspension. For the Model S, Custuning has previewed a package called Boreas, after Greek god of the cold north wind, storms, and winter. This one cranks up the aggression several notches, with carbon fiber construction. It’s far less subtle than the Model Y kit and rocks a custom splitter, aerodynamic skirts, and new fins at the rear. According to Custuning, it boosts downforce, although no specific details have been provided. A widebody kit is also under development. Rounding out Custuning’s Greek-inspired lineup is the Eurus kit for the Model 3, named for the god of the east wind. Like Boreas, the Eurus kit brings a similar design language to the Model 3, with an array of carbon fiber elements for a more sharper and aggressive look.",
