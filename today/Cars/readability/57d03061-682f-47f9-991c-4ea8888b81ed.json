  "text": "The son of the almighty Valkyrie is the brand's first plug-in hybrid and debuts a new dual-clutch eight-speed December 10, 2024 at 19:46 by Brad Anderson The supercar’s twin-turbo V8 is familiar but has a flat-plane crank and dry sump lubrication system. Aston Martin says the Valhalla hits 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.5 seconds and tops out at 217 mph (350 km/h). Just 999 examples are destined for the production line. It’s been more than five years since the Aston Martin Valhalla was first unveiled as a concept and over three years since its production-spec design was previewed. Now, the British brand has unveiled its flagship new mid-engined supercar in full before production starts in the second quarter of 2025. It promises to put cars like the Lamborghini Revuelto and Ferrari SF90 Stradale on notice and follows in the footsteps of the Valkyrie. Found at the heart of the new supercar is a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that delivers 817 hp (828 PS), giving it the highest specific output of any Aston Martin. Supplementing the V8 are three electric motors, including two at the front axle, that lift output to 1,064 hp (1,079 PS) and 811 lb-ft (1,100 Nm) of torque. Read: Aston Martin Valhalla AMR Looks Sensational But Sounds Rather Dull At The ‘Ring In addition to being the first Aston Martin sold as a plug-in hybrid, the Valhalla debuts the marque’s new eight-speed dual-clutch transmission. Thanks to more than 1,000 raging horses and all-wheel drive, the Valhalla will scurry off the line and hit 62 mph (100 km/h) in 2.5 seconds and power through to 217 mph (350 km/h). Aston Martin has other V8 models in its line up, but the engine of the Valhalla is a little different. Most notably, it has a dry sump lubrication system and is fitted with a 180-degree, flat-plane crankshaft. Engineers have also designed new camshafts and exhaust manifolds for the 4.0-liter and the turbos are larger than those found in the DBX707. Trick tech Incorporating a trio of electric motors has allowed Aston Martin to give the Valhalla torque vectoring on the front axle while found at the rear is an electronic limited-slip differential. The electrical assistance also mitigates any noticeable turbo lag and lost energy can be captured under braking. The Valhalla can even drive purely on electric power for up to 14 km, although the top speed is limited to 80 mph (140 km/h). Like the Valkyrie, the Valhalla prioritizes aerodynamics. At 149 mph (240 km/h), it produces more than 600 kg of downforce and as speeds build, trick active aero parts are used to bleed off excess downforce from the front and rear wings. There’s no word on how quickly it’ll lap a circuit, but it should be rapid. Key vehicle components, including the suspension, braking, steering, active aerodynamics, and the powertrain, are optimized by an Integrated Vehicle Dynamics Control (IVC) system, allowing for fine-tuning of key parameters. The IVC also ensures the front and rear axles can communicate with each other, as there’s no physical connection between them. Like the finest supercars, the Valhalla is built around a carbon fiber monocoque that draws on Aston Martin’s expertise in Formula 1. Aluminum subframes are then attached to the front and rear of the tub. Trick push rod suspension with inboard springs and dampers is found up front, while at the rear are bespoke Bilstein DTX adaptive dampers. Braking is handled by carbon ceramic discs at all four corners, consisting of 410 mm discs at the front and 290 mm units at the rear. F1-inspired cabin A race car-inspired cockpit makes the Valhalla feel all the more special. Like the Valkyrie, it has raised footwells to provide a low hip-to-heel seating position and is fitted as standard with one-piece carbon fiber seats. A flat-top and flat-bottomed carbon fiber steering wheel catches the eye, as does a large digital instrument cluster and a big infotainment screen. Aston Martin’s team has created special graphics for these displays, too. As with other existing Aston Martin models, those who purchase a Valhalla will be offered “endless bespoke and customization possibilities” through the Q by Aston Martin division. There’s no word on how much the Valhalla will cost but we do know it will be limited to just 999 examples worldwide.",
