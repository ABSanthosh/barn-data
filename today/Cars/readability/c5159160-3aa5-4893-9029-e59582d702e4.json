The car is finished in paint-to-sample Grey Black over a white leather-to-sample interior, and is powered by a 4.6-liter V8 that works in conjunction with dual electric motors that drive all four wheels through a seven-speed PDK automatic transaxle. Equipment includes 20″ and 21″ 918 Spyder magnesium wheels, an electro-mechanical limited-slip differential, a front-axle lift system, the Porsche Active Aerodynamics system, rear-axle steering, LED headlights, a back-up camera, $7k in Custom Tailoring options, a Burmester surround sound system, the Carbon-Fiber Interior Package, dual-zone climate control, glare-reducing interior components, and a 6.8-kWh lithium-ion battery pack mounted behind the passenger compartment. This 918 Spyder is now offered in Newbury Park, California, on dealer consignment with a window sticker, a build sheet, a car cover, factory literature, and a clean Montana title. The Michael Mauer-designed 918 Spyder was unveiled as a concept at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show and entered production in September 2013, with all examples produced as 2015 models. Construction incorporates a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer monocoque chassis with carbon fiber also utilized for the body panels and removable roof panels. The $21k paint-to-sample option saw this car specified in Grey Black, and the car features the Porsche Active Aerodynamics system, a back-up camera, a driver-side fuel door, a passenger-side charging port, and LED headlights. Optional equipment includes exposed carbon-fiber mirror housings as well as a lift system that allows the front end to be raised when clearance is needed. Paint imperfections, as well as nicks in one of the headlight covers, can be viewed in the gallery. Staggered-diameter 20″ and 21″ 918 Spyder magnesium wheels are mounted with 265/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The adaptive suspension system incorporates a double-wishbone front and multi-link rear setup along with rear-axle steering, Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus, and electro-mechanical power steering. Stopping power is provided by silver-painted six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over ventilated and drilled carbon-ceramic discs measuring 410mm up front and 390mm out back. The cabin features carbon-fiber seats trimmed in leather-to-sample white, and matching accents extend to the door panels, dashboard, and steering wheel. Equipment includes a Burmester surround sound system, Bluetooth capability, navigation, dual-zone climate control, and an elevated center console with a 7″ touchscreen. The car was optioned with the Carbon-Fiber Interior Package as well as silver accent stripes on the seatbelts. The leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel frames a trio of configurable digital gauges that display speed, revs, fuel level, and battery charge. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles. The driver can select from five different driving modes, including E-Drive and two hybrid modes as well as sport and race settings. Plaques on the center tunnel and rear engine cover identify this chassis as #590 of a total production run of 918 units, approximately 300 of which were built for the US market. The mid-mounted 4.6-liter MR6 90° V8 features dual overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank, a flat-plane crankshaft, titanium connecting rods, and a dry-sump lubrication system. It is mated to a seven-speed PDK transaxle and an electro-mechanical limited-slip differential. Electric motors are mounted at the front and rear and work in conjunction with the gasoline engine for a combined factory-rated output of 887 horsepower and 944 lb-ft of torque. The 6.8-kWh lithium-ion battery pack is mounted behind the passenger compartment and allows a limited range in all-electric “E-drive” mode. The oil was changed in December 2024. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Niello Porsche in Rocklin, California, along with factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $911,500.
