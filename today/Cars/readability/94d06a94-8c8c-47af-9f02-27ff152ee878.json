  "text": "Kia plans to keep the Tasman relevant with various improvements over a long lifecycle 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas The Tasman is expected to gain hybrid and electric powertrains later in its lifecycle. An upcoming facelift may take design cues from the Tasman Weekender Concept. Kia says it plans to keep the pickup on the market for approximately 8 to 12 years. Kia’s midsize truck, the Tasman, is just getting started and is expected to stick around for quite a while, according to a high-ranking company official. However, it won’t remain frozen in time. Along the way, it’ll see upgrades including, in all likelihood, a styling refresh and, more notably, hybrid and fully electric variants. More: Kia Confirms First Midsize Pickup For America The update comes via Roland Rivero, General Manager of Product Planning at Kia Australia. Speaking with CarExpert, Rivero described the Tasman’s ladder-frame chassis as a “fairly modular platform” that can accommodate “numerous powertrains.” Hybrid and EV Versions on the Table Depending on the market, the Tasman is currently offered with gasoline and diesel engines, but electrified versions are on the horizon. Rivero confirmed that Kia is actively “studying and reviewing” both hybrid and fully electric variants, though he stopped short of committing to a specific timeline for their launch. One possible setup involves pairing the turbocharged 2.5-liter gasoline engine that’s available in the Korean market with a self-charging hybrid system, like what Hyundai is doing with the latest Palisade. Such a move could position the Tasman to compete directly with electrified midsize trucks like the BYD Shark and Ford Ranger Plug-in Hybrid. As for the fully electric Tasman, expect a dual-motor setup providing all-wheel drive. This version would go up against the zero-emission trucks being developed by Toyota and Isuzu, including electric versions of the Hilux and D-Max. Kia’s local head of Product Planning said the Tasman’s lifecycle will follow the typical pattern for light commercial vehicles, lasting “anywhere from 8 to 12 years.” To keep demand strong over that span, Kia plans to update and refine the midsize truck in a variety of ways. Weekender Concept Shows What’s Possible Some of those future styling updates might take cues from the recently revealed Tasman Weekender concept, which debuted at the 2025 Seoul Mobility Show. While Rivero emphasized that the Weekender is “just a concept” for now, he acknowledged that it could influence future updates, saying there’s “plenty of opportunity to enhance the Tasman” throughout its run. More: New Kia Pickup Coming To America And It’s Nothing Like The Tasman The concept gets wider, body-colored fenders, redesigned bumpers, a more pronounced hood, and chunkier tires over the production model. These could make their way into a tougher, off-road-oriented variant of the Tasman, a move in line with the growing popularity of factory-built rugged trucks, led by models like the Ford Ranger Raptor. In any case, it appears that Kia has plenty of ideas about the future of the truck, enhancing its presence as a newcomer in this competitive segment. Until a facelift arrives, owners of the Tasman can rely on the numerous available accessories, tailored for different use-case scenarios.",
