  "description": "This Maserati 450S re-creation was constructed by the seller’s company in Madrid, Spain, between 2023 and 2024 and features a steel oval-tube spaceframe wrapped in hand-formed aluminum bodywork. Following its completion, the car was displayed at Retromobile Paris in 2025 before undergoing a color change from blue to red. Power is provided by a Maserati Tipo 107 V8 that was overhauled to a displacement of 4.6 liters with components reportedly including lightened cylinder heads, forged pistons, and modified camshaft profiles. The car is also equipped with quadruple Weber carburetors, a five-speed manual transmission, disc brakes disguised as finned hydraulic drums, four-wheel independent suspension, silver-painted wire wheels, dual side-pipe exhaust, a riveted aluminum fuel tank, bucket seats upholstered in black, and Jaeger instruments. This 450S re-creation is now offered in Madrid, Spain, with photos and invoices from its construction and Spanish registration identifying it as a 1966 Maserati 4200 GT.",

Following its completion, the car was displayed at Retromobile Paris in 2025 before undergoing a color change from blue to red. Power is provided by a Maserati Tipo 107 V8 that was overhauled to a displacement of 4.6 liters with components reportedly including lightened cylinder heads, forged pistons, and modified camshaft profiles. The car is also equipped with quadruple Weber carburetors, a five-speed manual transmission, disc brakes disguised as finned hydraulic drums, four-wheel independent suspension, silver-painted wire wheels, dual side-pipe exhaust, a riveted aluminum fuel tank, bucket seats upholstered in black, and Jaeger instruments. This 450S re-creation is now offered in Madrid, Spain, with photos and invoices from its construction and Spanish registration identifying it as a 1966 Maserati 4200 GT. Development of the original 450S began in 1954 under the project name Tipo 54 and resumed in 1956 when Maserati was tasked with producing a V8 for use in an Indianapolis 500 chassis. After the powerplant was tested in a 350S chassis, a new platform was designed by Valerio Colotti to accommodate the increased power. The 450S model gave Maserati second place in the 1957 World Championship of Makes before production ceased in 1958 after approximately 10 chassis had been built. This re-creation was constructed by Fly Hammer in Madrid, Spain, and features hand-shaped aluminum bodywork that is patterned after the Fantuzzi styling of the original 450S platform. Initially finished in blue, the bodywork received a color change to red with number-19 roundels. Features include removable hood and trunk panels with drilled release handles, a hood scoop ahead of three sets of louvers, faired-in headlights, a wrap-around plexiglass windshield, a removable headrest fairing, rear fender scoops, louvers behind each rear wheel, and Monza-style fuel-filler caps accessible through the trunk panel. Silver-painted Borrani-style wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in Pirelli tires, as is a matching spare housed in the rear compartment. Stopping is handled by hydraulic disc brakes that are concealed inside finned drum-style covers and are actuated by dual master cylinders. The left-hand-drive cockpit houses a pair of fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in black leather and surrounded by gray-painted aluminum surfaces. Additional features include a gated shifter, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, and a handheld fire extinguisher mounted on the center tunnel. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a central Jaeger 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by gauges monitoring coolant temperature and oil pressure. The car is not equipped with an odometer, and it is said to have been driven approximately 600 miles since its construction. The Tipo 107 V8 incorporates an aluminum block and cylinder heads, dual overhead camshafts on each bank, and quadruple dual-throat Weber carburetors. This example’s engine was rebuilt in Argentina prior to installation in the car with features reportedly including a 4.6-liter displacement, forged racing pistons, lightened and machined cylinder heads, and revised camshaft profiles. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission. Independent suspension incorporates a coil-sprung double-wishbone front setup and a De Dion rear arrangement with radius rods and a transverse leaf spring. Images from the car’s construction can be viewed in the photo gallery below. The vehicle is being sold on its Spanish registration, which serves as an ownership document in Spain.
