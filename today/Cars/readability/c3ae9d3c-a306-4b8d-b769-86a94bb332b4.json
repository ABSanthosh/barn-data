  "description": "Ather Energy has announced that it will be showcasing its new scooter platform – EL – and a bunch of other fresh developments at its annual Community Day 2025 to be held on August 30. New Ather EL platform to debut on August 30 Company working on new fast chargers  Recently, Ather Rizta crossed the 1 lakh unit sales milestone Ather EL scooter platform, new fast chargers being readied Ather Stack 7.0 operating software to also debut at this event. At its Community Day 2025, Ather will be showcasing its new scooter platform – EL – and concept vehicles, some of which are likely to be based on this new platform. Ather claims its new EL platform is engineered to be versatile and cost-efficient and will enable the company to expand its product line-up to cater to a wider range of customers. Currently, Ather is the sole mainstream player in the electric two-wheeler industry to not have an offering under the Rs 1 lakh mark. Competitors such as Bajaj, TVS, Ola Electric, Vida (Hero) and Greaves all have at least one product under that threshold and this new EL platform could remedy this for Ather. Ather is also working on its next-generation of Grid fast chargers, which it claims will make charging quicker and more convenient. For reference, the current Ather Grid chargers can top up any Ather e-scooter at the rate of 1.5km/min and any Vida e-scooter at 1.2km/min; since Vida uses Ather’s open-sourced charger connector, its products benefit from this system. Last but not least, Ather will also debut an upgraded version of its software stack, Ather Stack 7.0, which is likely to bring in more features to its products. At its previous Community Day, Ather launched its first family centric offering, the Rizta, which recently surpassed the one lakh unit sales milestone.
