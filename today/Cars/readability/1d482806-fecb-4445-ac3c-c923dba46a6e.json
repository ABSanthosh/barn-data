  "text": "Scattered across Japan is a mythical chain of stores that bring wonder and excitement to all who visit. ‘Up Garage’ reads boldly in blue and red over yellow, a name well-known to JDM enthusiasts. But for those who think manga is some new American political term, a visit to Up Garage feels like visiting eBay Motors in the real world. Think of it as eBay circa 2008, back when genuine bargains could still be found. That’s because Up Garage isn’t your average parts shop. Everything here is used – wheels, bumpers, headlights, exhausts, and more. Best of all, no two Up Garages are the same. So, if you’re willing to spend the day hopping from branch to branch, you’re bound to find many interesting parts at a fraction of their original cost. Shopping at Up Garage is an easy way to modify your Japanese car on a budget, especially if you drive something popular like a Toyota 86 or Honda Civic. But not everyone wants that easy option no matter how tempting it is. Take Kazuma Hara, for example. While visiting his local Up Garage could make his life much simpler, Hara-san prefers a challenge. “When you get your first car, all you want to do is drive to a garage and start buying tuning parts,” Hara-san says. “But if you want to stand out, you can’t use the same car or the same parts as everyone else. Sometimes it’s better to take a more difficult route.” And so, he chose something far from the mainstream – a JW3 Honda Today. If you’ve never seen one before, the Today looks a bit like a shrunken EG Civic. That’s no accident; the model was one of Honda’s kei car offerings through the 1980s and ’90s, adhering to Japan’s strict mini-car regulations: a 660cc engine and a length under 11.2 feet (along with restrictions on width and height). Hara-san’s love for the Today didn’t start with the car you see here. Five years earlier, when Hara-san was just 15 and still in school, he began racing with another JW3 chassis. It may seem like an obscure choice, but these cars are cheap, light (only 650kg), and perfect for honing your race craft. In fact, they’re even a good choice for time attack racing, as Dino discovered in 2023. Having raced for several years before earning his driving license, Hara-san now needed a daily driver. And sure enough, another JW3 Today – this one – soon joined his stable. “I know these cars very well from racing, so it seemed like an obvious choice once I had my driving license,” he explains. “The problem is there are a lot fewer parts than a Civic or Integra, so if you want to create something unique, you’re often required to do it yourself.” What Hara-san discovered from talking with other JW3 owners is that some parts – like the engine – are shared with the Honda Beat. This knowledge paved the way for Hara-san to add more performance-orientated parts including an E07A (MTREC) Beat engine which – although remaining 656cc – has a higher rev limit and more peak power than the similar variation fitted in the Today. Engine displacement was increased by a whisper to 700cc and a JB1 Honda Life 4-speed manual transmission with shorter gear ratios was fitted alongside. Then, Hara-san turned his attention to the intake and exhaust. Three Keihin Flat CR (FCR) carburettors with alloy intake trumpets are fed by the now-removed passenger headlight, while an SS Works exhaust system was one of the few off-the-shelf parts Hara-san could use. Inside, Hara-san has taken a similar route to his old race car, stripping the interior and building a custom roll cage in the rear. He also seam-welded the body for extra strength and reinforced the engine mounts. And who doesn’t love a big ol’ Stack gauge in the centre of the dash? Completing the interior is a Ciena bucket seat with a Sabelt harness belt, a Momo steering wheel, and a full-size spare wheel in the back. As for wheels, Hara-san runs several sets, including 14-inch Mugen MR5s wrapped in Dunlop Direzza semi-slicks. “For the exterior, I had a very specific look I wanted to achieve,” Hara-san says. “I’ve always loved the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC) and from an early age, while racing, I always wanted to make my car look and feel like a racing version. There are a lot of Integra and Civics modified in a similar way already in Japan, so I did not want to just copy this look and be like others. That’s why I wanted to do it on the JW3 Today.” His favourite JTCC-era car, the 1997 Kool Jaccs Honda Accord, would be the inspiration for his Today’s livery. But this isn’t a vinyl wrap – Hara-san painted the green, gold, and white himself, with a friend making the stickers to complete the JTCC look in ‘micro’ form. “What I love about the JW3 Today is that it is only sold in Japan, so it is already very unique before you start customising it,” Hara-san explains. “I could have bought a Civic, got many parts off the shelf and built the car very quickly. But it would not have given me the same feeling, especially when seeing similar cars that no longer make you feel unique. All of the work on my JW3 Today has been done by myself and in my spare time. To drive reminds me of racing when I was younger, and I hope that feeling never goes away.” Mark Riccioni Instagram: mark_scenemediaTwitter: markriccionimark@speedhunters.com",
