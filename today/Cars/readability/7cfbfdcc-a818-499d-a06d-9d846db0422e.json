  "description": "The provisional calendar for the 2026 MotoGP season has been revealed. However, there is no mention of the Indian GP. MotoGP commercial rights holder Dorna had stated last year that the return of the Indian GP had been postponed to 2026 due to “operational circumstances”, but this hasn’t materialised. 2025 Indian GP was cancelled due to “operational circumstances” 2026 MotoGP calendar features 22 rounds Indian GP not part of 2026 MotoGP calendar MotoGP’s India return hits another roadblock MotoGP made its India debut at the F1 Indian GP’s former home, the Buddh International Circuit, back in 2023. Despite operational issues and scorching hot temperatures, the track itself earned praise from several riders. The race was set to return and was originally a part of the 2024 calendar as well. But it was later cancelled and pushed to March 2025, with the official reason cited as “weather concerns”. However, reports at the time suggested that promoter Fairstreet Sports had not paid the full hosting fee to Dorna on time. Fairstreet Sports had denied this, stating that Dorna was aware that payments would be delayed due to the upcoming General Elections. Just weeks later, though, Dorna signed a new 3-year deal directly with the Uttar Pradesh government, removing Fairstreet Sports from the picture entirely. In August 2024, the government issued a tender to find a new race promoter, but this was later recalled and reissued in September 2024. Finally, in late September, Dorna confirmed that the Indian had been dropped from the 2025 calendar as well. However, the statement at the time stressed that the Indian GP would return in 2026.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Autocar India (@autocar_india) “Operational circumstances have obliged the event to be delayed from its initial slot near the start of the 2025 calendar. With no available dates towards the end of the season, MotoGP will therefore return to India in the early stages of 2026,” the statement said. “Both MotoGP and InvestUP are working hard to bring MotoGP back to Buddh International Circuit with a world-class event and are committed to confirming India as a destination for global sporting events.” Despite the promises, there’s no mention of India in the 2026 MotoGP calendar announcement. Given India’s tumultuous history of hosting international motorsport events (just look at F1 and Formula E), the success of the India MotoGP round was crucial. No reason for the cancellation of the race has been shared as of yet, but Autocar India has reached out to Dorna and is awaiting a response. Also see: Mahindra wants to stay Formula E manufacturer",
