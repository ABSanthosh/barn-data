  "text": "26 parties reportedly expressed interest in the plant, but none of the concepts were said to be viable and sustainable October 16, 2024 at 20:35 by Michael Gauthier Audi reportedly hasn’t found a suitable buyer for their Brussels plant, which currently builds the Q8 and Q8 Sportback e-trons. The luxury brand wants to axe the unpopular EVs and this has put the plant’s future in jeopardy. The Volkswagen Group has reportedly decided against building another model at the plant and hasn’t found another use for it. During the summer, Audi revealed they wanted to end production of the Q8 e-tron lineup early and explore options for the Brussels plant, where the crossovers are built. At the time, the automaker said demand for the models had dropped and the plant had “long-standing structural challenges,” which included high logistics costs and a layout that is difficult to change due to its location near the city center. Given these issues, Audi announced their intention to “carry out a restructuring of the site” and noted this could eventually result in a “cessation of operations if no alternative is found.” Unfortunately for employees, things aren’t looking good. More: Audi Wants To Kill The Q8 E-Tron, May Shut Brussels Plant AutoNews Europe quoted Audi Chief Operating Officer Gerd Walker as saying they haven’t found a “viable and sustainable concept,” despite being approached by 26 interested parties. On top of that, the Volkswagen Group has reportedly decided against building another vehicle at the plant or finding some other use for the facility. This sounds like it could be the final nail in the coffin for the plant and the publication pointed to a union negotiator who said approximately 3,000 jobs could be lost as “the only thing they want to do is close the plant as quickly as possible.” It remains unclear how much Audi is seeking for the facility, but some are likely hoping that tariffs on Chinese EVs could encourage automakers to setup shop in Belgium. Nio was reported to be one of the companies interested in the plant, although their CEO later denied that as a “groundless” rumor.",
