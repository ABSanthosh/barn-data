  "text": "The Level 4 ID. Buzz is equipped with dozens of sensors and will operate on both sides of the Atlantic. June 18, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier The production version of the autonomous ID. Buzz AD has officially been unveiled. It features Mobileye’s self-driving technology and 27 sensors for improved safety. The autonomous van is marketed as a turnkey solution for cities and fleet companies. Volkswagen’s mobility-focused MOIA brand has unveiled the production version of the ID. Buzz AD. It’s been years in the making and paves the way for autonomous electric vans in Europe as well as the United States. This announcement comes just days after Elon Musk said Tesla’s Robotaxis would begin trial operations in Austin, Texas, on June 22. Coincidence? Maybe. But the race to dominate autonomous mobility is heating up. One key difference between the two is that while Tesla’s Robotaxi will focus on serving passengers as a ride-hailing service, VW’s MOIA will primarily target corporate customers and mobility providers. More: This VW Robotaxi Could Be Your Next Uber Ride Volkswagen’s Level 4 vehicle has been “specifically optimized for use in mobility services” and features an extended wheelbase as well as a raised roof. Those aren’t the only changes as the van has “intuitive boarding via smartphone,” which implies riders use their device to unlock the vehicle. Once inside, riders are treated to a revamped interior that features ‘wood’ flooring, large grab handles, and four passenger seats. We can also see SOS, Support, and Start/Stop buttons. MOIA also said the van has onboard AI to “ensure comfort and safety.” Interestingly, the vehicle has a driver’s seat and what appears to be a steering wheel covered in cloth camouflage. This suggests the model may accommodate a safety driver, although the seat can apparently be pushed out of the way when not in use. Elsewhere, the front passenger seat and center console have been removed. This frees up space for a storage compartment, which can hold luggage and other items. The Autonomous Driving System Of course, the real news is the autonomous driving system. MOIA said the van has a total of 27 sensors including 13 cameras, nine LiDARs, and five radars. This gives the ID. Buzz AD a “comprehensive, redundant 360-degree view of its surroundings.” The company added the van uses “Mobileye’s self-driving system, along with a proprietary Autonomous Driving Mobility as a Service (AD MaaS) Ecosystem Platform.” While the firm didn’t delve into many specifics, MOIA said they offer public and private mobility providers a “turnkey package to launch autonomous services quickly, safely, and at scale.” They noted this can include everyone from cities and municipalities to fleet companies. Customers that sign up can expect a “fully connected 360-degree package made up of leading technology, an attractive vehicle fleet, intelligent fleet management, and a customer-centric booking system – all from a single source.” Plenty of questions remain, but Volkswagen Group CEO Oliver Blume said the rollout should begin next year, pending approval. “Beginning in 2026, we will bring sustainable, autonomous mobility to large-scale deployment in Europe and the US another milestone on our path to becoming a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” he said.",
