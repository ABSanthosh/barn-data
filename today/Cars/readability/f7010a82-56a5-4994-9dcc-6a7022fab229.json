  "description": "Korean car manufacturer Hyundai has roped in TVS Motor to develop electric three-wheelers and micro four-wheelers in India. While Hyundai plans to offer design, engineering and technology, TVS will focus on manufacturing and marketing these EVs in India.  Two concepts showcased today feature screens at the front to display text Wheelchair access is also provided Two Micro Mobility concepts, called E3W and E4W, that could culminate from this partnership, were also showcased at the ongoing Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025 on Saturday. This comes after our exclusive report on the two firms coming together. E4W (left) and E3W (right) concepts at Auto Expo 2025. The three-wheeled concept is the duo’s take on electrifying the motor rickshaw while also serving multiple purposes, such as logistics, emergency response, or passenger transport. The other four-wheeler concept looks similar to the e-rickshaw but gets a wider-angled windshield.  These green vehicles are built with enhanced collision protection and have a flat floor placed right above a long wheelbase. The Korean manufacturer is also reviewing the use of heat-resistant gloss black paint on the roof to reduce interior heat conductivity and exploring water-resistant materials for the cabin. Apart from that, wheelchair access is provided. Interestingly, they are also equipped with a screen at the front that can display text, something we have seen on public buses in Delhi. “Hyundai is a customer-centric brand, and our mission is to care for people in India by designing micro-mobility solutions tailored to its unique environment,” said SangYup Lee, executive vice president and head of Hyundai and Genesis Global Design.  “Collaborating with TVS Motor, we aim to locally produce the three-wheeler while exploring global opportunities for the four-wheeler, blending intuitive functionality with India’s spirit of innovation,” Lee added. Hyundai and TVS are reviewing the feasibility of scaling these vehicles for global markets, with the electric four-wheeler micro concept under evaluation for a broader application.
