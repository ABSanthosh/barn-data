  "description": "After revealing the updated Speed Twin 900 back in October, the bike has now been launched in India at Rs 8.89 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The bike has seen significant visual and hardware changes but the engine has been left relatively untouched. USD fork, radial front caliper is new for 2025 Now uses same circular display as Trident 660 Available in three colours  Triumph Speed Twin 900 details The 900cc parallel-twin engine is rated for the same 65hp and 80Nm as before and the 5-speed gearbox is carried over as well. This engine is now compliant with the latest Euro 5+ regulations. Compared to the old bike, the big change is in how the Speed Twin 900 looks. This is a far more minimal design with more blacked-out elements, and it more closely resembles the Speed Twin 1200 now. The 2025 bike also employs a non-adjustable Marzocchi USD front fork as well as a Triumph-branded (J.Juan manufactured) radial caliper. The Speed Twin 900’s seat height has now risen to 780mm (up from 765mm), but with the accessory low seat, you can drop it to 760mm. Gone is the single-pod digi-analogue display, and it has been replaced by the same TFT unit seen on the bigger 1200 models. The switchgear, too, is shared with the bigger Speed Twin models. The electronics suite includes Road and Rain riding modes along with cornering ABS and traction control. Three colours are available on the Speed Twin 900 and deliveries are expected to begin by January 2025. With the Rs 8.89 lakh asking price, the most affordable Triumph modern classic is now Rs 40,000 dearer.",
