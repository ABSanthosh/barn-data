  "text": "It disappeared faster than you could say \"limited edition,\" with all 50 units gone before most even knew it existed 5 hours ago by John Halas The BMW Skytop Roadster is headed for limited production, with only 50 units available. Under the hood is a 617 hp V8, propelling the Skytop from 0 to 62mph in just 3.3 seconds. The concept marks a return to a more sophisticated design ethos, with a restrained front end. You thought it was just another concept car, didn’t you? Well, guess what—BMW is actually building it. Enter the BMW Skytop, a two-seater roadster that started as a design study at the 2024 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Now, thanks to enough demand from the right people, BMW is moving the Skytop into a very limited production run. Here’s the catch: they’re only building 50 examples of the targa-style model, and if you’re not already on the VIP list, you’re out of luck. Unsurprisingly, every one of those 50 cars has been claimed at an undisclosed price that BMW isn’t eager to share. More: BMW Concept Skytop Is The Prettiest Bimmer In A Decade  For reference, BMW’s most recent ultra-exclusive special, the 3.0 CSL (also capped at 50 units), was priced at €750,000, or about $820,000 back in 2022. Some of those later popped up on the used market for as much as $1.35 million. So, if history repeats itself, the Skytop will likely follow the same trajectory. BMW hasn’t specified which markets the production Skytop has been certified for. “The BMW Skytop is a truly exotic design and offers a combination of driving dynamics and elegance at the highest level,” said BMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk. “To finally be able to announce that this car will be built is like a dream come true. Thank you for the very positive response around the globe and to the passionate team that worked on the project.” Built on the Bones of the BMW 8-Series Following the same formula BMW used with the 3.0 CSL in 2022, the Skytop joins the ranks of other impossible-to-get, high-dollar showpieces, using off-the-shelf components wrapped in a custom suit. The Concept Skytop is based on the existing BMW 8-Series, reimagined with a bespoke body featuring a targa-like semi-open cockpit. V8 Turbo Power We’ll have to wait and see what the production version of the concept shown here will look like. Power comes from BMW’s most potent V8—the same 4.4-liter twin-turbo engine you’ll find in flagship M models like the M8 Competition, cranking out 617 horsepower (460kW / 625 PS). With an eight-speed Steptronic transmission and xDrive all-wheel-drive, the Skytop will rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.3 seconds. So yes, it’s fast, and yes, you’ll never drive one. So there’s that. Keeping It Classy The design, though, is what really makes the Skytop stand out. BMW raided its greatest hits archive, blending elements from the Z8 and 503 coupe to create something both retro and modern—far better looking than the 8-Series Coupe and Convertible models it’s based on. It’s a nod to a more sophisticated, elegant era of BMW design. More: BMW Concept Touring Coupe And Z3 M Coupe Photographed Side-by-Side The signature shark-nose front, the flowing rear, and the aluminum spine that runs from the hood to the trunk all make it clear that this isn’t just another roadster. The details are where the Bavarian brand flexes its design muscles, like the lack of door handles, replaced by subtle winglets, and custom-designed LED lights that are some of the thinnest you’ll find on any production car. All Luxed Up Inside Inside, the Skytop plays it safe, relying more on premium materials than a fully bespoke interior to make its mark. The cabin sticks to the familiar 8-Series dashboard layout and tech package, nothing groundbreaking here. In the concept, at least, BMW attempts to elevate things with hand-stitched reddish-brown leather and intricate brogue detailing. The tech is exactly what you’d expect from BMW’s upper echelon: a head-up display and a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system to ensure your playlist hits just as hard as the V8 under the hood. Can’t Touch This As mentioned earlier, all 50 units are already gone. Unless you’re willing to pay an outrageous premium on the secondary market, the Skytop will remain just another unattainable piece of automotive art for most of us. So, enjoy the photos, because that’s about as close as you’re going to get.",

BMW raided its greatest hits archive, blending elements \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/tag/bmw-z8/\"\u003efrom the Z8\u003c/a\u003e and 503 coupe to create something both retro and modern—far better looking than the 8-Series Coupe and Convertible models it’s based on. It’s a nod to a more sophisticated, elegant era of BMW design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore: \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/2023/05/z4-based-bmw-concept-touring-coupe-poses-next-to-the-original-z3-clown-shoe/\"\u003eBMW Concept Touring Coupe And Z3 M Coupe Photographed Side-by-Side\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe signature shark-nose front, the flowing rear, and the aluminum spine that runs from the hood to the trunk all make it clear that this isn’t just another roadster. The details are where the Bavarian brand flexes its design muscles, like the lack of door handles, replaced by subtle winglets, and custom-designed LED lights that are some of the thinnest you’ll find on any production car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll Luxed Up Inside\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n        \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23.jpeg\" data-type=\"inarticle-image-block\"\u003e \n            \u003cfigure\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\n                    \u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23.webp 1920w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-400x225.webp 400w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-768x432.webp 768w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-1536x864.webp 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, (max-width: 1535px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 1000px, (max-width: 300px) 600px, (max-width: 200px) 200px\"/\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-1024x576.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23.jpeg 1920w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-1536x864.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, (max-width: 1535px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 1000px, (max-width: 300px) 600px, (max-width: 200px) 200px\" alt=\" BMW Skytop Entering Production, But It’s Already Sold Out\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-BMW-Concept-Skytop-23-1024x576.jpeg\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\n                \u003c/picture\u003e\n            \u003c/figure\u003e\n        \u003c/a\u003e  \n        \n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the Skytop plays it safe, relying more on premium materials than a fully bespoke interior to make its mark. The cabin sticks to the familiar 8-Series dashboard layout and tech package, nothing groundbreaking here. In the concept, at least, BMW attempts to elevate things with hand-stitched reddish-brown leather and intricate brogue detailing. The tech is exactly what you’d expect from BMW’s upper echelon: a head-up display and a Bowers \u0026amp; Wilkins sound system to ensure your playlist hits just as hard as the V8 under the hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan’t Touch This\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, all 50 units are already gone.
