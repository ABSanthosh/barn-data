  "text": "Inside, the QX80-based concept is equipped with a large TV and a bespoke audio system 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Infiniti has unveiled the Autograph Lounge concept, ahead of its debut at the SEMA Show. The concept is based on the QX80 and features a stylish wrap as well as special 24-inch wheels. Designed for luxurious tailgates, the SUV has a cargo compartment with a TV and speakers. Typically, luxury brands steer clear of the SEMA Show’s raucous, aftermarket crowd, but Infiniti is bucking that trend with its new Autograph Lounge concept. Based on the recently redesigned QX80, it’s pitched as a high-end reimagining of tailgating. In order to become the life of the party, the concept has a bespoke cargo compartment that houses a television and a Klipsch audio system. Both are mounted on top of custom slide-out drawers, which are wrapped in burgundy leather and feature diamond stitching. Review: The 2025 QX80 Is A Step In The Right Direction for Infiniti Instead of beer and burgers, the drawers house water and wine bottles as well as premium glassware. They’re joined by plates, silverware, and a corkscrew. The upgrades continue outside as the QX80 wears a matte gray wrap that combines nicely with black and dark bronze accents. Rounding out the highlights are an air suspension with a lowering kit and custom 24-inch wheels. The latter sport colorful accents as well as floating center caps. Since the concept is based on the 2025 QX80, it features a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 developing 450 hp (336 kW / 456 PS) and 516 lb-ft (699 Nm) of torque. That’s 50 hp (37 kW / 51 PS) and 103 lb-ft (139 Nm) more than the old 5.6-liter V8. The redesigned luxury SUV is currently available at dealerships and pricing starts at $82,450 before a $1,995 destination fee. However, the range-topping Autograph trim will set you back $110,595. That’s pretty pricey, but the flagship has semi-aniline quilted leather seats with heating, ventilation, and massage functions in the first two rows. Buyers will also find a heated steering wheel, a suede headliner, and open pore ash wood trim with an aluminum inlay. Technology takes a starring role as the QX80 Autograph has dual 14.3-inch displays and a lower 9-inch screen. Second-row passengers get their own touchscreen as well as a high-tech biometric cooling system, which uses an infrared sensor to help keep them cool as a cucumber. Other highlights include a 24-speaker Klipsch audio system and ProPILOT Assist 2.1, which allows for hands-free driving on the highway.",
