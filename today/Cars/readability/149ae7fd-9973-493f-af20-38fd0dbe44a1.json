The Swift Sport Final Edition will be available from March to November 2025 It gets unique cosmetic bits inside out There are no mechanical changes for the Final Edition Swift Sport Final Edition gets unique cosmetic upgrades As part of the Final Edition, the Swift Sport ZC33S gets a gloss black finish on the grille, unique 17-inch alloy wheels with a black finish, red brake calipers, a Swift Sport emblem with red and black lettering, and special decals on the C-pillars on each side. Apart from these, there are no other exterior changes to the car, which has been around internationally since 2017. It gets faux aluminium inserts on the dashboard and door pads. Additional ‘Sport’ lettering and a decal reading ‘ZC33S powered by Suzuki’ are positioned near the gear lever. The car retains the regular Swift Sport’s bucket seats, aluminium-finished pedals, and red stitching on the steering wheel and upholstery.  Customers who want their Swift Sport ZC33S Final Edition to look more unique can opt for optional aero accessories that include more decals, light garnishes, and other add-ons to enhance the car’s visual appeal. Swift Sport Final Edition gets no mechanical changes The ZC33S Final Edition is identical to the regular Swift Sport in terms of mechanicals. It comes with the same 1.4-litre turbo petrol engine, producing 138hp and 230Nm of torque. It gets a front-wheel-drive (FWD) layout and offers a choice of a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox. This powertrain in the Japanese-spec car does not get any electrification, while the Swift Sport sold in Europe has had mild-hybrid technology since 2020 due to stricter emission norms. Production of the Swift Sport ZC33S Final Edition will begin in March 2025 and continue until November 2025. Swift Sport India launch details Maruti has shown the Swift Sport in India many times at various events. However, it has not gone on sale in India throughout its history. The standard Swift and its sedan sibling, the Dzire, entered their respective new generations in India this year.
