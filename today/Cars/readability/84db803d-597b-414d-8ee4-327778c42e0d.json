  "text": "This 2008 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder has 4,700 miles, and it was purchased by its current owner in February 2017. It is finished in Giallo Midas over black Alcantara and is powered by a 5.0-liter V10 paired with a six-speed E-gear automated transaxle. Equipment includes a front-axle lift system, a rear-view camera, a Nero convertible soft top, a speed-activated rear spoiler, 19″ Cassiopeia wheels, heated power-adjustable seats, navigation, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This Gallardo Spyder is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a Pennsylvania title. The Gallardo was initially styled by Italdesign Giugiaro, while the final production version was designed in-house by Luc Donckerwolke. This example is finished in Giallo Midas and features a Nero convertible soft top, a rear-view camera, a speed-activated rear spoiler, xenon headlights, power-folding side mirrors, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets that exit through the rear valance. A ceramic coating has reportedly been applied to the body. The 19″ Cassiopeia wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires, which were fitted in January 2024. Braking is provided by yellow-finished calipers with black Lamborghini script over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The car is equipped with an optional front-axle lift system. The heated power-adjustable seats are upholstered in black Alcantara, and interior features include navigation, a rear-view camera, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 210-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. A three-gauge panel mounted atop the dashboard includes readouts for oil pressure, oil temperature, and voltage. A service record viewable in the gallery indicates that the tire pressure monitor light is illuminated. The digital odometer indicates 4,700 miles, approximately 200 miles of which were added under current ownership. The 5.0-liter V10 was factory rated at 512 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. Work in January 2024 included an oil change, a coolant flush, and replacing the fuel filter and spark plugs. Power is routed to all four wheels via a six-speed E-gear automated transaxle. The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage. The Pennsylvania title is listed as a duplicate. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
