  "description": "Volkswagen has unveiled the new Tayron, which replaces the Tiguan Allspace, offering extra practicality, more onboard tech, and four engine options. This model is essentially the three-row version of the Tayron that was revealed earlier this year at the Beijing Motor Show, where it was named the 'Tiguan L Pro.' Gets four engine options, with 2WD and 4WD PHEV capable of 100km EV-only running Will rival Skoda Kodiaq, Jeep Meridian Volkswagen Tayron: dimensions, interior, features The new Volkswagen Tayron is effectively a new-generation Tiguan that has been stretched by 231mm to bring the option of a third row of seats and an extra 198 litres of boot space. However, the PHEV can't be had with seven seats due to the placement of the 19.7kWh battery under the boot floor. It also loses 18 litres of boot capacity compared to the regular five-seater Tayron’s 885 litres. Inside, the Volkswagen Tayron gets a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. A 15-inch head-up display is available as an optional extra. It also packs in ADAS features such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keep Assist, Autonomous Emergency Braking, and more. Volkswagen Tayron: powertrain options The new Volkswagen Tayron is being offered with four engine options: a mild-hybrid petrol, a pure petrol, a petrol plug-in hybrid and a diesel – with various power outputs. The line-up opens with the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol mild-hybrid, which sends 150hp through the front wheels. It’s followed by a 2.0-litre turbo petrol with 204hp or 265hp and front- or four-wheel drive. The 2.0-litre turbo diesel can be had in 150hp or 193hp guises – the former with front-wheel drive and the latter with VW’s 4Motion 4WD. Each of these versions is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox as standard. The range-topper is the PHEV, combining a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol, four-cylinder engine with a single electric motor and a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The system sends either 204hp or 272hp through the front wheels, and Volkswagen claims an electric-only range of more than 100km for both versions. The 19.7kWh battery can be charged with speeds of up to 50kW DC. Volkswagen Tayron: India launch timeline Deliveries of the new Tayron in the UK will begin in March 2025, with pricing expected to represent a small premium over the Tiguan AllSpace. For India, the new Tayron will be assembled via CKD kits when it’s expected to arrive later in 2025, and will rival the Jeep Meridian and the Skoda Kodiaq, among other similarly priced SUVs.
