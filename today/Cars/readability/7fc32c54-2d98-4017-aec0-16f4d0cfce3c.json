It is slated to go on sale sometime next year and will essentially serve as an EV equivalent of the popular XUV700.   XEV 7e name trademarked alongside XEV 9e and BE 6e  XEV 7e is expected to share its powertrain with XEV 9e Its design will be less radical than the BE 6e and XEV 9e Mahindra XEV 7e new details  Leaked images preview the XEV 7e in its production avatar, and just like the BE 6e and XEV 9e, the XEV 7e has a lot in common with the concepts that were shown back in 2022. It is a three-row derivative of the XEV 9e coupe-SUV.  While the name XEV 7e has not been officially announced, Mahindra has trademarked it along with the XEV 9e and the BE 6e nameplates, with the latter two already used for models that are now on sale. As seen in the leaked images, the XEV 7e will be the less radical and more conventional of the trio, with a “practical” three-row XUV700-like cabin. Upfront, it has a unique design that mimics the XEV 9e, including the headlamps, the closed-out grille and the front bumper. On the sides, it looks very similar to the XUV700, with the rear styling that has EV-specific design tweaks. The alloy-wheel design is also reminiscent of the new XEV 9e with aero-looks.   The cabin has a lot in common with the XEV 9e, including the three-screen setup and the two-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated logo. Compared to the other two Mahindra EVs, one of the USPs of the XEV 7e is captain’s chairs for the second-row passengers, with ample headroom thanks to a conventional roofline. While there isn’t much clarity on the powertrain, we expect the XEV 7e to mimic the XEV 9e’s battery and motor setup. Expect more details on the XEV 7e to emerge closer to its market launch, which is expected by mid-2025.  IMAGE SOURCE Also see: Mahindra BE 6e review: A path-breaking EV Mahindra XEV 9e launched at Rs 21.90 lakh Mahindra XEV 9e Pack One variant price, features explained",
