  "description": "Gaydon goes very large indeed on both performance and 4x4 capability for its very first ultimate Defender How does one begin to succinctly define a vehicle as multi-faceted as Land Rover’s Defender Octa?One thing’s certain: the process takes you down numerous paths. Is the 626bhp Octa the most ambitious product the company has launched since the original Range Rover? In many ways, from engineering to sales, yes, it absolutely is. No Land Rover has ever been conceived with such scope in respect to its all-terrain ability and drivability. Or price.Could the Octa also be said to have a genetic make-up achievable by blending DNA from the sensational BMW M5 CS with one of McLaren’s supercars and a T1+ Dakar rally-raider, of the sort you’ll have seen competing in the Dakar Rally? Incredible as it sounds, that isn’t far from the truth.More broadly, is this carbon-adorned Defender for everyday use, family trips away or weekends doing specialised off-road activities? Incredibly, hardware suggest it’s all three.As for what it is not? At £148,000 even before you get to the limited-release Edition 1 car tested here, the Octa is not an inexpensive car. In terms of price, in the broader Defender line-up it is very much positioned as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS or Lamborghini Huracán STO and is aimed at a similar clientele.Neither is this car going to be free from quirks in normal driving. One reason why the Octa can happily fire itself down dusty back roads at frightening speeds is because of its new suspension, which makes for tracks 68mm wider than those on the standard and hardly slimline Defender. No matter how expert the chassis tuning, the Octa will need handling with care in a way something humdrum like, say, a Porsche Cayenne Turbo wouldn’t.Which brings us to one last point on the subject of what the Octa is and is not. Is it necessary? Unless you see yourself needing to escape from the bad guys by travelling at speed over rough and varied terrain, and you need to do it in comfort and a reasonable level of luxury, then no, of course this car isn’t necessary. And we dare say it will be easier to find chances to explore the full potential of the aforementioned supercars at track days than it will this extra-special Defender, unless you happen to own half the county.But when did necessity concern cars made with imagination? And it’s this, above all else, that most neatly defines the Defender Octa.",

  "text": "Take it as read that, alongside the dust fests, the Octa can also handle the mucky stuff – traditionally a Defender’s bread and butter. Outside of Octa mode, it still has the regular car’s suite of terrain settings, only now with the benefit of the increased approach, departure and breakover angles. Horiba MIRA’s off-road course gets considerably more difficult than what you can see in the images on these pages and our test car lapped it up.And so to the road. Much has been made of the Octa’s potential for width-, weight- and height-defying dynamics and, in many respects, the hype is well earned. The Octa has a marginally quicker steering response than the regular Defender but the real reason it feels so much more agile and, frankly, manageable than its off-the-shelf range-mates is mostly to do with the new cross-linked suspension. Especially in Dynamic mode, the car’s resistance to pitch and squat is notably reduced, and while roll movements start off in a familiar fashion, they’re quickly curtailed and the body’s deftly supported.For any Defender to conduct itself like this is remarkable, not least in the context of the Octa’s broadened off-road envelope. Moreover, the Octa retains the regular car’s natural manner – the ease and fluidity that result from body movements being so well matched to cornering force and steering input, only with a much tighter operational window. It means that, even on the Goodrich tyres, you can put the Octa down a decent road just as quickly as you like, without having to worry about any unpleasant surprises the topography might throw up.Is the Octa a driver’s car, then? Of sorts, yes. There’s satisfaction to be had here, though you are still ultimately dealing with a high centre of gravity, geometry that must cope with extreme off-road scenarios, and plenty of weight transfer. Certainly, think twice before cancelling that Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid order if outright dynamism is your priority.Lastly, and as if the Octa needed another string to its bow, is touring ability. In Comfort mode, you’re treated to a languid gait but on many surfaces Octa mode itself yields the best ride quality. Combined with effortless torque, superb visibility and precise steering that doesn’t subtly leech your concentration, as it can in the regular car, the Octa is excellent company on long drives.",
