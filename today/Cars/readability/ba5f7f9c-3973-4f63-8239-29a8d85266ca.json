  "description": "The Land Rover Defender, five years into its second-generation run, remains a tour de force in the world of SUVs. Defying the norms of typical automotive life cycles, the Defender’s appeal continues to grow rather than fade. Global sales are closing in on the 4,00,000 mark, a testament to its enduring charm and versatility. But rather than rest on its laurels, Land Rover has taken its most daring step yet with the introduction of the Defender Octa – a luxury off-roader conceived to play at the pointy end of the high-performance SUV market along with the mighty Mercedes-AMG G 63, Porsche Cayenne and Lamborghini Urus. The brief was very simple – make the Octa the fastest off-roader in the world. But what does that exactly mean? Is it about Nürburgring lap times? Racing up sand dunes? Rock-crawling prowess? Or the ability to bomb down a gravel road sideways with a family and a boot full of their luggage? Land Rover’s answer: all of the above. Plus, it will make its Dakar Rally debut in 2026. Yes, the Octa is out to make a statement – a big, bold, go-anywhere, do-anything statement – and live up to its name. And in case you were wondering, the name ‘Octa’ takes inspiration from the octahedral shape of a diamond, a nod to both the beauty and unparalleled toughness of this precious stone. Defender Octa engine and mechanical upgrades BMW-sourced twin-turbo V8 makes 635hp and 750Nm The twin-turbo V8 produces 635hp and 750Nm. To acquire such a repertoire of talents, the Defender Octa had to be much more than just a beefed-up version of the standard Defender 110. It represents a wholesale reengineering effort aimed at elevating performance both on and off the road. At its heart lies a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine sourced from BMW, tuned to deliver a staggering 635hp and 750Nm of torque, which jumps to 800Nm when using Dynamic Launch Mode. This V8 is a ‘hot-vee’ with twin turbochargers within the two-cylinder banks, which improves driveability. This engine also has a mild hybrid system that gives an extra 27hp and 175Nm of torque.  This immense power enables the Octa, a 2.5-tonne SUV, to sprint from 0 to 100kph in just 4.0 seconds – performance on par with some sports cars. New 6D suspension includes hydraulically interlinked, triple-valve dampers controlling pitch and roll On rocky trails, the Octa has an astonishing ability to clamber over boulders with calculated precision. However, the Octa’s true innovation lies in its all-new 6D suspension system. While the standard Defender employs air suspension with adaptive damping and mechanical anti-roll bars, the Octa ditches traditional anti-roll bars in favour of hydraulically interlinked, triple-valve dampers that control pitch and roll in real-time. This semi-active suspension setup provides unprecedented body control, enhancing both on-road agility and off-road capability. The front and rear axles have been moved forward (by 4mm and 3mm, respectively) to accommodate the larger tyres and extra ride height to give a lofty ground clearance of 323mm. Wheel articulation? Up by 100mm to a massive 500mm. Approach, departure, and breakover angles? All improved (40.2, 42.8, and 29 degrees, respectively). There’s a larger intake at the front to keep the engine cool, a powder-coated metal undershield for added protection, and an extended bar at the rear shielding a pair of auxiliary radiators. Octa is the fastest and toughest ever Defender With this trick suspension, the Octa achieves a level of wheel articulation and off-road capability that sets new benchmarks in the SUV segment. This isn’t just the fastest Defender ever – it’s the toughest, too. Standing 28mm taller and 68mm wider than the standard Defender, the Octa’s pumped-up wheel arches add some serious presence, but it still looks like a Defender – just one that’s spent a lot of time in the gym. The optional matte protective film adds a military-spec ruggedness, though the carbon fibre accents on the bonnet and interior might be a bit much for some tastes. 20- and 22-inch tyres options on offer The Defender Octa can be specced with three tyre options tailored for different terrains. The 22-inch road-focused tyres are perfect for urban and highway use, while the 20-inch all-terrain tyres strike a balance between on-road comfort and off-road prowess. For the ultimate off-road experience, the Goodyear DuraTrac RT Advanced All-Terrain tyres provide durability and unparalleled grip on loose surfaces. Defender Octa off-road and on-road performance Not a match for the Urus or Cayenne on road In off-road mode, ground clearance is 323mm. Leaving Cape Town, the first thing I notice is the steering response, which is nippier than a standard Defender’s – the result of borrowing the quicker steering rack from the Range Rover Sport. The Octa turns in keenly, feeling surprisingly agile for such a large machine. It won’t match a Lamborghini Urus or Porsche Cayenne for outright handling precision, but it’s not far off. And let’s be real – nobody would dare take those road-oriented SUVs deep into the wilderness. The optional 275/60 R20 Goodyear DuraTractyres (fitted to our test car) do impact on-road grip, but they were necessary for tackling the extreme terrain of our South African test route. Driving on empty and smooth South African roads, the handling felt a bit ‘woolly’, and I had to make constant steering corrections. The chunky tread pattern drummed up some road noise, too. Most Octa buyers will likely opt for the Michelin all-season tyres on 22-inch alloys, which should transform on-road performance and offer a more direct or connected feel. We’ll need to revisit the car on those to get the full picture. New 4.4-litre V8 misses the drama of the old 5.0-litre supercharged V8 With the right tyres, the Octa can munch tarmac at a blistering pace. Tarmac roads also gave the opportunity to prod the performance of the Octa, which is simply staggering. The BMW-sourced 4.4-litre V8 is a different kind of beast compared to the old-school supercharged 5.0-litre V8. It’s more refined, less unruly, but no less potent. Flat out, the Octa pulls hard all the way to 7,000rpm, with a relentless surge of power. The twin-turbo V8 is smooth, muscular, and effortlessly quick. But compared to the old supercharged unit, it’s missing that raw edge – the deep-chested growl, the theatrical pops and crackles. That said, in any gear, at any speed, just floor it, and this thing absolutely flies. A proper V8 is always something to celebrate, and this one is no exception. Lofty driving position gives you a commanding view. The ZF 8-speed torque converter auto is the best in the business, seamlessly and swiftly managing the grunt with smooth shifts. The drivetrain has been seriously reinforced with stronger propshafts, beefier driveshafts, high-tensile steel joints, and a toughened rear diff – all built to handle the extra torque. The bespoke quad-pipe exhaust is tuned to balance performance with the Defender’s class-leading wading ability. Octa is far more capable off-road than the already formidable standard Defender Defender Octa off-road specsWater wading1,000mmGround clearance323mm (max)Approach angle40.2degDeparture angle42.8degRamp angle29deg The Defender Octa takes the already formidable off-road capabilities of the standard Defender and dials them up to an entirely new level. On rocky trails, it exhibits an almost supernatural ability to clamber over boulders and steep inclines with calculated precision. The Octa’s added ground clearance and increased wheel articulation make it feel unstoppable. The terrain response system does most of the work, letting the electronic differentials and suspension handle the trickiest sections with minimal driver input. Even when faced with a near-impassable climb, the Octa methodically claws its way up, throttle response so precise that you feel like you’re advancing one tread block at a time. Engage the off-road cameras, and you’ll watch in disbelief as obstacles that appear insurmountable disappear under the wheels with barely a scrape. In the sand, the Defender Octa is equally impressive. Drop the tyre pressures to 20psi, engage the Octa mode, and it transforms into a desert-storming beast. The V8’s abundant torque ensures that maintaining momentum – critical for dune driving – is effortless, while the advanced software monitors suspension movements to optimise damping in real time. Engage Octa mode and it transforms into a desert-storming beast. It’s on fast dirt tracks where the Octa truly sets itself apart. Engage Octa mode, and the Defender transforms from a rugged off-roader into something that feels more at home in the Dakar Rally. With roll control dialled back and the damping force cranked up, it stays composed while hammering over rough terrain at high speeds. The faster steering rack keeps you locked into the front axle, making corrections easy and intuitive. You can initiate a slide and let the Octa dance through corners with surprising agility for something this big and heavy. The recalibrated ABS and powerful Brembo brakes ensure you can scrub off speed effectively, whether you’re blasting down a dirt road or picking your way down a near-vertical descent. So, whether creeping over boulders, gliding over dunes, or charging through rally-style dirt tracks, the Defender Octa is an absolute weapon. Defender Octa exterior design Octa looks even more muscular than regular Defender 110 After an intense day of driving, we arrive at BushmansKloof, a fabulous resort in the middle of nowhere surrounded by scrubby desert. Taking a break at this luxurious oasis, I get a chance to have a proper look at the Octa to see what’s new. The real standout features are the bulging wheel arches and the massive tyres that fill them. That alone gives the Octa street cred like no other SUV. For the first year of production, the Octa will be available in this Edition One variant, which gets some exclusive colours and bits of carbon fibre. On the C-pillar, there’s an Octa badge, but it isn’t eight-sided or octahedral; it does look like a diamond. The other distinguishing factor is the quad exhausts neatly tucked away under the rear bumpers. So, all in all, the Octa Defender still looks like a Defender, but with a bit of muscle. Defender Octa interior features and comfort Octa looks even more muscular than regular Defender 110 Functional and quality interiors similar to the standard Defender. The interiors are pretty much Defender, but there are some specific Octa touches. The Performance front seats are new; they get integrated headrests, 14-way adjustment, and can be heated and cooled. There are specific colour themes for the Octa, and you tell the steering wheel apart from the standard Defender just by the Octa button. The minute you activate Octa mode, the paddle shifters glow, which is pretty cool. Selecting Octa mode illuminates the paddles. What is not cool is the aircon system, which struggled in what was peak summer in South Africa, with ambient temperatures hitting 42 degrees Celsius. With the temperature dialled down to the lowest cooling setting and the blower speed cranked up to seven, the cabin was just about cool but far from cold. Aircon struggled to cool cabin in 42 deg C. The Defender’s AC uses a variable-geometry piston compressor, which is simpler and easier to maintain than the more effective scroll-type compressor. However, the real issue seems to be the mild-hybrid battery system, which needs cooling when the Octa is driven hard. In such situations, the air-conditioning system’s power is split between cooling the battery and cooling the cabin via the air vents. Defender Octa price and verdict Expected to cost Rs 1.35 crore more than the standard Defender 110 V8 The touchscreen works well and is easy to use. The Octa will officially be launched soon at an indicative price of around Rs 2.85 crore. That’s Rs 1.35 crore more than the standard Defender 110 with the 5.0 supercharged V8, but even at this price, customers will be lining up for it. It’s cheaper than the G 63 and has wider breadth of capabilities. The Octa pushes the boundaries of what an off-road SUV can do and offers an unparalleled driving experience for those willing to explore its full potential. Whether tackling the toughest trails or cruising on the highway, the Defender Octa proves there’s truly no limit to where this legendary SUV can go.

Driving on empty and smooth South African roads, the handling felt a bit ‘woolly’, and I had to make constant steering corrections. The chunky tread pattern drummed up some road noise, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost Octa buyers will likely opt for the Michelin all-season tyres on 22-inch alloys, which should transform on-road performance and offer a more direct or connected feel.

The twin-turbo V8 is smooth, muscular, and effortlessly quick. But compared to the old supercharged unit, it’s missing that raw edge – the deep-chested growl, the theatrical pops and crackles. That said, in any gear, at any speed, just floor it, and this thing absolutely flies.

On rocky trails, it exhibits an almost supernatural ability to clamber over boulders and steep inclines with calculated precision. The Octa’s added ground clearance and increased wheel articulation make it feel unstoppable. The terrain response system does most of the work, letting the electronic differentials and suspension handle the trickiest sections with minimal driver input. Even when faced with a near-impassable climb, the Octa methodically claws its way up, throttle response so precise that you feel like you’re advancing one tread block at a time. Engage the off-road cameras, and you’ll watch in disbelief as obstacles that appear insurmountable disappear under the wheels with barely a scrape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the sand, the Defender Octa is equally impressive. Drop the tyre pressures to 20psi, engage the Octa mode, and it transforms into a desert-storming beast.

With roll control dialled back and the damping force cranked up, it stays composed while hammering over rough terrain at high speeds. The faster steering rack keeps you locked into the front axle, making corrections easy and intuitive. You can initiate a slide and let the Octa dance through corners with surprising agility for something this big and heavy. The recalibrated ABS and powerful Brembo brakes ensure you can scrub off speed effectively, whether you’re blasting down a dirt road or picking your way down a near-vertical descent. So, whether creeping over boulders, gliding over dunes, or charging through rally-style dirt tracks, the Defender Octa is an absolute weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefender Octa exterior design\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOcta looks even more muscular than regular Defender 110\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter an intense day of driving, we arrive at BushmansKloof, a fabulous resort in the middle of nowhere surrounded by scrubby desert. Taking a break at this luxurious oasis, I get a chance to have a proper look at the Octa to see what’s new. The real standout features are the bulging wheel arches and the massive tyres that fill them. That alone gives the Octa street cred like no other SUV. For the first year of production, the Octa will be available in this Edition One variant, which gets some exclusive colours and bits of carbon fibre. On the C-pillar, there’s an Octa badge, but it isn’t eight-sided or octahedral; it does look like a diamond.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other distinguishing factor is the quad exhausts neatly tucked away under the rear bumpers.
