Finished in Rosso Corsa over Beige leather, it is powered by a fuel-injected 3.2-liter V8 linked to a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a removable black roof panel, pop-up headlights, concave 16″ Speedline five-spoke alloy wheels, air conditioning, power windows, a gated shifter, and an Eclipse CD stereo. This 328 GTS is offered by the selling dealer in New York with manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, an accident-free Carfax report, and an Ohio title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features a removable black roof panel, pop-up headlights, integrated fog lights, side air intakes, dual side mirrors, a power antenna, and a black spoiler mounted over the rear window in addition to quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear valance. Paint protection film has been applied to the front bumper. Photographs of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery below. Staggered-width concave 16″ Speedline five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 205/55 front and 225/50 rear Bridgestone Potenza RE050A Pole Position tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted ventilated four-wheel discs. The seats are trimmed in Beige leather and complemented by color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Interior amenities include air conditioning, power windows, a gated shifter, an Eclipse CD stereo, and a rear-window defroster. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation consisting of a 180-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. Readouts for oil temperature and fuel level are mounted in the center of the dashboard along with an analog clock. The five-digit odometer shows 10k miles. The issuance of a “Not Actual Mileage” Utah title is noted on the Carfax report beginning in May 2001. The mid-mounted 3.2-liter Type F105 V8 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and four valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 260 horsepower and 213 lb-ft of torque. Recent work is said to have involved performing fluid services and replacing the timing belts, water pump, and spark plugs. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned “Not Actual Mileage” title issuances, although the current Ohio title lists the mileage as actual.
