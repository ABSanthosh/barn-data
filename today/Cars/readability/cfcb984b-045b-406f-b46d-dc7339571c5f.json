It is finished in Exotic Red Clear Coat over Ginger leather and is powered by a turbocharged 2.2-liter inline-four paired with a three-speed automatic transaxle. Features include a body-color removable hardtop with opera windows as well as a black convertible soft top, 15″ lace-style alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, power-adjustable seats, an Infinity cassette stereo, cruise control, and an Ultimate sound system. The car was built in late-1988, and it features a cabin without wood trim as well as a non-airbag steering wheel. This TC is now offered at no reserve with a period brochure, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title in the seller’s name. The TC was developed jointly by Chrysler and Maserati and assembled in Milan, Italy. This example is finished in Exotic Red Clear Coat (FR2) and features a body-color removable hardtop with opera windows as well as a black convertible soft top, a retractable antenna, power-adjustable side mirrors, bright trim, and dual exhaust outlets. Chips are noted in the driver’s door, and imperfections are visible in the clear coat. The 15″ lace-style alloy wheels are mounted with Ultra GT tires. The car is equipped with power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, and the seller notes that the brake pedal has a long travel. The power-adjustable bucket seats are upholstered in Ginger leather, as are the center armrest and door panels. Cars built early in the production sequence were not equipped with wood trim. The car is equipped with an Infinity cassette stereo, although the AM/FM radio is inoperable. The air conditioning system does not work. The non-airbag steering wheel was unique to the 1989 model, and it is mounted on a tilting column and frames a 125-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 29k miles, approximately 160 of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 2.2-liter inline-four was assembled by Maserati and was factory rated at 160 horsepower and 171 lb-ft of torque. Work in July 2024 included an oil change and replacing the air filter, distributor cap, ignition coil, spark plugs, and ignition wires. Power is sent to the front wheels through a three-speed automatic transaxle. Additional photographs of the underside are shown in the gallery below. The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage.
