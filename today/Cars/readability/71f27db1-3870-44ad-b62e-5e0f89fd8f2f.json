  "text": "Jun 9, 2025 7:00 PM EDTThe Rivian R2 should arrive early next year Expected to become available in early 2026, Rivian’s upcoming R2 is a midsize, fully electric SUV that will slot beneath the R1S and R1T in the automaker’s lineup and will provide a more rugged alternative to established electric crossovers such as the Tesla Model Y and the Ford Mustang Mach E. As we eagerly await the arrival of Rivian’s third-ever model, we can now take a closer look at the R2’s innovative suspension system, as shared on Instagram by the brand’s founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe. Oops! We’re unable to load this content right now.View directly on Instagram According to Scaringe’s Instagram post, the “R2 multi-link rear suspension includes 5 stamped steel links and uses an isolated rear subframe to deliver incredible ride quality and handling.” In an automotive first, the Rivian R2’s rear suspension resembles a “starfish” in an effort to “reduce unsprung mass to support enhanced ride quality.” Judging by the comments on RJ’s Instagram post, it seems that people are generally very excited by the innovative suspension system. Perhaps most importantly, the brand CEO’s fascination with seemingly small details such as the R2’s rear suspension system echoes the automaker’s attention to detail, which seems to have resonated with buyers and enthusiasts alike. The Rivian R2 is set to be a game changer Featuring two unique battery sizes, the Rivian R2 will reportedly be available with over 300 miles of all-electric range and a 0-60 miles per hour time of under three seconds. Perhaps the most notable feature of the Rivian R2 is its size. Claimed to be a true SUV, rather than a crossover, the modest-yet-ample sizing of the Rivian R2 reminds us of a popular segment of SUVs that, into the late-2000s and early-2010s, saw most of its models morph into softer, less-rugged crossovers, such as the Jeep Cherokee, the Ford Explorer, and the Chevrolet Blazer. Now that boxy and rugged-yet-practical SUVs are regaining popularity, Rivian is set to be ahead of the game by offering a vehicle in a class that seems to have been entirely neglected for far too long, even by more traditional combustion-powered options. Final thoughts While the upcoming Rivian R2 seems like it’s set to be one of the most exciting and most usable electric SUVs introduced to date, perhaps the most eagerly anticipated feature is the R2’s supposed price tag, which is expected to start around $45,000 USD. That’s about the same price as a 2025 Ford Explorer ST-Line, a Toyota Highlander Hybrid, or a Tesla Model Y without the federal EV tax incentive included, despite offering superior interior spaciousness and rugged, off-road-ready chops. We’re eagerly awaiting the Rivian R2’s imminent arrival in early 2026, and we’re excited to see how it stacks up against more established EV SUVs. About the AuthorCole Attisha",
