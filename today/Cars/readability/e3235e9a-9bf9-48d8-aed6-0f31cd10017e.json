  "description": "Replace the fetching new Sakhir Gold paint shade for a more conventional black, white or silver, and you’d be hard pressed to identify this Audi Q8 as the 2024 Audi Q8. Fact is, the list of changes on Audi’s glamorous big SUV isn’t a long one. Yet, it’s a model you can’t help but be charmed by.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift exterior design  For starters, the way it looks. To me, the Q8 is the best looking of the German SUV-coupes. The balanced proportions and in particular, the flow of the C-pillar and exaggerated haunches that link to Audi's hero rally cars of the 80s give the Q8 standout appeal. It's not a shape I'd tinker with much, to be honest.  The exaggerated haunches link the Q8 to Audi's hero rally cars of the 80s.  As for what’s changed, the headlights are familiar in shape but have been upgraded to HD Matrix LED units with powerful laser lights for high beam. What's also cool is the option to toggle between four DRL light signatures. The bold octagonal grille gets a facelift of its own with the incorporation of chrome teardrop detailing that adds in a bit of bling. Also, the Q8 makes the move to Audi's new 2D logo. The front bumper has been revised with a new intake design and chin spoiler.  At the sides, it's the new 21-inch rims finished in graphite grey and red brake calipers that are your only cues to this being the 2024 Q8. Frameless windows remain a detail that'll leave an impression at the hotel lobby. At the back, the latest Q8 carries forward the full-width LED lighting, with a redone scuff plate completing this mildest of makeovers.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift interior and features Even less has changed inside. It’s a high quality space but there’s a feeling of familiarity thanks to a three screen layout. The 10.1-inch touchscreen on the upper portion of the dash is very slick but still misses on wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The lower 8.8-inch touchscreen for the climate control system is more contentious. While you do get used to it over time and haptic feedback helps, for anything but the basic temperature controls you’ll need to take your eyes off the road. The third screen is for the digital dials. While informative, they lack the vibrancy that we've seen in the screens on the latest lot of BMWs and Mercs. Still misses out on wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Features-wise the Q8 packs in soft close for the doors, a sweet-sounding Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, four-zone climate control and a panoramic sunroof. There's ambient lighting too, park assist, and a 360-degree camera with maneuver assist that'll apply the brakes if the system senses an impending collision when you're parking your vehicle. However, a full suite of ADAS features is missed, which is something you'd expect on a car of this price. Also, there's no seat ventilation and even steering adjust is manual. Individuals just under 6 feet can manage with reasonable headroom.  Rear seat passengers have it good with lots of legroom and (not a speciality on SUV-coupes) too. There's also the option to drop the rear seat backrest by a few degrees for added comfort and you also get powered sunshades. Luggage space remains unchanged at 605 litres. Folding down the rear seats takes that figure to 1755 litres. 2024 Audi Q8 facelift powertrain There are no changes under the hood. We get the Q8 in 55 TFSI form, which means power comes courtesy a 3.0-litre V6 turbo-petrol engine. The engine makes 340hp and 500Nm and power is channeled to all four wheels via Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system. V6 turbo-petrol only show its full might when you really provoke it. It's a familiar experience behind the wheel, but also a very likeable one. This is not the kind of engine that makes a song and dance of the power that it has. Power delivery is smooth throughout and you have this feeling of a reserve of power that you can always tap into. The engine will only show its full might when you really provoke it. 0-100 kph takes a claimed 5.6 seconds and top speed is limited to 250 kph.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift ride and handling  Thing is, the Q8 is the kind of car that has a calming effect on you, which is also a function of its excellent refinement. Refinement is really good, you won't hear much from the engine bay at average city speeds and even road and wind noise are really well contained. There is one notable change under the skin though. The Q8 is now only available with steel springs, you don't get an option of air suspension as you did before. Does that mean ride comfort is a compromise? Absolutely not. It rounds off the bumps really well, it doesn't feel as stiff-kneed as some of the other European luxury rivals and mind you that it's doing all that it does on large 21-inch rims. The Q8 prioritises comfort over driver engagement and there's really nothing wrong with that approach. Even with steel springs, it rounds off the bumps really well. The Q8 comes across as a smooth operator in the corners as well, it's not the most dynamic SUV even with its steering and suspension set to their sportiest, but for something so large and so heavy, you still will have quite a bit of fun in the corners. Body control is good and so are grip levels, helped in no small measure by Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system. For max driver thrills, you'll have to wait for the updated version of the fire-breathing RS Q8 that should come to India early next year. 2024 Audi Q8 facelift price and verdict So that, in a nutshell, is the 2024 Audi Q8. Priced at 1.17 crore rupees ex-showroom, it slots in between the outgoing Q8 and Q8 Celebration variant. Also, with the BMW X6 currently not on sale in India and the Mercedes GLE Coupe only sold in AMG form at a much higher price point, the Q8 sits in a sweet spot in the luxury SUV market. The right way to look at a Q8 would be as a fashionable alternative to a BMW X5 or Mercedes GLE. Yes, the update should have filled in the blanks with added features, but the rest of the package remains likeable as ever. So, just as before, for an SUV that's all about size and glamour, the Q8 still offers much to win you over. Also see:   Audi Q8 facelift launched at Rs 1.17 crore",
