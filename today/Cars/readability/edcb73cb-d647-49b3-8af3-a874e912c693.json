  "description": "Welcome to Ibiza, the playground of millionaires and billionaires, and the perfect setting to test something as exclusive—and expensive—as the Mercedes-Maybach SL 680. But this isn’t just another Maybach. In fact, it’s a piece of history reborn: for the first time since the 1930s SW38, Maybach has ventured into two-door territory with this roadster. Customers have been asking for a two-door Maybach for years, and Mercedes' uber-luxury brand has finally delivered. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 design and engineering - 9/10 Built on the bones of the AMG SL 63, the Maybach version reinterprets the sporty roadster into something far more indulgent. What really stands out are the exclusive Maybach colours. Our test cars came in a rich, garnet red inspired by pomegranate, and an elegant two-tone combination of obsidian black and opalite white that oozed class. There are plenty of shades to choose from, because offering something bespoke is core to any super-luxury brand. Maybach says customers prefer the monogrammed bonnet over the plainer alternative.  The highlight is undoubtedly the “Monogram” bonnet—adorned with dozens of tiny Maybach logos arranged in a repeating pattern (hence the Monogram Series badge), evoking the look of luxury fashion houses like Louis Vuitton. It’s polarising, yes, but Maybach says customers love it. In fact, most buyers choose the monogrammed bonnet over the plainer alternative, which is rarely specified. Maybachs are known for their liberal use of chrome, and the SL 680 doesn’t hold back. The grille, Maybach wordmark, centre bonnet fin, A-pillars, and rear apron all sparkle with polished metal accents. The 21-inch multi-spoke alloys are a Maybach-exclusive Another standout feature is the pair of bespoke, Maybach-exclusive 21-inch alloy wheels. You can choose between an elegant multi-spoke design or a dramatic five-spoke monobloc pattern that looks absolutely stunning. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 interior space and comfort - 7/10 Step inside, and it’s a sea of white. The all-white interior—finished in sustainably tanned Nappa leather—feels airy, indulgent, and unmistakably Maybach. Diamond-stitched seats, a dual-tone steering wheel, and Maybach-specific trim patterns give the cabin a luxury yacht-like ambience. White sustainably tanned Nappa leather upholstery feels indulgent and unmistakably Maybach. That said, while the white-only theme looks gorgeous under Ibiza’s sun, it could be a nightmare to maintain in India’s dusty, monsoon-prone environment. And while nearly every other part of the cabin feels bespoke, the central touchscreen—carried over from the AMG SL and even found in the humble C-Class- undercuts the otherwise opulent atmosphere. At this level, a unique interface would’ve made all the difference. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 performance and refinement - 9/10 At its heart is the same 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8, putting out 585hp and 800Nm of torque. But this isn’t about lap times. It’s about wafting, cruising, and making a statement—one that says you’ve arrived, and probably own a villa to park it in front of. A dedicated Maybach drive mode softens throttle response and further smoothens gear shifts. Even in Sport mode, which adds just a hint of sharpness, the ride never turns harsh. The 9-speed torque converter has been recalibrated for leisurely shifts. True, it results in a slightly slower 0–100 km/h time (4.1 seconds versus the AMG SL 63’s 3.6), but what you get in return is a velvet-gloved surge of torque that feels utterly effortless. The drive experience is leisurely and all about making a statement. Make no mistake—the SL 680 is still properly quick. The V8 sounds glorious too—slightly subdued compared to the AMG, but still raspy and full-bodied. Steering has also been retuned with a slower ratio and more relaxed off-centre response—perfect for confident, laid-back cruising on tight European roads or wide Indian expressways alike. The three-layer fabric roof can be raised or lowered in about 16 seconds, even at speeds of up to 50 km/h. With the hood up, refinement is astonishing and you can’t believe you’re in a soft top. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 ride comfort and handling - 8/10 If there’s one area where the Maybach SL 680 truly shines, it’s comfort. The transformation from AMG to Maybach goes far beyond the leather and logos. The suspension has been comprehensively reworked—damping, bushings, springs—all retuned for plushness. The result? Possibly the most comfortable roadster on sale today. The SL 680 is possibly the most comfortable roadster on sale today. The ride is sublime. It absorbs imperfections like few other convertibles can, and it feels as serene with the roof up as it does with it down. Mercedes engineers have even stuffed in over 18kg of sound-deadening material to shut out wind and road noise. The result is astonishing. Even at speed, it's eerily quiet. The handling is calm and composed rather than razor-sharp, and that’s exactly the point. This isn’t a car that eggs you on. It encourages you to slow down, take in the view, and let the world admire you as much as you admire the world. Mercedes-Maybach SL 680 price and verdict - 8/10 Exclusivity defines Maybach, and this SL 680 Monogram Series is no exception—with only three units allocated for India. At Rs 4.2 crore apiece, it certainly isn’t cheap. But what does that kind of exclusivity buy you? It is unnecessarily excessive, but it makes you feel special every time you get in it.  The Maybach SL 680 isn’t just a car—it’s an experience. It fuses the joy of open-top motoring with Maybach’s hallmark craftsmanship. Yes, the monogrammed bonnet may not be to everyone's taste, and the recycled infotainment screen is a rare misstep, but these are minor quibbles in a car that delivers on its brief: to make you feel special every single time you get in. For those fortunate few who can afford it, the Maybach SL 680 is a rolling expression of wealth, taste, and individuality. It's niche, it’s excessive, and it’s entirely unnecessary—but in a good way.
