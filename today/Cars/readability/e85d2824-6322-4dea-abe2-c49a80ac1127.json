  "description": "This 1920 Ace Four is a first-year example that was restored under previous ownership and purchased out of the Otis Chandler Collection by the seller in 2006. It was kept on static display prior to being recommissioned in preparation for the sale by John Bivens of Indian Engineering in Stanton, California. The bike was refinished in blue with gold pinstriping and is powered by a 75ci F-head inline-four mated to a hand-shifted three-speed transmission. Additional equipment includes a cross-braced pullback handlebar, a valanced front fender, a brown leather Troxel seat, and folding footboards as well as a Schebler carburetor, a leading-link fork, 20\" wire-spoke wheels, dual contracting band rear brakes, and a four-into-one exhaust system. Previously listed on BaT in May 2025, this Ace Four is now offered at no reserve in California with the seller's service records and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller's company.",

It was kept on static display prior to being recommissioned in preparation for the sale by John Bivens of Indian Engineering in Stanton, California. The bike was refinished in blue with gold pinstriping and is powered by a 75ci F-head inline-four mated to a hand-shifted three-speed transmission. Additional equipment includes a cross-braced pullback handlebar, a valanced front fender, a brown leather Troxel seat, and folding footboards as well as a Schebler carburetor, a leading-link fork, 20″ wire-spoke wheels, dual contracting band rear brakes, and a four-into-one exhaust system. Previously listed on BaT in May 2025, this Ace Four is now offered at no reserve in California with the seller’s service records and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s company. The bike was refinished in blue with gold pinstriping during the aforementioned restoration. Features include a 3.75-gallon fuel tank with an integral toolbox and a hinged lid as well as a brown leather Troxel seat, a valanced front fender, a chain-guard-mounted tire pump, folding footboards, and a rear-wheel stand. Yellow-painted 20″ rims are mounted with Coker Classic Cycle Clincher Diamond Tread tires. The bike’s sole suspension consists of a leading-link fork with a cartridge-type internal coil spring. Braking is provided by a pair of external contracting bands acting on drums located at opposite ends of the rear hub and actuated independently by left- and right-side foot pedals. There is no front brake nor any instrumentation, therefore true mileage is unknown. The black-finished, cross-braced, pullback handlebar features mechanical cable linkages for a twist-grip spark advance on the left and a twist-grip throttle on the right. The metal-jacketed control cables are sheathed in brown leather where they pass in close proximity to the painted surfaces of the steering neck and fork stems. The unit-construction 75ci F-head inline-four was nominally rated at 20 horsepower when new. It features an aluminum crankcase, an exhaust-jacketed intake manifold, and a Schebler carburetor with a hot air intake tube as well as a Splitdorf magneto, a spring-return kick starter, and a four-into-one exhaust system with a polished heat shield and an exit pipe that passes behind the lower frame rail before terminating in a turned-out tip. The fuel tank, fuel line, and carburetor were cleaned, the valves were checked and set, the spark plugs were replaced, the oil was changed, and the engine was tuned in preparation for the sale. The bike is titled by the number B2365 stamped on the left side of the engine case. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-plate wet clutch operated by either of a foot pedal or a second lever located alongside the gear selector for the hand-shifted three-speed transmission. Final drive is via chain. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
