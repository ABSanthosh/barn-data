We kick off with a modern Ducati Diavel from China, then take a look at the first made-to-order Janus Motorcycles Gryffin 450 scrambler to roll off the Indiana company’s production line. BMW updates the R18 for 2025, while an incredibly rare American-made board tracker pops up at the Mecum Las Vegas auction. Ducati Diavel by Mandrill Garage When Ducati unveiled the new Diavel V4, we knew that the Ducati Diavel V2’s time was limited. To mark the occasion, Ducati China approached Luo Hao and the team at Mandrill Garage to give the V2 a proper sendoff with a bespoke Diavel V2 custom. And what a sendoff it is. The goal was to preserve the original character of the sporty power cruiser but elevate the design to something bold and exclusive. Mandrill took one of the last brand-new Diavel V2s, and promptly stripped it back until just the rolling chassis remained. The rear subframe was replaced with a more relaxed unit from a Ducati XDiavel, then the whole bike was 3D-scanned before the design work could start in earnest. The design was heavily inspired by the iconic DeLorean car, but instead of stainless steel construction for the body panels, the Mandrill team utilized CAD design and 3D printing. The new body panels were painted with a brushed metal effect, which looks incredible. The tail lights are just visible on the back of the seat, with LED lights ingeniously designed to shine through two slits in the tail panels, just under the custom black leather seat. There’s also a small storage compartment beneath the seat to add some utility to this futuristic beast. The black, red, and silver theme is classy and extremely impactful. We didn’t think the Diavel could gain any more street presence—but we’re glad to be proven wrong by one of China’s best custom motorcycle outfits. [Source] Janus Motorcycles Gryffin 450 The Janus Motorcycles team is celebrating the recent rollout of the first production version of their new Gryffin 450. Based in Goshen, Indiana, the company’s craftspeople hand-build motorcycles that are as fun to ride as they are to own. The Gryffin 450 is the company’s scrambler, positioned alongside the road-going Halcyon 450 in the Janus lineup. You’re looking at Gryffin 450 #1—the first made-to-order Gryffin to officially roll off the production line. Up front is a leading link fork with twin Ikon progressive shocks. The front suspension is a Janus signature, as is the handmade steel frame. The wheels measure 21” up front and 18” out back, and use CNC-machined aluminum hubs laced to aluminum rims with stainless steel spokes. The Gryffin’s scrambler-esque bodywork (which is all made in-house) includes a high-mount front fender, a round headlight with a small alloy windscreen, and aluminum-backed hand guards. The short tank is backed up by a long, flat scrambler-style seat, and the lucky owner of Gryffin 450 #001 specced it with a svelte luggage rack. Janus doesn’t make their engines themselves—but if this one looks familiar, that’s because it’s a Honda XR400-derived powerplant built by SWM. The old XR400 was perfectly at home on the dirt, so it’s rather fitting that Janus chose to power their new scrambler with the classic thumper. A twin stainless steel exhaust exits high on the left, with black exhaust shields and an aluminum bash plate adding a few more rugged touches. Nostalgic lines and classic made-in-America good looks are just two things we like about the Janus Gryffin 450. Honestly, there’s not much we don’t like about it. [Source] 2025 BMW R18 BMW has just pulled the covers off the revised 2025 R18 lineup, featuring a raft of subtle changes. The 1,802 cc air- and oil-cooled boxer twin packs a pantry full of torque into a long, heavy cruiser with stunning vintage styling. While it’s fun to ride, it’s not without its shortcomings—so news of its update intrigued us. The BMW R18 platform has been renewed for 2025 with Euro 5+ compliance across all the bikes. Power is largely the same at 91 hp, but peak torque has been increased by 5 Nm to a whopping 163 Nm at 3,000 rpm. (BMW says there is over 150 Nm of torque present at any point from 2,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm.) The base model BMW R18 gets the most changes for 2025. Gone are its burly fork shrouds—which was something we rather liked. The front and rear fenders are new, and the chunky 16” rear wheel has been traded for an 18” unit. Whether that will improve the R18’s woefully limited corner clearance remains to be seen. The R18’s laced rims have been replaced by cast wheels, with the original 19F/16R laced hoops available as an optional extra. The wheels are black out-of-the-box, but there’s a contrast-cut option that lets some of the metal shine through. More importantly, the R18’s mufflers have been updated with a circular cross-section design that replaces the old comically large ‘fishtail’ units. The seat has thicker padding, more ergonomic contouring, and a new push-button release system. The rear suspension has been tweaked and a daytime running light has been added (in certain markets). Another notable update is the addition of ‘Blacked Out’ models to the R18 and R18 Classic catalogs. As implied, those come with exactly zero ounces of chrome, sporting all-black powertrains instead. There’s no denying that the face-lifted BMW R18 looks sharper, but have its road manners improved? Only time will tell. [Source] Auction: 1915 Cyclone roadster Mecum’s annual Las Vegas motorcycle auction kicks off this week, with this extremely rare 1915 Cyclone V-Twin as one of its headline attractions. It forms part of the late Urban S. Hirsch III’s extensive collection of vintage bikes, about 100 of which are going on sale in Las Vegas. And considering we once saw a Cyclone sell for $520,000, it should fetch a pretty penny. Cyclone was an American company that only produced motorcycles for three years, making original examples of their machines extremely sought after. What counted though, was that they were fast. The Cyclone engine was a 996 cc V-twin, with overhead camshafts driven by a vertical shaft via bevel gears. It made 45 hp and could hit speeds of over 100 mph—bonkers numbers for the time. Naturally, it found fame on the board track racing circuit of the time. This particular 1915-model Cyclone roadster was meticulously restored by famed vintage motorcycle expert Stephen Wright. Resplendent in bright yellow paint (a signature of the Cyclone brand) it looks factory fresh—even though it’s nearly 110 years old. It’s believed that there are no more than 14 Cyclones in the wild today, making this vintage machine about as rare as it gets. Tempted? [Source]",
