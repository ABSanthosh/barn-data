  "description": "This 1993 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 coupe was modified by Singer Vehicle Design between 2015 and 2016. The “Fiona Commission” spent time in the United Arab Emirates before it changed hands in 2019 and returned to the US, where it was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025. Finished in paint-to-sample non-metallic Midnight Blue, the car is powered by an Ed Pink-built 4.0L flat-six that drives the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include carbon-fiber body panels, individual throttle bodies with velocity stacks, Öhlins adjustable shock absorbers, Brembo cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with body-color calipers, staggered-width 17” Fuchs-style forged aluminum wheels with nickel-plated spoke accents, carbon bucket seats, Espresso and Cognac leather-weave interior trim, a laminated-wood shift knob, a padded leather-trimmed roll bar, air conditioning, power windows, and an upgraded sound system with a Becker radio and a Parrot infotainment unit. This Singer-modified 964 is now offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean New York title.",

  "text": "This 1993 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 coupe was modified by Singer Vehicle Design between 2015 and 2016. The “Fiona Commission” spent time in the United Arab Emirates before it changed hands in 2019 and returned to the US, where it was purchased by the selling dealer in 2025. Finished in paint-to-sample non-metallic Midnight Blue, the car is powered by an Ed Pink-built 4.0L flat-six that drives the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include carbon-fiber body panels, individual throttle bodies with velocity stacks, Öhlins adjustable shock absorbers, Brembo cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with body-color calipers, staggered-width 17” Fuchs-style forged aluminum wheels with nickel-plated spoke accents, carbon bucket seats, Espresso and Cognac leather-weave interior trim, a laminated-wood shift knob, a padded leather-trimmed roll bar, air conditioning, power windows, and an upgraded sound system with a Becker radio and a Parrot infotainment unit. This Singer-modified 964 is now offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean New York title. Los Angeles-based Singer Vehicle Design was founded by former Catherine Wheel frontman Rob Dickinson in 2009 and specializes in performance-based customizations of 964-series 911s. Each car is stripped to its steel unibody, which receives welding reinforcements before being fitted with carbon-fiber panels including the fenders, bumpers, hood, and rear decklid. Non-sunroof coupes such as this example are also fitted with a carbon-fiber roof. The front spoiler, lower rear valance, and lower rocker panels are composed of black textured urethane. This example is finished in non-metallic Midnight Blue with ghosted side stripes and gold-color “Porsche” lettering. Exterior options include an external fuel filler cap centered in the hood, an external oil filler cap, deleted rear bumperettes, a gold-finished “Singer” badge atop ghosted “Re-imagined” lettering, and gold-finished raised “Porsche” lettering on the rear decklid. Additional Singer touches include a retractable rear spoiler with a tinted acrylic screen beneath the grille, bi-xenon headlights, polycarbonate front lenses, bullet-style side mirrors, and nickel-plated brightwork. A paint protective film was applied over the front surfaces during the build. A chip in the finish on the leading edge of the left front wheel arch is shown up close in the photo gallery below. Fuchs-style forged aluminum wheels feature nickel-plated spokes and matte black webbing and are secured by open lugnuts. Michelin Pilot Sport tires measure 225/45 up front and 265/40 at the rear and show 2020 dates codes. The Brembo brake system was derived from the Porsche 993 Turbo and incorporates drilled and ventilated rotors acted upon by Midnight Blue four-piston calipers with black Porsche lettering. The suspension features Öhlins adjustable dampers at all four corners. The cabin houses carbon bucket seats trimmed in Cognac leather with leather-weave inserts and brass grommets over the seating surfaces, while matching woven leather covers the door panels and rear surfaces. Espresso leather trims the dashboard and door caps, while the sills, center tunnel, and rear seat pan are painted in Midnight Blue. Options include piano black seatbacks, a padded roll bar trimmed in Cognac leather with white stitching, a beige headliner, leather side-bolster shields, a laminated-wood shift knob, deleted rear seatbacks, and an upgraded sound system that includes a Becker radio, a Parrot infotainment unit, and a subwoofer mounted in the left rear seat position. Quilted Cognac leather with white stitching accents the front compartment. The MOMO Prototipo steering wheel sits ahead of early-style green-letter instrumentation including an 11k-rpm tachometer, a 190-mph speedometer, and a combination gauge monitoring oil pressure and oil temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 3,200 miles since the Singer build, approximately 25 of which have been added under current ownership. The air-cooled, naturally aspirated flat-six was rebuilt to a displacement of 4.0 liters by Ed Pink Racing Engines of Los Angeles, California, and it was rated by Singer at 390 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Custom components are said to include the crankshaft, pistons, cylinders, connecting rods, camshafts, cylinder heads, oil pump, and intake system, the latter of which features individual throttle bodies topped by velocity stacks that were added after the initial build. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. A list of the car’s Singer build options is provided above. The Carfax report is free of accidents from its first entry in 1993. An odometer discrepancy is noted in 2020 after the Singer build. You are not connected to real-time updates.
