This Streetfighter V4 Lamborghini is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment in Missouri with manufacturer’s literature, factory accessories, and a clean Oklahoma title. Finished in the Lamborghini hues of Citrea Green and Dac Orange with black accents and exposed carbon-fiber trim, the bike features a front fender inspired by the STO’s one-piece cofango (hood and fenders) as well as aerodynamic winglets integrated into the fuel tank side covers. Air extractors on the chin spoiler and tailpiece refer to the STO’s rear brake cooling intakes and hood vents, respectively. Equipment includes a black solo saddle, articulated brake and shift pedals, and a 4.5-gallon fuel tank with a Ducati by Rizoma billet aluminum fuel filler cap as well as Ducati by Rizoma adjustable rear-set foot controls. STO-inspired 17″ cross-spoke alloy wheels, the rear of which is retained by a titanium lock nut, are finished in black and mounted with Pirelli Diablo Rosso IV Corsa tires. Braking is handled by Brembo Stylema R four-piston monobloc calipers over dual 330mm drilled discs up front and a two-piston Brembo caliper over a single 245mm drilled disc out back, and the bike is equipped with Cornering ABS EVO. Semi-active Öhlins adjustable suspension is provided by a NIX-30 fork, a TTX36 monoshock mounted to the single-sided aluminum swingarm, and a steering damper controlled by the second generation Öhlins Smart EC 2.0 system with an event-based operating system. The black-finished handlebar is equipped with billet aluminum Brembo lever assemblies, dual mirrors, and bar-end weights. It fronts a carbon-fiber dash cover housing a configurable 5″ TFT screen with displays for a digital speedometer, a virtual circular tachometer with a 15k-rpm redline, and additional operational information. The integrated electronics suite includes riding and power modes as well as Ducati ABS, traction, wheelie, slide, and engine brake controls. The digital odometer indicates 3 miles. A metal plate inset to the carbon-fiber panel atop the fuel tank indicates this bike is number 152 of 630 units produced. The liquid-cooled 1,103cc Desmosedici Stradale V4 features a rearward-rotating crankshaft, four desmodromically actuated valves per cylinder, electronic fuel injection with two injectors per cylinder, ride-by-wire elliptical throttle bodies, and an Akrapovič titanium silencer with dual outlets and carbon-fiber endcaps. Factory-rated output was 208 horsepower at 13k rpm. The selling dealer notes that the service light is on due to the bike having never been serviced. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a hydraulically actuated slipper dry clutch with an open carbon-fiber cover and a self-bleeding master cylinder as well as a six-speed gearbox with Ducati Quick Shift (DQS) up/down EVO2.
