The automaker recently held the “Honda 0 Tech Meeting 2024,” during which it announced a slew of new tech and design features it said would reach buyers through new EV models planned for release in the next few years. Honda introduced five core values that it said would guide its efforts:Artistic design that resonates with peopleAutomated driving and advanced driver assistance systems that ensure safety and peace of mindNew value of EVs as a “space” for people The joy of driving with the feeling of oneness with the vehicleOutstanding electric efficiency and performanceThe automaker debuted two new concept vehicles in the 0 Series, a saloon (sedan) and Space Hub (an SUV with CR-V-like features). Honda said it would introduce seven new 0 Series vehicles by 2030, with the first models scheduled to reach the market in 2026. Honda’s new EVs land on a dedicated platform that will enable “thin and light” vehicle designs. Everything from the battery packs to the electric motors follow that mentality, and the automaker noted that the design “stabilizes vehicle behavior and enables a sporty driving.”The company will incorporate active aerodynamics, novel manufacturing techniques, and Level 3 driving assistance systems. Honda said its goal is to become the first automaker to “expand the application of eyes-off functions to all driving situations and provide safer AD/ADAS which offer greater peace of mind for the customers.”[Images: Honda]Become a TTAC insider.
