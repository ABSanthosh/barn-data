  "text": "Mar 19, 2025 4:00 PM EDTLeasing can be better than buying Leasing a vehicle can be an economical way to drive a new car without the long-term commitment of ownership. There are more attractive lease choices out there than ever before and manufacturers are offering leases on high trims, as well. As of March 2025, several manufacturers are offering attractive lease deals that combine affordability with desirable features. Below are four of the most cost-effective automotive lease deals available this month. 1. 2025 Kia K4 Don’t say sedans are dead because the Kia K4 is one seriously compelling compact sedan with gobs of style and tech. It borrows edgy styling from its K9 EV SUV sibling, and the airy interior upends what an economy sedan should feel like inside. The K4’s base engine is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 147 horsepower mated to a CVT.  Standard equipment on the LXS trim includes features such as heated side mirrors, twin 12.3-inch screens for instrumentation and infotainment, wireless Apple CarPlay \u0026 Android Auto, a smart trunk, and a slew of high-end safety tech.  The purchase price of a Kia K4 LXS is just $22,990, but the lease offering makes it even more approachable. This month, Kia is offering a lease deal of $209 a month for 24 months, with $3,499 due at signing. This lease deal only applies to the 2025 Kia K4 LXS front-wheel drive. Learn more here. 2. 2025 Nissan Sentra If you’re searching for a no-nonsense but still attractive compact sedan, now is the time to lease a 2025 Nissan Sentra. This compact sedan offers a balance of style, comfort, and efficiency. Powered by a 149-hp four-cylinder engine mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission, the Sentra won’t set your hair on fire, but it will give you 34 mpg in combined driving. The Sentra SV comes standard with 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, an 8-inch color touchscreen infotainment system, a 7-inch digital instrument cluster, and adaptive cruise control.  This month’s lease deal applies to the second-tier Sentra SV, which sports more style than the base S trim. Nissan will have you pay a mere $229 per month for 39 months, with $2,499 due at signing. Learn more here.  3. 2025 Hyundai Venue The diminutive 2025 Hyundai Venue is a subcompact SUV that combines practicality with a touch of style and is known for its compact dimensions and urban-friendly design. Every Venue trim level gets a user-friendly 8.0-inch color touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The Venue also gets praise for roominess that belies its small exterior size, and the large physical controls make it easy to operate. The 121-horsepower four-cylinder engine isn’t powerful, but it offers 33 mpg highway for good fuel economy.  The purchase price of $20,200 is definitely approachable for most folks, but an excellent lease offering of $239 a month for 36 months with $3,499 due at lease signing can surely draw in customers looking for a low payment and a short commitment. Learn more here.  4. 2025 Chevrolet Trax We never expected to love the new Trax as much as we did. Not only does it look pricier than its $20,500 base MSRP, but it also has precise and communicative steering that befits a sports car. Every Trax is powered by a 137-horsepower 3-cylinder engine, but its low power is partially offset by its wonderful driving experience. The midpack Trax LT comes with standard features like 17-inch machined aluminum wheels, an 11-inch diagonal color touch-screen, an 8-inch diagonal color instrument cluster, wireless smartphone integration, remote vehicle start, and automatic climate controls. The current lease deal applies to the Trax LT. The purchase price is $23,995, but a lease of $299 per month for 24 months with $1,879 due at signing improves its affordability even more. It’s not the lowest monthly lease payment for a compact SUV, but the low signing price is in its favor. You get a stylish, fun, and practical SUV for a great monthly price. Learn more here.  Final thoughts Leasing presents an attractive option for car shoppers who want affordable payments, low commitment, and a warranty throughout the life of ownership. As always, read the lease’s fine print and be aware of the down payment, the length of the lease term, mileage limits, and your options and potential penalties at the end of the lease. By carefully evaluating these deals and considering your personal driving habits and financial goals, you can secure a lease that offers both value and satisfaction. You might even get the car you really want versus a car that you feel compelled to lease.",

Every Venue trim level gets a user-friendly 8.0-inch color touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The Venue also gets praise for roominess that belies its small exterior size, and the large physical controls make it easy to operate. The 121-horsepower four-cylinder engine isn’t powerful, but it offers 33 mpg highway for good fuel economy. \u003c/p\u003e\n            \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp data-wp-block=\"{\u0026#34;dropCap\u0026#34;:false}\" data-wp-block-name=\"core/paragraph\"\u003eThe purchase price of $20,200 is definitely approachable for most folks, but an excellent lease offering of $239 a month for 36 months with $3,499 due at lease signing can surely draw in customers looking for a low payment and a short commitment.

Not only does it look pricier than its $20,500 base MSRP, but it also has precise and communicative steering that befits a sports car. Every Trax is powered by a 137-horsepower 3-cylinder engine, but its low power is partially offset by its wonderful driving experience. The midpack Trax LT comes with standard features like 17-inch machined aluminum wheels, an 11-inch diagonal color touch-screen, an 8-inch diagonal color instrument cluster, wireless smartphone integration, remote vehicle start, and automatic climate controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n            \n        \n            \n        \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp data-wp-block=\"{\u0026#34;dropCap\u0026#34;:false}\" data-wp-block-name=\"core/paragraph\"\u003eThe current lease deal applies to the Trax LT. The purchase price is $23,995, but a lease of $299 per month for 24 months with $1,879 due at signing improves its affordability even more. It’s not the lowest monthly lease payment for a compact SUV, but the low signing price is in its favor. You get a stylish, fun, and practical SUV for a great monthly price.

As always, read the lease’s fine print and be aware of the down payment, the length of the lease term, mileage limits, and your options and potential penalties at the end of the lease. By carefully evaluating these deals and considering your personal driving habits and financial goals, you can secure a lease that offers both value and satisfaction. You might even get the car you really want versus a car that you feel compelled to lease. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
