  "text": "Sure, it looks like a VW MKI Rabbit but it'll cost its next owner six figures May 26, 2025 at 21:12 by Stephen Rivers This 1995 Range Rover is missing two doors and a roof, but it’s all style. Power comes from a 4.0-liter V8 paired with a 4-speed automatic gearbox. It’s expected to sell for a six-figure sum, with estimates reaching up to $125K. Making a serious impact on a swanky beach like those you’ll find in Nantucket requires something special. Rolling up in a Mercedes-Benz G-Class, even a convertible one, won’t be all that shocking. People have seen those before. What will definitely turn heads is this: a 1995 Land Rover Range Rover with two doors missing and no roof. Now that’s a ride that’ll leave people staring. That’s right, a legendary customization company in Germany, Styling Garage, created the SUV that Land Rover wouldn’t. Well, to be fair, Land Rover did build the drop-top Evoque years later, so maybe this was a bit of inspiration. That said, Styling Garage is the same brand that inspired other cool modified cars and built many itself. Read: The Muscle Car Market Just Sent A Brutal Message To New Hellcat Holdouts This SUV appears as though it’s a very high-quality build, even if it sort of looks like a VW Rabbit now. The uneducated might very well believe this to be a production vehicle. The cabin is unchanged from the original as well. Under the hood rests a 4.0-liter V8 that sends power to all four wheels via a four-speed automatic gearbox. While the auction house, RM Sotheby’s, doesn’t have a description of the vehicle at the time of listing, it evidently rides on an unchanged wheelbase, according to one post on Instagram. Photos RM Sotheby’s If that’s the case, then Styling Garage really managed to pull off something special here. To the eye, this SUV looks shorter than the original. That said, it does appear to have the same general distance between each row. It’s unclear when the work happened, but the car has been in the U.S. since 1995 based on its CarFax report. Now, for the really fun part: the auction. If you’ve got a spare six figures lying around, you can own this strange, but undeniably cool, Land Rover. The auction will be held in Costa Mesa, California, between May 28 and June 3, and RM Sotheby’s expects the final bid to fall somewhere between $100,000 and $125,000. Sure, it’s a lot of money, but think of it this way – wherever you go, you’ll definitely be the only person with a Range Rover that looks like it was built in a fever dream.
