  "description": "The Toyota Innova Hycross has been a popular choice not just for private buyers but also for fleet owners. According to the latest update, customers booking the Innova Hycross petrol can get their vehicle in around six months, while the more sought-after petrol-hybrid variants can be delivered in around eight months. While these waiting periods may seem high, not too long ago, buyers had to wait for close to a year. Top-spec Hycross ZX has a waiting period of under six months  Not too long ago, the waiting periods were as high as nearly a year Toyota has been adjusting production capacity for the Innova Hycross depending on demand. The company had paused bookings for the top-spec ZX and ZX(O) variants earlier this year due to “overwhelming demand”. However, bookings for these variants resumed in August. The demand for Innova Hycross petrol-hybrid remains comparatively higher, and a majority of the production capacity has been allotted for the petrol-hybrid iteration, say sources.   Toyota Hycross waiting period at dealer level While the above waiting periods have been released by Toyota, according to a quick check with some of the dealers, both petrol and hybrid variants are being delivered sooner than what the company has conveyed.    For example, Innova Hycross petrol variants are being delivered at most outlets within 45 days to two months at most. Also, waiting periods for the Innova Hycross hybrid vary depending on the variant.
