  "description": "This 1989 Porsche 911 Speedster is one of 823 US-market examples produced for the model year, and it was purchased in October 2004 by the current owner, who has since added 7k of the 52k miles shown. The car was refinished in Black in 2022, and the interior was refreshed in February 2025. It is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a G50 five-speed manual transaxle, and additional equipment includes 16\" Fuchs alloy wheels, Koni shocks, a black soft top, a fiberglass twin-hump convertible-top cover panel, a power-adjustable driver's seat, a Blaupunkt Las Vegas CD stereo, Blaupunkt speakers, air conditioning, and fog lights. This 911 Speedster is now offered in Texas on dealer consignment with an owner's manual, partial service records, a 2022 appraisal report, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title.",

The car was refinished in Black in 2022, and the interior was refreshed in February 2025. It is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a G50 five-speed manual transaxle, and additional equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, Koni shocks, a black soft top, a fiberglass twin-hump convertible-top cover panel, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a Blaupunkt Las Vegas CD stereo, Blaupunkt speakers, air conditioning, and fog lights. This 911 Speedster is now offered in Texas on dealer consignment with an owner’s manual, partial service records, a 2022 appraisal report, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title. The car features widened rear bodywork shared with the contemporary 911 Turbo, a fiberglass twin-hump convertible-top rear deck, and a shortened windscreen and side windows compared to the standard Carrera. This example is finished in Black and was refinished in January 2022. Xpel protective film was subsequently applied to the front bumper, hood, mirrors, and fenders. The side mirror control switch and the hood and decklid struts were replaced in December 2024. There are tears in the soft top, and patches have been applied to the underside of the fabric. Staggered-width 16″ Fuchs wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires that were installed in June 2022. Braking is handled by black Porsche-script calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The car was equipped with front and rear Koni shocks in December 2024, at which time the spring plate bushings were replaced. The cabin features a power-adjustable driver’s seat and a passenger sport seat trimmed in black leather, both of which were re-dyed in February 2025. The shift knob was refurbished, and the interior was refreshed at the same time. Features include a Blaupunkt Las Vegas CD stereo, Blaupunkt speakers, and air conditioning. The Speedster was not equipped with rear seats. In January 2025, the leather-wrapped steering wheel was redyed, and the gauges were reconditioned with replacement glass and bezels. The six-digit odometer shows 52k miles, approximately 7k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.2-liter flat-six features Bosch fuel injection and was factory-rated at 215 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. An August 2022 appraisal report is viewable in the gallery. The oil was changed and the windshield washer pump was replaced in December 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a G50 five-speed manual transaxle. The Carfax report is free of accidents and other damage, and it lists an initial entry in December 1993. The Illinois title carries a “Corrected” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates.
