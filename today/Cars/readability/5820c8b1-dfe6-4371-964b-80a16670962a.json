  "description": "This '32 Ford was built by Larry Grobe of VooDoo Larry Kustoms. The car is built around a '32 frame with a Brookville roadster body, and power comes from a 221ci flathead V8 sourced from a '49 Ford linked to a 350 Turbo automatic and a Winters quick-change rear end. It rides on a modified suspension with products from Speedway Motors, a dropped axle, and rear coilovers, front brakes sourced from a '39 Lincoln, and '39 Dodge front wheels. Other details include an aluminum radiator, a Duvall windshield, E\u0026J headlights, a '50s sprint car steering wheel, a custom exhaust system, a Gennie shifter, and more as described below. Acquired by the current owner in 2022, this '32 hot rod is now offered on dealer consignment with handwritten build notes and a clean Illinois title.",

The car is built around a ’32 frame with a Brookville roadster body, and power comes from a 221ci flathead V8 sourced from a ’49 Ford linked to a 350 Turbo automatic and a Winters quick-change rear end. It rides on a modified suspension with products from Speedway Motors, a dropped axle, and rear coilovers, front brakes sourced from a ’39 Lincoln, and ’39 Dodge front wheels. Other details include an aluminum radiator, a Duvall windshield, E\u0026J headlights, a ’50s sprint car steering wheel, a custom exhaust system, a Gennie shifter, and more as described below. Acquired by the current owner in 2022, this ’32 hot rod is now offered on dealer consignment with handwritten build notes and a clean Illinois title. VooDoo Larry Kustoms built the car utilizing a ’32 frame, a ’32 grille, and a Brookville roadster body, and it was painted by Paint Spot. The Duvall winshield was sourced from Speedway Motors, the headlights are ’27 E\u0026Js, and the taillights are from a ’36 Chrysler. The car also has an Indian-sourced horn and fog lights. The ’39 Dodge front wheels measure 20″, and the high-clearance rear wheels are 18″s. They were all powdercoated to match the body. The suspension is comprised of a ’50s Mor Drop front axle, ’36 Ford radius rods, and ’40 Ford wishbones, and the front shocks, transverse leaf spring, and rear coilovers were sourced from Speedway Motors. A ’56 Ford F-1 steering rack and column were utilized along with ’39 Lincoln front brakes. The louvered lid is accented by green fourishes and the signature of Larry Grobe, and an aluminum fuel tank is mounted in the trunk. Mapes Auto Upholstery retrimmed the interior, and the glasswork was done by Glass Guy Chicago. The 1920s-era gauge panel holds AutoMeter gauges. The shifter is from Gennie, and the steering wheel was reportedly sourced from a 1950s sprint car. The 221ci flathead V8 was sourced from a ’49 Ford and rebuilt with an Eddie Meyer intake and heads. The headers and wiring harness are from Speedway Motors, and Fox Valley Hot Rods tuned the engine. The Winters quick-change rear end is linked to the Turbo 350 automatic by a custom driveshaft from Suburban Driveline. Handwritten notes attributed to Larry Grobe are included. The seller and owner cannot locate the VIN on the car, and the builder believes it was painted over during the build. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
