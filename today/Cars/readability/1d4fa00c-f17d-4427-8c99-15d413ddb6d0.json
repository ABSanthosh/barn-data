It's an electric car, yet small dimensions don’t mean a small range here: in big-battery form, it will go up to 229 miles between charges. Hyundai claims that the Inster isn't tied to the A or B segment, having been designed to sit in the middle of both.  It's an interesting and quite different proposition to the norm, then, in being a small car on the outside but doing an impression of a larger one in its equipment levels and pricing.  Such cars have a track record of success in being small yet with a premium price, the Honda E coming to recent memory to that end. Still, any preservation of small cars is to be welcomed, particularly one as unique in its positioning as the Inster.  Our first taste of Hyundai's smallest EV came last November in its native South Korea. Now we’ve sampled it in right-hand-drive form to see how it stacks up against the Citroën ë-C3, Renault 5 and more. Verdict EV is boldly positioned and ambitiously priced yet backed into a corner in how niche its positioning is. GoodFantastic interior versatility and flexibilityCompact dimensions make it great around townGood equipment levels – but you do pay for it BadExpensive compared to rivals, especially those from the B-segmentWeight dulls handling and performance Some interior trim feels cheap and infotainment system can be sluggish DESIGN \u0026 STYLING Pros Compact dimensionsDistinctive visual character Cons Styling will be divisive Bigger than A-segment rivals The Inster is loosely based on the petrol-engined Hyundai Casper that has been sold in Korea since 2021, but its platform has been stretched and overhauled to accommodate a battery and an electric motor.Despite this, it's still really small, measuring 3.8m in length and 1.6m wide, making the car shorter and narrower than its French rivals.And the Inster’s compact dimensions have been cleverly disguised by chunky wheel arches and short overhangs that give it a pseudo-SUV aesthetic.Mechanically, it's very simple: a front-mounted electric motor powers the front wheels while there's MacPherson-strut suspension at the front and coupled torsion-beam axle at the rear.The Hyundai Inster range at a glanceThree trims and two battery options are available.The Standard Range model is powered by a 42kWh battery and 95bhp front-mounted electric motor for a 203-mile range, while the Long Range model gets a larger, 49kWh battery and a 113bhp motor for a 229-mile range.Then you can choose between 01, 02 and Cross trims, with prices starting from £23,495.  INTERIOR Pros Superb versatilityOption to choose between a bigger boot or more rear leg roomRobust and durable feel to the cabin Cons UK denied leather trim optionSome materials lack qualityNo wireless Apple CarPlay or Android Auto Move inside and you might mistake the Inster for an SUV: its concave roof means there’s plenty of head room for adults front and rear, while leg room in the back is practically limo-like.You can’t escape how narrow the car is, however, so taller and broad-shouldered passengers might not find it all that roomy up front.The seat bases are shallow and the backrests lack a bit of lumbar support, but the fixed armrest offers some comfort and the cupholders that sit underneath are handy.Such generous passenger space limits the boot capacity to 280 litres, but you can slide the two rear seats forwards independently to increase the volume. You can even fold down the front pair to store longer items or lie down and take a nap.The 10.25in touchscreen infotainment system is easy enough to use but not as intuitive as the Google-based set-up in the 5.Furthermore, it can be a little sluggish to respond to inputs and its Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality isn’t wireless.The digital dash is graphically strong and customisable. And for all the touchscreen-dominated cars we test these days, it’s refreshing to step down into a small EV and have a neat cluster of large, tactile physical buttons to prod and poke.You don’t need to take your eyes off the road to adjust the fan speed or temperature and the row of buttons for the touchscreen are useful for function-hopping on the move.The plastic on the doors, dash and lower down by your feet may feel cheap, but there’s a robustness to the cabin that suits the Inster’s vibe and cloth-like material on various touchpoints adds a premium air.Ultimately the interior feels like its been thought about and created specifically for the inster, rather than simply being a scaled up or saled down version on of Ioniq EV's interior.  ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE Pros Nippy off the lineQuiet and refined Cons Acceleration soon tails off Very one-dimensional to drive With just 113bhp and 1423kg to haul along, the Inster feels sluggish and takes more than 10sec to hit 60mph.In Normal mode, acceleration off the line tails off pretty quickly, and it only feels nippy around rown – but given that’s where the Inster will likely spend most of its time, that’s understandable.There’s a modicum of additional zip if you put it in Sport mode, but overall the Inster feels like a car in which to make steady progress.A reason it feels so slow when the speeds get above around 30-40mph is the weight. The Inster is more than 400kg heavier than the i10 – a huge amount.This means it lacks the pep of the i10 and leads to an overall dynamic impression that's a bit dull and laboured.Control weights are good and it was easy to adjust the regenerative braking with the paddles behind the steering wheel.  RIDE \u0026 HANDLING Pros Narrowness a boon around townPredictable handlingMature-feeling and comfortable at higher speeds Cons Handling is numb and lacks communicationFeels heavy For city-scything jaunts, the Inster is the ideal companion. It's generally pliant, soaks up lumps and bumps well and only seems to come unstuck over larger potholes and severe imperfections.Like the best small cars, it's narrow, allowing you to nip around urban back streets and gaps in the traffic with ease; there's more than enough room to move around in a lane. For its size, the car is surprisingly mature out on the open road too, and while there’s more jounce and head toss on country roads, it feels controlled and pleasant to drive.Even on a motorway at higher speeds it feels mature, feeling less dwarfed in motorway running than an i10. There’s plenty of grip through the corners (my test car’s 17in wheels wore Michelin Pilot Sport 5 rubber) and the body is kept well in check. I would, however, like a bit more feedback from the slow-geared steering, which is a bit numb.There’s little verve or agility to the way the Inster drives, however, which raises an important point about small electric cars. So much of the joy that is found in driving a small petrol car is borne from how light they are. There's greater intereaction, too, because most come fitted with is manual gearbox. The weight of the battery and a single-speed transmission negates most of that in the Inster, and it lacks any real memorable character as a result.  MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS Pros Good real-world rangeImpressive standard kit Cons Expensive next to rivals No cheaper trim levels With the 42kWh battery, 01 trim starts from £23,495. While that makes the Inster some £1500 dearer than the ë-C3, it gets a lot more standard kit, including a heat pump, a pair of 10.25in digital displays for the infotainment and instruments and adaptive cruise control.The 49kWh battery (for a 229-mile range) raises the price to £25,055.For £1700 more, you can have the range-topping 02 trim, which adds heated seats and a heated steering wheel. Or for £28,775, Cross trim gives the Inster a 4x4-inspired makeover.The entry-level Inster is a good £8500 more than the ever so slightly shorter Dacia Spring, albeit the Hyundai is much more sophisticated, better equipped and has more range. The Renault 5 is the biggest elephant in the room, with near price parity for short- and long-range versions and all that style to go with it, while still being a small car with a premium feel. Satisfyingly, the Inster is competitively efficient: over extended testing, our car regularly matched the official economy figure of 4.1mpkWh.The Inster has a peak charging rate of up to 85kW, which means a 10-80% charge should take around 30 minutes.  VERDICT Verdict EV is boldly positioned and ambitiously priced yet backed into a corner in how niche its positioning is. GoodFantastic interior versatility and flexibilityCompact dimensions make it great around townGood equipment levels – but you do pay for it BadExpensive compared to rivals, especially those from the B-segmentWeight dulls handling and performance Some interior trim feels cheap and infotainment system can be sluggish There’s a lot to like about the Inster: it has a good range, a comfortable ride and an excellent interior that majors on versatility and space.But while it might be a more tempting proposition than A-segment EVs like the Fiat 500e, its niche positioning and ambitious pricing make it less competitive when pitched against the 5. It feels mature at higher speeds while lacking the character you would expect at lower speeds, and it packs in plenty of equipment into such a small package, rather than feeling entry level in where it is pitched. It has the versatility of much larger cars inside too. Ultimately, buyers are going to need to be convinced that being small is a premium worth paying for, and Hyundai and the Inster would need to buck an age-old trend to do so.If it had the charm and character of an i10 in the way it drove, the Inster might make a better case for itself. As it stands, buyers are really going to need to find value in its equipment levels and eschew many petrol rivals, let alone electric ones like the 5.
