  "description": "This 1963 Shelby Cobra is one of 126 Mark I examples produced and is said to have arrived in Los Angeles in the spring of 1963 before being invoiced to Coventry Motors of Walnut Creek, California, that June. Chassis 2095 was purchased from its first known owner in Oregon in 1972 by another Oregon owner before undergoing two color changes, the installation of a newer dual-carb engine, and the addition of fender flares and wider wheels over the ensuing decade. The car was purchased in 1981 by a steward who retained it for 20 years before it was sold in 2003 to a Florida owner who subsequently commissioned a refurbishment by marque specialist Mike McCluskey in California that included the removal of the fender flares. It was reportedly driven in various tours before being purchased by another owner in 2018 and then being sold to a Qatari collection in 2020. It was purchased by its current owner and relocated to Van Nuys, California, in 2024. Finished in black, the car is powered by a 289ci Ford V8 that is topped by twin Carter four-barrel carburetors and is mated to a four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include transverse leaf-spring suspension, worm-and-roller steering, four-wheel disc brakes, bright 15” wire wheels, a hood scoop, dual rear-exit exhaust with chrome tips, red leather upholstery, and a black convertible top with matching side curtains. This Cobra 289 is recorded in the 2019 SAAC registry and is now offered by the seller on behalf of its current owner with a tool kit and a clean California title.",

This Cobra 289 is recorded in the 2019 SAAC registry and is now offered by the seller on behalf of its current owner with a tool kit and a clean California title. After his retirement from competitive driving due to a heart condition, Carroll Shelby shifted his focus to an endeavor to create a European-style sports car with American V8 power. In 1961, Shelby secured a partnership with AC Cars in Surrey, UK, to build a variant of the AC Ace that would be completed by Shelby in the US with engines supplied by the Ford Motor Company. The resultant Cobra model was introduced in 1962, with the first 75 examples powered by a 260ci powerplant before production shifted to the use of Ford’s 289ci unit. Originally finished in red, this example is said to have been refinished in dark blue as of 1974 before another color change to black and the additional of fender flares by the early 1980s. The early-2000s refurbishment included the removal of fender flares and an additional repaint in black. Features include front and rear bumpers with guards, fenders free of vents, a driver-side mirror, adjustable wind wings, and flat-head Cobra badges, the latter of which were unique to early Cobra variants. A black soft top and a matching set of side curtains are included in the sale along with a black zippered tonneau cover. Bright wire wheels are secured by two-eared AC-branded knock-offs and are wrapped in 205/65R15 Goodyear Eagle GT tires, while a silver-painted spare housed in the trunk wears Michelin rubber. Stopping is handled by four-wheel disc brakes. Mark I Cobras such as this example utilize worm-and-roller steering as opposed to the rack-and-pinion setup introduced for Mark II production in 1963. The cockpit houses fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in red leather with color-keyed storage pockets and carpeting. Additional features include black latch-and-link lap belts, a cowl-mounted rearview mirror, a lockable glovebox, a passenger-side grab handle, and AC-branded pedals. The riveted-wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer. The five-digit odometer shows 64k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. Stewart-Warner instruments to the driver’s right include a clock and gauges monitoring oil temperature, coolant temperature, amperage, oil pressure, and fuel level. The 289ci Ford V8 breathes through twin Carter four-barrel carburetors topped by bright air cleaners and features a ribbed oil sump and valve covers. An engine block casting date from 1965 is shown in the photo gallery below. Additional equipment includes a Harrison aluminum radiator, an electric cooling fan, an electric fuel pump, and a fuel pressure regulator. Service in February 2025 is said to have included fluid changes and replacement of the water pump and alternator. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a BorgWarner T-10 four-speed manual transmission. Four-wheel independent suspension incorporates transverse leaf springs at front and rear. A knock-off hammer, a jack, and additional tools are included in the sale. The car’s 2019 SAAC registry entry notes the original colors and delivery information and outlines ownership history through 2018. The California title is marked as “title only,” and the car is not currently road registered. The title lists the car as a “1963 COBR” You are not connected to real-time updates.
