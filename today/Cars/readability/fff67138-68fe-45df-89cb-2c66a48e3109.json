Acquired by the seller in 2025, this illuminated Agip Motor Oils sign is offered at no reserve in Salem, Oregon. Agip S.p.A. was an Italian petroleum enterprise established by the Italian government in 1926 and the six-legged fire-breathing dog logo first appeared circa 1952. The hanging bracket and chains are not included. The rectangular sign features a metal structure and a translucent panel in yellow, red, white, and black. The dimensions for the sign are approximately 37” wide by 12″ tall by 4” deep and it weighs about 10 pounds. The seller notes yellow paint loss around the edges of the translucent panel which can be viewed in the gallery. The sign was retrofitted from a fluorescent bulb to an LED tube light housed within the enclosure and the power cord on the 120-volt circuitry has a two-prong wall plug. The metal enclosure has a pair of D-ring hangers affixed to the top. The sign can also be displayed freestanding as seen in the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates.
