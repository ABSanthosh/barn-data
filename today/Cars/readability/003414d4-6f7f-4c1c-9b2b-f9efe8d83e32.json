  "text": "Expect to hear more about Alfa Romeo’s plans for 'very powerful' special edition Quadrifoglio models later this month 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Alfa Romeo plans a new performance models through a partnership with Luna Rossa. CEO confirmed the car will tie into the Quadrifoglio performance sub-brand. A switch to hybrid power has delayed the launch of the next-gen Giulia and Stelvio. Alfa Romeo’s performance division is stirring again, and this time, it’s bringing a little help from the high seas. As early as next year, the brand could unveil a new wave (pun intended) of high-performance models. But instead of developing them in-house as usual, Alfa is curiously teaming up with Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, the Italian yacht racing team known more for hydrofoils than horsepower. Read: New Alfa Romeo Stelvio Unmasked From Official Patents Production of the only two Quadrifoglio models from Alfa Romeo, the flagship versions of the Giulia and Stelvio, ended earlier this year. That means whatever Alfa is cooking up now won’t be a mere refresh of those outgoing flagships. Whether the badge returns on the delayed next-generation Stelvio or makes a surprise appearance on something like the Junior or Tonale is still anyone’s guess. For what it’s worth, there’s also chatter that Alfa is cooking up a new flagship sports car for 2026, which could end up being the real torchbearer for the badge. Regardless of which model gets the nod, Alfa Romeo CEO Santo Ficili has confirmed that the partnership with Luna Rossa will result in a series of special edition cars inspired by the Quadrifoglio brand. The goal is to have the first of these limited-run models ready by the first quarter of 2026. High Performance, Limited Production “The partnership is going to start now, and I believe in the next six to eight months we are going to be really working together – we have started already,” Ficili told CarExpert. “I believe that Q1 2026 {the first quarter of next year] we would like to start with something we have in our mind – very limited, very powerful – and then we would like to continue.” What exactly “very powerful” means remains to be seen, as Ficili stopped short of naming which models would get this yacht-inspired performance boost. What he did say is that “it has to be something embedded into the Quadrifoglio brand – so it’s going to be basically something around Quadrifoglio.” The Future Of The Giulia And Stelvio It has already been confirmed that work on the next-generation Stelvio and Giulia models has been delayed because Alfa has decided to offer them as hybrids, despite originally committing to morphing both into pure EVs. While recently speaking with Automoto, Ficili acknowledged that Alfa has had to rethink its lineup strategy in light of the slower-than-expected EV uptake. “The transition to electric is taking longer than could have been expected some time ago, so we are remodeling the entire product development plan,” Ficili said. “Alfa Romeo will have ICE and hybrid engines, and all this requires a review of the plans and times needed to be able to put the right cars on the market at the right time.” Looking ahead, the picture for Alfa’s future lineup may come into sharper focus once Antonio Filosa officially steps in as the new CEO of Stellantis on June 23. According to Ficili, that leadership change will allow Alfa to have a clearer discussion about upcoming product plans and timelines.",
