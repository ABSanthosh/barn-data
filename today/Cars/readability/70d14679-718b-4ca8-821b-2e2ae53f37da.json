  "text": "Adding to the desirability of this Cadillac CTS-V with a supercharged V8 is the fact that it’s only been driven 44,000 miles March 4, 2025 at 19:26 by Brad Anderson The 6.2L supercharged V8 in the CTS-V Wagon delivers 556 hp and 551 lb-ft torque. A six-speed manual and rear-wheel drive promise to offer an engaging experience. In the age of ever-expanding SUVs and crossovers, fast wagons have become something of a rare breed. The market has shifted, and while European brands still manage to churn out a few, they’re about as common on American roads as a unicorn sighting. But, if you look at the classifieds, there are some options out there for fast estates, and few are more wild than the CTS-V Wagon from a decade ago. Cadillac built sedan, coupe, and wagon versions of the CTS-V, and in our eyes, the wagon is the ultimate iteration. It has a fierce and muscular design that still looks awesome to this day while also packing plenty of luxuries and a boatload of performance. If you want to know what the antidote is to fast SUVs, this is it. Watch: Jay Leno Says That The Cadillac CTS-V Coupe Is Likely A Future Classic The CTS-V Wagon you’re looking at has been listed for auction through Bring a Trailer and has been in the current owner’s possession since 2015. It has a clean California title and has just 44,000 miles (~70,800 km) on the clock. Driving the American estate is a 6.2-liter supercharged LSA V8, producing 556 hp and 551 lb-ft (747 Nm) of torque. Making the car all the more desirable is the fact that this engine is coupled to a Tremec six-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels, and that’s not a combination you’ll find in any current estates from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, or BMW. Bring a Trailer The exterior of this wagon is finished in a slick Black Raven paint job, topped off with 19-inch alloy wheels that feature a Satin Graphite finish. Red Brembo brake calipers peek through the wheels, adding a hint of aggression to the visual package. Inside, it may feel a bit dated by today’s standards, but the essentials are still all there: dual-zone climate control, Recaro seats that hold you in place without suffocating you, cruise control, and a Bose audio system. If you’re in the market for something that’s equal parts practical and insane, check out the listing here and place your bid. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill family hauler.",
