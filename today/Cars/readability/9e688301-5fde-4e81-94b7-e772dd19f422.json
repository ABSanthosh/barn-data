  "description": "Say hello to the Mercedes-AMG GT XX – the first full-electric concept from Mercedes’ storied performance division. The four-door GT XX concept previews what will be the first series-production model from Mercedes-AMG. The headlining figures? A peak power output of 1360hp, a top-speed of over 360kph and a range top-up of about 400km in just five minutes. The production version of the GT XX concept will be the first model to be underpinned by Mercedes’ AMG.EA skateboard architecture. This serves as a technology demonstrator for what will become a successor to the GT 4‑Door Coupé and the most powerful AMG yet. Powered by three axial flux motors producing a combined 1360hp Gets new battery technology with direct cooling for individual cells Has a top-speed of over 360kph and a drag coefficient of 0.198 Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept electric motors Co-developed with British electric motor specialist YASA In Mercedes’ own words, “the heart of an AMG is always the motor,” so let’s begin with what’s powering this radical-looking concept. Under the skin are three axial flux motors (two on the rear axle and one on the front axle), which Mercedes says, are significantly more compact and lighter than conventional e-motors (radial flux motors). It is also said to be three times more energy dense, allowing for improved continuous power and repeatability of performance, something that’s not usually the strength of high-performance EV. GT XX concept gets two electric motors at the rear and one at the front.  So far, axial flux motors have typically been seen on high-performance hybrid cars (Lamborghini Temerario, Ferrari SF90 Stradale), but this is the first application in an all-electric vehicle. The two electric motors at the rear are oil-cooled and packaged in one unit with a planetary gearset and an inverter, and along with front electric motor, produce a total of 1360hp. This also give the GT XX an all-wheel drive layout. However, under most conditions, it is rear-wheel driven, with the front motor only kicking in during hard acceleration, energy recuperation or when additional traction is needed. Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept battery and cooling Operating at more than 800V, it can theoretically supports DC charging at up to 850kW Arguably the most notable technological innovations on the GT XX concept are in the battery which builds on learnings from the AMG One hypercar and Mercedes’ Formula 1 racing division. With DC fast charging at up to 850kW, it can top up about 400km in five minutes.  The GT XX concept uses an 114kWh battery with NMC (nickle/manganese/cobalt) chemistry and particularly tall and slim cylindrical cells. Mercedes says the small radius from the cell core to its casing enables faster discharge of energy, while also helping in effective cooling. The cells also get an aluminium casing instead of the usual steel, the former being better for electrical and heat conductivity. What’s also notable is that the cells are packaged into plastic modules with direct cooling for each individual cell. A high-tech coolant flows through channels in the modules to ensure equal cooling for all cells. The battery has an 800V architecture and also gets an all-new battery management system developed in-house by AMG. It can theoretically supports DC charging at up to 850kW.  Claimed drag coefficient is 0.198 for the GT XX concept. In effect, the electric motors, the clever battery cooling tech and the high voltage architecture are all meant to ensure a sustained peak power output and efficient thermal management of the battery. The benefits of direct cooling also lend itself to charging, whereby the battery can be topped up with about 400km of range in just five minutes. Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept exterior design Develops on elements first seen on the Vision AMG of 2022 The design of the GT XX is reminiscent of the Mercedes C111 series of concepts from the 1960s and 1970s, especially in this shade of sunset beam orange. With a fastback roofline, low-slung bonnet and sharply raked windscreen it looks to have combined the design cues of a sportscar and a grand tourer. This new design language was first hinted at by the Vision AMG of 2022.  Panamericana grille features 10 vertical slats and is more concave than before. AMG’s signature Panamericana grille has been retained, now framed by a light band and more concave than before. There are new rectangular auxiliary lights at the edges of the grille (again drawing from C111), while the main vertical headlamps are housed on power bulges over the wheel arches. The headlights even come with integrated external speakers that use the housing as a loudspeaker cavity, warning pedestrians about the car's movements. Yet another striking detail are the two-part air outlets on the bonnet, each with two fins, that help dissipate warm air. Meanwhile, the front splitter features an integrated air curtain that reaches up to the wheel arches. The profile is defined by a low-slung stance and a pronounced shoulder line, but what’s really cool is the ‘MBUX Fluid Light Paint’ applied on the sills of the car. It features luminescent paint segments that not only glow in the dark, but even can be used to communicate charging status. Also notable are the patented, electronically controlled aero-wheels with moving aero-blades. The 21-inch wheels comprise five moving blades which open or close depending on brake cooling requirements or aerodynamic efficiency. 'MBUX Fluid Light Panel' at the rear comprises over 700 configuarble RGB LEDs. At the rear, the GT XX gets a six circular tail lamps and a wide diffuser finished is exposed carbon fibre, its form reminiscent of the AMG ONE. The biggest talking point, however, is what Mercedes is calling the ‘MBUX Fluid Light Panel’. This panel comprises more than 700 freely programmable RGB LEDs, which not only gives a 3D-pixel look, but can also be used to communicate specific messages, in text or animation. At the rear, one can also notice an integrated active airbrake and the absence of a rear windshield. Mercedes has optimised the underbody of the car for aerodynamic efficiency, which along with the diffuser, helps generate the so-called Venturi effect. It has a claimed drag coefficient of 0.198. Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept interior and features Cabin mixes luxury car cues with GT3 race car elements The all-black interior with silver and orange accents look really snug and race-inspired, with chequered flag graphics peppered on the door pads and the floor. A particularly distinctive design feature are the exposed structural extrusions, seen with the dashboard panel and centre console. Meanwhile, the backlit, vertical struts on the dashboard and orange piping on the centre console are inspired by high-voltage cables, says Mercedes. Interior draws influences from AMG One hypercar.  Ahead of the driver are two large floating screens – a 10.25-inch instrument cluster and a 14-inch infotainment display – and a yoke-like steering wheel with the usual AMG-spec switchgear. The screens run the latest version of the MB.OS operating system with a bespoke UI/UX. The steering wheel also gets paddle shifters to control energy recuperation. Another stand-out feature is the design element in the centre console, which takes the form of the AMG coat of arms. The carbon fibre bucket seats at the rear are completely integrated into the car’s rear bulkhead. There’s also no headliner, which helps save wight and exposes the carbon-fibre structure. Swathes of experimental materials adorn the interior, with biotech leather alternatives made from recycled GT3 tyres and protein‑derived bio‑silk interior door handles Mercedes says they have achieved the same finish and quality with this material as natural leather. Even the floor uses recycled materials. The fastening points on the doors are clad with small buttons with the AMG coat of arms. The GT XX’s production model will be joined by a closely related SUV, both of which are expected to go into production sometime by late 2026. This unveiling comes as several performance car makers scale back their electric model plans. Ferrari has reportedly delayed its second electric model until at least 2028 due to weaker than expected orders, although it still plans to unveil its first purely electric model in October. Lamborghini, Porsche and Maserati have also postponed forthcoming electric models. Also See: Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge launched at Rs 9.5 crore Audi reverses 2033 ICE phase out plan",

Meanwhile, the backlit, vertical struts on the dashboard and orange piping on the centre console are inspired by high-voltage cables, says Mercedes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/News/20250626124553_1 (56).jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInterior draws influences from AMG One hypercar. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAhead of the driver are two large floating screens – a 10.25-inch instrument cluster and a 14-inch infotainment display – and a yoke-like steering wheel with the usual AMG-spec switchgear. The screens run the latest version of the MB.OS operating system with a bespoke UI/UX. The steering wheel also gets paddle shifters to control energy recuperation. Another stand-out feature is the design element in the centre console, which takes the form of the AMG coat of arms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe carbon fibre bucket seats at the rear are completely integrated into the car’s rear bulkhead. There’s also no headliner, which helps save wight and exposes the carbon-fibre structure. Swathes of experimental materials adorn the interior, with biotech leather alternatives made from recycled GT3 tyres and protein‑derived bio‑silk interior door handles Mercedes says they have achieved the same finish and quality with this material as natural leather. Even the floor uses recycled materials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/News/16 (5).jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe fastening points on the doors are clad with small buttons with the AMG coat of arms.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe GT XX’s production model will be joined by a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mercedes-amg-confirms-future-electric-super-suv-433470\"\u003eclosely related SUV\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, both of which are expected to go into production sometime by late 2026. This unveiling comes as several performance car makers scale back their electric model plans. Ferrari has reportedly delayed its second electric model until at least 2028 due to weaker than expected orders, although it still plans to unveil its first purely electric model in October. Lamborghini, Porsche and Maserati have also postponed forthcoming electric models.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso See:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/rolls-royce-spectre-black-badge-launched-at-rs-95-crore-435832\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge launched at Rs 9.5 crore\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/audi-reverses-2033-ice-ban-435794\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAudi reverses 2033 ICE phase out plan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-435868\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-435868\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-435868\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-435868\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
