  "text": "If you love practical cheap supercar speed, this might be the car for you April 30, 2025 at 20:36 by Stephen Rivers Someone picked up a Kia EV6 GT at auction for less than half of its original price. They paid just $31,000 for a 576-horsepower car that can keep up with supercars. Despite being a great deal, the EV6 GT has limited range, making road trips difficult. We’re seeing used electric vehicle prices take a nosedive, and even the mighty Kia EV6 GT isn’t immune. In fact, someone just snagged one at auction for less than half of its original MSRP of $64,360. So, would you drop $31,000 on a two-year-old EV with 21,000 miles on the clock? Let’s break down the upsides and downsides, and why this could actually be a fantastic deal for the buyer. The Downsides of the Kia EV6 GT Let’s actually start off by talking about the not-so-glamorous side of owning something like the Kia EV6 GT AWD. None is as big as the lack of range available in this thing. At best, you’re looking at around 206 miles (331 km) on a full charge, and that’s according to the EPA estimates. In my testing, I found that you might hit that number – if you’re not constantly pushing it to the limit. My drive ended up around 175 miles, so don’t expect much more if you’re, you know, enjoying the throttle. It’s not great, especially for longer road trips. But on the flip side, it’s more than enough for day-to-day driving. Review: Kia EV6 Facelift Is Better Than Ever, But We’d Wait For The EV5 That said, the suspension can be a little rough in GT mode, but running it in ‘normal’ mode seems like the solution. Finally, the climate controls are a bit finicky. I think most folks will get over that given time, but having tried them in several Kia products, I still don’t like them. The Fun Side: Why the EV6 GT is a Steal With that Debbie Downer section out of the way, let’s get into why this is such a great car to drive. Sure, 576 horsepower (429 kW) sounds like the obvious answer, and it’s certainly part of it, but it’s more than just outright speed. The EV6 GT handles exceptionally well. Sure, it’s outshone slightly by its cousin, the Ioniq 5 N, which we’ve also reviewed, but that in and of itself is a compliment in that they’re very similar. Photos Cars\u0026Bids In our testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, the EV6 GT performed admirably on the drag strip and the road course. The only bit that wasn’t superb was the way ABS engaged during trail braking. That’s something software updates might have solved in the meantime, though. Ultimately, this is a four-door superhot hatch, and we haven’t even gotten to the X factor. Read: 2025 Kia EV6 Proves Facelifts Aren’t Cheap Speed is great and getting a big discount thanks to depreciation is too, but it’s the things that make this car so livable that make it such a steal at $31,000. First and foremost, it’s comfortable, it’s spacious, and it has enough space in the back to haul five people and an afternoon’s worth of gear. On top of that, if one needs even more space, it can tow almost 4,000 pounds! That’s ridiculous for such a small car that can drive as sharply and as fast as this one does. All of this having been said, there’s no question that there are some unknowns out there. How will EVs like this one hold up years from now? Will replacement batteries and motors ever be economical to replace? These are some of the big questions the new owner of this Cars\u0026Bids find might have to consider down the road. Til then, they get to enjoy one of the most well-rounded cars in the segment for less than half of its MSRP.  Photos Cars\u0026Bids",
