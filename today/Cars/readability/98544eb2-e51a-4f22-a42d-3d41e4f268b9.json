  "description": "With sub-4-metre SUVs accounting for 60 percent of total passenger vehicle sales in India, every manufacturer is vying for a share of that market. Skoda is the latest to join the segment with the Kylaq, aiming to make a strong impact. The brand has generated significant buzz over the past year through its marketing tactics, including a naming contest and periodic teasers. We even had the chance to test a camouflaged pre-production model on a race track. However, the real highlight is its aggressive introductory price of Rs 7.89 lakh, announced ahead of the full range pricing. But the question remains: Can the Kylaq take on well-established rivals? Skoda Kylaq design Takes design cues from Skoda's latest EVs. The Kylaq incorporates Skoda’s latest design language, first seen in the company’s international EVs. It sports a split headlamp setup with sleek daytime running lamps integrated into the signature blacked-out Skoda grille. The higher placement of the grille and a flatter bonnet lend it a bold SUV-like stance, distinguishing it from the Kushaq. Rugged elements such as a matte black panel around the air dam and a silver faux skid plate further enhance its persona. The stylish 17-inch alloy wheels are well-proportioned, while faux roof rails add character to the otherwise minimalist side profile. The rear, though packed with design elements like a chiselled tailgate, black applique with ‘Skoda’ lettering and chunky plastic cladding, features tail-lamps that appear relatively small. The roof rails add character but are not meant to carry weight. Built on the MQB A0 IN platform, the Kylaq manages to remain under four metres without looking like a forced compromise. Despite a shorter wheelbase than the Kushaq (reduced by 85mm to 2,566mm), it is 23mm wider and 7mm taller. Impressively, it boasts the second-largest wheelbase in the segment and a ground clearance of 189mm, reinforcing its SUV credentials. Impressively, the Kylaq has been awarded a solid 5 stars by BNCAP in crash tests. Skoda Kylaq interior While the exterior differentiates itself, the interior closely resembles the Kushaq – offering a clean, uncluttered design and a solid build. The reassuring ‘thud’ of the doors remains intact, as do elements like the digital instrument cluster, two-spoke steering wheel, and climate control console. However, Skoda has introduced ‘olive green’ inserts on the dashboard, door panels and centre console, along with a light-textured fascia to add uniqueness. Octagonal surrounds on the air vents further distinguish it from its stablemates. Olive green inserts and new-design AC vents help differentiate the Kylaq’s interior from the Kushaq. A light grey theme brightens its cabin ambience, and even though the plastics are hard, these feel high-quality and long-lasting. However, the Kushaq’s cabin tends to develop creaks and squeaks, so we’ll have to wait and see whether the same happens in the Kylaq. The front seats are powered and ventilated and quite comfortable. With the wheelbase being shorter than the Kushaq’s, the rear legroom is understandably tighter. However, on the whole, it is par for the course. Some might find the backrest a tad too upright, and because of the cup-like seat contouring, this area is best for two adults only. Front seat comfort is a highlight of the Kylaq. The upright backrest angle enhances boot space, which Skoda advertises to be 446 litres up to the roof; the usable boot space is just 360 litres up to the rear parcel shelf only. Below the boot floor sits a spare tyre, but unlike its premium stable mates, there is no subwoofer placed here. Rear legroom is average by segment standards; contoured seatbacks make it best for just two. While on that topic, the top-spec Kylaq is equipped with auto LED headlamps, 17-inch alloys, a sunroof, powered and ventilated front seats, a wireless charger and a digital instrument cluster, to name a few. The touchscreen gets updated software, which includes a new coloured theme. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay continue to be offered, and while the speakers aren’t branded per se, the sound quality is respectable. Some rivals go a step further by offering rear disc brakes, ADAS, a 360-degree camera and a panoramic sunroof. Only the top-spec Kylaq Prestige variant gets the sunroof.   Skoda Kylaq performance The Kylaq is powered by a 999cc 3-cylinder turbo-petrol engine – the same as in the Kushaq and Slavia. In a smaller package, its performance feels livelier, though turbo lag is noticeable below 2,000rpm. Once past this point, power delivery is strong, and the engine revs quite freely, too. Our preliminary tests indicate a 0-100kph sprint in 11 seconds for the manual variant, while the automatic takes 11.9 seconds. Kushaq's 115hp engine feels livelier in the lighter Kylaq. The 6-speed manual gearbox is not the smoothest, requiring effort to slot gears and featuring a heavy clutch. The 6-speed automatic gearbox is likely to be the choice for a majority of urban dwellers, and the good news is that it is smooth for the most part and works well with this engine. The engine idling speed is still high to prevent it from stalling. However, it doesn’t leap forward from a standstill as aggressively as the Kushaq. Throttle responses feel a bit lazy, and to extract the best out of this engine, the automatic gets a ‘Sport’ mode for more zing. There are paddle shifters, as well as a Tiptronic mode for manual control over the transmission. But the downshifts aren’t very quick, and the transition from third to second or second to first gear can get jerky. Downshifts when using the paddle shifters aren’t all that quick. The Kylaq’s refinement leaves scope for improvement. The engine is prominently audible all throughout, and you will feel vibrations across the cabin, which indicates that insulation isn’t as generous as its premium siblings. Skoda Kylaq ride and handling The Kylaq’s stiff chassis and suspension setup make it feel nimble and engaging to drive. Despite its 189mm ground clearance, body roll is well controlled, and grip levels are excellent. The steering is light and precise – great for city driving, though driving enthusiasts may desire more feedback. However, the stiffness results in a rather unsettled ride quality, especially at city speeds, where it occasionally feels jarring. On the braking front, stopping power is strong and confidence-inspiring, even without rear disc brakes. Skoda Kylaq verdict The Kylaq is an engaging drive. While the Kylaq doesn’t break new ground in any particular area, it delivers where it matters – engaging driving dynamics, solid build quality and a well-equipped feature list. However, its refinement levels, rear seat comfort and ride quality leave room for improvement. The aggressive entry price is a strong hook, but the prices of its top variants are close to those of its better-equipped rivals. Despite this, the Kylaq’s nimble handling and Skoda’s reputation for safety and durability make it an appealing alternative for those seeking a fun-to-drive, compact SUV.   The Kylaq may be late to the party, but it has made a statement. In summary, the Kylaq delivers a Kushaq-like experience at a relatively more affordable price, and that makes it worthy of your consideration.
