The car has 39k miles, and it has spent most of its time registered in California. It is powered by a 3.6-liter V8 paired with a six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and is finished in Rosso Corsa over Beige leather. Equipment includes a Capristo exhaust system, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, xenon headlights, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, and automatic climate control. This 360 Spider is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a car cover, steering wheel and seat covers, a tire repair kit, tools, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features xenon headlights, a power-retractable black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, fender badges, and quad exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in August 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded. The 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels show curb marks and are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza tires, which were reportedly fitted about two years ago. Stopping power is from red-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at each corner. The cockpit features power-adjustable Daytona-style seats upholstered in beige leather with black accents along with matching door panel inserts and carpets. Amenities include aluminum pedals, a CD stereo, and automatic climate control. Photos showing wear on the interior surfaces are included in the gallery. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a digital fuel level readout and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. Paddle shifters for the F1 gearbox are mounted behind the steering wheel. The digital odometer indicates 39k miles, approximately 37k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 395 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. A Capristo exhaust system has been added. A belt service was most recently carried out in October 2020. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an electrohydraulic six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch is said to have been replaced about three years ago. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Midwestern Auto Group in Dublin, Ohio, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total suggested retail price of $178,113. The sale also includes owner’s manuals, a tool kit, a tire repair kit, a car cover, and steering wheel and seat covers. The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage.
