  "text": "It's unclear if any significant mechanical damage has been done to the V12-powered supercar that reportedly starts from over $450,000 December 16, 2024 at 19:07 by Brad Anderson Several outlets attended the event in Luxembourg, with at least six matching 12Cilindris used. The crash took place on a narrow, rain-slicked road, causing significant damage to the car. The monstrous 6.5-liter V12 sends all 819 hp to the rear wheels via a dual-clutch automatic. The Ferrari 12Cilindri is a celebration of one of the finest naturally aspirated V12 engines ever created. It’s loud, expensive, and dramatic, just like every Ferrari grand tourer should be. But now, thanks to a shiny gold example (Ferrari calls it Giallo Montecarlo for extra flair) getting stuffed into something immovable, there’s officially one fewer on the road. What makes this incident even juicier? It allegedly happened during a press event in Luxembourg, and it’s apparently the first reported crash of Ferrari’s newest V12 masterpiece. Details are scarce, including who was behind the wheel or how exactly things spiraled into oops-territory, but the mangled metal seen in this photo shared by Supercar.fails, speaks for itself. The crash occurred on a narrow, rain-soaked road, leaving the supercar with extensive damage. Who Did It? We can confirm that this 12Cilindri, with the license plate reading ‘GT950AH‘, was one of at least six gold examples Ferrari used during a recent media test drive event. Journalists were flown in to test the Italian Grand Tourer in late September or early October, a timeline backed up by the reviews that soon followed. What remains unclear, though we’re actively digging for more information, is whether the crash occurred at the hands of a journalist, someone from the press trip organizers, or perhaps even Ferrari’s own team, since this exact car, with that license plate, has been spotted in official press photos. Read: Why Buy A Nissan Versa When You Can Have A Tiny Ferrari For More? Regardless of who was behind the wheel, it seems the passenger-side rear quarter panel of the Ferrari has taken the brunt of the impact, slamming into a dirt/clay embankment next to the road. It’s been badly dented and scratched, and small pieces of the rear bumper have been torn off. The wing mirror also looks to be covered in dirt and probably also took a hit. It’s a little more difficult to determine if any damage has been done to the front of the 12Cilindri, but it’s possible the bumper and at least one of the wheels have also taken a hefty knock. Some Good News If there’s a sliver of good news here (and we’re really scraping the bottom of the optimism barrel), it’s that this this 12Cilindri doesn’t seem to have been privately owned. Instead, it was part of Ferrari’s press fleet. Sure, someone’s likely sweating bullets over the whole incident—and honestly, who could blame them? We’d be breaking out in a cold sweat too. But at the end of the day, the car was insured, and as long as the damage isn’t structural, there’s a decent chance it can be repaired. Fingers crossed for a happy-ish ending. With the 12Cilindri’s V12 churning out a monstrous 819 hp – all of which is sent to the rear wheels – driving it along twisty and wet roads requires a lot of care. There’s no word on whether anyone was injured in the crash, although an ambulance did attend the scene, but that may have been standard procedure. With great power comes great responsibility, but it seems 819 horses were too much for one driver to handle. Lead photo Supercar.fails@Instagram",
