  "description": "The Skoda Kylaq is off to a good start, with the company recording sales of over 5,000 units last month, thereby giving Skoda its highest-ever monthly sales figure in India: 7,422 units in March 2025. Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, Skoda Auto India Brand director Petr Janeba confirmed, “The waiting time currently ranges between 2 and 5 months.” Seeing the positive response, Skoda India recently also extended the introductory price period of the compact SUV until the end of this month.  Kylaq is powered by a 115hp, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine Has secured a 5-star crash safety rating from Bharat NCAP Available in four trims: Classic, Signature, Signature+, Prestige Skoda Kylaq waiting period explained Base Classic trim has the longest waiting period The maximum waiting period of up to 5 months is for the base Classic trim, which is only available with a manual gearbox. This, however, is not surprising, given that Skoda has earmarked a majority of production for the high-spec variants. Consequently, the mid-spec Signature and Signature+ trims have a waiting period of about 3 months, while the top Prestige trim has a waiting period of 2 months. Skoda is targeting 8,000 monthly Kylaq sales Skoda is likewise expanding its touchpoints With the Kylaq, Janeba expects to hit 8,000 monthly sales by the end of 2025. This is expected to help the company achieve its target of selling 1,00,000 vehicles annually in India from 2026. “In March, we reached 280 touchpoints, which is slower than we’d like. But by August, we’ll ramp up to 350 touchpoints, allowing us to operate at full network capacity. So, by the end of the year, touching 8,000 Kylaqs is not a problem. Sustaining momentum will depend on the expanded network, a more robust IT system, and hiring more front-facing staff,” said Janeba. But while the Kylaq is certainly bringing in much-needed volumes for the Czech brand, it is worth pointing out that the Kylaq is also inevitably cannibalising Kushaq’s sales. Prior to the Kylaq’s arrival, the Kushaq sold about 1,500-2,000 units a month, which has since dropped below 1,000. Skoda sold only 897 units of the Kushaq last month, the lowest since its launch in 2021. Given the overlap in features and powertrain options, it is no surprise that buyers are seeing greater value in the sub-4-metre Kylaq. Skoda Kylaq engine details and features The Kylaq gets a sole 1.0-litre, three-cylinder, turbo-petrol engine, which produces 115hp and 178Nm of peak torque. It comes mated to either a 6-speed manual gearbox with an ARAI-claimed fuel efficiency of 19.05kpl or a 6-speed torque converter with a claimed efficiency of 19.68kpl. The Kylaq gets six airbags as standard, and in terms of features, the top-spec gets a 10-inch infotainment screen, an 8-inch digital instrument cluster, powered and ventilated front seats, a sunroof, ambient lighting, and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Recently, the Kylaq also secured a 5-star safety rating from Bharat NCAP.
