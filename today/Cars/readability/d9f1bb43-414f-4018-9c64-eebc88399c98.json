  "text": "Fiat seems uninterested in the two-door coupe segment, but fans wouldn’t turn down a Honda Prelude rival from Italy December 19, 2024 at 19:39 by Thanos Pappas Independent digital artist Theottle reimagined the Fiat Coupe for the modern era. The fictional model could use Stellantis underpinnings, aimed at rivaling the Honda Prelude. The Bangle-designed original Fiat Coupe debuted in 1993 and was discontinued in 2000. If there’s one thing sorely missing from today’s car market, it’s affordable coupes. Remember those? The antidote to the lifeless sea of crossovers we’re drowning in? Thankfully, with the Honda Prelude making a comeback, and a new Toyota Celica potentially joining it, automakers might finally be waking up to the fact that not everyone dreams of piloting a high-riding, personality-deprived SUV. Adding some fuel to this fantasy revival tour, digital artist Theophilus Chin (a.k.a. “Theottle”) decided to reimagine the Fiat Coupe, a ’90s design icon with a streak of weird for the modern era. Since Fiat doesn’t currently offer any low-slung models in the compact or midsize segments, Theottle had to base his digital illustrations on something else. He chose the Audi RS5 Coupe for its proportions, blending elements from the original Fiat Coupe (greenhouse), the Bentley Continental GT (boot and taillights), and the Lynk\u0026Co 07 (nose). More: Someone Should Build This Designer’s Fiat Barchetta Electromod Study The end result looks surprisingly modern, proving the Fiat Coupe’s styling was ahead of its time. The design retains the split headlights, signature sharp fender creases, and the angular greenhouse of the original, while adding fresh features. The tail looks more conventional than we would expect, swapping the Ferrari-inspired round taillights of the Fiat Coupe with Bentley-style oval units. Finally, the diffuser and oval tailpipes are leftover pieces from the Audi RS5, and could be further improved with an Abarth-inspired design. Theottle / FCA Heritage A Punk Rocker From The 1990s Let’s rewind to the Fiat Coupe’s glory days. Born in 1993 and axed in 2000, it was the brainchild of Chris Bangle (yes, that Chris Bangle) under Fiat design legend Ermanno Cressoni. The interior was penned by Pininfarina, which, fun fact, also handled the production of the car. Fiat built the Coupe on the humble FWD platform of the Tipo hatchback but added flair with an independent suspension setup. The result was an approachable yet quirky coupe, offering just enough performance to stay exciting. Power came from a range of four-cylinder turbocharged engines, including one borrowed from the legendary Lancia Delta HF Integrale. At the top of the lineup was the Coupe 20VT, featuring a turbocharged 2.0-liter five-cylinder engine producing 217 hp, a number that made it a serious contender in its heyday. Could It Really Make A Comeback? Given that Fiat’s current lineup is heavily focused on small hatchbacks and SUVs, the return of the Coupe seems highly unlikely. Still, such a model could be technically possible, thanks to Stellantis‘ parts bin. The STLA Medium architecture would be perfect for a new Fiat Coupe, offering compatibility with hybrid, PHEV, and EV powertrains. Pair these with a sporty chassis and stunning styling, and you’d have a model that might even make Alfa Romeo envious. On a final note, this is not the first time we see a modern take on the Fiat Coupe, as plenty of independent designers have been inspired by it. One of the coolest examples is the digital concept by Gaspare Conticelli that we covered a few years ago.",
