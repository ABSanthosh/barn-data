  "text": "It's unclear how the driver of the electric pickup lost control, but the good news is that no one was seriously injured February 27, 2025 at 19:11 by Brad Anderson The front end of the Tesla has taken a hefty hit after slamming into the pool. Local fire crews stabilized the rear of the Tesla and rescued the occupants. It remains unclear whether the EV will be repaired or scrapped by the insurer. The owner of a matte black Tesla Cybertruck in Arizona made a very costly mistake when they drove the electric pickup straight into a backyard swimming pool. While the crash left the Tesla with significant damage, the pool was thankfully empty at the time, meaning the Cybertruck avoided injuring anyone and spared itself from an unwanted swim (and probably even more extensive damage). The accident took place near the intersection of East University Drive and North Signal Butte Road, on the edge of Phoenix. While images shared on Instagram by the Local 3878 Firefighters division don’t explain how the Cybertruck ended up in the pool area, we can take an educated guess that the truck went off-road, likely smashing through a fence before making its poolside debut. Read: Mercedes S-Class Driver Confuses Carpooling With Gym Pool Dive While recent NHTSA testing shows that the Cybertruck has been built tough and is very safe, the front of this particular truck is looking a little worse for wear after it nosedived into the empty pool. The nose took the brunt of the impact, with the front bumper and hood crushed, and the windshield shattered. There’s also a good chance the undertray took some damage too and will likely need some repairs. Fortunately, local fire crews were on hand to stabilize the situation. They placed supports under the rear of the truck to keep it from tipping any further, then extracted the occupants safely. Ambulances were on site to take them away, though it’s unclear if the only injury was to their pride. What’s next for this Cybertruck? While it’s hard to say for sure based solely on these images, there’s a good chance it will be repairable, but that’s only relevant if the insurer is willing to pay rather than deciding to scrap the truck and sell it at an auction. If a major part of the front crash structure was damaged, that would add to the cost of fixing, as would any suspension damage to the driver’s side front quarter.
