  "description": "Mahindra is planning to add hybrid powertrains to its current model portfolio, and, interestingly, the Indian automaker is looking at hybridisation of both its ICE and born EV platforms. A while ago, the company had said that it saw only EVs as the future, but with interest in hybrids steadily rising, it had subsequently decided to explore electrified ICE powertrains. The EV growth rate, too, has been slower than expected and with substantial effort and expense put into its BEV range, it's not surprising to see Mahindra considering hybrid powerplants for them too. Mahindra is considering both strong and range-extender hybrid powertrains The brand's current lineup comprises ICE and EV models In May 2025, Mahindra sold 2,604 EVs, with the bulk of the volumes coming from its born-electric lineup. While the figures mark steady progress, the brand is aiming higher with a 5,000-unit monthly sales target, now supported by the addition of hybrid alternatives. Mahindra hybrid details Range-extender hybrid powertrain under consideration We reported on Mahindra's hybrid plans in the June 2025 issue of Autocar India magazine. It's understood that for its ICE models, Mahindra is looking at a regular series-hybrid setup, whereas its BEV lineup is likely to get a range-extender hybrid powertrain. In this setup, a 1.2-litre petrol engine will function solely as a generator to recharge the battery, which in turn will power the electric motors that drive the wheels. Interestingly, even Maruti is developing an in-house and affordable range-extender powertrain for models like the Fronx, Baleno, Swift, and a small MPV. Also see: Mild, strong and plug in hybrid tech explained Mahindra XUV 3XO hybrid also in the works Strong hybrid system paired with 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine In January 2025, we had exclusively reported that the homegrown automaker is studying a hybrid system for its XUV 3XO compact SUV. But unlike the range-extender arrangement on the Mahindra BEVs, the XUV 3XO will make use of a series-parallel hybrid system. Sources in the know revealed that its existing 1.2-litre, three-cylinder, turbo-petrol engine will be paired with a strong hybrid system. Here, the combustion engine and electric motor can work together or independently, with the setup automatically deciding which to use, helping to leverage high fuel efficiency figures. Hybrid, EV sales in India outlook Grand Vitara, Urban Cruiser Hyryder most-selling hybrid models  With a total of 85,000 units sold last year, hybrids accounted for a 2.1 percent market share in the passenger vehicle category. Electric vehicles, which were subject to a slower-than-expected pace of adoption and the sustained challenge surrounding charging infrastructure, with sales of over 90,000 units secured a slightly higher 2.4 percent market share. In April 2025 alone, 8,754 hybrid cars and SUVs were sold in India, with the Maruti Grand Vitara and Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder accounting for an overwhelming 99 percent of these sales. A key driver of this growth is the government's recent push for hybrid adoption, including road tax exemptions on par with EVs in some states (see below). It's becoming increasingly clear that the shift to full electrification won't happen as quickly as expected, in India or globally. Here, despite EV penetration crossing 4 percent for the first time last month, the government's ambitious 30 percent target by 2030 remains a long way off. Even the EU is reconsidering its 2035 zero-emissions deadline, while in North America, Donald Trump’s pro-oil stance hints at continued reliance on ICE vehicles. Hyundai, Skoda-VW and JSW-MG hybrids coming as well Additionally, our recent scoop revealed that Hyundai is bringing the Pallisade hybrid SUV here. Skoda Auto Volkswagen, and JSW MG Motor also plan to introduce hybrid models down the line.
