Others, Group B, must be constantly monitored to ensure they perform some semblance of work. Because feelings are hurt if logic is applied and Group B are called what they are, unproductive slackers, Group A must take up the slack created by Group B. When Group B is finally held to the same standard as Group A, incessant whining ensues. Seeing as how little has been proven either way, I will refrain from assigning these German workers to Group B. But seeing as how slanted everything is against the once messiah Musk these days, I'll take the accusations against Tesla with a grain of salt.",
