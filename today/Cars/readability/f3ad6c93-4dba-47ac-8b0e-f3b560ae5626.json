The car is powered by a replacement flat-four that has reportedly been increased in displacement to 1,883cc, and additional equipment includes a four-speed manual transaxle, 15″ ventilated chrome steel wheels, vent windows, body-color bumpers, and a cabin heater. This 356B coupe was acquired by the current owner in 2016 and is now offered on dealer consignment with a copy of the Kardex, a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a rear luggage rack, two sets of keys, and Connecticut registration. The T5 body was introduced for the 1960 model year with revised front-end styling, including raised bumpers and headlights along with a redesigned front trunk lid handle. This Reutter-built example came finished from the factory in Signal Red (6011) and was repainted around 2000. Features include a sliding steel sunroof, Super 90 badging, a chrome driver-side mirror, a windshield washer system, vent windows, and body-color bumpers with chrome overriders. A silver metallic rear luggage rack is included in the sale. Flaws include paint bubbling on the lower area of the driver’s door, scratches on the right rear bumper, and blemishes on the right-side fender, and the hood is believed to be a replacement item. The 15″ vented steel wheels wear chrome hubcaps and are mounted with 165HR15 Verdestein Sprint Classic tires. The car was factory equipped with drum brakes at each corner. A Willhoit front sway bar and Koni shocks have been installed. The front bucket seats and rear jump seats have been reupholstered in black leather, and interior appointments include a Becker Mexico AM/FM radio, an analog clock, a dimmable rearview mirror, a cabin heater, lap belts, front seat head restraints, and a body-color painted dashboard. The wood-rimmed steering wheel features a bright horn ring and frames green-letter VDO instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline as well as a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 34k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. The replacement flat-four was reportedly sourced from a Super 90 and increased in displacement to 1,883cc using LN Engineering “Nickies” cylinders and JE forged pistons around 2013. Additional details include street-ported 912 cylinder heads, Datsun intake valves, an Elgin camshaft, an aluminum oil cooler, a spin-on oil filter, dual Dellorto carburetors, and a 123ignition programmable distributor. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a replacement four-speed manual transaxle. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity shows the factory colors, serial numbers, and optional equipment along with a production completion date of November 22, 1960.
