  "text": "Jul 23, 2025 6:00 PM EDTDongfeng’s M817 fills the off-road gap that Tesla can’t fill in China Tesla was already making up lost ground in China this year, and a new 912-horsepower SUV from automaker Dongfeng has scored nearly 10,000 pre-orders in 24 hours. Dongfeng, one of China’s big four state-owned auto manufacturers, racked up these pre-orders for its M-Hero M817 hybrid, acting as an alternative to Tesla’s products with a multi-faceted value proposition. The M817’s off-road capability fills a niche that Tesla can’t yet fill in China since its Cybertruck isn’t sold in the country. Dongfeng also sells its M817 for 329,000 yuan, equivalent to about $45,854, allowing drivers to receive a solid amount of versatility without spending a fortune. The 5-seat SUV features a 1.5-liter turbocharged engine and two electric motors, resulting in a 4.2-second 0-62 mph time and a superb all-electric range for a hybrid vehicle of 124 miles. Additionally, its 912-horsepower rating is complemented by 944 lb-ft of torque and a 4×4 drivetrain. Dongfeng’s M817 is equipped with Huawei’s latest ADS 4 driving assistance system. Huawei’s ADS 4 driving assistance system represents China’s debut high-speed Level 3 commercial autonomy solution and contains the first mass-produced high-precision solid-state LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), the first mass-produced in-cabin laser vision sensor, and the first distributed millimeter-wave radar, according to Shanghai Metal Market. The M817 will come in dual exterior designs labeled “City Edition” and Off-Road Edition.” The City Edition features hidden mechanical door handles and low-drag wheels, while the Off-Road Edition boasts exposed hinges, beadlock wheels, and a 12,500-lb electric winch, Car News China reports. Drivers receive a 33-degree approach angle, a 34-degree departure angle, and a 13.1-inch ground clearance. Those seeking extra ground clearance can increase this figure to 15.1 inches by opting for air suspension. On the display front, a 15.6-inch floating curved central screen takes center stage with aviation-inspired switches and a rotary knob to minimize reliance on touch controls. Passengers have access to 13 power outlets, and buyers can choose between a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) or an Extended-Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) powertrain. How Tesla is faring in China as of late While Dongfeng received positive news after its initial pre-orders, Tesla registered 9,900 vehicles in China between July 14 and 20, down nearly 20% from 12,300 the previous week and 5.7% lower than the same time last year, according to EV. Last year, Tesla’s sales three weeks into Q3 were up over 70% year-over-year. Tesla China registrations had been climbing somewhat after the company posted its lowest amount in two months at the start of July. From January 1 to July 20, Tesla’s sales are down 4.8% year-over-year, with a total of 291,300 vehicle deliveries. Final thoughts  Unlike the hundreds of thousands of pre-orders that Xiaomi’s YU7 electric SUV pulled last month in China, the deposits for Dongfeng’s M-Hero M817 are refundable. Still, Dongfeng receiving 9,713 pre-orders in a single day shows that the automaker can compete against automakers like Tesla and China’s NEV (New Energy Vehicle) market as a whole. The model’s appeal is rooted in hybrid versatility, which combines quality all-electric range, off-road capability, and power into a stylish package that’s hard to miss.
