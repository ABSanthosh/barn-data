The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0L flat-six that drives all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with an electronic differential lock. Equipment includes the Sport Chrono Package, LED-Matrix Design headlights, rear-axle steering, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control, Rallye Launch Control, Vesuvius Gray-finished 19″ and 20″ 911 Dakar wheels, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, aluminum pedals, and a heated steering wheel. Purchased new by the seller, this 992.1 Dakar has 143 miles and is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, two keys, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. Introduced at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show, the 911 Dakar was designed as an homage to the Porsche 953’s overall victory in the 1984 Paris-Dakar Rally. The 911 Dakar model is based on the Carrera 4 GTS but with revisions focused on off-road capability including increased ground clearance, all-terrain tires, specialized drive modes, and various weight-saving measures. This example is finished in paint-to-sample Yachting Blue Metallic and features model-specific stainless-steel front and rear skid plates, a carbon-fiber front hood with stainless-steel vents, a carbon-fiber fixed rear spoiler, 911 Dakar puddle lamps, black rocker-panel cladding with inset stainless-steel guard plates, black wheel-arch extensions, lightweight glass, red front and rear tow hooks, and Exclusive Design tailpipes. Additional exterior equipment includes LED-Matrix Design headlights as well as fog lights, a backup camera, and front and rear parking sensors. Vesuvius Gray-finished 19″ and 20″ 911 Dakar alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires. The Dakar model features a ride height 50mm higher than standard sport-suspension-equipped 911 variants along with a hydraulic lift system that provides up to an additional 30mm of clearance, with the maximum ride height of 7.5” sustainable at up to 105 mph. Additional standard features for the Dakar include rear-axle steering, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control with active anti-roll bars, traction management, torque vectoring, and a Rallye Launch Control. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted six-piston front- and four-piston rear black-painted calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with Race-Tex inserts, “911” embroidery on the headrests, and GT Silver stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, knee pads, and door panels. Cabin appointments include carpeted floor mats, aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, a Bose sound system, cruise control, automatic climate control, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. The heated Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel features paddle shifters and fronts a central 8k-rpm tachometer with an inset speed readout and LCD screens with configurable displays. A Sport Chrono stopwatch is mounted atop the center of the dash. The digital odometer indicates 143 miles. The twin-turbocharged 3.0L flat-six is shared with the Carrera GTS and was factory rated at 473 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The Dakar model utilizes the cooling system from the 911 Turbo and Turbo S while sharing the GT3’s dynamic engine mounts. An oil change was performed in January 2025. Power is routed to all four wheels through an eight-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with an electronic differential lock. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The copy of the window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche San Antonio in Texas, along with factory options and a total price of $246,650.
