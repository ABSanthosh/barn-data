  "description": "TVS entered the electric scooter game with its popular iQube back in 2020 and since then it has regularly finished in the top 3 in terms of monthly EV sales. Now we have learned that the company is working on a new budget-friendly EV model which will likely sit below the iQube and is slated to launch before the festive season.  TVS iQube is one of the bestselling EVs in India Expected to be priced around or below base iQube 2.2 ballpark Jupiter CNG also being readied for market launch soon TVS entry-level EV in the works Launch slated before festive season, expected price around base iQube ballpark  The TVS iQube has one of the most widespread lineups in the electric scooter game with five different variants available across three battery capacities. Pricing for the iQube starts at the Rs 1 lakh mark for the smallest 2.2kWh variant and goes up to nearly Rs 2 lakh for the range-topping 5.1kWh model. We have been led to believe that this new TVS electric scooter will be positioned below the iQube and given its intended positioning, it is reasonable to expect a small battery, simpler parts and fewer features.  With an ever-diminishing government subsidy and increasing inflation, the onus is on manufacturers to bring out newer products at competitive price points and TVS seems to be doing that very thing with its new entry-level electric scooter. While specific details are scarce at the moment, it is likely that just like the iQube which uses a hub-mounted motor (sourced from Bosch), this new TVS EV could also follow in its footsteps and it will likely will be a simple, no-frills offering to ensure costs are in check.   According to people in the know, TVS is aiming to bring its entry-level electric scooter to the market before the festive season to capitalise on market demand and hit the ground running with its new offering. Where exactly it finds itself in the market is a bit of a question mark currently, but we expect it to be positioned around the Rs 90,000-1 lakh ballpark (ex-showroom). The company will probably achieve this by offering simpler features compared with the iQube and either the same 2.2kWh battery pack or a slightly smaller one.  As of now, the name of the entry-level TVS e-scooter hasn’t come to light, but given the widespread popularity of the Jupiter brand, that could be a definite possibility. TVS is also working on bringing the Jupiter CNG scooter to market this year and if it does, the Jupiter will be the first two-wheeler brand to be available in petrol, CNG and electric versions.  There's also the outside possibility of this model being the electric version of the XL moped. TVS has filed patents for the names XL EV and E-XL and this could be the name that the electric moped could carry upon launch. Traditionally, the value proposition of the TVS moped has been strong and the XL 100 is the most affordable ICE two-wheeler one can buy in India today. It remains to be seen whether the upcoming TVS EV slots into the Jupiter, XL or iQube lineups or creates an altogether new brand.
