The truck is also equipped with Bilstein 5125 shocks, 15″ Rally wheels, power-assisted front disc brakes, manually locking front hubs, a removable hardtop, and chrome bumpers. This Jimmy is now offered in Massachusetts by the selling dealer with 2021-2022 service records and a clean California title. The truck was delivered from the factory finished in Medium Blue and was resprayed in preparation for the sale. Features include a white removable hardtop, quad headlights, dual side mirrors, chrome bumpers, and dual exhaust outlets. The antenna has been removed. The 15″ Rally wheels wear bright trim rings and are wrapped in 33×10.50″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain KO2 tires with 2022 date codes. A full-size spare is stored in the rear cargo area. The truck is equipped with power steering, manually locking front hubs, and an aftermarket suspension lift, and stopping power is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. A body mount kit and a quick-ratio Borgeson power steering box were fitted in 2021. Work in 2022 involved installing a power brake booster and replacement brake lines in addition to a Bilstein steering stabilizer and 5125 shocks, a U-joint steering shaft, a dropped Pitman arm, a heavy-duty front shackle kit, and more as detailed in invoices provided in the image gallery below. The refreshed cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench trimmed in blue vinyl along with a body-color dash and replacement color-coordinated carpets. Interior equipment includes a center console, lap belts, dash-mounted cupholders, and a Custom Autosound stereo with Bluetooth connectivity. Wear on the door panels and dashboard is shown up close in photos below. The two-spoke steering wheel was replaced under current ownership and fronts instrumentation consisting of a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for amperage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 7k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The 350ci V8 was factory rated at 170 net horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque and has been modified with an aluminum radiator and a custom dual exhaust system utilizing long-tube headers, a crossover pipe, and Dynomax mufflers. The alternator was replaced in November 2021. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case.
