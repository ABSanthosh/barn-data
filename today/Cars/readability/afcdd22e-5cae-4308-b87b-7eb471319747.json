  "description": "A year and a half back, we broke the news that Royal Enfield was working on a new model called the Scram 440. Internally codenamed D4K, this project is now ready and has been revealed at the 2024 Motoverse festival. Bigger engine with improved performance Minimal chassis, visual changes Royal Enfield Scram 440 details The biggest talking point is that the engine has now been upgraded from 411cc to 443. This has been achieved via a bore increase of 3mm. Power and torque have climbed from 24.3hp at 6,500rpm and 32Nm at 4,250rpm to 25.4hp at 6,250rpm and 34Nm at 4,000rpm. Another big change is that the bike now gets a 6-speed gearbox, and Royal Enfield says it has also worked on reducing the clutch effort. Other changes include refinements in the SOHC valvetrain system, which RE says will result in reduced noise. Chassis-wise, the changes are far fewer, although the company says the chassis has been strengthened in certain areas and that the bike is now capable of carrying a top box. Ground clearance is the same 200mm, and suspension travel has not changed either – 190mm at the front and 180 at the rear. Seat height has also remained at 795mm. However, the company says it has improved the braking performance by moving to a bigger piston for the front brake caliper. Kerb weight has gone up by around 2 kilos, and the bike weighs 196kg with the 15-litre fuel tank filled. Like with the existing Scram 411, the bike will come with a 19-inch/17-inch wheel setup, but this time around, Royal Enfield has incorporated numerous features based on customer feedback. The first of these is that now, there is a choice of tubeless tyres and alloy wheels, although the spoked wheels continue to be on offer. The company has also incorporated switchable ABS, which was missed on the older Scram. Visually, not a lot has changed, apart from fresh colour schemes and a new LED headlamp borrowed from the rest of RE’s line-up. The display is the same digi-analogue unit as before, and a tripper navigation pod can be selected as an optional extra. The switchgear remains conventional, unlike the rotary-style switches seen in most of RE’s line-up.   The Scram 440 will launch in January 2025, and it will be available in two variants. The top Force model gets alloy wheels and tubeless tyres, while the Trail version continues with spoked wheels. The current Scram 411 is priced between Rs 2.06 and Rs 2.12 lakh, and we expect the new bike to be priced similarly, perhaps with a small increase. Also see: Royal Enfield Goan Classic 350 unveiled",
