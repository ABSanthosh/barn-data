Now with 950 miles, the car is finished in Nitro Yellow and powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six linked with an eight-speed automatic transmission and an active rear differential. It was specified with the Safety and Technology Packages, and additional equipment include 19″ 10-spoke forged aluminum wheels, an adaptive sport suspension, Brembo front brake calipers, heated sport seats trimmed in black leather and Alcantara, carbon-fiber interior trim, a JBL sound system, and touchscreen infotainment with navigation. This Supra is now offered by the selling dealer in Washington State with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Hawaii title. The car is finished in Nitro Yellow and features matte black-finished front and rear splitters, rocker panels, and rear canards. Additional details include a double-bubble roof, an integrated rear spoiler, and six-lens auto-leveling LED headlamps with automatic high beams as well as LED taillights, front and rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. A scratch is noted on the right front splitter. The 19″ ten-spoke forged aluminum wheels are mounted with 255/35 front and 275/35 rear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires. The car rides on an adaptive variable sport suspension, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs with Brembo four-piston front calipers. The heated power-adjustable sport seats are upholstered in black leather with Alcantara inserts and red and white contrasting stitching. Carbon fiber trim accents the cabin, and appointments include adaptive cruise control, a 12-speaker JBL audio system, dual-zone automatic climate control, and an 8.8″ touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and Apple CarPlay connectivity. Driver aids consist of launch control, blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection. The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a digital gauge cluster. The odometer indicates 950 miles. The turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six was factory rated at 382 horsepower and 368 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was carried out in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF eight-speed automatic transmission and an active rear differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Servco Pacific Toyota (SPI) in Honolulu, Hawaii, and lists factory colors, equipment, options, and a total price of $56,315.
