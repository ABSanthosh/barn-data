  "description": "The world of motorcycle jackets is flooded with options that scream, “I ride; therefore, I must look like I’m about to scrape knees or win the Dakar Rally.” Enter Rynox’s Downtown Pro Jacket, which promises the right riding chops but prefers to whisper about them in a coffee shop rather than shout over an exhaust note. Available only in Midnight Black, it is rather muted and minimalistic for a riding jacket and is aimed at the urban commuter. The jacket’s touch and feel are quite premium for the price, and it still manages to be fairly practical. The fit is quite snug, and I found that the sizing chart was quite accurate. The chest panel is made of knitted polyester with infused reflective fibre that glimmers under light. There’s even a little reflective detailing that’s subtle by day and life-saving by night. While this appears a tad odd and out of place at the start, with time, I’ve begun to like its look. Pockets large enough to fit a regular size phone The jacket packs two large external pockets, usable enough to fit most things you’d need to access on the go. The shell is created using heavy-duty 3D polyester mesh and reinforced dual-stitching on slide zones. It is worth noting that while this jacket is mostly made out of mesh, the heavy-duty construction means it weighs more than a traditional mesh/textile jacket and has slightly less ventilation. Rynox also hasn’t disclosed any ratings for the abrasion resistance. Adjusters don't get in the way of folding your arm and it is easy to fine-tune the fit. In terms of comfort, the Downtown Pro does well in India’s harsh climate. The excessive use of mesh makes this a fairly breathable jacket for most seasons. While overall ventilation is quite good, it’s only during peak summer in Mumbai that I found it a bit lacking and not on par with the more affordable Cypher GT jacket. That seems like a fair trade-off to me, given the classy design. The knitted rib material used on the wrist and waist feels a lot nicer and should save you from any chafing. It is a soft and elastic material that ensures quite a snug fit. However, the downside is you won’t be able to wear a watch under your cuff, leaving it on display while riding. The front facing reflectors are integrated quite smartly into the jacket There’s also a removable internal rain liner, and the outer shell has some decent water resistance, so you can get through a short drizzle without looking like you walked out of a swimming pool. As for safety, this jacket is generously equipped with CE level 2 armour by Cerros. You get armour for your shoulders, elbows and back, along with an optional chest armour set that is sold separately. The armour is flexible, breathable, and sits flush with the body, so you don’t appear like you’re hiding a turtle shell underneath. At just Rs 5,950, the Rynox Downtown Pro punches above its weight. It is well-equipped and ventilated without breaking the bank. What’s impressive is how all this protection is integrated without ruining the silhouette. It’s very much a “ride to work, ride to dinner” kind of jacket. If your commutes are short and your evenings spontaneous, the Downtown Pro Jacket offers a presentable and perfectly comfortable option. However, if functionality and ventilation are your priority, I’d save the extra Rs 1,000 and check out the Cypher GT instead. Also see: Raida Frigate jacket review",
