  "description": "We recently reported that Mercedes-Benz had slightly rejigged the variant and equipment configuration on the new-gen E-Class, offering the Superscreen only on the top-spec AMG line trim with E 450 4Matic variant. The company has, however, now clarified that the Superscreen continues to be available as standard on all variants of the E-Class - the E 200, E 220d and E 450 4Matic.  The ‘Superscreen’ setup comprises a 12.3-inch free-standing digital instrument cluster, a 14.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen. The official statement from Mercedes-Benz India said,  \"We want to clarify, Mercedes-Benz during the initial production, manufactured a limited 72 units of the LWB E-Class without the Superscreen, some of which were also used for the certification purpose, owing to an initial shortage of Superscreen. These limited units are since sold by our Franchise Partners. Mercedes-Benz however, will continue retailing the LWB E-Class in the current E 200, E 220d variants and the upcoming E 450 variant, with the MBUX Superscreen as a standard configuration.\" The E 200 and E 220d variants come in the Avantgarde spec, while the range-topping E 450 4Matic is available in the AMG Line trim. The two trims were largely differentiated on the cosmetic front with different looking bumpers and wheels. Also See: New Mercedes E-Class review: Has the best gotten better?",
