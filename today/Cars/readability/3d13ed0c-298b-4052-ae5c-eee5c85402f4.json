  "description": "Volvo Cars has unveiled the new XC70 as a plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) for the Chinese market, bringing back a nameplate that has been inactive since 2016. Previously associated with the off-road version of the Volvo V70 station wagon, the XC70 badge now marks a full-fledged SUV. The luxury carmaker claims the latest XC70 is the brand’s first extended-range PHEV as it has a pure electric range of around 200km – the highest for any Volvo car yet. The 2025 Volvo XC70 will slot between the XC60 and XC90 SUVs upon launch. Volvo didn’t disclose details about the XC70’s performance and interior Volvo XC70 launch in China slated for later this year Launch in other markets to be explored as well New Volvo XC70 platform details Built on the new Scalable Modular Architecture, AWD to be offered Volvo says the XC70 PHEV has been developed specifically \"to meet the demand for longer-range plug-in hybrids in China\". The latest XC70 is underpinned by the new Scalable Modular Architecture (SMA), designed for range-extended electric vehicles (REXs), and Volvo describes it as \"a premium extended-range plug-in hybrid [base]\". Volvo’s parent company, Geely (headquartered in China), is investing heavily in extended-range hybrids in response to lower-than-expected demand for fully electric luxury cars. LEVC, one of Geely’s other brands, has been using a REX powertrain in its Volvo-engined TX taxi. However, unlike the TX, which uses a combustion engine solely to recharge the battery, the new Volvo XC70 has a more conventional plug-in hybrid setup. Additionally, the presence of an ‘AWD’ badge on the XC70’s boot suggests that a four-wheel-drive system will be on offer. More details about the powertrain will be revealed in the coming months. New Volvo XC70 exterior design Active shutter tech for optimised airflow borrowed from Volvo EVs The XC70 borrows visual cues from other Volvo models, like the signature ‘Thor’s Hammer’ DRLs and C-shaped tail-lights. Its front section is fully sealed, including both the nose and bumper grille, which features an active shutter system that opens and closes automatically. Inspired by Volvo EVs, the shutter optimises aerodynamics, cabin climate and cooling. Flanking the bumper are Matrix LED headlights that adapt to traffic and road conditions, enhancing both visibility and safety.  As per the Volvo XC70 images, the SUV appears slightly longer than the XC60 but shorter than the flagship XC90, positioning it between the two. The XC70 design comprises smooth lines that flow from front to rear, complemented by a gently sloping roofline. Other exterior design elements include flush-fitting door handles, aerodynamic alloy wheels, a sculpted section along the doors, and LED tail-lights (which look similar to the all-electric Volvo EX40). Rising demand for PHEVs in China Demand for electric cars slowing in the country China-bound VW ID.Era SUV (concept). Interestingly, the 2025 Volvo XC70 reveal comes just weeks after Volkswagen showed its plug-in hybrid ID.Era SUV concept for China. Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said long-range hybrid technology provides \"a perfect bridge to full electrification\" amid a slowing demand for pure-EVs. \"It enables us to maintain and develop a balanced product portfolio, while offering a highly attractive alternative to customers who are not yet ready for fully electric cars,\" he added. Volvo will explore launching the XC70 in other potential markets at a later stage.
