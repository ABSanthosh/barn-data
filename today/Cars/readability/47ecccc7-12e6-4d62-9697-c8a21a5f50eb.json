It has 3,800 miles and was acquired by the selling dealer from its original owner. This 911 Speedster is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, a battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title. The Speedster shares styling cues with the 991 GT3, including a similar front splitter and bumper covers, while features unique to the Speedster consist of a shorter windshield, a manually retractable black soft top, and a body-color carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel. This example is finished in GT Silver Metallic and was optioned with the Heritage Design Package, which adds a partially white front section, white motorsport graphics, and gold-colored Speedster badging. Additional features include LED headlights with PDLS, auto-dimming mirrors, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. Center-locking 20″ forged alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires that were installed in preparation for the sale. Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), Porsche Stability Management (PSM), and rear-axle steering were standard on the Speedster, and this example was optioned with a front-axle lift system. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes with Porsche-branded calipers. A brake line was replaced in April 2022, and a brake fluid flush was performed in January 2025. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in Cognac, while black leather covers the upper portions of the dashboard and door panels. A fire extinguisher is mounted in the passenger footwell, and additional appointments include a Bose surround sound system, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, the Light Design Package, aluminum pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control. A serialized plaque located between the seats denotes this example as #1,203 of 1,948 Speedsters produced. The three-spoke leather-wrapped GT sports steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline, a 225-mph speedometer, a configurable digital display, and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The Chrono Package adds a stopwatch to the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 3,800 miles. The naturally aspirated, GT3-sourced 4.0L flat-six features VarioCam Plus valve timing and was updated for the Speedster with revised individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors. Factory-rated power output was 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car is equipped with an optional 23.7-gallon extended-range fuel tank. The serpentine belt, battery, and engine oil were replaced, and open recalls were addressed in January 2025. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Porsche Greenwich, in Connecticut, and lists factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $312,900.
