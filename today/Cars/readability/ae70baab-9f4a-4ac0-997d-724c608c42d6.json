  "description": "Audi’s chic supermini promises class-leading luxury and sportiness - but is it past its prime? The second-generation Audi A1 promised to introduce hitherto unseen levels of luxuriousness and sportiness to the supermini class when it launched in 2019, in spite of its more mundane, Volkswagen-based origins and underpinnings.Ingolstadt has a long history with gentrified superminis like this. What started with the Audi 50 in 1974, followed by the innovative-yet-expensive A2, then the first-generation A1 in 2010, has now become the brand's showcase for technology and quality at the bottom rung of the fiscal ladder.Indeed, this car vows to continue the trend started by its forebears, promising to set new benchmarks for perceived quality, powertrain refinement and general desirability via a completely overhauled interior, striking exterior design touches from more rarefied Audi models, a range of efficiency-focused turbocharged engines and a competitive starting price.Audi hopes this will be enough to fend off talented - and, in many cases, much newer - competition from the likes of the Mini Cooper C, Fiat 500, Skoda Fabia, and Renault Clio.How, then, does it fare in the autumn of its production run, and, even in this ever-shrinking class, has it overstayed its welcome?Audi A1 range at a glanceAudi offers the A1 in a choice of three trim levels: Sport, S Line and Black Edition. S Line and Black Edition cars typically introduce differing cosmetic tweaks over Sport cars, including larger alloy wheels, various 'S' and ‘S-Line’ badges dotted around inside and out, redesigned bumpers, and, in the case of the Black Edition, darkened trim pieces. Entry-level '25 TFSI' cars come with a 1.0-litre turbocharged triple with 69bhp, which is mated to either a five-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. One level up from this is '30 TFSI', which features the same engine tuned to 114bhp and comes with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch auto. Top-rung '35 TFSI’ cars, meanwhile, get a 1.5-litre turbocharged 'evo' four-pot, which can only be had with the seven-speed DSG. All engines are, of course, sourced from the VW Group, and no diesel powerplants are available.All cars sit on passive suspension which is both lowered and stiffened if you choose a car in S-Line-trim. Each model gets torsion beam rear suspension just like every other car on Volkswagen's MQB-A0 platform; none offers four-wheel drive. The 1498cc four-pot turbo is the only engine in the range with cylinder deactivation technology, wherein it can shut down two of its cylinders to save fuel.",

  "text": "While Audi has made an effort to differentiate the A1’s cabin from that of its Volkswagen Polo and Seat Ibiza cousins by employing a slightly more tasteful palette of trim materials and switchgear, that relationship hasn’t been entirely masked. Sure, it might exude more in the way of immediate opulence on first acquaintance, but closer inspection reveals several surfaces and finishes that make it feel like the budget option. Coarse, sometimes flimsy feeling plastics that reek of cost-cutting make its VW Group DNA readily identifiable. That being said, platform-sharing means an element of sameness is inevitable, and you get more visual interest with every box you tick on the spec sheet - as is the way with a German machine. Top-specification cars, with their aluminium trim inlays, ambient lighting and leather seats, make a more convincing play of its upmarket aspirations than the lower-rung models do. All variants of the A1 come with a 10.25in digital instrument cluster, as well as an 8.8in colour touchscreen that incorporates basic infotainment features such as Bluetooth, DAB radio, voice control and USB connectivity. Strangely, Audi’s native satellite navigation system is not fitted as standard, however all cars come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  Fitment of the optional Technology Pack grants you a larger 10.1in touchscreen, wireless phone charging and an embedded sim card for 4G internet access. It’s integrated cleanly into the surrounding dash structure and, framed by attractive gloss black plastic, lends the smallest hints of Audi big-car technological sophistication. Graphically speaking, both the infotainment screen and the Virtual Cockpit are very impressive indeed, operating smoothly and without much in the way of lag. In terms of ergonomics, the touchscreen is simple to interact with when stationary, but the loss of the rotary controller used to operate earlier versions of Audi’s infotainment software means on-the-move adjustments are a bit trickier, because you have to prod a specific point on a touchscreen. At the foot of the touchscreen sits - praise be - a row of physical dials for the heating and air conditioning. Beneath that are more buttons to change the driving modes and to turn off the traction control. There’s also a rotary knob to adjust the radio volume, and the steering wheel is littered with physical controls. Not only is the A1's reliance on buttons a welcome relief for drivers looking for ease of use, but they are extremely tactile to use and hold.  Despite this and the fact that the A1's interior generally looks smart, it fails to truly differentiate itself from its VW Group siblings and justify its elevated price. That it is around £3000 more expensive than a Seat Ibiza and Skoda Fabia - both of which share engines with the A1 - isn’t easy to overlook. However, of greater concern is the competition from Mini. It might be around £1000 more expensive, but its upmarket interior is one of a kind to look at and feel - and makes the Audi's look both outdated and cheap. And while it is only a gripe, we would have expected to see a front armrest/storage cubby included as standard - especially given the - cheaper - Polo offers one across the range. While you’d be able to squeeze two adults into the Audi’s second row in relative comfort, according to our tape measure its typical rear leg room figure of 640mm is some 50mm less than that of the Polo. The A1’s 335-litre boot is also 20 litres smaller than the Polo’s, according to our measurements, though it does, at least, outdo the Mini’s 210-litre effort by a significant margin.",
