  "text": "First time offenders could get a second chance but end up limited to trips that involve work, school, and church July 7, 2025 at 21:11 by Stephen Rivers Tennessee has a new law that affects teens convicted of bullying. The state can take away their driver’s license for up to 12 months. First-time offenders can request a restricted license for work and school. Teen drivers in Tennessee may want to think twice before engaging in bullying, online or otherwise. That type of behavior could end up getting their car keys taken away. A new bill signed into law says that those convicted of bullying or even cyberbullying can lose their driving privileges for up to a year. First-time offenders can still apply for a restricted license, and lawmakers are already discussing the possibility of permitting travel to counseling sessions under future revisions. Read: Texas Is Finally Getting Rid Of Paper License Plates The new bill will affect those guilty of bullying in a few different ways, with the effect on driving being the same in most cases. Those with a valid driver’s license can have it suspended for up to 12 months. Those convicted who do not already have a license are stuck, too. The court has the power to stop the issuance of a license via the Tennessee Department of Safety. Restricted Licenses May Offer a Middle Ground Notably, this shouldn’t end up being a total hindrance in situations where a teen needs to drive to get to work or school. Those who lose their license over this new law have ten days to apply for a restricted license that only allows travel to and from work, school, and religious institutions. They’ll have to pay a $20 application fee, meet specific age requirements, and pass a driving test. If all of that goes well, the court will ultimately have to approve the restricted license and rule on where the teen is allowed to drive. While it might sound harsh to some, the goal is to make an impression before the behavior becomes a lifelong habit. Photo Honda “Bullying can cause long-term harm that results in mental health problems later in a person’s life,” State Rep. Lowell Russell told CNN. “Most acts of violence and suicides are noted as the result of being bullied. I simply got tired of nothing being done to stop bullying.” Russell also told Fox 12 that he hopes a future version of the legislation allows convicted teens to drive to therapy. “I thought that the driver’s license piece would be pretty important to get their attention. We’ll just see how it works in the future,” he said. Whether this approach makes a measurable dent in bullying rates remains to be seen. For now, Tennessee is signaling that actions have consequences, and that even a car key might come with strings attached.",
