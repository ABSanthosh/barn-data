Finished in Rosso Chiaro over beige leather upholstery, the car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 14″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, a quad-exit exhaust system, air conditioning, a gated shifter, a cassette stereo, and electric windows. This 308 GTB shows 28k miles and is offered with manufacturer’s literature, service records, a tool roll, and a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name. The 308 GTB was introduced at the 1975 Paris Motor Show and featured Pininfarina-styled bodywork. The car is finished in Rosso Chiaro and features pop-up headlights, a driver’s side mirror, a vented decklid, and quad exhaust outlets. Silver 14″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Sumitomo tires. The car features a fully independent suspension with double wishbones front and rear, and stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at each corner. The cockpit features bolstered seats trimmed in beige leather upholstery along with matching door panels. Equipment includes air conditioning, a Motorola AM/FM/cassette stereo, electric windows, and a gated shifter with a dogleg gear pattern. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel fronts Veglia instrumentation, including a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,700-rpm redline, and supplementary gauges. Additional readouts are mounted ahead of the shifter. The five-digit odometer shows 28k miles, approximately 1k miles of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 2.9L quad-cam V8 is equipped with four twin-choke Weber 40DCNF carburetors and was factory rated at 237 horsepower. The timing belt was replaced in 2021, at which time the battery was replaced and the air conditioning system was serviced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
