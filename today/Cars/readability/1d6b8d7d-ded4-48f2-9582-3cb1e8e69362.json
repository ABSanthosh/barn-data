It is powered by a 400ci V8 with a factory replacement block, a Holley carburetor, and Hedman headers, and the rear wheels are driven by a four-speed manual transmission. Red paint covers the exterior, and additional elements include retractable headlight covers, a hood-mounted tachometer, an Endura front bumper, 14″ Rally II wheels, power steering, and front disc brakes. The cabin is trimmed in red vinyl and outfitted with front bucket seats, a Hurst shifter, woodgrain trim, and an aftermarket CD player. This GTO is now offered on dealer consignment in New Jersey with a collection of spare parts, service records, and a clean New Jersey title in the current owner’s name. The car left the factory finished in Matador Red (52) and was repainted during the refurbishment in 1999, per the seller. Exterior equipment includes a color-keyed Endura front bumper, retractable headlight covers, a twin-scoop hood, a hood-mounted tachometer, and dual rolled exhaust finishers. The seller notes the body was recently polished. The 14″ Rally II wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires. A full-size spare is located in the trunk. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The front bucket seats and rear bench are upholstered in red vinyl, while faux woodgrain trim accents the instrument panel and center console. Appointments include a Hurst T-handle shifter, a padded dashboard, and an aftermarket CD receiver mounted in the glove compartment. The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 120-mph speedometer flanked by a tachometer and a combination gauge. Aftermarket readouts are mounted beneath the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 27k miles and is believed to have rolled over. Approximately 4k miles were added under current ownership, and the total mileage is unknown. The 400ci breathes through a Holley four-barrel carburetor and a chrome air cleaner assembly. The block was replaced with a factory unit some time ago, per the seller. Photos of drivetrain identification numbers are provided in the gallery. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Hedman long-tube headers flow to a dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information: Style: 69-24237 – 1969 GTO hardtop Body: ATL532533 – Atlanta assembly; body-sequence number Trim: 254 – Red Morrokide upholstery Paint: 52 – Matador Red paint 04C – Third week of April assembly A collection of spare parts and an assembly manual are included in the sale.
