Subsequent work included reupholstering the dashboard and driver’s seat bolster, performing a dry-ice cleaning, and replacing the valve cover gaskets. It is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Rosso Corsa over Crema Connolly leather. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 415 mm Cromodora alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, a single left-A-pillar-mounted monospecchio “flying mirror,” air conditioning, and a gated shifter. This Testarossa is offered in California with the factory owner’s manual and accessories along with a clean Carfax report and a clean Ohio title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features a single left-A-pillar-mounted monospecchio “flying mirror” as well as pop-up headlights, fog lights, an asymmetrical cooling duct beneath the left fog lamp, side intake strakes, quad exhaust outlets, and black rocker panels, the latter of which were refinished under current ownership along with the front spoiler. Dents on the right door were repaired and a paint correction was performed in February 2025. Silver 415 mm Cromodora five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin TRX tires that require replacement due to age. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The cockpit is trimmed in Crema Connolly leather upholstery over the seats and door panels. Interior amenities include a gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows. Work under current ownership included removing the rear speakers, reupholstering the dashboard, replacing the door weatherstripping, and repairing the driver’s seat outer bolster and window motor along with various trim pieces. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 16k miles. The 4.9-liter flat-12 was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service is said to have been performed in 2021, and service under current ownership included changing the oil and replacing the valve cover gaskets and left distributor seal. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The engine bay and underside surfaces were dry-ice cleaned in preparation for the sale. A factory owner’s manual is included in the sale, in addition to a factory tool kit, jack kit, map light, and two folding keys displayed in the gallery below.
