Finished in Grey Black and Guards Red over black leather and Alcantara upholstery, it is powered by a 3.8-liter flat-six linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential.

The car has been registered in Quebec and Ontario, and its odometer currently indicates 37k kilometers. This 997.2 GT3 RS is now offered in Canada with owner’s manuals, service records, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration. The track-focused RS model features a carbon-fiber rear wing and wider quarter panels when compared to the standard 997 GT3. This example is finished in Grey Black with Guards Red accents and exterior details include xenon headlights with washers as well as LED taillights, dual center-mounted exhaust outlets, and a Gurney flap that was added to the rear wing. Clear paint-protection film covers the paintwork, and a front lip spoiler was installed in 2020. Red-finished 19″ center-locking wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 325/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires that have 2020 production-date codes. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers along with rotors measuring 15″ and 13.8″ front and rear, respectively. Adjustable Öhlins TTX coilovers have been added, as have Road Sport Supply (RSS) suspension links and control arms. The front brakes were replaced in 2022. RS carbon bucket seats have been fitted, and they are upholstered in black leather with Alcantara inserts. Their harness-guide inserts are finished in Guards Red, along with the added roll bar, center console, and gauge bezel. The seatbelts and door-pull straps are also in red to match the exterior, and additional appointments include a Sharkwerks short shifter, a CD stereo, automatic climate control, carbon-fiber trim, and an Alcantara headliner. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel features a yellow center stripe, and it frames a central GT3-branded tachometer with an 8,400-rpm redline along with a 350-km/h speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 37k kilometers (~23k miles). The 3.8-liter Mezger flat-six features VarioCam variable valve timing as well as titanium connecting rods and dry-sump lubrication. A Dundon Motorsports D4 Street Power Package has reportedly been installed and added a non-catalyst exhaust system and a larger throttle body, though the COBB tuner has since been removed. Road Sport Supply (RSS) engine mounts have been fitted. The oil was most recently changed in July 2023 and an inspection was performed in July 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The US Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries, and a seller-provided Carfax Canada report can be viewed in the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
