  "description": "Hero’s Xpulse has long been the go-to motorcycle for riders looking for an accessible, affordable, and reasonably capable dual-sport. Hero MotoCorp now takes things a step further with the all-new Xpulse 210—a motorcycle the company says has been designed from the ground up to enhance both its highway cruising capability and off-road performance. Developed with input from Dakar rally riders, the Xpulse 210 marks a significant leap forward.  Hero Xpulse 210 design, features and ergonomics The design isn't a drastic change to the original The updated design of the Xpulse 210 has been showcased at both EICMA and Bharat Mobility. While not a drastic departure from its predecessor, it represents an evolution rather than a revolution. The Xpulse 200 straddled the line between a dual-sport and a commuter, but the 210 finds a better balance between dual-sport and ADV. The Xpulse 210 looks like a mini Africa Twin in this shade of Azure Blue. Swinging a leg over the Xpulse 210 feels familiar to the 200, as Hero has refined rather than overhauled the formula. The 210 features an offset handlebar, offering improved adjustability and reach. Additionally, Hero also sells an optional handlebar riser that allows for more height adjustments. Ergonomics are now noticeably better than before One of the key complaints with the Xpulse 200 and 200 4V was the forward-set footpeg positioning, which Hero addressed in a 2024 update. The Xpulse 210 builds on this by offering adjustable footpeg and pedal heights, further improving ergonomics. Footpegs now feel better suited for the intended purpose of this motorcycle. The new seat provides better cushioning for both rider and pillion while featuring a slimmer front section to aid shorter riders in reaching the ground. This is good because seat height has gone up from 825mm to 830mm. Seat now offers better comfort for both rider and pillion The result of all these changes is that the standing ergonomics have also improved significantly and the Xpulse 210 provides a more commanding stance. In fact, I found the standing ergonomics better on this Xpulse 210 than the all-new KTM 390 Adventure. New rear rack boasts a better design than before There has also been an improvement to the luggage mounting points with a new rear rack that is not only bigger than the one on the Xpulse 200s but also makes for a better recovery point should you need to pick the bike back up after a fall.  A nice addition that increases the number of recovery points Additionally, Hero has also added a bar near the headlamp which serves as yet another recovery point in case you find yourself in some muck and need some assistance to get out. There is also a slimmer and better-looking high-mounted exhaust and a new metal bash plate that certainly appears more durable than the one found on the  Xpulse 200s. New TFT feels a lot more premium and is quite legible Build quality has also improved, with better fit and finish. The 4.2-inch TFT display is a welcome upgrade, offering Bluetooth connectivity, navigation, and phone controls. The tactile switchgear adds to the premium feel, though the matte-finish screen reduces legibility under direct sunlight. Hero Xpulse 210 suspension, frame and brakes The Xpulse 210 has better ride quality and composure than its predecessor Beyond design improvements, the Xpulse 210 features an all-new frame and updated suspension. The front fork has been upgraded from 37mm to 41mm, increasing stiffness for better control and precision. The rear features a new progressive-linked monoshock, providing compliance over small bumps while stiffening for larger impacts. Compared to the Xpulse 200, the ride feels smoother and more predictable, improving both road and off-road stability. Suspension now feels more planted around corners The latest iteration is more stable around corners and offers a better balance between road and offroad ride quality. All in all this new setup doesn’t let the motorcycle squat or dive nearly as much as the Xpulse 200s. In fact, I’m going to go as far as to say this suspension setup is perhaps one of the nicest ones I’ve experienced from an Indian manufacturer, second only to the Royal Enfield Himalayan. There is a noticable improvement in overall handling The company says the new double-cradle frame has been chosen not only for better stress distribution but also to protect the engine from below, especially during hard landings from jumps. It now also gets a 35mm longer wheelbase, bringing it closer to a 450cc MX bike and has resulted in a 40mm increase in overall length, adding to its stability. Despite gaining nearly 10kg in weight, the Xpulse 210 feels lighter and more agile than its predecessor. Braking performance is familiar for the most part The Xpulse 210 gets the same 276mm disc at the front and 220mm disc at the rear as the Xpulse 200s. As a result, braking performance remains largely the same but feels noticeably better perhaps due to the better Eurogrip tyres and reduction in brake dive. This motorcycle now gets dual-channel ABS and also has three ABS modes (Road, Trail, Off-road) that allow you to turn off ABS selectively and can be done on the move.   Hero Xpulse 210 road and off-road performance The new 210cc engine is shared with the Karizma XMR The new 210cc engine offers an additional 5hp and 3Nm over the previous version. Though these gains may seem modest, they translate to a noticeably improved riding experience. The motor feels more responsive, particularly in the low and mid-range compared to the Karizma thanks to an increase in teeth at the rear sprocket and new cams, making inclines more manageable without constant downshifts. Motor feels more tractable and sounds better than before Highway cruising speeds too have seen an improvement with the motorcycle now cruising effortlessly between 80-100kph, while triple-digit cruising or overtakes will require a bit more effort. This makes it slightly better for long-distance travel and is yet another step to improve its all-rounder credentials.  Motor now cruises comfortably at higher speeds The sound from the new exhaust is a lot nicer and doesn’t pack the same commuter undertone as the Xpulse 200s. The motor overall feels a lot more engaging now both on and off-road greatly improving over the previous iterations shortcomings. New exhaust looks and sounds much better than before The cooling system has also been redesigned for better thermal management. However, by the end of my ride, the Xpulse 210 went into limp mode and the motorcycle wouldn’t rev beyond 6,500rpm. The company claims this was due to an increase in coolant temperature, although there was no warning sign or indication of it on the TFT. Upon inquiring with other journalists it would seem this issue was only limited to our unit. Hero Xpulse 210 verdict and price Xpulse 210 offers great value in the dual-sport space The Xpulse 210 is a significant leap forward, addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor while staying true to the core values of simplicity, affordability, and durability. At a reasonable Rs 23,000 - Rs 33,000 premium over the Xpulse 200 4V, it offers enhanced capabilities and a more refined riding experience. It’s a bike built to take on the unknown and is now more refined, beginner-friendly and feels more premium improving its overall appeal. For those of you who don't think this is capable enough, Hero has plans to launch a rally variant sometime in the future. Redesigned rear is fresh and an improvment over the Xpulse 200s All is not gold and this motorcycle has a limited dealer network. Hero has announced that this motorcycle will be available only at their Premia dealerships which currently sit at about 65 across the nation.  A proper mountain goat that is quite friendly to ride This number pales in comparison to Hero's existing dealer network and will make this motorcycle quite inaccessible for the majority out there, at least for the time being. However, for those of you located around a Premia dealership and on the lookout for a well-rounded affordable dual-sport, the Xpulse 210 makes quite a compelling case for itself.

The motor feels more responsive, particularly in the low and mid-range compared to the Karizma thanks to an increase in teeth at the rear sprocket and new cams, making inclines more manageable without constant downshifts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250321125703_24.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMotor feels more tractable and sounds better than before\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHighway cruising speeds too have seen an improvement with the motorcycle now cruising effortlessly between 80-100kph, while triple-digit cruising or overtakes will require a bit more effort.

However, by the end of my ride, the Xpulse 210 went into limp mode and the motorcycle wouldn’t rev beyond 6,500rpm. The company claims this was due to an increase in coolant temperature, although there was no warning sign or indication of it on the TFT. Upon inquiring with other journalists it would seem this issue was only limited to our unit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHero Xpulse 210 verdict and price\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eXpulse 210 offers great value in the dual-sport space\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Xpulse 210 is a significant leap forward, addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor while staying true to the core values of simplicity, affordability, and durability. At a reasonable Rs 23,000 - Rs 33,000 premium over the Xpulse 200 4V, it offers enhanced capabilities and a more refined riding experience. It’s a bike built to take on the unknown and is now more refined, beginner-friendly and feels more premium improving its overall appeal. For those of you who don\u0026#39;t think this is capable enough, Hero has plans to launch a rally variant sometime in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250321010224_4.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRedesigned rear is fresh and an improvment over the Xpulse 200s\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll is not gold and this motorcycle has a limited dealer network.
