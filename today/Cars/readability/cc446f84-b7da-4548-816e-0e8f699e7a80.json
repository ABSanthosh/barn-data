  "description": "The Lotus Emira sports car has been launched in India, starting at Rs 3.22 crore (ex-showroom) for the base Turbo variant. The Emira is Lotus’ only ICE-powered model in India – a lightweight, mid-engine sports car that embodies what this storied British brand is best known for. It was launched alongside the new Emeya, an electric hyper-GT, which joins the Eletre electric SUV in Lotus’ line-up in India. Exclusive Motors, the official partner of Lotus Cars in India, has also inaugurated the flagship Lotus Centre at the World Trade Centre in New Delhi. The Emira gets V6 and inline 4-cylinder petrol engine options It comes in three variants: Turbo, Turbo SE and V6 It has no direct rivals in India Lotus Emira powertrain, specs Lotus is offering two engine options with the Emira in India. The first is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged AMG unit, and the second is a Toyota-sourced supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine. The former comes in two states of tune – 365hp/430Nm (Turbo) and 406hp/480Nm (Turbo SE) – while the latter produces 406hp and 420Nm of peak torque. Both versions of the Emira have their engines mounted transversely, powering the rear axle. The Toyota-sourced engine is available with both a 6-speed manual and an automatic gearbox, while the AMG four-pot is only available with an 8-speed DCT gearbox. At its lightest, the Emira weighs 1,405kg. In its quickest avatar (Turbo SE), the sports car boasts a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 4 seconds and a top speed of 290kph. The Turbo SE also comes exclusively with a launch control function. Lotus Emira design, colours The Lotus Emira clearly looks like a baby Evija and has beautiful sports car proportions. The front end is specifically where it draws heavy design influence from the Evija, thanks to the design of the headlamps and the beautiful scoops on the bonnet. The prominent intakes on the sides, short overhangs and bulky haunches are some other defining characteristics. At the rear, the flat C-shaped LED light clusters are linked by an LED brake light, which sits well above the rear vents and the dual exhaust. Lotus is offering customisation options with the wheel finishes and exterior branding. The Emira Turbo and V6 come standard in Vivid Red, while the Turbo SE is available in Zinc Grey. The 20-inch Satin Grey wheels are exclusive to the Turbo SE variant. Lotus Emira interior and features Inside, the highlight is a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard. There’s also a 12.3-inch digital driver’s information display. It also gets most other modern convenience features, such as a multifunction steering wheel, a 10-channel premium sound system from KEF, optional 12-way-adjustable sports seats, cruise control, and ADAS features. The perceived quality of materials, as well as the fit and finish, is also quite remarkable. It’s a fuss-free environment that gives the driver easy access to all information and controls. Crucially, in a sports car, there are physical controls for the climate control and drive mode functions. It also fares well in terms of storage with cupholders, door pockets, a storage box between the seats, usable open space under the centre console, and storage behind the front seats for a couple of soft bags. Customers will get customisation options for interior colours and branding. The Emira is really a last-of-its-kind model from Lotus, as all future models will be electrified in some way, if not fully electric. With a starting price of Rs 3.22 crore (ex-showroom), it is certainly expensive for what is only an entry-level sports car. However, it does not have any direct rivals in India, with the Porsche 718 Cayman now gone. We have already exclusively driven the Emira in India, which you can read about here.
