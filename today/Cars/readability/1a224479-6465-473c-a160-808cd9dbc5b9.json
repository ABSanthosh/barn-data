  "description": "The Vellfire is Toyota’s big global MPV. It’s the current craze among India’s rich and famous, and has even gone on to become an unlikely red carpet regular. Mind you, this new-gen model was launched in India way back in 2023, but such has been the demand (nearly 1,200 were delivered last year), even the team at Toyota – that wouldn’t cut a queue – seemingly got their hands on their own media car only now. 2025 Toyota Vellfire exterior design and engineering: 7/10 5 metres long and 2 metres tall Vellfire has big presence You wouldn’t buy a Vellfire – or any MPV for that matter – primarily for the way it looks, but this latest-gen model does look more luxury product and less upscale airport pickup than the last one did. Of course, it’s the 5-metre length, 2-metre height and massive body that make the hulking Toyota unmissable even amidst luxury sedans and SUVs. Chrome treatment extends to 19-inch rims. Chrome details add bling to large MPV There’s more bling too. The huge 6-slat grille that almost extends to the floor is slathered in dark chrome, there’s more of the shiny stuff lining the bumper and even the headlamps sport a jewelled effect. You get the full effect of the Vellfire’s towering size at the side. Even the 19-inch rims look small amidst the vast body. A stylistic fold at the window line does give the slab-sided Vellfire some distinction in the world of MPVs. At the back, a roof spoiler and protruding bumper add some sportiness, if you will. Upward sweep of window line limits visibility for middle row passengers. The Vellfire uses a monocoque construction and is built on Toyota’s TNGA-K platform meant for large models. Toyota claims the new Vellfire is significantly stiffer in its construction yet engineered to be comfier and quieter than the last-gen model. 2025 Toyota Vellfire interior space and comfort: 9.5/10 Middle row comfort is exceptional Make what you want of the way the Vellfire looks, because the real story starts when you get inside. The first and perhaps only place of interest for the Vellfire’s chauffeur-driven clientele will be the middle row seats, access to which is via powered sliding doors. It is a bit of a step up into the living room-sized cabin. However, the short trek is worth it, ending in a pair of individual chairs that are no less than thrones. Large enough to accommodate the biggest of passengers, padded to perfection and adjustable in multiple ways, the middle row seats are among the very comfiest in the business, price no bar. Vellfire's middle row captain seats are among the comfiest in the business, price no bar.  Physical controls at the seats or detachable screens positioned on the armrests can be used to move the seats fore-aft, recline the backrest angle and raise the legrests. There’s a wide range of motion, and, at full extension, you can really stretch out business-class style to catch a power nap on the go. Heating, ventilation and massage functions only up the comfort levels. However, the upswept rear windows don’t give the panoramic view out you’d expect in an MPV. Detachable screens mounted on armrests control seat adjustment, heating, ventilation and massage.   Third row offers enough room for three adults to sit in comfort Middle-row space and comfort is just brilliant, but it isn’t too bad for your entourage at the very back either. In fact, the Vellfire’s third row is the best we’ve experienced. Access is convenient enough (through a passage between the middle seat and body) and there’s enough room for three adults to sit in comfort, which is saying something. Backrest recline is included and the seats can also be slid to maximise legroom or balance space for luggage. Access to third row is easy which has enough space for three adults.   Access to the Vellfire’s luggage area is via a powered tailgate that's large enough to do justice to the word ‘gate’. There's loads of flexibility built in: push the third row seats far forward or manually swivel them up and to the sides to free up courier van-levels of room. For all its space though, the Vellfire doesn't offer enough room for a spare tyre. Vellfire's boot offers courier van-levels of space, but there’s no provision for a spare tyre.   Cabin quality sees a huge jump over last-gen Vellfire We don’t foresee too many Vellfire owners getting into the intricacies of the front section of the cabin, but even so, the news is good. The dashboard with a wrap-around look is nicely done, but more pronounced is the huge leap up the new Vellfire has taken in terms of perceived quality. There’s more generous use of leather and padded surfaces, and even the wood-like detailing is convincing. Front seat comfort is also really good. Wraparound look to dash and high quality materials make cabin look rich and inviting.  The Vellfire gets abundant storage spaces across all three rows (including roof-mounted boxes), although the glovebox is unusually small. 2025 Toyota Vellfire features and safety: 8/10 14-inch touchscreen and digital dials are part of long equipment list The Vellfire comes loaded with goodies, so let’s break down the features set row-wise. Power adjustment for the steering and driver’s seat make it easy to find a comfy driving position, while the digital dials (limited in layout) make for easy viewing too. Also nice is the 14-inch touchscreen. The UI isn’t cutting edge, but the screen is smooth and slick, and packs in essentials like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected tech to remotely operate certain features. Physical knobs for the temperature settings also get our thumbs up. A 360-degree camera is included but feels only marginally better than the one in a Toyota Glanza (that costs a tenth!). The 15-speaker JBL sound system won’t get you enthused either. 14-inch touchscreen is smooth and slick, but UI isn't cutting edge.    Middle row passengers get lots of features and gizmos The multi-way adjustable, heated, cooled and massaging seats are the highlights in the middle row, and there’s more to make your journey comfier. Both seats pack in flip-out tray tables with a built-in vanity mirror, and there’s a 14-inch rear entertainment screen (it support Miracast and HDMI connectivity only) that folds out of the roof when summoned via the detachable control screens on the armrests. These mobile phone-sized screens (as well as buttons on the roof) can also be used to adjust the 14-colour ambient lighting, powered window sunshades and dedicated zones for the climate control system. Also, there won't be any quarreling with your co-passenger over sunroof opening thanks to the presence of individual glass panels with powered sunshades atop both seats. Middle row passengers get dedicated sunroofs. Adjustable seats, AC vents and powered sunshades for the quarter glass are features of note for third-row passengers. ADAS is part of Vellfire’s safety suite Safety kit includes six airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control and ISOFIX child seat mounts. Camera and radar-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are also included. Lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control worked well on the smooth and well-marked Coastal Road in Mumbai, though it was the Blind Spot Warning function that came in most handy when piloting the oversized Vellfire. 14-inch rear entertainment screen folds out of the roof.    2025 Toyota Vellfire performance and refinement: 7/10 Vellfire offered in India only in front-wheel drive form Before we get moving, you should know that the Vellfire is sold in India only in front-wheel-drive format. Versions on sale overseas can be had with a rear electric motor that powers the rear wheels, effectively enabling all-wheel drive when driving conditions require. As things stand, the Vellfire is the most expensive front-wheel-drive vehicle on sale in India. Strong hybrid powertrain delivers a max of 250hp Driving the front wheels via an eCVT is a strong-hybrid arrangement. The powertrain comprises a 192hp, 2.5-litre, 4-cylinder petrol engine and a 182hp electric motor. The hybrid system delivers a max power of 250hp. Vellfire doesn’t like to be rushed and feels its best in city confines.  It goes without saying that this is not a vehicle you buy for performance. If you’re in a hurry, the Vellfire is probably not the right vehicle to pick from your garage. This one’s job is to transport seven passengers in comfort. Vellfire can run in electric-only mode when battery has enough charge The Vellfire loves easy-going driving and gentle cruises, but ask anything more of it by pressing down harder on the accelerator pedal and that CVT-ness of the drivetrain comes right through. The engine will become audible and the groan stings at this price point. When there is enough charge in the battery, the Vellfire will slip into all-electric EV mode, which brings the decibel levels right back down. This is when you see the Vellfire in its best light. The Vellfire is ideal for easy-going driving and gentle cruises.  The Vellfire actually feels its best in stop-start urban confines, where the hybrid setup keeps the big Toyota in its comfort zone. It works as a long-distance vehicle too, but the powertrain simply doesn't feel as effortless as a strong diesel or even a strong turbo-petrol engine would. 2025 Toyota Vellfire ride comfort and handling: 7/10 Suspension doesn’t iron out all bumps and road noise creeps in to the cabin On the go, the VIP sat at the back will have reason to nitpick. Ride comfort is good but not good enough for a vehicle that sets you back by Rs 1.5 crore. The bumps and potholes do get filtered to quite an extent (it’s far nicer than the last Vellfire on this front), but the experience is not as pliant as it should have been. There’s also a fair bit of road noise that makes its way into the cabin, and at high speeds, you’ll hear air slamming against the A-pillar. Drivers will take some time getting used to the Vellfire’s size.    Drivers will need some time to get comfortable with the Vellfire’s size Also, the Vellfire isn’t the kind of vehicle that you just get into and get comfortable behind the wheel of. Sure, the high-set seat and large glasshouse give a commanding view of the world, but the windscreen that extends far forward makes it tricky to judge the Vellfire’s frontal extremities, at least initially. The size takes some getting used to and U-turns will need a bit of planning. There’s more ground clearance than the low floor would suggest. Ground clearance might appear inadequate but the Vellfire clears big speedbreakers without scraping its belly. No height adjustable air suspension here; the Vellfire rides on steel springs. 2025 Toyota Vellfire price and verdict: 8.5/10 Toyota Vellfire prices start at Rs 1.22 crore (ex-showroom) The Vellfire starts at Rs 1.22 crore for the Hi trim, while this VIP Executive Lounge spec is yours for Rs 1.32 crore (ex-showroom). Fun fact? That’s a crazy Rs 40 lakh-plus jump over the last-gen model’s launch price in 2020! The Vellfire is clearly not your average level-headed Toyota, nor is it your typical practicality-above-all-else MPV. It’s a luxury good and Toyota would like you to think it’s priced as such too. The Vellfire is for the chauffeur-driven who want to lounge on their way to work or home. A like-priced luxury sedan or SUV will get you more power and deliver a quieter experience, and of course, there’s the lure of a more prestigious badge too. But nothing, and I mean nothing, at this price can match the Vellfire’s rear seats for comfort. For the chauffeur-driven who merely want to lounge on their way to work or home, the Vellfire will be money well-spent. Toyota’s peace of mind ownership and a claimed 19.28kpl fuel economy figure would perhaps help strengthen the case for the Vellfire with the company CA too. But you know what? There’s an even more exclusive, more refined and comfier option from the house of Toyota – the Vellfire’s cousin. It’s called the Lexus LM, and it goes up to Rs 2.6 crore. Van damn!

Large enough to accommodate the biggest of passengers, padded to perfection and adjustable in multiple ways, the middle row seats are among the very comfiest in the business, price no bar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Toyota_Vellfire_Second_Row_Reclined_Seating.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVellfire\u0026#39;s middle row captain seats are among the comfiest in the business, price no bar. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhysical controls at the seats or detachable screens positioned on the armrests can be used to move the seats fore-aft, recline the backrest angle and raise the legrests.

In fact, the Vellfire’s third row is the best we’ve experienced. Access is convenient enough (through a passage between the middle seat and body) and there’s enough room for three adults to sit in comfort, which is saying something. Backrest recline is included and the seats can also be slid to maximise legroom or balance space for luggage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Toyota_Vellfire_Third_Row_Seating.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAccess to third row is easy which has enough space for three adults.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccess to the Vellfire’s luggage area is via a powered tailgate that\u0026#39;s large enough to do justice to the word ‘gate’.

The dashboard with a wrap-around look is nicely done, but more pronounced is the huge leap up the new Vellfire has taken in terms of perceived quality.

Power adjustment for the steering and driver’s seat make it easy to find a comfy driving position, while the digital dials (limited in layout) make for easy viewing too. Also nice is the 14-inch touchscreen. The UI isn’t cutting edge, but the screen is smooth and slick, and packs in essentials like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and connected tech to remotely operate certain features. Physical knobs for the temperature settings also get our thumbs up. A 360-degree camera is included but feels only marginally better than the one in a Toyota Glanza (that costs a tenth!). The 15-speaker JBL sound system won’t get you enthused either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Toyota_Vellfire_Touchscreen.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e14-inch touchscreen is smooth and slick, but UI isn\u0026#39;t cutting edge. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMiddle row passengers get lots of features and gizmos \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe multi-way adjustable, heated, cooled and massaging seats are the highlights in the middle row, and there’s more to make your journey comfier. Both seats pack in flip-out tray tables with a built-in vanity mirror, and there’s a 14-inch rear entertainment screen (it support Miracast and HDMI connectivity only) that folds out of the roof when summoned via the detachable control screens on the armrests. These mobile phone-sized screens (as well as buttons on the roof) can also be used to adjust the 14-colour ambient lighting, powered window sunshades and dedicated zones for the climate control system.

The engine will become audible and the groan stings at this price point.
