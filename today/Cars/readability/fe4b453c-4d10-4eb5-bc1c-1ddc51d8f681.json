Now showing 1,700 kilometers (~1k miles), the car is finished in Sparkling Silver over black cloth and powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six linked to a six-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. Additional equipment includes Super HICAS rear steering, Brembo disc brakes, 18″ wheels, a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, a carbon-fiber hood, a CD player, and automatic climate control. This R34 V-Spec II Nür is now offered in Fukuoka, Japan, with maintenance records and Japanese registration documents. This R34 is one of 81 V-Spec II Nür examples delivered from the factory in Sparkling Silver (WV2) and features a V-Spec II-specific carbon-fiber hood with a NACA duct. Additional equipment includes a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, a rear fog light, a rear wiper, an adjustable rear wing, side marker lamps, and xenon headlights. Gray-finished 18″ wheels wear GT-R-branded center caps, and they are mounted with 245/40 Bridgestone Potenza tires. An electronically-actuated Super HICAS rear-wheel-steering system was standard equipment. Stopping power is provided by gold Brembo calipers over slotted discs at all four corners. The right-hand drive cockpit features manually adjustable sport seats trimmed in textured black cloth with suede inserts. A matching rear bench is fitted, and additional equipment includes power windows and mirrors, automatic climate control, a CD player, a multifunction LCD screen, aluminum pedals, and checkerboard-pattern GT-R branded floor mats. Interior surfaces covered in plastic can be seen in the gallery. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with an airbag and frames a tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline and an inset oil pressure gauge as well as a 300-km/h speedometer and gauges to monitor coolant temperature and fuel level. A digital screen in the center of the dashboard provides additional information including boost pressure, throttle input, injector workload, and temperature readings. The digital odometer shows 1,700 kilometers (~1k miles). The twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six came from the factory with a reinforced N1 engine block and is equipped with individual throttle bodies, dual overhead camshafts, and 24 valves. A strut bar extends over the gold-finished valve cover. Power is delivered to the wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA four-wheel-drive system. The V-Spec II came standard with an electronically controlled active limited-slip rear differential. The gold firewall-mounted chassis tag decodes as follows: G – Two-door coupe GJ – RB26DETT P – 4WD Super HICAS R – RHD W – V-spec Y – Six-speed manual R34 – Model Z – Twin-turbo D – Standard A – Four-person seating capacity A – Super-fine hardcoat G – Rear window wiper, privacy glass V – V-Spec II Nür Spec, advanced aero system, multi-display meter, large rear brakes – Standard D – Rear fog lamp The selling dealer notes that the car is ineligible for importation into the US before February 2027.
