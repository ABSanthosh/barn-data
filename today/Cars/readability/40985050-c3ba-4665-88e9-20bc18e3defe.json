  "description": "This 1969 Shelby GT500 is one of 1,157 fastbacks produced for the model year. It was originally specified in Black Jade with a four-speed manual, a Traction-Lok differential, a Sport Deck rear seat, white upholstery, power steering and front disc brakes, a tilt-away steering column, and a tachometer and odometer. The car was given as a gift to its former owner circa 2004, and it was primarily stored until it was acquired by the seller in 2022. Approximately $25k was spent in 2024 to recommission the car, including overhauling the brakes and suspension, replacing the weather seals, heater core, and servicing the 428ci Cobra Jet V8. This Shelby GT500 is now offered in Canada with a Deluxe Marti report, a window sticker, the owner's manual, and Ontario registration.",

It was originally specified in Black Jade with a four-speed manual, a Traction-Lok differential, a Sport Deck rear seat, white upholstery, power steering and front disc brakes, a tilt-away steering column, and a tachometer and odometer. The car was given as a gift to its former owner circa 2004, and it was primarily stored until it was acquired by the seller in 2022. Approximately $25k was spent in 2024 to recommission the car, including overhauling the brakes and suspension, replacing the weather seals, heater core, and servicing the 428ci Cobra Jet V8. This Shelby GT500 is now offered in Canada with a Deluxe Marti report, a window sticker, the owner’s manual, and Ontario registration. The GT500 was built with a fiberglass nose, front fenders, and a vented hood with NACA-style hood inlets, as well as fog lights, quarter panel vents, Shelby badging, a trunk lid spoiler, and dual square center-exit exhaust outlets. This example was specified in Black Jade (C) and has white side stripes and tinted glass. The wiper cowl was stripped and refinished under current ownership, and the door glass, weather seals, door and trunk lid bumpers, and the right door stopper were also replaced. The seller notes paint chips on the door edges and bubbles in the paint on the trunk lid. The car retains 15″ Shelby wheels, which have been mounted with 215/65 Cooper Cobra tires. The front calipers and rotors were replaced in 2024 along with the master cylinder, sway bar links, control arms, strut rod bushings, upper ball joints, and upper arm bushings. The seller notes the center console is broken, the upholstery is discolored in spots, and the clock, radio, and tilt-away steering column do not work. The right-side courtesy light, the door speaker grilles, and the heater core, heater box, and blower motor were all replaced by the seller. The three-spoke steering wheel frames an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 140-mph speedometer, and gauges displaying fuel level and coolant temperature. Additional auxiliary readouts are mounted forward of the gear shifter and indicate oil pressure and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 60k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The 428ci Cobra Jet V8 is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor, a ram-air intake assembly, and finned valve covers. Output was factory rated at 335 horsepower and 440 lb-ft of torque. The seller replaced the following: Exhaust manifold gaskets Ignition wires Spark plugs Ignition coil Left-bank valve stem seals Water pump Fluids Hood springs Fan resistor Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Toploader close-ratio four-speed manual transmission and a Traction-Lok limited-slip differential. The Deluxe Marti report lists colors, production information, and optional equipment. A set of Goodyear Polyglass tires are included along with records displayed in the gallery. The car is sold with its Ontario registration, which acts as the ownership document. The registration carries an “Unplated” note. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
