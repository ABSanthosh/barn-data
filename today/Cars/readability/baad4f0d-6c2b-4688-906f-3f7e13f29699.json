  "description": "This 2021 Porsche 911 GT3 Cup was delivered new to Allied-Racing GmbH of Germany and campaigned in several Porsche Carrera Cup Deutschland races in Europe during the 2021 season, including ADAC GT Masters series events, along with the International GT Open in Monza and the FIA World Endurance Championship in Spa-Francorchamps. It was imported to the US in August 2022 and purchased by the current owner after it was listed on BaT in December 2022. Power is from a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed sequential transaxle that was rebuilt in September 2023. A Rothmans-livery vinyl wrap was added over the aluminum-steel composite bodywork under current ownership, and a factory anti-lock braking and traction control system were added. Other features include a carbon fiber decklid and doors, a swan-neck rear wing, full roll cage with door bars, Sabelt fixed-back bucket seat with head restraints, fire suppression system, Schroth harnesses, Brembo disc brakes, an air jack system, and center-lock 18” wheels. This 992 GT3 Cup is being offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a binder of documentation, service records, a Wagenpass, two spare sets of wheels, a spare set of Michelin slicks, and a bill of sale.",

Power is from a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed sequential transaxle that was rebuilt in September 2023. A Rothmans-livery vinyl wrap was added over the aluminum-steel composite bodywork under current ownership, and a factory anti-lock braking and traction control system were added. Other features include a carbon fiber decklid and doors, a swan-neck rear wing, full roll cage with door bars, Sabelt fixed-back bucket seat with head restraints, fire suppression system, Schroth harnesses, Brembo disc brakes, an air jack system, and center-lock 18” wheels. This 992 GT3 Cup is being offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a binder of documentation, service records, a Wagenpass, two spare sets of wheels, a spare set of Michelin slicks, and a bill of sale. The GT3 Cup features aluminum-steel composite bodywork with fender extensions, a removable roof section, polycarbonate windows, a ventilated hood, LED headlights and taillights, and a carbon fiber swan-neck rear wing, decklid, and doors. This example features a Rothmans-livery vinyl wrap that was applied over its silver paint under current ownership. Additional equipment includes an integrated rear rain light, tow straps, a rear diffuser, and a front lip spoiler. The hood and front bumper cover have reportedly been repainted. Gray-finished 18” center-lock wheels are mounted with treaded Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Two sets of wheels with slicks are included in the sale. The brake system utilizes Brembo calipers and ventilated rotors, along with two independent circuits that incorporate front and rear axle brake pressure sensors with a driver-adjustable brake balance system. A factory anti-lock braking and traction control system was added under current ownership. The car rides on adjustable double wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension and is equipped with an air jack system. The cabin houses a single fixed-back Sabelt carbon fiber-shelled bucket seat with head restraints and six-point Schroth harnesses. Equipment includes carbon fiber door panels with pull straps, a welded padded roll cage with door bars, a window net, and a fire suppression system. The passenger seat and RaceLogic module mounted on the dashboard are not included in the sale. A multifunction carbon fiber-reinforced plastic steering wheel with a quick release and illuminated push buttons sits ahead of paddle shifters and a Porsche-branded digital touchscreen display with integrated shift lights. The display shows approximately 10k kilometers (~6k miles) and 93 hours of run time. The 4.0-liter flat-six is equipped with dry-sump lubrication with an oil-water heat exchanger and a race exhaust system for a factory-rated output of 502 horsepower and 347 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed sequential transaxle and a mechanical limited-slip differential. The transaxle was rebuilt at Heinlein Racing Development of Ledgewood, New Jersey, in September 2023. The rear axles were replaced and an oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Two spare sets of wheels are included in the sale, along with a set of unused Michelin slicks. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
