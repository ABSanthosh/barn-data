  "description": "This 2023 Ford GT is the first of 67 track-only Mk IV examples built by Ford Performance and Multimatic Motorsports to commemorate Ford's victory at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. Custom ordered by the selling dealer, chassis #001 wears a one-off #1 Frozen White and blue livery in tribute to the first 1966 GT40 Mk IV prototype, chassis J-1. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.8-liter EcoBoost V6 paired with an Xtrac seven-speed sequential transaxle and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Equipment includes Multimatic Adaptive Spool Valve dampers, carbon-fiber longtail bodywork, a center-exit exhaust with purple powder-coated pipes, Alcon carbon-ceramic brakes, gold-finished 18\" center-lock wheels and radiator intakes, carbon-fiber fixed-back seats trimmed in blue leather with custom chrome ventilation grommets, a roll cage, a fire-suppression system, a multi-function steering yoke, and side-view cameras with MoTeC display screens. This Ford GT Mk IV has three miles, and it is now offered by the selling dealer as part of The Ford GT Legends Tribute Collection from Legendarymotorcar in Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada, with a build sheet, factory literature, and a bill of sale.",

This Ford GT Mk IV has three miles, and it is now offered by the selling dealer as part of The Ford GT Legends Tribute Collection from Legendarymotorcar in Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada, with a build sheet, factory literature, and a bill of sale. The Mk IV is the final variant of the second-generation Ford GT, and it was inspired by the 12 Mark IV “J-Car” prototypes that were built in 1966 and 1967, including chassis J-5, which was driven to victory by Dan Gurney and AJ Foyt at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. The GT Mk IV features model-specific carbon-fiber longtail bodywork and aero equipment as well as a longer wheelbase compared to the standard Ford GT. This example was ordered by the selling dealer in a one-off livery that was inspired by J-1, the first GT40 Mk IV, or J-car, prototype. The livery includes Frozen White paint with a dark blue nose and side stripes, #1 graphics, gold-color side-mounted radiator intakes, blue leather interior upholstery, and a dual exhaust with blue powder-coated tips. Hampton Gold-finished 18″ centerlock wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport slicks. The Mk IV features a pushrod suspension with Multimatic Adaptive Spool Valve dampers as well as Bosch motorsport traction control and anti-lock braking systems. Stopping power is provided by Alcon carbon-ceramic brakes. The cabin features carbon-fiber fixed-back seats trimmed in blue leather with custom chrome ventilation grommets and Sparco harnesses. Equipment includes a full roll cage, a fire-suppression system, drilled pedals, and a rotary gear selector. The carbon-fiber multi-function steering yoke fronts a configurable display flanked by MoTeC side-view camera display screens. The odometer shows three miles. The twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 was enlarged to 3.8 liters for the Mark VI, and it is factory rated at over 800 horsepower. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an Xtrac seven-speed sequential transaxle and a mechanical limited-slip differential. The build sheet is presented above, and it lists optional equipment as well as a total price of $1,806,100. The car does not have a title, as it is a race car not intended for road use. It is being sold on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
