  "text": "Cadillac is recalling the Lyriq over an issue that can cause their speedometer and rearview camera to disappear June 5, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Cadillac is recalling over 40,000 Lyriqs with displays that can go blank. The 2023 and 2024 models will receive updated software to address the issue. The update can be delivered over-the-air or installed at local dealerships. The Cadillac Lyriq has been a hit for General Motors and has attracted new customers to the brand. However, the electric crossover is now the subject of a sizable recall. 41,376 vehicles from the 2023 and 2024 model years are impacted as they’re equipped with a 33-inch curved display that can go blank while being driven. This poses a safety risk as it could disable the instrument cluster, rearview camera, and other federally mandated safety features. More: 2026 Lyriq-V Boasts 615 HP, Is The Quickest Cadillac Ever The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says GM opened an investigation in March after the government inquired into customer complaints alleging display malfunctions. This identified 1,209 vehicles which reportedly had issues with their screens going blank. Looking into the data, the company found the “vast majority of these incidents occurred in 2023-2024 model year vehicles equipped with video display control modules” that were not updated to the latest software. While the automaker wasn’t aware of any injuries or accidents related to the issue, they decided to conduct a recall. Since this is a software issue, the fix is pretty straight forward as it can be addressed through an over-the-air update. Customers can also take their vehicle to the dealership to have it updated by a technician.",
