  "description": "This 1962 Mercedes-Benz 190SL was delivered new at the factory in Sindelfingen, Germany, on January 11, 1962, and was subsequently purchased out of Spain by a late friend of the seller's father who was stationed there with the US Air Force. It was then brought it to the US, where it remained with the friend and first owner until the late 1990s. Chassis 023533 was acquired by the seller's father in 1997 and subsequently underwent a color change to burgundy red, an interior re-trim in cream leather, and a rebuild of the 1.9-liter M121 inline-four as part of a multi-year refurbishment completed in 2000. The car wears a tan soft top and is accompanied by a removable body-color hardtop, while the engine is equipped with dual Solex PHH carburetors and mated to a four-speed manual transmission. Further equipment includes a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio and VDO instrumentation along with power-assisted drum brakes and 14″ steel wheels with body-color hubcaps. This 190SL is now offered by the seller on behalf of their father with a copy of a 1962 Spanish-language invoice, manufacturer's literature, a car cover, spare parts, and a clean Texas title in their father's name.",

Further equipment includes a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio and VDO instrumentation along with power-assisted drum brakes and 14″ steel wheels with body-color hubcaps. This 190SL is now offered by the seller on behalf of their father with a copy of a 1962 Spanish-language invoice, manufacturer’s literature, a car cover, spare parts, and a clean Texas title in their father’s name. The car left the factory finished in Graphite Grey (190) and was repainted in burgundy red as part of the aforementioned refurbishment performed from 1997 to 2000. It wears a tan soft top with a matching top boot and is accompanied by a body-color removable hardtop. Further details include a bright windshield surround, grille, and bumpers with overriders. A majority of the photos provided by the seller were taken in November 2024. The seller notes various blemishes in the paintwork. The 14″ steel wheels wear body-color hubcaps as well as polished accents and are mounted with whitewall tires. The car is equipped with a double-wishbone front suspension, rear swing axles with coil springs, and power-assisted drum brakes. A brake fluid flush was completed in preparation for the sale. The cabin features low-back bucket seats upholstered in cream leather, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the dash surround as well as the door panels. Amenities include a push-button Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, an analog clock, and a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror. The seller notes that the radio works, although the sound quality is poor. A two-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a 140-mph speedometer and a 7k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, water temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 8k miles, which is said to represent the mileage added since completion of the refurbishment. The 1.9-liter M121 inline-four was factory rated at 104 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque. The seller tells us that the engine and dual Solex PHH carburetors were rebuilt by S\u0026S Imports of Dallas, Texas, as part of the aforementioned refurbishment completed in 2000. An engine oil and coolant change was completed in preparation for the sale, and the seller recommends tuning the carburetors. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a fully synchronized four-speed manual transmission. A Spanish-language invoice from Daimler-Benz notes a January 11, 1962, delivery date at the factory in Sindelfingen, Germany, and lists factory equipment and colors. A collection of additional documents and spare parts will accompany the car and can be viewed in the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
