Finished in Nero DS over Beige leather, the car is further equipped with a black convertible soft top, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a Challenge-style rear grille, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, an Alpine stereo, and automatic climate control. The car was sold on BaT in April 2020 and was acquired by the selling dealer in 2022. This 360 Spider has 34k miles and is offered in Georgia with service records, a tool kit, a Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum body is finished in Nero DS and features a power-retractable black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and quad exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. Damage to the front of the car is noted in a 2021 entry on the Carfax report, which also lists damage to the roof in 2024. The convertible top boot does not function properly and the seller notes a paint imperfection on the left front fender. The 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Hankook Ventus V12 Evo2 tires measuring 215/45 up front and 275/40 out back. Stopping power is from red-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at each corner. The cockpit features power-adjustable Daytona-style seats upholstered in Beige leather along with matching door panel inserts and carpets. Amenities include an Alpine stereo, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control. Sticky buttons and several interior surfaces were refinished under previous ownership. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a digital fuel level readout and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. Paddle shifters for the F1 gearbox are mounted behind the steering wheel. The digital odometer indicates 34k miles, approximately 600 of which have been added by the selling dealer. The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Modifications include carbon-fiber engine bay trim, Seca Competizione exhaust headers, Hyper-Flow catalytic converters, and a Tubi exhaust system. The selling dealer notes that aftermarket engine management software has been installed. The timing belts were replaced in April 2022. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an electrohydraulic six-speed F1 sequential transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch assembly was replaced in 2012. The Carfax report notes the aforementioned damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
