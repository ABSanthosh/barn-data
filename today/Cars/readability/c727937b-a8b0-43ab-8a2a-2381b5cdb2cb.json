  "description": "The Tata Altroz facelift has finally broken cover, marking the first major update to the premium hatchback since its January 2020 launch. This facelift brings comprehensive changes to the Altroz’s styling, interior layout and feature list, while retaining the existing powertrain line-up. The Altroz facelift will be available in five variants, namely Smart, Pure, Creative, Accomplished S, and Accomplished+ S. Tata Altroz facelift gets new LED headlights, connected tail-lamps, etc Cabin updated with new digital cluster and other features Altroz remains the only diesel hatchback on sale in India 2025 Tata Altroz facelift exterior design Substantial changes on the outside The Altroz facelift gets a thoroughly revised front end, with new full-LED split headlights with updated signatures for the daytime running lights, a new grille design with layered rectangular elements, and a redesigned front bumper with vertical recesses for the fog-lamp housings. Over to the side, notable updates include flush-fitting illuminated door handles and new 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. At the rear, the Altroz facelift comes with new horizontal T-shaped LED tail-lamps, now connected by an LED light bar that adds visual width and looks slightly similar to that of the Hyundai Venue. There’s also a sportier dual-tone rear bumper and ‘Altroz’ lettering on the lower end of the tailgate. There are five colour options to choose from – Dune Glow, Ember Glow, Pristine White, Pure Grey, and Royal Blue. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift interior and features Cabin changes inspired by Nexon and Curvv Inside, the Altroz facelift has been refreshed with a cleaner dashboard design. Its cabin lifts several components from the Tata Nexon and Curvv, such as the 2-spoke steering wheel, 10.25-inch all-digital instrument cluster, and auto AC controls, to name a few. Tata has also added some features that were previously exclusive to the outgoing Altroz Racer variant. Meanwhile, features like an electric sunroof, cruise control, rear AC vents, ambient lighting, 90-degree opening doors, automatic headlights and wipers, and a 360-degree camera, among others, have been carried forward from the current model. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift engine and gearbox No changes under the hood The Altroz facelift continues with the same powertrain options as the outgoing model: an 88hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine with a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, a 74hp factory-fitted CNG version with a 5-speed manual, and a 90hp 1.5-litre diesel engine with a 5-speed manual. Notably, in India, the Altroz is the only hatchback that offers a diesel engine. It remains to be seen if the Altroz facelift will also offer the 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox powertrain available with the current Altroz Racer. 2025 Tata Altroz facelift price and rivals Prices yet to be announced The facelifted Altroz competes in the premium hatchback segment against the Hyundai i20, Maruti Suzuki Baleno and Toyota Glanza. Tata has yet to announce pricing for the Altroz facelift, but expect a slight increase over the outgoing model’s ex-showroom price range of Rs 6.65 to 11.30 lakh.
