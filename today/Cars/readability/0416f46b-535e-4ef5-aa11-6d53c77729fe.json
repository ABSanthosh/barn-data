  "description": "Launched in 2022 as Kia’s first EV in India, the EV6 has always stood out for its striking design, innovative cabin and punchy performance. There’s now an updated version out that promises more range, and we’ve put it through its paces to see how it performs. Kia EV6 Range and Efficiency - 9/10 Larger 84kWh battery translates into an impressive 498km combined real-world range. Composed road manners, hushed cabin make it a relaxing drive. With this facelift, the EV gets a new, larger 84kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) battery, replacing the older 77.4kWh unit. This new battery is not only more energy-dense but also lighter. The WLTP range has increased to 581km, up by 53km. Impressively, in real-world conditions, we managed a combined range of 498km, which is closer than usual to the official figure. City driving yielded an efficiency of 5.18km/kWh, which translates to a usable range of around 435km. Interestingly, highway efficiency was even better at 6.67km/kWh, delivering a range of approximately 560km. It’s worth noting, however, that ambient temperatures rose by 12 degrees during our city run, which meant the AC was working harder to keep the cabin cool, impacting efficiency. Also, while we used Level 3 (out of 4) regen braking in the city, it wasn’t strong enough to bring the car to a complete halt and didn’t recoup much. As for charging, the EV6 supports ultra-fast DC charging at speeds of up to 350kW, allowing it to go from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes. Kia EV6 Exterior Design and Engineering - 9/10 Gets new headlights, bumpers and alloys; still based on the born-EV E-GMP skateboard platform. On the outside, changes to the EV6 are subtle but impactful. The most noticeable update is the new headlights, which now feature a hook-like LED DRL signature, adding to the futuristic appeal, and there’s a full-width LED strip connecting the headlights. The facelift is offered exclusively in the sportier GT-Line trim in India. There are new bumpers at both ends and a fresh design for the 19-inch alloy wheels. Minor tweaks to the LED elements in the rear lightbar further refine the appearance. Under the skin, it continues to be based on the E-GMP skateboard platform, with its advanced 800V electrical architecture, shared with the Hyundai Ioniq 5. The EV6 remains a substantial car, measuring nearly 4.7 metres in length and 1.9 metres in width, with a generous 2.9-metre wheelbase. Kia EV6 Interior Space and Comfort - 8/10 Comfy front seats feature heating, ventilation and a zero-gravity mode; rear seat wide enough for three adults, but you’re sat in a knees-up position. Rear is spacious for three, but you’re sat knees-up. Step inside, and you’ll find that the cabin retains its familiar layout but with some updates. A more conventional three-spoke steering wheel replaces the old two-spoke unit, the dashboard gets new textures, and the screens get new software and a user interface. The twin 12.3-inch high-definition screens are crisp and intuitive, with logically arranged menus. While they operate smoothly, they are prone to reflections, and the new minimalist themes, though modern, can appear a bit sparse. It’s also worth noting that the fingerprint scanner seen at the Auto Expo 2025 is absent in the version on sale. New UI is easy to use, logically laid out, and follows a minimalist theme. Comfort levels are high, especially in the front seats, which offer firm but supportive cushioning. A standout feature is the zero-gravity mode, allowing the front occupants to fully recline and relax when the car is stationary. The rear bench is spacious enough to accommodate three adults with ease. There’s ample knee and headroom, and the backrest reclines for additional comfort. However, thigh support is compromised due to the high floor, and window blinds have been given a miss. Boot space stands at a respectable 490 litres, but the compartment is shallow. There’s also a frunk, though it’s small at 20 litres.   Kia EV6 Performance and Refinement - 9/10 Performance is strong and feels seamless to drive; wind and road noise is well-contained. The EV6 continues with the same dual-motor setup, producing 325hp and 605Nm. The claimed 0-100kph time is 5.3sec (just 0.1sec slower than before), but we managed a quicker 5.16sec in our testing. Roll-on acceleration is impressive too, with 20-80kph despatched in 2.77sec and 40-100kph in 3.49sec. Performance, then, remains a strong suit. The EV6 feels very natural to drive, thanks to well-calibrated acceleration. Unlike EVs of old, the EV6 serves up its power in a progressive manner rather than in one big chunk, which aids drivability. The all-wheel-drive system also ensures excellent traction, helping put down the power effectively. Drive modes alter the car’s behaviour – Eco softens responses to maximise efficiency, Sport sharpens everything up, and Individual lets drivers customise settings to their preference.

When it comes to ride and handling, the EV6 strikes a good balance. Around corners, it feels confident and composed, with good grip levels. The steering offers decent weight in Sport, though it lacks feedback. Despite riding on large 19-inch wheels, the EV6 maintains good ride comfort. It can feel a touch firm at lower speeds but settles nicely as you go faster, delivering a pliant and absorbent ride. There are some vertical movements at higher speeds, but they’re well-contained. Cabin insulation is impressive, too, with minimal wind or road noise. Kia EV6 Features and Safety - 9/10 Features two 12.3-inch screens, Meridian audio system, ADAS tech and has V2V, V2L capabilities.  The EV6 remains generously equipped. Highlights include a sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, two 12.3-inch displays, wireless smartphone integration, wireless charging, ambient lighting, a head-up display, and a top-tier 14-speaker Meridian audio system. A larger sunroof would’ve helped the sense of space, especially given that the upholstery is black. On the safety front, it features 8 airbags, a 360-degree camera, and a comprehensive ADAS suite. This includes adaptive cruise control, autonomous emergency braking, and lane-keep assist. Additionally, the EV6 supports both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-load (V2L) functions, enabling it to charge other EVs or power external appliances. Kia EV6 Price and Verdict - 7/10 A well-rounded and premium package, with great real-world performance and range. Imported as a completely built unit (CBU), the Kia EV6 facelift is priced at Rs 65.97 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which positions it higher than its rivals, such as the Ioniq 5, BMW iX1 LWB and BYD Sealion 7. However, some dealerships are offering substantial discounts, which could bring it into your budget. Overall, the Kia EV6 continues to impress with its futuristic styling, premium interiors, and generous features list. Performance remains strong, and the improved real-world range makes it even more appealing. While it may lack a premium badge, the EV6 delivers a genuinely premium experience and stands out as one of the most well-rounded EVs on sale today.

Drive modes alter the car’s behaviour – Eco softens responses to maximise efficiency, Sport sharpens everything up, and Individual lets drivers customise settings to their preference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv oncopy=\"return false\" onpaste=\"return false\" oncut=\"return false\"\u003e\u003ctable\u003e\u003cthead\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"\u003eKia EV6 facelift performance as tested\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/thead\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-20kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e0.82s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-40kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e1.61s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-60kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e2.51s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-80kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e3.64s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-100kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e5.16s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e0-120kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e7.12s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e20-80kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e2.77s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e40-100kph\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e3.49s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eBraking (80-0kph)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003e27.54m; 2.47s\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e  \u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKia EV6 Ride Comfort and Handling - 8/10\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRide is pliant despite large 19-inch wheels; feels planted around corners.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Kia EV6 corner\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Kia_EV6_GT_Line_Cornering.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"2025 Kia EV6 corner\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to ride and handling, the EV6 strikes a good balance.
