  "description": "A few months after launching the all-new Chetak 35 series, Bajaj has introduced the most affordable variant in the line-up. The new Chetak 3503 is priced at Rs 1.10 lakh and uses the same battery and new chassis as the more expensive models but gets fewer features.  Bajaj Chetak 3503 has a claimed range of 155km 3503 uses front drum brake, colour LCD display It has a lower 63kph top speed and a slower charging time Bajaj Chetak 3503 launch details 3503 gets the same range and big boot as other 35 variants The Bajaj Chetak 3503 uses the same basic architecture as the other 35 variants, which means you get a 3.5kWh battery delivering a claimed range of 155km. Since it also uses the same chassis as the higher variants, the 3503 also gets a big 35 litre boot. However, unlike other variants, the Chetak 3503 has a lower top speed (claimed) of 63kph. The feature set, too, is a little simpler on the Chetak 3503. It uses a colour LCD display with basic Bluetooth connectivity, has a longer charging time (0-80 percent SOC takes 3 hour and 25minutes, compared to 3 hours on the other Chetak 35 models), doesn’t get sequential indicators, and has a drum brake at the front unlike the disc on the other two. At the same time, it isn’t completely barebones and has the same two riding modes (Eco and Sports), hill-hold assist and the full metal body that is a hallmark of the Chetak.   With a price tag of Rs 1.10 lakh (ex-showroom), the Bajaj Chetak 3503 sits comfortably below the 3502 (Rs 1.22 lakh) and 3503 (Rs 1.30 lakh). However, Bajaj has still kept the 2903 variant, which comes with the smaller 2.9kWh battery and 123km claimed range, on sale. Priced at Rs 98,498, it is currently the entry-level model in the Chetak line-up. Similiarly priced rivals to the Bajaj Chetak 3503 include the Ather Rizta S, Ola S1 X+ and TVS iQube 3.4.   Also See: TVS iQube 2.2 real world range tested and explained",
