The entire LX line-up has received tech and feature updates Now, the SUV is also available in Overtrail form Hybrid puts out 463hp and 790Nm, as per preliminary prototype figures Lexus LX 700h: what’s new? Before the introduction of the LX 700h, the LX SUV was the only Lexus model sans an electrified version. The LX 700h packs a new parallel hybrid tech that combines an electric motor with a twin-turbo, 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine mated to a 10-speed automatic gearbox. The same V6 petrol-hybrid engine will also power the soon-to-be-updated Toyota Land Cruiser 300. Like other LX SUVs, the 700h also has four-wheel drive. Lexus’ preliminary prototype figures put the combined power output at 463hp and 790Nm. As for the updates to the LX line-up, the SUV now has a revamped 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and faster wireless charging pads. Its VIP and Executive variants even boast massage programmes, including full-body and targeted options with varying intensity levels. Lexus has also introduced an off-road-focused “Overtrail” edition for the LX; this edition is also available with a few other Lexus models, including the new Land Cruiser Prado-based Lexus GX. The LX Overtrail sports unique alloy wheels with all-terrain tyres, an exclusive Moon Desert paint, blacked-out grille and other accents, which add to its rugged persona. Its cabin is draped in a low-saturation monolith upholstery with ash burl black accents.  The Overtrail package includes front and rear differential locks, along with the central differential lock, which is standard on all LX trims. The updated LX line-up, along with the LX700h, will go on sale in North America first, followed by other markets.
