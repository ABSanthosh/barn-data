  "text": "If you want Hemi power, you might need a heavy duty pickup in the future November 1, 2024 at 19:51 by Michael Gauthier Stellantis has been going on a killing spree, eliminating Hemi-power from an assortment of models. Despite being increasingly rare, the 6.4-liter Hemi V8 will apparently survive well into the future. That remains to be seen, but the engine powers the SEMA-bound Ram 2500 Power Wagon concept. Hemi-power used to define Dodge and Ram, but the once ubiquitous engine is becoming increasingly rare. Besides being absent in the redesigned Dodge Charger, the HEMI has been dropped from the facelifted Ram 1500 as well as recent versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer. While the engine family continues to live on in a handful of models – including the Durango and Wrangler 392 (Not So) Final Edition – the writing was largely seen to be on the wall. However, one version of the popular powertrain might be sticking around for awhile.

In particular, the SEMA-bound Ram 2500 Power Wagon concept has a 6.4-liter Hemi V8. While it’s technically a concept, the truck is based on the facelifted heavy duty pickup and previews the production model that will debut later this year. Ram hasn’t said much about it, but the initial focus has largely centered on the “improved” Cummins turbodiesel engine. Ram 2500 Power Wagon Concept However, with the concept featuring a 6.4-liter Hemi V8, it appears the powertrain will continue to be offered in the facelifted pickup. In the current model, it produces 410 hp (306 kW / 416 PS) and 429 lb-ft (582 Nm) of torque. Only time will tell what happens, but rumors had suggested the Hemi would survive in the heavy duty pickup. Its appearance in the concept seems to confirm this, but we’ll find out for sure later this year. 2025 Ram HD Lineup",
