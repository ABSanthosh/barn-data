  "text": "Since they first hit the scene, Auto Fabrica has flirted with the concept of motorcycles as art pieces. The machines they build often feel like elegant concept bikes, but stop short of being so abstract that they become useless ornaments. This Ducati Scrambler 1100 embodies that philosophy. Labeled ‘T23,’ this is, remarkably, the first Ducati that the English workshop has customized. “We wanted to design and build something with a unique style,” says Bujar Muharremi, who runs Auto Fabrica with his brother, Gaz. “It was during the time when we were finishing our first bike with an integrated seat cover—Type 17—and wanted to really explore this idea on a slick concept-style build.” To give themselves a head start, Bujar and Gaz started with a 2024-model Ducati Scrambler 1100 Pro. The simplicity of the Scrambler 1100’s air-cooled motor appealed to the brothers, and the Öhlins and Brembo parts on the ‘Pro’ spec bike negated the need for any additional suspension or brake upgrades. Auto Fabrica started by lowering the front forks to create a more aggressive stance, before blacking out the suspension at both ends. Next, they grafted on the single-sided swingarm from a Ducati Hypermotard 821—which meant also fabricating a new upper shock mount. Braided stainless steel brake hoses were fitted to give the Brembo brakes an ounce more bite. The Scrambler 1100 now rolls on a set of gorgeous carbon fiber wheels, built to spec by Rotobox. They’re wrapped in Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa tires, which AF adorned with white accents to riff off the wheels’ 10-spoke design. A handmade aluminum fender hugs each wheel. Moving to the frame, AF trimmed off any superfluous tabs and lopped off the OEM subframe. A new tubular unit was fabricated in its place, primed to accept new handmade bodywork. The Ducati’s new fuel tank, tail section, and seat cover are all one-off aluminum parts. With the cover installed, the whole arrangement cuts a sculpted silhouette from front to back. Removing it reveals a suede seat, while a slim LED taillight does duty out back. “From a design point of view, the seat cover gives the bike two personalities—one where it’s covered and stationary, and another when you’re riding,” Bujar explains. “A common question is ‘Where is the cover kept?’ I think the best way to think of it is like when you put an actual cover on the bike when it’s parked for a period of time.” “It’s designed to be left at the garage and not be taken with you while riding; it’s optional. In my client’s case, he also told us how amazing the bike looks in his collection with the cover on. It’s a bit of a party trick when he shows his friends.” “We also worked with Hedon helmets to have a matching helmet, and the bike comes with a display plinth, and a small area to leave your helmet and seat cover or whatnot.” Bujar adds that although the Ducati sports a focused café racer stance, AF aimed to make it as rideable as possible. The seat has been designed with ample padding where it counts, and the custom-machined aluminum top yoke sports integrated clip-ons sit higher than usual. They’re matched to Gilles Tooling rear-sets. AF retained the Scrambler 1100’s original controls and relocated its digital dash to just in front of the fuel tank. Knurled aluminum grips add a touch of class to the bars, while a Truck-Lite LED, housed in a 3D-printed nacelle, lights the way. Finishing touches include a gleaming silver paint job, and a sand-bent titanium exhaust system that flows gracefully alongside the bike. (AF remapped the Ducati Scrambler 1100 to account for the new pipes.) “It rides absolutely beautifully and smooth, yet as fast as you need,” Bujar confirms. “Coming in considerably lighter than the stock bike also makes it a great recipe for a really usable custom.” Highly imaginative, but somehow also tastefully restrained, the Auto Fabrica T23 ticks all of our boxes. If it butters your toast too, get in touch—Bujar and Gaz are planning to build a limited run of 23 of these. Auto Fabrica | Facebook | Instagram",
