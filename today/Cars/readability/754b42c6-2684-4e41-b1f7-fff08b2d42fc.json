  "text": "Such a creation could bridge the gap between the somewhat numb EV driving experience and the epitome of driving.Toyota has long been known for its innovative approach to automotive technology and its commitment to providing drivers with engaging and reliable vehicles. Yet, when it comes to electric vehicles, the automaker has been more cautious than some of its competitors, focusing heavily on hybrids and hydrogen fuel cells. Although it is famous for its line of trucks and SUVs, the brand has also worked hard to bring more engaging gas-powered vehicles into its lineup, including the GR86, GR Supra, and GR Corolla, all of which have manual transmissions.Lexus UX 300eToyotaIn 2023, Toyota developed a simulated manual transmission for electric vehicles that provides a driving experience similar to that of a gas-powered automobile. They even put the revolutionary system in a Lexus UX 300e, and it did exactly what it was intended to do. This kind of system would be a first for production EVs, offering a rare blend of electric efficiency and old-school driving involvement. But when will Toyota actually build an EV with this unique and potentially game-changing feature? A manual “shifting” transmission for a single-speed electric setup?Toyota’s simulated manual transmission has a clutch pedal, a six-speed manual shifter, synthetic engine sounds, and even the ability to stall the engine. If you want convenience and comfort, you can even drive it in regular, boring EV mode. The simulated manual transmission Toyota developed for EVs isn’t just a novelty—it’s an effort to preserve the engaging driving experience that many enthusiasts associate with stick-shift cars. Toyota EV shifterToyotaTraditional EVs are typically single-speed, using the instant torque of electric motors to deliver seamless acceleration without the need for gear changes. While this makes them efficient and smooth, it also removes the tactile, interactive element of shifting gears — something that many driving purists miss. Lexus UX 300eToyota’s simulated manual works via software, which allows the car to shake if the driver fails to depress the accelerator enough, shift into the wrong gear, or mishandle the clutch pedal. The six-speed shift gear shift is embedded in an old-school H-gate with microswitches in each gear position but no physical connection to any shift rods, syncros, etc. The clutch pedal utilizes a return spring for feel. The gearshift lever and the clutch aren’t mechanically connected to anything. This is a brilliant and innovative system designed to make the driving experience as authentic as possible. What is Toyota’s plan with the revolutionary transmission?Toyota’s electric vehicle strategy has been deliberate and measured as evidenced by its single EV offering, the bZ4x. The company has invested heavily in hybrid technology and has been a strong proponent of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles like the Mirai. That said, Toyota has been criticized for lagging behind in the all-electric space, especially as automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, and Ford push forward with ambitious EV lineups.Toyota FT-SeToyotaIn December 2021, Toyota announced plans to release 30 new EV models by 2030, with the aim of selling 3.5 million electric vehicles annually by the end of the decade. They have since scaled back their EV plans, and rightly so given the slowing demand for electric vehicles. Toyota now expects to produce around 1 million EVs by 2026, down from the previous 1.5 million target. But as for when the simulated manual transmission will debut, Toyota has been tight-lipped.There was the possibility of integrating this new transmission into future electric sports cars, like a potential EV successor to the Toyota GR86 or Supra, but now it appears that both models’ successors will probably have gas engines with mild hybrid assist. Toyota FT-SeReports from Toyota insiders suggest that the company could launch a prototype featuring the simulated manual transmission by 2026, and the most likely candidate is the sporty, all-wheel-drive FT-Se EV concept introduced in 2023. This timeline aligns with Toyota’s broader EV goals and its push to bring more diverse electric options to the market. The use of a driver-centric EV aligns nicely with the company’s increasing focus on sporty vehicles.As Toyota continues to expand its EV lineup, the prospect of a driver-focused electric sports car with a simulated stick shift is exciting. While we may have to wait a few more years to see it in action, the mere possibility suggests that Toyota is serious about keeping driving fun, even in an electric future.Final thoughtsA simulated manual could differentiate Toyota’s EVs in an increasingly crowded market. As electric cars become more common, features that enhance driving experience — rather than just efficiency and range — will likely become key selling points.Toyota will need to determine whether a simulated manual transmission in an EV is a niche offering or something that could attract a wider audience by providing a more connected driving experience. Then there’s the question of how well the final product will be executed. To draw enthusiasts, it would have to improve on its mechanical “feel” and how well it mimics a real manual gearbox. If the system feels artificial or gimmicky, it could struggle to win people over.Love reading Autoblog?

But as for when the simulated manual transmission will debut, Toyota has been tight-lipped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was the possibility of integrating this new transmission into future electric sports cars, like a potential EV successor to the Toyota GR86 or Supra, but now it appears that both models’ successors will probably have gas engines with mild hybrid assist. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv phx-gallery=\"\"\u003e\u003cphx-gallery-image data-caption-html=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Toyota FT-Se\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" data-full-height=\"1335\" data-full-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_2000%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_2000/MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NjQzNDcx/toyotaft-seext03.jpg\" data-full-width=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"ci02f5b53ca00025cf\" data-image-slug=\"toyotaft-seext03\" data-public-id=\"MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NjQzNDcx\" data-title=\"Toyota FT-Se\"\u003e\u003c/phx-gallery-image\u003e\u003cphx-gallery-image data-caption-html=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Toyota FT-Se\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" data-full-height=\"1315\" data-full-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_2000%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_2000/MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NTc3OTM1/toyotaft-sedet01.jpg\" data-full-width=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"ci02f5b53c900025cf\" data-image-slug=\"toyotaft-sedet01\" data-public-id=\"MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NTc3OTM1\" data-title=\"Toyota FT-Se\"\u003e\u003c/phx-gallery-image\u003e\u003cphx-gallery-image data-caption-html=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Toyota FT-Se\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" data-full-height=\"1333\" data-full-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_2000%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_2000/MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NTc4MzMz/toyotaft-sedet03.jpg\" data-full-width=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"ci02f5b53c700025cf\" data-image-slug=\"toyotaft-sedet03\" data-public-id=\"MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NTc4MzMz\" data-title=\"Toyota FT-Se\"\u003e\u003c/phx-gallery-image\u003e\u003cphx-gallery-image data-caption-html=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Toyota FT-Se\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" data-full-height=\"1333\" data-full-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_2000%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_2000/MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NTEyMzk5/toyotaft-sedet02.jpg\" data-full-width=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"ci02f5b53c6000275d\" data-image-slug=\"toyotaft-sedet02\" data-public-id=\"MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NTEyMzk5\" data-title=\"Toyota FT-Se\"\u003e\u003c/phx-gallery-image\u003e\u003cphx-gallery-image data-caption-html=\"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Toyota FT-Se\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\" data-full-height=\"1333\" data-full-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_2000%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_2000/MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NzA5MDA3/toyotaft-seext04.jpg\" data-full-width=\"2000\" data-image-id=\"ci02f5b53c800025cf\" data-image-slug=\"toyotaft-seext04\" data-public-id=\"MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NzA5MDA3\" data-title=\"Toyota FT-Se\"\u003e\u003c/phx-gallery-image\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"toyota-ft-se\"\u003eToyota FT-Se\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_406%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEzMjc1ODI3MjA5NjQzNDcx/toyotaft-seext03.jpg\" alt=\"toyotaft-seext03\" itemprop=\"image\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eReports from Toyota insiders suggest that the company could launch a prototype featuring the simulated manual transmission by 2026, and the most likely candidate is the sporty, all-wheel-drive FT-Se EV concept introduced in 2023. This timeline aligns with Toyota’s broader EV goals and its push to bring more diverse electric options to the market. The use of a driver-centric EV aligns nicely with the company’s increasing focus on sporty vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Toyota continues to expand its EV lineup, the prospect of a driver-focused electric sports car with a simulated stick shift is exciting.

As electric cars become more common, features that enhance driving experience — rather than just efficiency and range — will likely become key selling points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToyota will need to determine whether a simulated manual transmission in an EV is a niche offering or something that could attract a wider audience by providing a more connected driving experience. Then there’s the question of how well the final product will be executed. To draw enthusiasts, it would have to improve on its mechanical “feel” and how well it mimics a real manual gearbox. If the system feels artificial or gimmicky, it could struggle to win people over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLove reading Autoblog?
