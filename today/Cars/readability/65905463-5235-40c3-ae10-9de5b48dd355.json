Powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential, the car was initially sold by Brown Daub Ford of Nazareth, Pennsylvania, prior to being exported to Canada in 2010. The car is finished in Mark II Black over Ebony leather upholstery and is further equipped with Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. This Ford GT was acquired by the owner, a retail dealer, in 2021 and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Carfax report and British Columbia registration. The Camilo Pardo-designed GT was styled as an homage to the Le Mans-winning GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features aluminum body panels over an extruded-aluminum space frame and roll-bonded floors. This example is one of 238 finished in Mark II Black for the model year, and it is not equipped with racing stripes or side tape stripes. Exterior details include HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. Paint protection film has been applied to the body, per the seller. Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are wrapped in Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 3,900 miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in September 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report shows no accidents or reported damage. The vehicle is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada.
