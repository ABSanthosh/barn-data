Wearing a repaint in Warwick Blue over blue Morrokide vinyl upholstery, the car is equipped with a dual-exit exhaust system, painted 15″ steel wheels, bright Pontiac-branded hubcaps, power-assisted front disc brakes, power steering, a push-button AM radio, and a heater. Following its purchase by the seller on BaT in June 2023, the car experienced a timing-chain replacement as well as the removal of aftermarket accessories. This Catalina Ventura is offered at no reserve with a Protect-O-Plate, manufacturer’s literature, service records, Pontiac Historical Society documentation, and a clean Texas title. The car was finished from the factory in Warwick Blue (53) and was repainted approximately three years ago under prior ownership. Exterior details include dual mirrors, dual exhaust outlets, and Ventura badging. The painted 15″ steel wheels have bright hubcaps. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The front and rear bench seats are upholstered in blue Morrokide vinyl. Amenities include a pushbutton radio and a heater, while aftermarket accessories were removed by the seller. The steering wheel fronts a horizontal-sweep 120-mph speedometer as well as gauges for fuel level and amperage. Aftermarket auxiliary instrumentation was removed by the seller. The five-digit odometer shows 61k miles, approximately 600 of which were added under current ownership. The 428ci V8 features a four-barrel carburetor and a dual-exit exhaust system, and work under current ownership has included installing blue-painted valve covers and replacing the timing chain. The seller notes that the ignition wires and water pump bear in-period date codes. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission and a Safe-T-Track limited-slip differential. Decoding the cowl tag reveals the following details: Style 69 25237 – 1969 Pontiac Catalina two-door hardtop coupe Body PON 220659 – Pontiac, Michigan, assembly and body number TR 550 – Blue Morrokide upholstery PNT 53 53 – Warwick Blue paint 05B – Second week of May build date PHS documents, manufacturer’s literature, a Protecto-O-Plate, and service records are included in the sale.
