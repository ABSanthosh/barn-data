  "text": "The facelifted compact crossover will arrive at Kia dealers across the U.S. in the coming weeks May 7, 2025 at 20:29 by Michael Gauthier Kia has announced the facelifted 2026 Sportage will start at $28,690 before fees. That’s $1,300 more than its predecessor, but there’s revised styling inside and out. Power comes from a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that develops 187 hp and 178 lb-ft. Kia introduced the facelifted Sportage at the Los Angeles Auto Show last year and now the company has announced the 2026 model will start at $28,690 before a $1,395 destination fee. That’s an increase of $1,300 but customers will be treated to a significant upgrade. Prices for the hybrid variants will be announced at a later date. Set to arrive at dealerships shortly, the 2026 Sportage features an all-new front fascia with a wide grille that is flanked by vertical headlights. Buyers will also find an updated rear bumper, revised taillights, and restyled wheels ranging in sizes from 17- to 19-inches. More: 2026 Kia Sportage Boosts Hybrid Power, Upgrades Tech, And Sharpens Its Looks The updates continue inside as there’s a streamlined dashboard and a freestanding cluster with dual 12.3-inch displays. Additional changes are limited, but the model sports a new two-spoke steering wheel as well as revised equipment. In terms of features, the entry-level Sportage LX has cloth seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning, and a six-speaker audio system. Buyers will also find a host of driver assistance systems including Smart Cruise Control with Stop and Go, Forward Collision Avoidance Assist, High-Beam Assist, and Lane Keeping Assist / Lane Departure Warning. They’re joined by Parking Distance Warning and Rear Occupant Alert. The $36,290 Sportage SX Prestige is far more luxurious as it comes with power front seats wrapped in leather-like SynTex upholstery. They offer heating and ventilation, and are joined by a heated steering wheel. Other niceties include a panoramic curved display, a panoramic sunroof, and a dual-zone automatic climate control system. Buyers will also find a wireless smartphone charger and a Harman Kardon premium audio system. On top of that, there are additional driver assistance systems such as Blind-Spot Collision Warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, and Highway Driving Assist. The list also includes a Blind-Spot View Monitor, a Surround View Monitor, and Safe Exit Warning. Customers looking for something more rugged can get the $32,990 Sportage X-Line AWD. It’s distinguished by unique bumpers, faux skid plates, and gloss black accents. Buyers will also find roof rails and unique 19-inch wheels wrapped in all-season rubber. The range-topping Sportage X-Pro Prestige AWD goes a step further as the $39,590 crossover has 17-inch matte black wheels with BF Goodrich all-terrain tires. Power is provided by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that develops 187 hp (139 kW / 190 PS) and 178 lb-ft (241 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission, which can be paired to an optional all-wheel drive system. The latter costs $1,800 on most trims, but is standard on the aforementioned X variants. 2026 Kia Sportage Pricing",
