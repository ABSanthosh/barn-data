  "text": "$3.65 million worth of stolen cars were found in two parking garages in the Bronx April 29, 2025 at 20:39 by Michael Gauthier Authorities in New York and New Jersey have busted a high-end vehicle theft ring. They stole BMW, Mercedes, and Land Rover vehicles and shipped them overseas. Some thieves would break into people’s homes to get key fobs for the desired vehicles. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin has announced 11 people have been charged in connection to a high-end vehicle theft ring. The group targeted an assortment of luxury models from BMW, Mercedes, Land Rover, and Rolls-Royce. According to officials, law enforcement agencies discovered there was a criminal enterprise coordinating the theft of vehicles from Burlington, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, and Morris counties. Vehicles were commonly taken from residences and then transported to the Bronx to be stored in parking garages to avoid detection. Thieves would be paid by “middle-level and high-level fences,” and the cars would often be sent overseas – mostly to West African countries.

In one incident, someone broke into an occupied home to steal a key fob for a 2024 BMW X5 valued at roughly $89,000. In a separate incident, thieves broke into another home to steal a 2024 BMW X7 and 2021 Audi SQ8. They also made off with $400 in cash, a driver’s license, a Gucci purse, and two high-end wallets. In total, the group allegedly stole approximately $542,295 worth of vehicles that could be linked to “specific residential burglaries.” However, that was just a small part of the theft ring. In fact, “investigators identified 43 stolen New Jersey vehicles valued at approximately $3.65 million in two parking garages on Jennings Street and Third Avenue in the Bronx.” Several vehicles that had been at those garages were later recovered from shipping containers that were destined for Africa. Attorney General Platkin said, “No one should be afraid that a thief will enter their home while they are sleeping to find their key fobs to steal their car.” His sentiments were echoed by Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark who noted, “Millions of dollars worth of stolen vehicles – including a $475,000 Rolls Royce -were taken to a Bronx parking garage that defendants used as a showroom.” He added, “We will not tolerate auto crime in the Bronx.” The sprawling case involves teens and juveniles as well as older promoters and organizers. Two central figures remain unidentified and are currently known as “E” and “Big G.” The latter faces a long list of charges including racketeering, being a leader of an auto theft trafficking network, and promoting organized street crime. They’re also on the hook for multiple vehicle thefts, fencing, receiving stolen property, and financial crimes.",
