Finished in Jet black Metallic over black and red leather upholstery, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 linked with an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission and a locking center differential.

This Cayenne Turbo was purchased by the owner in 2021 and is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, partial service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title. The truck is finished in Jet Black Metallic and has bi-xenon headlights with Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS) as well as fog lights, the SportDesign Package, front and rear ParkAssist, a sunroof, a roof spoiler, and LED taillights. The 21″ Cayenne SportEdition alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The truck is equipped with an adjustable air suspension, Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), and Power Steering Plus. Stopping power is provided by red-finished six-piston front and four-piston rear brake calipers over ventilated rotors at each corner. A brake fluid flush was performed in May 2023. The heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats and heated rear bench are upholstered in black leather with red inserts, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Rubberized floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include a backup camera, a Bose sound system, Porsche Communication Management, navigation, a CD stereo, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, and a compass mounted atop the dashboard. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 190-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,600-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 44k miles, approximately 34k of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 4.8-liter V8 was factory rated at 540 horsepower and 555 lb-ft of torque when equipped with the E81 Turbo Powerkit, which also increased the top speed. Replacement spark plugs were installed in May 2023, and an oil change was performed in January 2024. Power is sent to all four wheels through an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission and a locking center differential. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery.
