  "text": "Rivian is opening up sales to fleet customers, but Chevrolet's Brightdrop looks like a better deal 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Rivian has opened up orders for its electric delivery van. Two different versions are available and pricing starts at $79,900. The vans have 315 hp as well as a range of up to 161 miles. If the quiet whir of an Amazon delivery vehicle excites you, you’re in luck as Rivian has begun selling their commercial van to fleet customers. This is an interesting development as Amazon originally had an exclusivity agreement with Rivian. With the deal now over, customers can order the Rivian Delivery 500 and the Delivery 700. The former starts at $79,900 and measures 248.5 inches (6,312 mm) long. It has a cargo capacity of 487 cubic feet (13,790 liters) and can accommodate payloads of up to 2,663 lbs (1,208 kg). More: Rivian Will Produce Fleet Vehicles For AT\u0026T The Delivery 700 is similar, but starts at $83,900 and is 278 inches (7,061 mm) long. Thanks to the extra length, the cargo capacity climbs to 652 cubic feet (18,463 liters), while the payload rating drops to 2,258 lbs (1,024 kg). Both vans have a 100 kWh lithium iron phosphate battery pack that powers a front-mounted motor producing 315 hp (235 kW / 320 PS) and 299 lb-ft (405 Nm) of torque. This gives them a range of approximately 160 miles (257 km). When it’s time to recharge, you’re in for a wait as the vans have a DC fast charging capability that maxes out at 100 kW. Buyers will find a fairly basic cabin with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and a 15.4-inch infotainment system. They’re joined by a heated and cooled driver’s seat as well as a front passenger jump seat. Since the Rivian commercial van was designed to be one of the safest vehicles on the road, it comes with a long list of driver assistance systems. These include Adaptive Cruise Control, Blind Spot Warning, and Speed Limit Information. The model also has Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Warning, and High Beam Assist. Rounding out the highlights are a surround view camera, a back-up warning system, and Surround Park Assist. The vans cost more than Chevy’s Brightdrop lineup and offer significantly less range. However, Rivian’s Tom Solomon noted “Amazon currently has more than 20,000 in its fleet and delivered over a billion packages … in 2024 alone.” He added, “We’re excited to now be able to open sales to fleets of all sizes in the US, whether they want 1 van or thousands.”",
