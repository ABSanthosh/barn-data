This R8 was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with partial service records, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title. The car is finished in gray and features carbon-fiber Sigma side blades, LED headlights, carbon-fiber mirror caps, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and integrated dual exhaust outlets. Exterior imperfections are highlighted in the gallery below. The 20″ Vossen multi-spoke wheels are mounted with Nitto tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated and cross-drilled discs, and aftermarket suspension components have been installed. The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in black leather, while carpeted floor mats line the footwells. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include a black-finished roll bar, a gated shifter, the Audi Parking System Plus with a rearview camera, an infotainment system with Audi navigation, an Audi Concert CD stereo, and automatic climate control. Wear is visible on the seats and side sills, and the left door panel trim has blemishes. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 23k miles. The 5.2-liter FSI V10 features dry-sump lubrication and has been fitted with a Heffner twin-turbocharger kit as well as a custom cat-less exhaust system. Replacement vacuum lines and blow-off valves were fitted in January 2024, at which time an oil change was performed. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and Quattro all-wheel drive. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
