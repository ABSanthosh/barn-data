  "description": "In a fiercely competitive segment, the Raida Carbonite gloves promise a blend of robust protection and everyday comfort. But having put them through their paces on Mumbai’s chaotic roads, allow me to delve into whether they live up to the promise. Straight out of the box, the quality of the stitching and materials is impressive for the price. The full-grain leather feels substantial, and the carbon-fibre knuckle protectors, alongside the rubberised plastic scaphoid shield, inspire a good degree of confidence.  The gloves feature pre-curved fingers and a neoprene wrist cuff, which contribute to a generally pleasant feel. Ventilation is adequate, with mesh panels on the thumb, index and middle fingers, and vented TPR protectors on the leather ring and pinky fingers. However, in Mumbai’s humid climate, you’ll inevitably feel sweat building on your palms, especially during prolonged stops.  A significant point of contention here is the fit. I consulted the online size chart and opted for the large size. However, I noted empty voids on top of the ring and pinky fingers. This slightly loose fit at the fingertips can reduce feel but won’t pose a risk while riding. I also experienced a distinct tugging sensation on the thumb during initial rides. While this improved as the gloves broke in over time, it still persists, albeit to a lesser degree.  Fit can be an issue, so it’s best to try them before buying. Finally, the touch-compatible fingertips are a feature many riders look for today. My experience, however, aligns with a known issue across many gloves. While they technically work, precise inputs are difficult. Don’t expect to compose messages or navigate intricate menus; they’re best for quick taps to answer calls or skip tracks. Despite the minor fit nuances and the expected heat build-up, the Raida Carbonite gloves offer a solid package of protection and decent comfort for the price. They are a good VFM option for urban commuters and occasional tourers, provided you find a size that fits your hands well.
