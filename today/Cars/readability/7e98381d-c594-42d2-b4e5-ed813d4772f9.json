  "description": "Mercedes’ van-based MPV offers economical diesel engines and up to eight seats, but it commands a hefty premium compared with rivals One can make a case that it’s vans such as the Mercedes V-Class – and not the SUVs we’re plied with – that today come closest to mastering the art of the lifestyle vehicle.It’s why you find so many MPV owners, never to return to the SUV fold, eulogising the utility and surprising opulence of their boxy (and sometimes quite expensive) wheels.Playing into this is the fact that the ‘van with windows’ market has recently become more desirable and competitive than ever. Volkswagen has its understatedly charming Multivan; Ford’s Tourneo Custom has a panoramic roof; and the new Lexus LM, with its Mark Levinson sound system, is pitched as something to go up against the BMW 7 Series.As an established player in this area (one in which its compatriots Audi and BMW still have never so much as dabbled), Mercedes-Benz needs to keep up, and so it has updated the V-Class for 2024, with a sharper exterior design and an overhaul of the infotainment system.",

  "text": "The cabin update marks major change. Were it not for the cliff-face geometry of the wide, wood-effect (or, in higher trims, metal-effect) dashboard and the expanse between the front seats (nicely sculpted and with useful armrests), you could almost be forgiven for thinking you had climbed aboard one of Mercedes’ saloons. Gone are dramatically hooded instrument binnacles and the slightly awkward central touchscreen display, on its plinth. It’s all been replaced with the new generation of MBUX displays (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatability come as standard), though the little ledge that houses a touchpad controller is carried over. There's a good amount of physical switchgear, too, including those for electrically sliding side doors and the climate controls. Less welcome are the imprecise panel-push controls on the new wheel, smart as it is. In the main, and given the V-Class's van DNA, it feels supremely premium in here – something that's enhanced at night time, when the new ambient lighting comes to the fore.  Of course, the front portion of the cabin is not what the V-Class is really about. The passenger region of the car is outstandingly spacious in terms of leg and head room, even with the eight-seat configuration (two rows of three in the back). Luggage space isn't quite as straightforward – there's plenty of it, but only if you opt for the longer bodyshells that Mercedes offers.  The seats themselves are mounted onto rails that run the length of the floor, so you can tinker with the precise amount of leg room each row has. Of course, it's also possible to have one row facing backwards, though you can also do this in the VW Multivan. Whichever inlay trim you opt for also extends down the flanks on the cabin and into the third row, so there's a premium atmosphere throughout. Opting for beige leather raises the premium appeal of the V-Class still further, and there are other options such as a Burmester sound system and a panoramic roof, which are included for Exclusive trim.",
