Fast forward to a little over 15 years, and Toyota has finally given its rugged SUV a full redesign, and we’re about to drive it. To see how it stacks up in the real world, Toyota has invited us to test it all over sunny San Diego, California, during their press drive event. As we explore everything this long-awaited refresh has to offer, we want to hear from you.. Got burning questions about the 2025 Toyota 4Runner? Drop them in the comments, and we’ll provide answers once the embargo lifts on January 28. Let’s dig into what’s new with this long-awaited refresh. A Long Time Coming This isn’t the first time we’ve laid eyes on the new 4Runner. Toyota actually unveiled it back in April of last year at a kitschy beach party. At the time, though, all we could do was check out the exterior and poke around the interior. Toyota shared a few details during the event and has trickled out more information since then. More: Toyota Dealers Adding $5,000 Markups Onto New 4Runner First and foremost, this time around, there’s no V6, unfortunately. Instead, the base engine is a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder with 278 horsepower (207 kW) and 317 lb-ft (429 Nm) of torque. An eight-speed automatic gearbox sends power to the wheels. Speaking of wheels, the 4Runner is available in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive configurations. As expected, some trims come standard with 4WD, while for others, it’s a $2,000 add-on. RWD 4Runners now deliver up to 20 mpg in the city, 26 on the highway, and 22 combined—a huge leap forward compared to the previous generation’s underwhelming 16 mpg city, 19 highway, and 17 combined, regardless of drivetrain. Even better, the new 4WD model sacrifices just a single mpg compared to the RWD version, making it a far more efficient option than its predecessor. In addition to those bits of good news, Toyota is also offering a hybrid four-cylinder that makes 326 hp (243 kW) and 465 lb-ft (630 Nm) of torque. Four-wheel drive comes standard with all hybrid 4Runners. In addition, they manage to return 23 mpg in the city, 24 on the highway, and 23 combined. Basically, it offers more power than the old 4Runner and more fuel economy at the same time.  Pricing for the new 4Runner starts at $40,770 before adding a $1,450 destination fee (bringing the total to $42,220). At the top end, the flagship TRD Pro and Trailhunter trims climb to $66,900 before destination charges. Toyota hasn’t told us what trims of the 4Runner we’ll get to drive, but feel free to ask about any of them. Drop your questions, and we’ll track down the answers and report back in the coming week!
