  "text": "This special Defender was built at the request of a customer, although Heritage Customs will make more if there's enough demand 7 hours ago by Brad Anderson The blue paint of the Defender 90 is inspired by the blue skies of the Mediterranean island. Heritage Customs has fitted a set of white 20-inch forged wheels. Custom white and dark blue leather adorns the off-roader’s interior. Heritage Customs has lifted the veil on its latest Land Rover Defender project. The special creation, known as The Spirit of Cyprus Valiance Convertible, is based on the Defender 90 and could be produced in limited numbers. A special two-tone paint scheme immediately makes the Defender catch the eye. The top half of the bodywork is finished in a deep shade of blue to mimic the sky of Cyprus, while the rest of the car is painted in white, just like many of the buildings found across the stunning Mediterranean island. Heritage Customs has also fitted a set of white 20-inch forged wheels and added a blue soft top. Read: Land Rover Defender Beach Break Is An Ode To Summer There’s no mistaking the cabin of this Defender from a standard one, either. The front and rear seats have been clad in a beautiful shade of deep blue, as have the door panels, parts of the dashboard, and the steering wheel. Other interior elements are trimmed in plush white leather, and there’s also lots of white contrast stitching. The firm was originally called upon by a customer to build this special Defender 90 and has since decided that it’ll manufacture a handful of additional examples, should shoppers want it. It’s unclear how much the transformation cost but regardless of the figure, it certainly pays off with one of the most striking short-wheelbase Defenders we’ve seen. “We are thrilled to unveil this lovely Valiance Convertible Spirit of Cyprus,” Heritage Customs co-founder and designer Niels van Roij said. “Our goal was to create a vehicle that encapsulates the beauty, culture, and spirit of the island, while staying true to the rugged heritage of the Defender. The result is a sophisticated yet adventurous vehicle, perfect for this client, who seeked uniqueness and elegance in their driving experience.”",
