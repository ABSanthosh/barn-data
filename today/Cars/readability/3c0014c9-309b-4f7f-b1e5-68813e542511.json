Features include a limited-slip differential, the Comfort Package, 20″ Shelby alloy wheels, heated front seats, a Shaker 500 audio system, a Hurst short-throw shifter, Ford Racing mufflers, tinted windows, a SYNC voice-activated system, air conditioning, and cruise control. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2024. This S197 has 9k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual and a clean Pennsylvania title. The car is finished in Black with silver over-the-top stripes and features include sequential LED taillights, dual exhaust outlets, a Hurst badge, power-adjustable side mirrors, tinted windows, and polished exhaust finishers. The 20″ Shelby alloy wheels are mounted with Yokohama Advan Apex V001 tires measuring 255/35 up front and 275/35 out back. Stopping power is provided by vented four-wheel discs. The brake fluid was flushed in 2019. The cabin features heated front seats and a split-folding rear bench trimmed in Charcoal Black leather, and amenities include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a Shaker 500 audio system, a Hurst short-throw shifter, keyless entry, air conditioning, cruise control, a voice-activated SYNC system, and GT-branded floormats. The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, voltage, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.6-liter V8 was factory rated at 315 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque and features finned engine covers. A strut tower brace and billet fluid caps have been installed. Work since 2019 consisted of replacing the fuel filter, cabin air filter, and battery and servicing the power steering system, fuel injection system, and cooling system. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The differential and transmission fluid services were performed in 2019. Ford Racing mufflers have been fitted. The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
