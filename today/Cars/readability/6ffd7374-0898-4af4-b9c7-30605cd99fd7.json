  "text": "The high-performance crossovers will have a dual-motor all-wheel drive system with 321 hp 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Peugeot is gearing up to launch performance versions of the E-3008 and E-5008. The models will have a dual-motor all-wheel drive system that produces 321 hp. A five-seat version of the E-5008 will be launched in the first half of this year. Peugeot quietly used its latest E-Lion Day to reveal plans to expand its electric vehicle lineup in 2025. This will be spearheaded by performance versions of the E-3008 and E-5008. Set to arrive in the coming weeks, the models will have a dual-motor all-wheel drive system that produces a combined output of 321 hp (239 kW / 325 PS). The vehicles retain a front-mounted motor producing 210 hp (157 kW / 213 PS) and it’s joined by a new rear-mounted motor developing 110 hp (82 kW / 112 PS). More: 2025 Peugeot E-5008 Gives Buyers What The Mighty Tesla Model Y Won’t Speaking of the E-5008, the company will launch a new five-seat variant in the first half of 2025. It will offer 35.1 cubic feet (994 liters) of cargo room behind the second-row, which is 2.8 cubic feet (78 liters) more than the seven-seat variant. When the rear seats are folded down, the luggage capacity increases to 81.6 cubic feet (2,310 liters). While these aren’t groundbreaking developments, Peugeot noted orders for their electric vehicles doubled last year. The French brand went on to say they had the highest growth in Europe for retail electric vehicle sales and were the electric B-segment leader. The automaker also highlighted the Peugeot Electric Promise, which sees their electric vehicles come with an 8 year or 99,419 mile (160,000 km) warranty as well as a wall box charger and a Free2Move Charge pass, which provides access to nearly one million charging points across Europe.",
