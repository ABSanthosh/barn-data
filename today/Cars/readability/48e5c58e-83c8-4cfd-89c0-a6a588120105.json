The car is finished in Graphite Gray over red leather and equipment includes a removable hardtop, a black convertible soft top, a tonneau cover, 13″ steel wheels with body-color hubcaps, an AM/FM radio, and air conditioning. It was acquired by the seller in 2020, and work in preparation for the sale consisted of installing dual Weber carburetors and a 123ignition distributor along with replacing the spark plugs and wires. This 190SL is now offered with a copy of the data card, handwritten service notes from current ownership, parts receipts, a car cover, spare parts, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Graphite Gray (190) and was repainted under prior ownership. Equipment includes a removable hardtop and a replacement black soft top as well as a matching top boot and red cover. A hardtop stand accompanies the vehicle. Steel 13″ wheels wear chrome trim rings, hubcaps with body-color accents, and 185/80 Maxxis MA-7 tires. The car is equipped with a double-wishbone front suspension, rear swing axles with coil springs, and power-assisted drum brakes. Stainless-steel brake lines have been installed. The cabin features low-back bucket seats that have been reupholstered in red leather as well as matching door panels and dashboard trim and color-coordinated carpets. Amenities include aftermarket air conditioning, Coco floor mats, a Becker Europa AM/FM radio with an auxiliary input in the glovebox, Kenwood speakers fitted in the rear deck, lap belts, an analog clock, and a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror. The shift bushings and trunk lid support were replaced in 2022. The heater is inoperative. The two-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a 140-mph speedometer and a 7k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, water temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 95k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added under current ownership. The horn button was replaced in 2020. The replacement 1.9-liter M121 inline-four was factory rated at 104 horsepower and 105 lb-ft of torque and was installed under prior ownership. The starter, fuel pump, and battery were replaced in 2020 and a replacement water pump was installed in 2023. Work in preparation for the sale involved installing dual Weber carburetors and a 123ignition electronic distributor along with replacing the spark plugs, ignition coil, and ignition wires. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a fully synchronized four-speed manual transmission. The transmission fluid was changed in 2022. You are not connected to real-time updates.
