  "description": "Based in Burghausen in Upper Bavaria, Krämer Motorcycles is a boutique marque with a singular focus—race bikes. Everything they create is 100 percent track-focused, jam-packed full of high-end engineering, and slathered in top-shelf components. Now they’ve applied that ethos to their first naked bike, the Krämer GP2-890 XX hypernaked. Unveiled today at EICMA, the Krämer GP2-890 XX has much in common with the company’s GP2-890 RR track racer, but it’s more than just a GP2-890 RR without a fairing. Sporting upright ergonomics and a host of other tweaks, the GP2-890 XX is, as Krämer puts it, “built for wheelies, not podiums.” “When we looked around the paddocks we were going to, we noticed that a little over 10 percent of the motorcycles on track were large-displacement naked models, which is an interesting trend developing in the industry,” says Jensen Beeler, who runs Krämer’s USA operation.…",

Everything they create is 100 percent track-focused, jam-packed full of high-end engineering, and slathered in top-shelf components. Now they’ve applied that ethos to their first naked bike, the Krämer GP2-890 XX hypernaked. Unveiled today at EICMA, the Krämer GP2-890 XX has much in common with the company’s GP2-890 RR track racer, but it’s more than just a GP2-890 RR without a fairing. Sporting upright ergonomics and a host of other tweaks, the GP2-890 XX is, as Krämer puts it, “built for wheelies, not podiums.” “When we looked around the paddocks we were going to, we noticed that a little over 10 percent of the motorcycles on track were large-displacement naked models, which is an interesting trend developing in the industry,” says Jensen Beeler, who runs Krämer’s USA operation. “Until now, no manufacturer has produced a hypernaked that is focused solely for the race track, even though the demographics are skewing more into this category with each passing year. The Krämer GP2-890 XX aims to give these track riders a more purpose-built motorcycle for this segment of circuit riding, in the same way our other motorcycles have done in their model segments.” Like the GP2-890 RR, the Krämer GP2-890 XX uses a chromoly trellis main frame, with a rotationally molded plastic fuel tank out back that also functions as the bike’s tailpiece and subframe. The swingarm is a cast aluminum unit, featuring a progressive shock linkage that Krämer’s been running on the GP2-890 RR in the British Superbike Championship. The running gear includes full-adjustable WP APEX suspension at both ends, a full complement of Brembo braking components, and ultra-light carbon fiber BST Star Tek wheels. Just about everything on the Krämer GP2-890 XX is adjustable, from the swingarm angle to the steering head angle, triple clamp offset, seat height, and the position of the rear-set foot controls. That level of adjustability is a boon for track riders who want to extract the maximum from their machines. Powering the GP2-890 XX is the 889 cc parallel-twin motor from the KTM 890 platform, good for 138 hp and 100 Nm. Peek inside, and you’ll spot titanium connecting rods, high-compression Pankl pistons, titanium valves, a race-spec camshaft, and CNC-machined ports. Air is fed via two chunky carbon fiber air ducts, with stainless steel exhaust headers mated to a titanium muffler at the opposite end. The bike runs off a Mectronik MKE7 ECU with a six-axis inertia measurement unit that manages the rider aids, which include traction and wheelie control. Riders can customize the ECU with their own settings, or with ones from Krämer. The dash is an ECUMaster ADU 5 unit, loaded with everything you’d need at a track day—including a GPS-powered lap timer. What little bodywork the GP2-890 XX is almost exclusively made from carbon fiber. Stripped down to the basics, with number boards at the front and sides, it’s a gnarly-looking machine that would look just as good in street trim. It’s light too, weighing just 140 kilos [309 pounds] with 16 liters [4.2 gallons] of fuel on board. Available for pre-order in extremely limited numbers, the Krämer GP2-890 XX will set you back $49,995 in the United States and €50,000 in Europe. It’s also the first motorcycle that Krämer’s offering with factory customization options, starting with the frame color and fairing decals. Tempted?
