Having just over 2k miles, it is further equipped with a mechanical limited-slip differential, black leather and Race-Tex upholstery, LED headlights, a rear swan-neck-hinged wing, rear-axle steering, Satin Neodyme 20″ and 21″ center-locking wheels, a front-axle lift system, heated 18-way adaptive Sport Plus seats, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management. This 992 GT3 is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Alabama title. The car is finished in Arctic Gray and has LED headlights, a rear swan-neck-hinged wing, a rear fog light, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, a backup camera, puddle light projectors, side graphics, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Paint protection film and a ceramic coating have been applied to the exterior, per the seller. Satin Neodyme-finished 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with yellow calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with rear-axle steering and a front-axle lift system. The heated 18-way adaptive Sport Plus seats are trimmed in black leather with Race-Tex inserts, “GT3” embroidery on the headrests, and GT Silver stitching that extends to the center console, dashboard, door panels, and knee pads. Porsche-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include carbon-fiber trim, Porsche Communication Management, a Bose sound system, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a drive-mode selector dial, and it frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates just over 2k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car is fitted with the optional extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Porsche of Huntsville in Alabama, along with factory colors, options, and a total price of $224,070.
