The complaints follow the brand’s decision to make the God’s Eye system available to 21 models. Those who bought its products prior to the announcement are now asking for compensation. Earlier this month, Chinese automaker BYD announced that its “God’s Eye” driver-assist package would become standard on 21 models across all price brackets. While that’s great news for future buyers, existing owners aren’t exactly celebrating. Instead, they’ve flooded online forums with complaints about having overpaid for their cars. A significant number of BYD owners have voiced their frustration on 12365auto.com, a Chinese third-party platform focused on automotive quality. The backlash was strong enough to push models from BYD’s Ocean and Dynasty series into the top 10 most complained-about vehicles on the site. More: BYD To Roll Out Solid-State Batteries In 2027 Before Widespread Use In 2030 As reported by Reuters, over 4,700 complaints were filed against the Chinese brand between February 11 and 17, following its announcement for the upgraded ADAS. For comparison, owners had only filed 150 complaints on the previous week. One disgruntled owner of a BYD Qin L DM-i sedan pointed out that the company slashed prices and added features just four months after they had purchased their car, prompting them to demand compensation. Another buyer, who had recently purchased a Seal 06 DM-i, was frustrated to find that a newer version with notable upgrades was released at the same price—despite having “repeatedly” asked the salesperson whether an update was imminent. BYD Seal 06 DM-i According to the platform, BYD has acknowledged the complaints, stating they have been forwarded to the appropriate departments. Not All “God’s Eye” Systems Are Created Equal The 21 BYD models receiving the standard “God’s Eye” ADAS package span a price range of ¥69,800 to ¥239,800 (roughly $9,600 to $33,100 at current exchange rates). The most affordable of the bunch is the BYD Seagull electric hatchback.

The basic C will find its way into cheaper BYD models, the mid-spec B will equip offerings from the Denza and Fang Cheng Bao brands, while the flagship A is reserved for Yangwang. BYD is not the only automaker that has been the target of complaints about the ongoing price war in China, which is significantly more prominent compared to other countries due to the fierce competition in the world’s biggest car market. Back in 2023, hundreds of Tesla owners gathered at local dealerships asking for rebates and credits after the company slashed prices of its models.
