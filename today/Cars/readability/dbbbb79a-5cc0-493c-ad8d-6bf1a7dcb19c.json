  "text": "Carfax estimates that nearly 350,000 cars have been flood-damaged so far by the 2024 hurricane season, with many of them headed to used car markets across the country.The 2024 hurricane season has left its mark not only on homes and communities but also on vehicles. Nearly 350,000 cars are estimated to have been damaged by floodwaters, with many of these vehicles already making their way to used car lots across the country. While some sellers are transparent about the car’s history, others may attempt to hide the damage. Buyers should be cautious — especially in markets where flood-damaged cars are popping up more — as they can have serious hidden issues that may not be immediately apparent.Why you should be concerned about flood-damaged carsFlood damage can wreak havoc on vehicles, especially on modern cars equipped with complex electronics. The immediate concern is the water affecting mechanical components such as the engine, transmission, and brakes. However, the long-term issues tend to be electrical, with problems cropping up in everything from the car’s computer systems to its wiring harness. Even worse, the damage may not show up until weeks or months after purchase.Water in the engine, transmission, or other mechanical components can cause costly failures down the line, but it's the corrosion in electrical systems that can be particularly sneaky. Wiring damage, short circuits, or corrosion of essential components could lead to safety issues, including airbag malfunctions.States with the most flood-damaged cars in 2024According to Carfax, Florida and Texas have the largest number of flooded cars in 2024. Many of the flooded cars in Florida are concentrated around a few cities, including:Miami - Ft. Lauderdale: 23,200 flooded carsFt. Myers - Naples: 11,000 flooded carsTampa - St. Pete (Sarasota): 8,700 flooded carsOrlando - Daytona Beach - Melbourne: 8,500 flooded carsThe same is true for Texas, where just two cities — Houston and Dallas — account for many of the state’s flooded cars. Carmax estimates there are 29,000 flooded cars in Houston, with another 12,800 located in Dallas.Flood-damaged cars don’t always stay in the states where they were damaged. In fact, many are shipped to other parts of the country to avoid local scrutiny. While Hurricanes Beryl and Helene were concentrated in the south, cities further north like Chicago and New York still have a high concentration of flooded cars in 2024.How to spot a flood-damaged vehicleWhile it’s easy for scammers to clean a car’s exterior and interior to make it appear fresh, there are still telltale signs buyers can look for to avoid purchasing a flood-damaged vehicle. Here are some key tips:Check for Dampness and OdorsOne of the clearest indicators of flood damage is moisture inside the vehicle. Pay special attention to damp carpets or a musty smell. Sellers often try to cover these odors with air fresheners, so be wary if the car smells too good to be true.Inspect for Rust and SiltLook for rust in unusual places, such as the seat rails, door hinges, and under the dashboard. Floodwaters also often leave behind silt and mud, which can accumulate in hard-to-reach areas like under the seats, inside the glove compartment, or around the engine bay.Foggy or Moisture-Laden LightsFogging inside the headlights or taillights can be a sign that the vehicle was submerged. Inspect the light fixtures carefully, as moisture in these areas is hard to get rid of and can indicate prior flooding.Look at the UpholsteryIf the upholstery looks new or mismatched with the rest of the car’s interior, it could be a red flag. Many flood-damaged vehicles undergo interior refurbishments, which may include replacing carpets and seats. Be wary if the new materials don’t match the vehicle’s overall wear and tear.Test the ElectronicsTurn on all the electronics in the car, including the radio, windshield wipers, headlights, and dashboard lights. Electrical systems are often the first to fail in flood-damaged cars, so if any of these don’t work correctly, it’s a strong indication of water exposure.Final thoughtsFlood-damaged cars can be dangerous and expensive to repair, so taking the time to do your research and perform a thorough inspection is crucial. By following these tips, you can avoid falling victim to unscrupulous sellers and ensure that you’re purchasing a safe, reliable vehicle.",
