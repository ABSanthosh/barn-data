  "text": "The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance was originally slated for 2023, but Mercedes confirmed that the model will now hit U.S. dealerships for the 2024 model year.Mercedes just revealed a refreshed version of the hybrid sports sedan for Europe, and we expect the same bodywork to make its way here when the E Performance finally arrives.The updated grille draws upon the newest AMG GT Coupe, with a black intake beneath the main grille element.UPDATE 2/3/25: The Mercedes-AMG GT63 S E Performance sedan, originally set to reach the U.S. for the 2023 model year before being delayed to 2024, is now finally set to become available in the U.S. for the 2025 model year. The twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 engine is still paired with a single electric motor. This story has been updated to reflect minor changes to specifications. Mercedes claims the sedan will go from zero to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds and will top out at 197 mph. Pricing for the GT63 S E Performance will start at $200,100.Lost in the horde of online commenters lamenting the replacement of the V-8 with a four-cylinder engine in the latest Mercedes-AMG C63 was a new nameplate, E Performance—and some of these new hybrid models do in fact still use V-8 engines. In the U.S., we've gotten the S63 super-limo so far, and this hybrid setup actually first appeared two years ago on the GT63 S E Performance. Originally slated to debut in the United States for 2023, the hybrid four-door has been delayed. When it finally does arrive stateside, however, it will sport a sharp new face, with Mercedes revealing a refreshed version for Europe.When asked about the E Performance's absence, Mercedes told us that it would reach the United States for the 2024 model year with more details to come as part of a future announcement. We have a strong feeling that the U.S.-bound E Performance will include the revised bodywork from the new European model. The most obvious change is the grille, which now sits within a larger opening with a black intake below the chrome vertical strakes, drawing inspiration from the new Mercedes-AMG GT Coupe. The bumper looks cleaner, with thin air vents on the outside and a subtler lower grille opening. Mercedes also updated the features list, although it's unclear how Mercedes will package U.S.-market models. There is now a standard electric sunroof and wireless phone charger for the rear seats, and the standard Burmester surround sound system incorporates Dolby Atmos spacial audio, like the new E-class and other updated Mercedes-Benz models. The hybrid powertrain is unchanged, with the twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 paired to an electric motor on the rear axle for a total of 831 horsepower and 1032 pound-feet of torque. That thrust is sent through a nine-speed automatic gearbox to all four wheels, with the electric motor powered by a 4.8-kWh battery. The E Performance also has air suspension as standard, and a new color, Opalite White Metallic, joins the lineup. Mercedes should reveal information about the U.S.-spec GT63 S E Performance in the coming months.This story was originally published October 6, 2023.Caleb Miller began blogging about cars at 13 years old, and he realized his dream of writing for a car magazine after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University and joining the Car and Driver team.
