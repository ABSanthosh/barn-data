  "description": "I’ve always had a soft spot for Mercedes-Benz. The sheer luxury they offer simply bowls me over. While hardcore performance cars are often what I usually find myself behind the wheel of, every now and then, it is nice to sink back into the lap of luxury. And that’s been the case with the Mercedes-Benz GLC 220d in our long-term fleet. It was my daily driver for a few weeks, and I must say it always put a smile on my face each time I walked up to it to start my long commute to the office. I really like the styling of the GLC, which is just right and not over-the-top; it looks smart and has a good road presence, too. What I like even more, though, are the interiors. The inside complements the exterior perfectly, beginning with a neat and smart dashboard. However, I have to mention that for an otherwise minimalist cabin during the day, I found the ambient lighting a bit overwhelming with all sorts of colours on the dashboard and around the cabin. Thankfully, it can be toned down to a single colour or the brightness can be reduced. While there have been mixed opinions about it among my colleagues, I personally like the pinstripe pattern, which goes well with the matte dark wood insert on the dash. Active brake-assist activates after every ignition cycle. I also like the large 11.9-inch touchscreen, which is conveniently placed with a slight tilt towards the driver, making it more driver-centric. I also like the fact that most controls are integrated into the central touchscreen, along with a single bar of buttons for quick access to driving modes, park-assist, hazard lights, and volume controls. It sure looks neat, but feels loose when used. Something that I am really particular about in cars is the seats, especially the driver’s, as that’s where I spend most of my time. I must say that the GLC’s front seats were perfect for me. The cushioning is on the firm side, but I really like the side bolstering, which offers great support. I also found the brown leather seats perfectly suited for everyday use, without having to worry about them getting stained or dirty easily. What I found very useful was the seat memory feature, which allowed me to store the seat position, steering reach/rake, and wing mirror position every time I had to swap cars with my colleagues. Another aspect I really appreciated was the Burmester audio system, which delivered top-notch, crisp audio quality. Also worth mentioning are the side footboards, which made it easier to get in and out of the GLC. Burmester audio system delivers crisp sound quality. Another feature that is very helpful is the 360-degree camera, which also offers a simulated under-bonnet view using the front camera. What’s even more interesting is the GPS-activated 360-degree camera, which begins to relay a feed as soon as the GLC arrives at a saved GPS location. This is convenient if your parking spot is in a tight space. One oddity I did notice is that Google Maps via Apple CarPlay is projected on the whole screen, while when using Android Auto, it shows up on only half the screen. The GLC proved to be a perfect mile-muncher as it offered an estimated range of over 800km on a tank of diesel. This made it a go-to choice for long road trips for me, and I enjoyed the way it drives. There’s a healthy dose of torque, and the tall gearing means the GLC 220d was happily stretching its legs on highways. The 9-speed torque converter gearbox worked seamlessly and was fun to toggle between gears via the paddle shifters every once in a while for some enthusiastic driving. I found the suspension to be on the firm side, but it was never uncomfortable. The chunky 55-profile tyres were a boon on bad roads, providing extra cushioning where needed. 55-section tyres add a layer of cushioning to the firm ride. The GLC is equipped with Level 1 ADAS, which includes lane-keep assist and active brake assist. While these features are good for safety on highways, I found the active brake assist too intrusive and sensitive for our cities. Annoyingly, every time I turned it off via the settings, it would come back on with each ignition cycle. But these grouses aside, the GLC is really a well-sorted package and I had a comfortable time using it as my daily driver to work and on some enjoyable drives out of town. It is headed back to Mercedes now, and while I am a bit sad to see it go, on a greener note, we’ve got the Mercedes EQE SUV in the long-term fleet. More on it soon!  Cluster of buttons is very handy but feels loose to touch.
