  "text": "While laws vary by location, it's typically illegal to have red and blue lights on your car December 12, 2024 at 19:44 by Michael Gauthier Police in multiple states and jurisdictions are warning drivers not to install Christmas lights on their vehicle. Besides being a distraction, laws typically ban blue and red lights for non-police use. Several drivers have already been pulled over this year and more are likely given the trend’s popularity. Mercedes isn’t the only one sticking gaudy lights on their cars as an increasing number of people have been adding Christmas lights to their vehicle. Police aren’t a fan and the Wyoming Highway Patrol recently reminded drivers that it’s illegal. In a social media post, they pointed to a statute saying “no person shall drive or move any vehicle … with any lamp or device thereon capable of displaying a red or blue light.” While that would seemingly only ban multicolored Christmas lights, authorities don’t want you to use white lights instead. More: Drifting McLaren 720S Covered Entirely In Christmas Lights Is A Sight To Behold Quite the opposite as they want the holiday to be as dark as your soul. Probably not that dark, but Trooper Jason Simmer told the Cowboy State Daily it’s a safety issue. As he explained, it’s a distraction that “increases reaction time and decreases the amount of time you have to actually react to something.” He also noted that slathering your car in lights could make it harder for other drivers to determine when you’re braking. Wyoming drivers who decide holiday fun is more important than the law are reportedly facing a $100 fine. However, that can drop to $90 if they’re wearing their seatbelt. While those rules apply to the Cowboy State, there are similar laws elsewhere. That includes Massachusetts, where two drivers were recently pulled over for having Christmas lights on their vehicle. However, WBZ News is reporting that neither was ticketed. The York County Regional Police Department also chimed in to note Christmas lights are “very distracting to other drivers and are illegal in Pennsylvania.” Because of this, they asked drivers to save the lights for their house.",
