  "text": "UPDATED: Mar 27, 2025 8:46 PM EDTThe lowest volume seller has significant savings BMW M took a big risk by making its first flagship since the incredible M1 in the late 1970s a radically styled SUV with a hybrid powertrain. And with critical reception tepid at best and sales figures that trail every other BMW in the stable, you may not be terribly surprised to learn that BMW is offering some of its most aggressive rebates ever on the BMW XM. Whether you're a current BMW owner or not, BMW wants you to buy an XM According to a recent dealer bulletin uncovered by CarsDirect, eligible customers can save a total of up to $22,500 on the first-ever BMW M plug-in hybrid. That comes by way of a $5,000 rebate for Conquest (coming from a competing brand) or Loyalty (current BMW driver), meaning that regardless of your current choice of conveyance, BMW will give you $5,000 for taking home an XM. That savings stacks with an existing $15,000 in incentives when financing or paying cash, but by leasing, you can save $17,500 for a total of $22,500 off on your BMW XM. A “halo” M product shouldn't be sitting on lots It's important to note that these offers are only available on the remaining 2024 model year XM SUVs. Lest you fear you're completely out of luck, Autotrader currently shows 60 remaining new 2024 BMW XM units in the US as of this writing. I think I spied one of each color, even, so clearly there's plenty of choice. It also further illuminates why BMW is heavily incentivizing the model. The XM is, whether you agree with it or not, positioned as the crown jewel of the M Series, and new units shouldn't be celebrating birthdays on dealer lots. Historically, the BMW XM sits dead last in sales for the brand. BMW moved less than 2,000 of them in the United States last year, and global sales sat at 7,813—about 25% below even the niche BMW Z4 roadster. Critics claim the XM is too heavy, too similar to other BMWs in the lineup, and, frankly, too unattractive to be considered a true M halo car. Personally, I enjoyed driving the XM and feel that it might be a good vehicle in its own right. But its positioning as the “ultimate M car” is way off. Final thoughts Saving $22,500 is substantial, but when you realize even the least expensive 2024 BMW XM starts at somewhere around $160,000, it's still a tough sell. Fun fact: the $22,500 discount places the XM well within striking distance of the X6 M's base price of $132,100. That car ditches the hybrid system and is actually around half a second quicker from zero to 60 mph. It's more nimble, too, since it weighs half a planet less. If you have been waiting for the opportune moment, though, now is a better time than any to get behind the wheel of BMW's polarizing M hybrid.",
