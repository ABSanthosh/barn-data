  "description": "Recently appointed CBO Sharad Agarwal believes that Classic Legends' ability to balance tradition with modern demands will be key to driving future growth. Launched in 2018, Classic Legends, backed by Mahindra and Mahindra, has spent the past six years reviving iconic motorcycle brands like Jawa, Yezdi, and BSA. Despite a rich legacy, the company’s sales have been hovering around an average of 3,000 units per month. Amid fierce competition in the premium motorcycle segment, Sharad Agarwal, Chief Business Officer at Classic Legends, said that the company's commitment to preserving the authentic DNA of its brands while pursuing sustainable growth is a key focus area for this year. Classic Legends’ portfolio of Jawa, Yezdi, and BSA brings a unique advantage. \"We’re lucky to have three brands, and each of them has its own legacy and DNA in the category,\" Agarwal said. The company’s vision revolves around reviving the authentic classic character of these motorcycles with the right mix of performance and design, he adds. However, in a market dominated by heavyweights like Royal Enfield, KTM, and Bajaj, capturing significant market share is a daunting task. While Royal Enfield continues to dominate with sales averaging at 80,000 units per month, Classic Legends merely banking on nostalgia may not suffice. “Rather than pursuing aggressive short-term gains, we are focused on a medium to long-term trajectory. We’re expanding our footprint but want to have sustainable growth,” Agarwal explained. The company plans to stabilize its dealership network at around 400 outlets this year, aiming for broader coverage and customer reach. To fuel its ambitions, Classic Legends has earmarked a ₹1,000 crore investment till FY26 to strengthen marketing, distribution \u0026 new product development. “This funding is directed towards new models, processes, and expanding the production capabilities needed for a sustainable future. Our goal is to transform this classic motorcycling category with our challenger approach and grow these three brands,” Agarwal added. Global Expansion: A Path to Growth Classic Legends’ international aspirations are clear. The company is planning to expand BSA into key markets such as the US, Dubai, and Australia, with the BSA Scrambler set to launch internationally in the new financial year. Jawa, too, is poised for a global rollout soon. “When we’re expanding into new markets, it’s clearly showing the growth path that we’re going to take,” said Agarwal, highlighting the importance of exports in driving future sales. This international push is a strategic move to leverage BSA’s brand recall, especially in Western markets where the brand enjoys a cult following. However, cracking these markets will require competitive pricing, a robust dealer network, and a product lineup that can challenge established players. For electric vehicles, as well, Classic Legends is adopting a cautious approach. While many manufacturers like Royal Enfield are diving headfirst into the EV segment, Agarwal believes the premium category is yet to witness a meaningful EV transformation. “We’re ready with the technology, but we don't want to just do it as a ‘me too’ product. At the right time, we’ll enter,” he said. Also see: Ola Electric to get Rs 74 crore incentive from Government under PLI scheme",
