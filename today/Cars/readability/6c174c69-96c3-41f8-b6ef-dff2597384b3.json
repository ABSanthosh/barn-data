  "text": "A Norwegian manufacturer of synthetic graphite has inked a deal with General Motors to supply the stuff as part of the process to build electric vehicle batteries. However, the Nordmenn have indicated they will build a plant in America for this purpose.As reported by  The Detroit News and Reuters, an outfit called Vianode has agreed to supply synthetic graphite for The General’s electric cars starting in the 2027 calendar year. Anode graphite is apparently the largest part of a lithium-ion battery in terms of its weight, so a reliable source is key to cranking out this important EV component. At present, it is suggested that China controls over 90 percent of global graphite supply. Vianode says they are planning to build a plant for this purpose somewhere in North America, despite the company having roots in Norway. There’s every chance in the world such a facility will end up in close physical proximity to existing GM/LG battery production, a decision which would make sense in terms of supply chain and assembly challenges. Logistics are a heckuva thing when assembling something so complex as an electric car.The company already has a plant in its home country, with the new North American effort said to possibly add enough synthetic graphite to supply about 1.5 million electric vehicles. Spox for Vianode say they are in talks to supply other automakers in addition to The General. As an aside, it is of no small irony that the GM/LG joint venture handling these matters is called Ultium Cells, a name which is no longer welcome to be spoken in the halls of General Motors. GM claims it was the #2 seller of EVs in America across the second half of 2024. It reported that sales of its electric vehicles accelerated consistently throughout the year, culminating with Q4 sales of 42,000 units. That number was up about 10,000 from the third quarter and nearly twice the Q2 total.[Image: GM]Become a TTAC insider.
