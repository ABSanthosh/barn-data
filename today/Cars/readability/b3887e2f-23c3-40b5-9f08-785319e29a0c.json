  "description": "This Kirkham Motorsports 427/SC was assembled in 2007 at FE Specialties of Sacramento, California, and it is powered by a 428ci Ford Cobra Jet V8 with Stage II-ported Edelbrock cylinder heads, SCAT H-beam connecting rods, Ross pistons, a Crower camshaft, a Holley carburetor, an Aviaid oil pan, and an MSD billet distributor. The brushed aluminum bodywork is mounted to a stainless-steel frame riding on an independent suspension that features adjustable coilovers, billet control arms and uprights, Wilwood disc brakes, and Halibrand-style 15” knock-off wheels. A Tremec TKO 600 five-speed manual transmission is linked to a Jaguar rear end, and equipment includes a Lakewood safety bellhousing, a McLeod clutch assembly, a driver-side roll hoop, Raydot-style mirrors, quick-jack bumperettes, and side-exit exhaust pipes. The interior is outfitted with black low-back bucket seats, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a fire suppression system, and Smiths gauges. Acquired by the current owner in 2022, this 427/SC is now offered on dealer consignment in Arizona with a Florida title listing the car as a 1965 Cobra.",

The brushed aluminum bodywork is mounted to a stainless-steel frame riding on an independent suspension that features adjustable coilovers, billet control arms and uprights, Wilwood disc brakes, and Halibrand-style 15” knock-off wheels. A Tremec TKO 600 five-speed manual transmission is linked to a Jaguar rear end, and equipment includes a Lakewood safety bellhousing, a McLeod clutch assembly, a driver-side roll hoop, Raydot-style mirrors, quick-jack bumperettes, and side-exit exhaust pipes. The interior is outfitted with black low-back bucket seats, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a fire suppression system, and Smiths gauges. Acquired by the current owner in 2022, this 427/SC is now offered on dealer consignment in Arizona with a Florida title listing the car as a 1965 Cobra. Kirkham Motorsports was founded in Provo, Utah, in the 1990s, and the 427/SC utilizes an aluminum body and stainless-steel chassis fabricated in Poland. This example has a fully brushed exterior and features a hood scoop, a polished driver-side roll hoop, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, Raydot-style mirrors, and wind wings as well as black quick-jack bumperettes and side-exit exhaust pipes. Halibrand-style 15” knock-off wheels are finished in black and secured with three-eared spinners retained by safety wire. The yellow-letter Goodyear Eagle tires measure 26.5×8.0” up front and 26.5×10.5” out back. The independent suspension utilizes adjustable coilovers and billet aluminum control arms and uprights at all four corners. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs with Wilwood calipers all around, and the system fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale. The cabin features low-back bucket seats trimmed in black upholstery along with a color-coordinated dashboard fascia, door pockets, and carpets. Additional appointments include a fire suppression system, Stroud latch-and-link harnesses, and drilled aluminum pedals. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation consisting of a reverse-sweep 180-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 93 miles. Total mileage is unknown. The blueprinted 428ci Cobra Jet V8 was built at FE Specialties using SCAT H-beam connecting rods, Ross pistons, a Crower camshaft and lifters, Smith Brothers pushrods, Erson rocker assemblies, a Melling high-volume oil pump, and an Aviaid T-sump oil pan. A Stage II port job was carried out on the Edelbrock cylinder heads, and ARP fasteners were used. The Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold is topped with a Holley 850-cfm carburetor, and a “turkey pan” air box has been installed along with Cobra Le Mans-branded valve covers as well as an MSD billet distributor and Blaster 3 ignition coil. The aluminum radiator is cooled by an electric puller fan. The fuel cell was replaced in preparation for the sale, and an oil change was performed. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec TKO 600 five-speed manual transmission equipped with a Lakewood safety bellhousing, a McLeod flywheel and clutch assembly, and a hydraulic throwout bearing. The rear end is sourced from a Jaguar. The car is titled using the Pennsylvania assigned VIN SW132343PA. The current Florida title describes the car as a 1965 Cobra and notes a “PA-KIT” brand. Additionally, the car carries a California BAR sticker that was issued in 2008, which describes the car as a 2007 SPCN COBRA REPL and lists the VIN as KC6DSLC0478. That VIN matches the number shown on the Kirkham Motorsports identification plate. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
