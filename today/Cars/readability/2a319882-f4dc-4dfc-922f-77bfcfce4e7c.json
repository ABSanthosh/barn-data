It is powered by a supercharged 3.0-liter V6 linked to an eight-speed automatic transaxle and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system and is finished in Glacier White Metallic over Velvet Beige leather. Equipment includes the Executive Package, 20″ five-double-spoke alloy wheels, an adaptive air suspension, a panoramic sunroof, LED headlights, heated and ventilated front sport seats with massage function, heated rear seats, Bose audio, a top-view camera system, four-zone automatic climate control, and Audi MMI infotainment with navigation. This D4 A8L is now offered in New Jersey at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, two key fobs, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title. The car is finished in Glacier White Metallic (LS9R) and features LED headlights, fog lights, Audi Parking System parking sensors, a top-view camera system, and a panoramic sunroof. The 20″ five-double-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 265/40 Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4 tires, and braking is handled by ventilated discs at each corner. The car came factory equipped with an adaptive air suspension system. The tire pressure monitoring system warning light is illuminated. The heated, ventilated, and massaging power-adjustable front sport seats are trimmed in Velvet Beige leather, and amenities include brown and gold natural fine grain wood trim, a head-up display, heated outboard rear seats, power-operated rear sunshades, four-zone automatic climate control, Audi Side Assist, Audi Advanced Key keyless entry and start, a Bose sound system, Audi Music Interface, and Audi MMI infotainment with a pop-up display and navigation. The heated leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, a TFT display, and auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer shows 44k miles. The supercharged 3.0-liter TFSI V6 was factory rated at 333 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to all four wheels through a Tiptronic eight-speed automatic transaxle and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
