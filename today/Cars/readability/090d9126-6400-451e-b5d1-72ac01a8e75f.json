  "text": "This 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe was purchased by the seller in 2023 and has since been driven 2k of the 37k miles shown. The car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Polar Silver over gray leather upholstery. Additional equipment includes 18″ wheels, a power-operated sunroof, headlight washers, rear stone guards, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a “basket handle” fixed rear spoiler, cruise control, a Porsche Classic Radio, and air conditioning. This 993 Carrera coupe is now offered with the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in Polar Silver (L92M) and features headlight washers, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, a power-operated sunroof, rear stone guards, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a “basket handle” fixed rear spoiler with an integrated third brake light, a rear window wiper, and dual exhaust outlets. The rear spoiler plate was replaced in March 2023. The 18″ wheels are mounted with 225/40 front and 265/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires that were installed in March 2023. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The rear brake pads were also replaced in March 2023. The front seats are upholstered in gray leather and complemented by a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. A Porsche Classic Radio was installed in March 2023, and additional amenities include cruise control, Porsche crest floormats, and air conditioning that was also recharged in March 2023. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 37k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The air-cooled 3.6L flat-six was factory rated at 270 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. In March 2023 an oil change was performed and the air filter and oil level sender were replaced in March 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: L92M – Polar Silver paint C02 – Version for USA 030 – Sports suspension 220 – Limited-slip differential 224 – Automatic Braking Differential (ABD) 233 – Internal production code related to tires 331 – Becker Porsche CR-1 cassette stereo 398 – 17″ wheels 454 – Cruise control 650 – Power sunroof The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. There is currently a lien out on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner.
