Finished in Light Jade over Jade Green cloth and vinyl, the truck is powered by a 400ci V8 linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The camper is equipped with a telescoping upper section as well as a three-burner stove, a refrigerator, a sink, a dinette table, and convertible bench seating, while the truck cab is appointed with an AM radio, cruise control, and air conditioning. Additional equipment includes 16″ steel wheels, manually locking front hubs, Gabriel rear air shocks, a receiver hitch, and exterior storage cabinets. The seller acquired the truck on BaT in July 2023, and the master cylinder was replaced in August 2024. This F-250 is now offered with a clean Wyoming title in the seller’s name. The truck is finished in Light Jade and equipped with a chrome front bumper, low-mount swing-away mirrors, and a receiver hitch. The telescopic upper portion of the camper can be raised from its travel position via a manually operated hand pump to permit occupants to stand up inside. The utility cargo bed is equipped with cabinets, slide-out drawers, and a diamond-plate trim on the rear bumper. Black-painted 16″ steel wheels with bright center covers are mounted with 7.50″-width Power King Extra Traction tires. The truck is equipped with power steering and manually locking front hubs as well as power-assisted front disc and rear drum brakes. The power steering pump was replaced under previous ownership, and Rancho front shocks and Gabriel rear air shocks were also installed. The brake master cylinder was replaced in August 2024. The front bench seat is trimmed in Jade Green vinyl with cloth inserts, and the SuperCab cabin is further appointed with an AM stereo, air conditioning, cruise control, inward-facing rear jump seats, and a fire extinguisher. The two-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, battery charge status, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 47k miles, approximately 100 of which were added by the seller. The camper compartment may be accessed from the rear entry door or via the truck cab pass-through. Bench seating converts into a bed, and additional features include a dinette table, a sink, a three-burner stove, a refrigerator, storage cabinets, a roof vent, and overhead lamps. The lift seals are said to have been replaced under previous ownership. Wear is visible on various wood components. The 400ci V8 was factory rated at 169 horsepower. Various radiator hoses were replaced under previous ownership, and one of the two batteries was replaced in August 2024. Power is delivered to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The output shaft seal was replaced under previous ownership. Rust is noted on the driver-side floor pan, and corrosion can be seen in various underside components. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
