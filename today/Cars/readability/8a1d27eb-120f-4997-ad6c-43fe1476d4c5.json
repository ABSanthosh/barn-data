I can't possibly imagine a more visceral automotive experience than being in the passenger seat of such raw, unadulterated machines.Parnelli Jones 1970 Mustang Boss 302 Side ShotGabriel IonicaThe race track was an entirely new experience for meDespite being a self-proclaimed car guy, the track has always eluded me. My knowledge of the racing scene is nearly nonexistent. I had never been to a track to watch any sort of race, and I most certainly had never been in a ride-along in a race car. So when the email invitation came to attend the Velocity Invitational practice day and be tossed around both the paved and off-road tracks, nothing short of a hospital visit could have stopped me from saying yes.A purebred Parnelli Jones Mustang was my first foray into high-speed thrillsAt about noon on Thursday, October 3rd, I stared a Mustang in the face. The number 15 1970 Mustang Boss 302, once piloted by the great Parnelli Jones, was staring back, with its side pipe exhaust snarling in my ears. It was a menacing machine, requiring nerves of steel to pilot its eight cylinders past the checkered flag. Its current owner and tamer, Jeff O'Neill, is also the founder of Velocity Invitational and undoubtedly the right person to be holding its reins.I was handed a helmet, and thanks to my ballerina-like figure, I did short work climbing inside past the roll cage. Three clicks and a button press awoke the beast once more, and with a quick throw into first gear, we were off.An adrenaline-fueled ride gave me a newfound respect for the Mustang's powerIt's safe to say Jeff did not hold back, and I was more than thankful. The intoxicating combination of the race fuel, 5000-rpm corners, and the patriotic chorus of eight cylinders singing ahead of me was enough to turn me into an addict. From that moment, I was a believer. Every apex we crested left me wanting more and I think Jeff knew. By lap 2, the pedal hardly left the floor. It may have been just a practice session on an empty track, but it felt like we were gunning for a world championship.A moment of elation in the Parnelli Jones Boss 302 MustangGabriel IonicaOne lap later, it was over almost as quickly as it had begun. We rolled into the pits, where the crew was waiting for us. I exited as elegantly as I had gotten in and removed my helmet, welcoming the breeze. Glancing back at the Mustang that had shaken me to my core seconds ago, I had a newfound appreciation for its capabilities. The car was proud to have shown off its power to a rookie like me.From the pavement to the dirt trackThankfully, my day was not over yet, and we hopped in Diana's Subaru on our way to the dirt track. Just beyond the campgrounds of Sonoma Raceway, Velocity Invitational has repurposed some of the dirt lots for an impromptu rally stage spearheaded by the team at DirtFish Rally School. My steed this time was a slightly modernized 1968 Ford Escort Mark piloted by John Hill.1968 Ford Escort Mark IGabriel IonicaOnce more, I put on the helmet and did roll cage yoga. The course began with a slight uphill, and once we crested it, all bets were off.Four fewer cylinders, an equal amount of funJohn's foot slammed the gas and in a split second, the four-cylinder Cosworth BDG engine replied with a rev to redline, all 265 or so horses pushing the little Ford onwards. Every corner was deftly navigated with a powerslide, pebbles slamming into the body and dirt flung sky-high. If hard steering wasn't enough to turn a corner, liberal use of the hand brake kicked the rear end around. On the second lap, John played chicken with the hay bales strategically placed around the track, coming within inches of each one. Sideways. We crossed the finish line, and I felt like Colin McRae. Just substitute the Subaru for a Ford.Track racing and rally racing are as similar as they are differentIt took me a second to process the differences between the two art forms I had just witnessed. I won't say one is superior to the other; that wouldn't be right. They both require different sets of skills despite being similar at their core. On-track racing relies on keeping the same racing line while passing your opponents simultaneously and paying attention to not overdo a turn lest it end in your demise. It's a delicate balance between raw power and acrobatics.Rallying is a dance. You're rowing through gears and fishtailing around corners in a desperate attempt to beat the clock. The terrain is even more treacherous, with you, your co-driver, and your car being just one wrong slide away from an intimate meeting with a tree. It's the ballet of racing, except a little dirtier.It was a bit of a tight fitGabriel IonicaDriving will never be the same after thisAnd just like that, my crash course into the world of racing, thankfully with no actual crashes, ended. From now on, every car I drive or ride off the track will feel painfully underwhelming. Regular driving will never be the same; I'll always yearn for the scent of hot asphalt, racing fuel, and the thrill of off-road drifts.After today, I am a new man, a proud convert. I understand the pursuit of thrill, the need for speed, and the desire to discover the limits of man and machine, bonded in a screaming chase for the checkered flag. And I want more.",

You\u0026#39;re rowing through gears and fishtailing around corners in a desperate attempt to beat the clock. The terrain is even more treacherous, with you, your co-driver, and your car being just one wrong slide away from an intimate meeting with a tree. It\u0026#39;s the ballet of racing, except a little dirtier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\u003cphoenix-picture\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.webp 380w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.webp 620w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.webp 700w\"/\u003e\u003csource sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.jpg 380w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.jpg 620w, https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.jpg 700w\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"It was a bit of a tight fit\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/t_share/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.autoblog.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjA5Nzc4MjM5MzgyNDk2OTM3/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tight-fit.jpg\" height=\"4080\" width=\"3072\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" itemprop=\"contentUrl url\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/phoenix-picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"caption\"\u003eIt was a bit of a tight fit\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"author\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGabriel Ionica\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"driving-will-never-be-the-same-after-this\"\u003eDriving will never be the same after this\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, my crash course into the world of racing, thankfully with no actual crashes, ended.
