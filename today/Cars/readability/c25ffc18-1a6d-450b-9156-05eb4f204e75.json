  "text": "The Frontier-based pickup features two 43-inch TVs and Starlink internet for streaming football games 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Nissan has introduced a tailgate-friendly Frontier, ahead of its debut at SEMA. The modified pickup features two 43-inch TVs as well as Starlink satellite internet for streaming football games. Other highlights include a lift kit, a revised suspension, and a propane grill. Fall is football season, but it’s also perfect for off-roading. This is a conundrum, which Nissan is trying to solve with Project Trailgater. Based on the facelifted Frontier Pro-4X, the model was built in collaboration with Music City Trucks and features a host of Nismo Off-Road accessories. These include a lift kit and a revised suspension with forged upper control arms as well as performance shocks, springs, and coilovers. They’re joined by a cat-back exhaust, a roof rack, auxiliary lights, and 17-inch beadlock-capable wheels that are wrapped in Yokohama Geolandar M/T tires.

To this end, the model features a bed-mounted overlanding rack that has been equipped with two 43-inch TVs as well as a soundbar. They’re joined by a Decked drawer system that houses a propane grill and a Dometic cooler. The amenities continue inside as the rear seat has been replaced by a custom-fabricated floor leveling plate. This enabled the team to install a custom lithium battery pack, a refrigerator, and a Starlink kit for streaming football games in the middle of nowhere. If that wasn’t impressive enough, the truck has a 180-watt folding solar panel as well as a fold-out kitchen station with a sink. There’s also a fire pit and a ton of electrical equipment to keep the party going well into the night. Nissan didn’t mention performance specifications, but the standard truck has a 3.8-liter V6 engine with 310 hp (231 kW / 314 PS) and 281 lb-ft (381 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to a nine-speed automatic transmission and an available four-wheel drive system. Project Trailgater will be shown at the SEMA Show next month, where it will be joined by four other concepts.",
