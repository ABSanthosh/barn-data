  "text": "Published:  June 13th, 2025 Hey hey! It's time for this week's edition of the TTAC Podcast! This week on the TTAC podcast, we discuss Peak Auto, Ram’s return to NASCAR, and how to get bugs out of your grille.Our guest this week is Autoline’s John McElroy, who helps us figure out if we’ve reached peak auto. He also walks us through where the auto industry is and where it’s going. TTAC contributors Matthew Guy and Matt Posky join me to discuss Ram, NASCAR, and the race at Michigan – Matt Posky was there. Finally, Matthew Guy and I go over bug-remover chemicals. Yes, Ram is back in NASCAR, which is what we teased last week. Now that the embargo has been lifted, we'll have more to come on that topic. You can find us wherever you get your podcasts or by clicking  here. If you like what you hear, please leave a review!We thank John McElroy, Matthew Guy, and Matt Posky for their time, and Matt Posky for editing. Most of all, we thank you for listening.

Find Guaranteed Fit Parts at eBay Motors Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.

I was told, in no uncertain terms, that the future of the auto industry is electric vehicles. When you peer into those prognostic crystal balls, do you cup them?",
