  "description": "This 1958 Chevrolet Corvette was modified and refurbished circa 2008, and it is powered by a 383ci stroker V8 with an Englese individual throttle body setup along with FAST fuel injection and MSD ignition. The Tremec five-speed manual transmission is linked to a 9\" rear end with a limited-slip differential, and further equipment includes Hedman headers, a custom mandrel-bent X-pipe exhaust system, a BeCool radiator, and custom air cleaner assemblies. The car rides on a Jim Meyer Racing suspension with adjustable coilovers at all four wheels along with rack-and-pinion steering, tubular control arms, and Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes, and the Billet Specialties 18\" wheels wear Firestone Firehawk tires that were installed in 2025. White and red paint covers the exterior, while the cabin is outfitted with a Hurst Sidewinder shifter, custom speaker mounts, and bolstered bucket seats trimmed in red vinyl. This modified C1 is now offered on dealer consignment with an owner-provided build document and a clean Florida title.",

The Tremec five-speed manual transmission is linked to a 9″ rear end with a limited-slip differential, and further equipment includes Hedman headers, a custom mandrel-bent X-pipe exhaust system, a BeCool radiator, and custom air cleaner assemblies. The car rides on a Jim Meyer Racing suspension with adjustable coilovers at all four wheels along with rack-and-pinion steering, tubular control arms, and Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes, and the Billet Specialties 18″ wheels wear Firestone Firehawk tires that were installed in 2025. White and red paint covers the exterior, while the cabin is outfitted with a Hurst Sidewinder shifter, custom speaker mounts, and bolstered bucket seats trimmed in red vinyl. This modified C1 is now offered on dealer consignment with an owner-provided build document and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in “Light Pearl Effect White” with red coves, and it is not equipped with a soft top or a hardtop. Exterior elements include Fuel Injection emblems, chrome decklid accents, and dual exhaust outlets beneath the rear valance. The “washboard” hood was unique to 1958 model year Corvettes, and the car is equipped with quad LED headlights, split bumpers, and a chrome side mirror. Billet Specialties 18″ wheels wear a polished finish and are shod in Firestone Firehawk Indy 500 tires that were installed in May 2025. Braking is handled by red six-piston front and four-piston rear Wilwood calipers over drilled and slotted rotors. It rides on a refurbished and powder-coated frame with a four-link Jim Meyer Racing suspension comprised of adjustable coilovers, rack-and-pinion steering, tubular control arms, and sway bars front and rear. The bolstered bucket seats are trimmed in red vinyl and are equipped with Simpson latch-and-link harnesses, and LizardSkin sound and heat insulation was applied beneath the replacement carpets. The trunk has been upholstered to match the cabin, and appointments noted by the selling dealer include a Hurst Sidewinder shifter, an iPhone auxiliary audio input, and custom speaker mounts. The Billet Specialties steering wheel sits on an Ididit column and frames a sweeping 160-mph speedometer and an AutoMeter tachometer as well as gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, battery charge, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 9k miles, and the owner states approximately 8k miles were added since the completion of the build as the odometer could only be reset to 1k miles. Total mileage is unknown. The 383ci stroker V8 sits on heavy-duty mounts and breathes through an Englese eight-stack throttle body setup with FAST electronic fuel injection and custom air cleaner assemblies. The seller tells us it is further equipped with “Fast Burn” aluminum cylinder heads, a BeCool radiator, an electric fan, Aeromotive fuel system components, and an MSD ignition system, starter, and alternator. The throttle bodies were cleaned and the spark plugs were replaced in May 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec TKO600 five-speed manual transmission and a 9″ rear end with a Truetrac differential and 3.50:1 gears. Fluid services for the engine, transmission, and differential were carried out in June 2022. The custom ceramic-coated 2.5″ exhaust system is comprised of Hedman headers, a mandrel-bent X-pipe, and chambered mufflers. Photos taken during the build are provided in the gallery below.
