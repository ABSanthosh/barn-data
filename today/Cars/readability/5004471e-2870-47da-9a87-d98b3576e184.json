  "description": "This 1974 Lamborghini Espada is one of 472 Series III examples built between 1972 and 1978, approximately 55 of which came equipped from the factory with a Chrysler TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission. The car is said to have been initially delivered to California and later spent time in Texas before being exported to Kuwait in the mid-2000s, where it reportedly remained under the care of the country's then Prime Minister through 2022, when it was brought back to the US. Finished in burgundy over tan leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 3.9-liter quad-cam V12 equipped with six Weber carburetors. Additional equipment includes 15\" Campagnolo magnesium wheels, a sunroof, a quad-exit exhaust system, power windows, air conditioning, and a Kenwood cassette player. The current owner acquired the car in 2022 and service performed since then is said to have involved overhauling the carburetors as well as replacing the fuel pump, fuel filter, and battery, though the car has a cylinder head gasket leak and requires additional service before being driven. This S3 Espada is being offered as a running project in California with manufacturer's literature and a clean Florida title.",

The car is said to have been initially delivered to California and later spent time in Texas before being exported to Kuwait in the mid-2000s, where it reportedly remained under the care of the country’s then Prime Minister through 2022, when it was brought back to the US. Finished in burgundy over tan leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 3.9-liter quad-cam V12 equipped with six Weber carburetors. Additional equipment includes 15″ Campagnolo magnesium wheels, a sunroof, a quad-exit exhaust system, power windows, air conditioning, and a Kenwood cassette player. The current owner acquired the car in 2022 and service performed since then is said to have involved overhauling the carburetors as well as replacing the fuel pump, fuel filter, and battery, though the car has a cylinder head gasket leak and requires additional service before being driven. This S3 Espada is being offered as a running project in California with manufacturer’s literature and a clean Florida title. Unveiled at the 1968 Geneva Motor Show, the Espada featured Bertone bodywork styled by Marcello Gandini and was produced in three series over the subsequent decade. Design highlights include a transparent vertical rear panel, a glass hatch with an electric defroster, roof vents, and an aluminum hood panel incorporating twin NACA ducts and dual side fender vents. This example is noted to have left the factory in Luci del Bosco and was repainted in its current shade of burgundy some time ago. A dent and peeling paint are visible on the hood, and the front US-specification impact bumpers show discoloration. The 15×7″ Campagnolo magnesium alloy wheels feature Lamborghini-branded center caps and are mounted with older 215/70 Michelin XWX radial tires. The car is equipped with power-assisted steering and rides on four-wheel independent suspension with double wishbones, coil springs, hydraulic shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars. The braking system requires service and is comprised of Girling three-piston calipers over ventilated discs at all four corners. The 2+2 cabin features front and rear bucket seats trimmed in tan leather along with a color-matched dashboard, center console, door panels, and carpets. Further appointments include a sliding sunroof, woodgrain door panel trim, power windows, air conditioning, and a Kenwood cassette player. Creasing is noted on the seating surfaces, tears are visible along the driver’s seat upholstery, and the carpets and headliner show wear. The three-spoke steering wheel fronts Jaeger instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer, a 9k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 24k miles. The 3.9-liter V12 features an aluminum block with cast-iron cylinder liners, aluminum pistons, and aluminum cylinder heads with dual overhead camshafts on each bank as well as six two-barrel Weber carburetors. Factory output was rated at 350 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. Work performed in 2022 reportedly involved overhauling the carburetors and replacing the fuel pump, while service completed in anticipation of the sale consisted of draining the fuel tank and replacing a fuel line, the fuel filter, and battery. A leak at the head gasket is noted by the selling dealer. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Chrysler TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission. The car is equipped with a quad-exit exhaust system. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
