  "description": "Citroen finds its value niche within the Stellantis juggernaut with a likeable, practical electric hatchback As the various brands of the Stellantis juggernaut try to find their place and identity, Citroën appears to be morphing into the French Skoda, and the best example of that is the Citroën ë-C4, and its piston-powered equivalent the Citroën C4.Years ago, that Skoda comparison would have been an insult, but it certainly isn’t today. Skoda takes shared mechanicals and manages to make them just that bit easier to use, less pretentious and more practical.The ë-C4 attempts a similar trick, taking the basis of a small car and building a bigger but cheaper one on top. So the ë-C4 has the same e-CMP platform as the Peugeot e-208 and is priced in line with that car, but it’s the size of the Peugeot e-308.Citroën has just given it quite a comprehensive visual update to keep the family resemblance with the Citroen ë-C3, and to keep it fresh in a field with plenty of attractively priced alternatives like the Renault 5 and upcoming Renault 4, as well as the MG4 and Kia EV3.As before, there’s also a slightly weird saloon version of the ë-C4, called ë-C4 X. It’s mechanically identical, so we’ll briefly touch on the differences where relevant.",

  "text": "The Citroën ë-C4’s spacious, boldly featured and imaginatively laid-out interior helps the ambience transcend the influence of some of the cabin’s cheaper-feeling materials. There’s a wide variety of materials and finishes, from traditional graining to modern technical graining and fabrics, including a bold sash down the door. Up front, there’s a very good amount of cabin storage, with various trays, bins and not one but two gloveboxes. For the 2025 update, Citroën has played around with the colours and materials but hasn’t made any substantive changes to the design. With their memory foam construction, the ë-C4 X’s Advanced Comfort seats come with quite the billing. With the 2025 update, they’re supposedly even further improved, with 15mm thicker foam. In practice, the seats and driving position are a little peculiar. The seat material is indeed very soft and gives the impression it might swallow the occupant whole, but we didn’t find them more supportive or comfortable than most other seats. Like other cars on this platform, the C4 has quite a long-arm, short-leg driving position that doesn’t suit everybody. The seats are angled in a way that lessens the effect, but does create a semi-recumbent driving position.   Rear passengers have more legroom than in superminis like the Renault 5 and Peugeot e208, but less than in an MG4 or Kia EV3. They also benefit from a pair of air vents and a single USB port. At 380 litres, the boot occupies a similar territory relative to rivals. The ë-C4 X expands that to 510 litres, though it is accessed via a notchback-style bootlid rather than a hatch. It’s a shallower space than the C4 hatchback offers but still quite long and wide and well able to swallow bigger suitcases and storage boxes, although it’s a little sparsely provisioned. (There are no power sockets or retention nets.) Infotainment All versions of the car get a 10.0in touchscreen infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster (5.5in originally, and on You! trim, 7in from 2025). Both are fairly clear, and you can customise them to show what you find useful. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both wireless and well-integrated. Voice control works consistently well when entering navigation destinations, and the navigation system plots routes intelligently and with good live traffic information. Unlike on Peugeot models with effectively the same interface, the Citroën C4’s screens aren’t cluttered with climate controls, since there are separate physical buttons and dials for these. This shared Stellantis interface is never the zippiest, but the touchscreen on our 2025 test car was particularly laggy and unresponsive – some of the worst we’ve found recently. This was not the case on earlier test cars, so may have been a glitch on that particular car.",
