This Delta Integrale Evo 2 shows 41k kilometers (~25k miles) and is now offered in Arizona on dealer consignment with owner’s manuals, service records, and a clean Montana title. Approximately 2,500 examples of the Integrale Evo 2 were produced for the 1993 and 1994 model years, and each came equipped with hood vents, a high-mounted adjustable rear spoiler, and box-flared wheel arches. This example is finished in Blu Lord (438) and features Martini Racing lettering on the rear spoiler, a rear wiper, and Carello fog lights. Photos of paint meter readings are viewable in the photo gallery below. The 16″ Speedline Montecarlo alloy wheels are mounted with 205/45 Yokohama Advan Fleva V701 tires that were fitted in preparation for the sale. The car is equipped with adjustable front and rear coilovers, and stopping power is provided by anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes. The current gallery photos of the wheels were taken before the replacement tires were installed. The cabin features Recaro front seats and split folding rear seats trimmed in Beige Alcantara along with matching door panel inserts. Interior appointments include power front windows, HF-logo floor mats, air conditioning, a carbon-fiber shifter surround, an aftermarket CD stereo, and a Sparco gas pedal. Wear is visible on the passenger’s seat bolsters. The seats were repaired and the headliner was replaced in preparation for the sale. A Delta Integrale HF “Edizione Finale” plaque is mounted behind the shifter. The leather-wrapped MOMO Corse steering wheel fronts a 240-km/h speedometer, a 9k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for boost pressure, voltage, fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. A Blitz Racing turbo boost pressure gauge is mounted to the left of the instrument binnacle, and an HKS boost controller has been added to the right of the ignition switch. The six-digit odometer shows 41k kilometers (~25k miles), approximately 500 kilometers (~310) of which were added under current ownership. The transversely mounted turbocharged and intercooled 2.0-liter DOHC inline-four is spanned by a front strut tower brace, and it has been fitted with Samco Sport silicone hoses and a machined aluminum oil pan. The fluid levels and condition were inspected and assessed in preparation for the sale, per the selling dealer. Power is routed to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle, a Ferguson viscous center differential, and a Torsen limited-slip rear differential. Presto rear exhaust components have been installed, and the underside was cleaned with dry ice in preparation for the sale. Japanese-language manufacturer’s literature and inspection records are included in the sale. No Carfax report is available for this vehicle as no entries have been generated. There is currently on the car, and the current owner’s lender will need to be repaid before the title can be transferred to a new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
