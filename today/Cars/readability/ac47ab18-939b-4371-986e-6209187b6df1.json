It has a limited-slip differential, a removable roof panel, 390mm Cromodora alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, and a quad-exit exhaust system as well as a gated shifter, electric windows, and a Kenwood stereo with Bluetooth. The car is said to have spent the past three years in storage at the seller’s facility, and work performed in preparation for the sale included refinishing the wheels, repairing the odometer, and replacing the timing belt and alternator. This 308 GTS is now offered in Canada by the seller on behalf of the current owner with Ontario registration in the owner’s name that lists the car as a 1980 model. The hardtop 308 GTB debuted at the 1975 Paris Motor Show, while the targa-top GTS model was introduced at the 1977 Frankfurt Motor Show. This GTS example is finished in red and features a black removable roof panel, pop-up headlights, a vented decklid, and quad exhaust outlets. Some exterior seals are cracking. Touch-up paint was applied and the side mirrors were replaced in preparation for the sale. Silver 390mm Cromodora alloy wheels are mounted with 205/70 Michelin Defender tires. The car features a fully independent suspension with double wishbones front and rear, and stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at each corner. The wheels were refinished in preparation for the sale. The cockpit features bolstered seats trimmed in black leather upholstery along with matching door panels. A Kenwood CD stereo with Bluetooth has been installed. The gated shifter features a dogleg gear pattern. The upholstery on the seats and door panels is faded. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel fronts Veglia instrumentation including a 280-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,700-rpm redline, and supplementary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 59k kilometers (~37k miles), approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. The odometer was repaired in 2025, and total mileage is unknown. The mid-mounted 2.9L quad-cam V8 is equipped with four twin-choke Weber 40DCNF carburetors and was factory rated at 237 horsepower. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The timing belt and alternator were replaced in April 2025, at which time an oil change was performed. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below. Stamping F106AS✩28349✩ is visible in the engine compartment and corresponds to the VIN shown on the Ontario registration. The manufacturer’s identification plate mounted to the driver’s door jamb shows the VIN as 28349. The Ontario registration lists the model year as 1980 and carries an “unplated” notation. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada.
