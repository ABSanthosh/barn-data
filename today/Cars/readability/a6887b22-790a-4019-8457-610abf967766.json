The utilitarian nature of these plucky single-cylinder machines means that, although they’re visually bland, they’re also very simple. And that makes them ripe for customization.

They’re easy to handle in tight traffic, robust, and easy to maintain—and since they’re not subject to the same taxes as bigger bikes, they’re more affordable too. The utilitarian nature of these plucky single-cylinder machines means that, although they’re visually bland, they’re also very simple. And that makes them ripe for customization. The Taiwanese workshop 2LOUD Custom knows this all too well. Founder Ma ‘Max’ Yicheng has churned out countless customs based on small bikes from popular local brands like Kymco and SYM. Today, he’s treating us to a delightful Yamaha SR150 street tracker. A distant cousin of the more famous Yamaha SR500, the now-defunct SR150 was built in Taiwan exclusively for the local market. It was popular with commuters when it launched—and it’s become a hit among the country’s top custom shops. Max got the call to customize this particular Yamaha SR150 from a friend who’s owned it for years. “He decided to give his baby a new soul,” Max quips. Fans of 2LOUD’s work will recognize the shop’s signature style all over the petite Yamaha. Max has a sharp eye and excellent taste, so everything from the bike’s stance to its finishes is right on the money. To give the SR150 proper street tracker proportions, Max built a set of 19F/18R wheels, using aluminum rims, stainless steel spokes, and vintage trials-style tires from Duro. The drum brake hubs appear to be polished, but they’ve actually been finished in a high-temp metallic paint. Max used the same metallic paint on the fork yokes, and then refurbished the OEM forks with fresh sundries. The rear shocks are new items from the Taiwanese suspension brand GJMS. Moving to the motor, Max cleaned up the cases before treating them to a mix of painted and polished finishes. He also installed a Keihin PE28 carb, and then fashioned a unique choke knob to add a dash of style. The SR150-specific exhaust header is from 2LOUD’s rapidly expanding catalog of custom parts, as is the classic reverse-cone muffler. Max also dipped into the 2LOUD stash for the front and rear turn signals and their brackets, the head- and taillights, and the license plate bracket. The Yamaha SR150’s new fuel tank is an aftermarket part, echoing the silhouette of the Yamaha enduro bikes of yore. A custom saddle sits just behind it, perched atop a redesigned subframe, with custom-made side covers attached lower down. Aluminum fenders adorn both ends of the bike, mounted on stainless steel brackets. Finishing things off with panache are broad handlebars from the 2LOUD catalog. They’re fitted with new grips, pared-down controls, and retro-style micro switches. Continuing the trend of keeping the mods on this SR150 uncomplicated, Max had the fuel tank painted in a simple blue and white livery. The unusual stitching pattern on the saddle testifies to Max’s attention to detail. With less than 15 hp on tap, you’re not going to get anywhere in a hurry aboard this Yamaha SR150 street tracker. But thanks to 2LOUD, you’ll arrive in style. 2LOUD Custom | Facebook | Instagram",
