  "description": "Royal Enfield has finally entered the EV game and to do so, it has created a new subsidiary - Flying Flea. The first product from RE’s new EV subsidiary is called the C6. Frame made from forged aluminium C6 will go on sale in spring 2026 S6 scrambler also under development Also See: Royal Enfield Flying Flea C6 image gallery Royal Enfield’s Flying Flea C6: details  The C6 is Flying Flea’s maiden offering and while this is an all-new electric bike, the styling definitely has a whiff of old-school about it. The C6’s silhouette is like a low-slung bobber motorcycle, with its raked-out front end and solo saddle. One very unusual element of the Flying Flea C6 is that it employs a girder-style front fork to handle suspension duties, something not seen in today’s mainstream motorcycles.   The frame of the C6 is made from forged aluminium, certainly not common in the budget-friendly EV marketplace and another premium touch is the touchscreen TFT dashboard. All-new switchgear complements the new dash. The C6 gets all-LED lighting, with the headlight not being the same as the one seen across (almost) the entire Royal Enfield lineup now.    No details about powertrain, specs or the all-important question of range have been revealed yet but what can be seen is the presence of disc brakes front and rear. The C6 is meant to be an urban runabout and so the overall dimensions appear to be quite petite and it should be a friendly, welcoming machine for riders of all shapes and sizes. The C6 also gets rather skinny tyres, which should not only make it nimble and agile inside urban confines but also help it eke out more range with lower rolling resistance.   The bike you see here is a solo seater but Flying Flea will sell you provisions to carry a pillion as an optional extra. While the C6 was the only model showcased at this event, Flying Flea also teased a future model, the S6 electric scrambler. The S6 will have longer-travel suspension, spoked wheels shod with dual-purpose rubber and a flat, bench-style seat.    As for when you can buy a Flying Flea C6, Royal Enfield tells us that will be possible come ‘spring 2026’. Whether that will be through the Royal Enfield dealer network or via a separate Flying Flea dealership is one question (among many others) which we hope to bring you answers to soon.  Also See: KTM 390 Adventure R leaked fully ahead of debut",
