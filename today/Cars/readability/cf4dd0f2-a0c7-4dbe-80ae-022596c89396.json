  "description": "Bentley Motors has introduced a second plug-in hybrid V8 option for its Flying Spur, Continental GT and GTC (convertible) models. Dubbed the High Performance Hybrid, the powertrain is a slightly lower-powered alternative to the existing 782hp,1,000Nm Ultra Performance setup.  New hybrid setup outperforms previous-gen W12 Speed powertrain Bentley India website features the cars with the new powertrain Bentley Continental GT, Flying Spur new hybrid powertrain specs 680hp, 930Nm 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 The new PHEVs are run by the familiar 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 and a gearbox-mounted electric motor pair like the Ultra Performance version, though the combined output is less at 680hp and 930Nm. The Continental GT and GTC accelerate from 0-100kph in 3.7 seconds and 3.9 seconds, respectively (the latter time also applies to the Bentley Flying Spur). Both GT models share a 25.9kWh battery, delivering an electric-only range of 85km in the GT and 82km in the GTC. Variant-wise hybrid system on offer  “Though the Ultra Performance Hybrid of the Speed remains the most extreme powertrain in Bentley’s range, it’s significant that the new hybrid outperforms the previous generation’s W12 Speed powertrain on all power, torque and performance parameters,” stated the Crewe-based automaker. Out of the Flying Spur and Continental GT’s four variants, only the base-spec core and Azure get this new setup, while the more powerful hybrid system is exclusive to top-spec Mulliner and Speed. Bentley India's website lists the Flying Spur, Continental GT and GTC luxury cars with both Ultra Performance and High Performance hybrid powertrains. The Bentayga, along with its EWB version, is also listed. Also, see: New Flying Spur is the most powerful Bentley four-door ever Bentley to replace W12 engine with 750hp hybrid V8",
