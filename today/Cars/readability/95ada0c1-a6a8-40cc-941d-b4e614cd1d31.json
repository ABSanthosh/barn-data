  "text": "The moment we saw this outrageous custom BMW R 1300 R, we thought of Philip Ludwig. A veteran of the Sultans of Sprint series and the man behind Kraftstoffschmiede, he’s made a name for himself building wild, boxer-powered BMWs—like his 2019 stunner, Achilles. Our suspicions were right. Philipp has been with BMW for years, working in both the automotive and motorcycle divisions, and is currently part of Motorrad’s R\u0026D team. This R 1300 R is his latest creation—built inside BMW’s prototype workshop, with help from a crew of in-house designers and engineers. It’s a full-blown skunkworks special, and one of the most impressive we’ve seen. Revealed just three months ago, the new BMW R 1300 R is an aggressive naked roadster with a forward-heavy silhouette. Its liquid-cooled boxer motor kicks out 145 hp and 149 Nm of torque, while its shell-type steel frame and die-cast aluminum subframe prioritize weight saving and agility over elegance. That makes it the perfect donor for a white-knuckle sprint racer. As project manager, Phillip’s job was to draw on his experience racing in Sultans of Sprint—a league where looking good is almost as important as going fast. He was joined by BMW Motorrad vehicle designer Andreas Martin, graphic and color designer Theresa Stukenbrock, and prototype builders Paul Summerer and Thomas Becker. The list of changes to the BMW R 1300 R is extensive, and yet the donor bike is still recognizable. That’s because the BMW crew aimed to amplify the stock bike ratheraa than butcher it. Emphasis was placed on centralizing the bike’s mass and showcasing its stonking 1,300 cc mill. To that end, the R 1300 R was denuded of its bodywork and subframe, and built back up with a smorgasbord of custom accoutrements. A monocoque shell is now draped over it; its intoxicating forged carbon construction juxtaposed against a kinetic livery. The bodywork includes accommodations for all the R 1300 R’s important bits. Scooped sections at the front encourage airflow (just like the OEM panels do), while cutouts at the sides make space for a pair of chunky pod filters. Underneath the body, the team shaved some height off of the stock fuel reservoir, reinstalled the fuel pump on the right-hand side, and nudged the filler cap to the left. They also relocated the BMW’s TFT dashboard to the tank area, which let them clean up the cockpit without having to tear into the bike’s modern wiring. A small seat pad sits further back, sporting Alcantara upholstery over a 3D-printed pan. The R 1300 R retains its OEM headlight, but it’s been retrofitted with yellow LEDs from the BMW M4 CSL. There’s a small forged carbon cowl just above it, tidying up the space that the original dashboard mount used to occupy. It’s flanked by fully adjustable clip-ons, fitted with Magura brake and clutch master cylinders. The riding position is as extreme as you’d expect from a sprint racing machine. BMW S 1000 RR foot controls from the company’s ‘HP’ range are mounted to the ends of custom-made extensions, placing them as far back as humanly possible. Keen eyes will notice that the R 1300 R sits a hair lower than before. It now sits on a set of lowered BMW M 1000 RR forks and a custom-built rear shock, both from Wilbers and both fully adjustable. The front wheel’s another M 1000 RR item, as are the lower fork shrouds and brake ducts. The 1300 retains its original brakes, but the top yoke’s been replaced by a custom unit. The R 1300 R’s radical new aesthetic would imply a host of engine mods, but Philipp opted to keep things mostly stock. “Too much power is also not so good at the sprint,” he explains. “What’s really important is torque, which the boxer engine delivers perfectly at the bottom end.” There are two noticeable upgrades: a one-off titanium exhaust system from long-time BMW Motorrad partner Akrapovič, and a nitrous oxide injection system. The exhaust is mechanical art, snaking its way along the bottom of the engine block before crossing over itself and exiting at the tail. It’s fitted with a pair of GP-style mufflers and carbon fiber heat shields. The nitrous system is linked directly to the bike’s ECU, adding 30 and 40 more horsepower at a twist of the wrist. (A switch on the bars lets you alternate between two engine mappings.) Even though it weighs 40 kilos [88 pounds] less than before, the sheer presence of this custom BMW R 1300 R has earned it the nickname Titan. And if you’re worried that this bonkers machine will spend more time on display than on the track, fear not: Philipp has confirmed that he plans to race it. BMW Motorrad",

It now sits on a set of lowered BMW M 1000 RR forks and a custom-built rear shock, both from Wilbers and both fully adjustable. The front wheel’s another M 1000 RR item, as are the lower fork shrouds and brake ducts. The 1300 retains its original brakes, but the top yoke’s been replaced by a custom unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe R 1300 R’s radical new aesthetic would imply a host of engine mods, but Philipp opted to keep things mostly stock. “Too much power is also not so good at the sprint,” he explains. “What’s really important is torque, which the boxer engine delivers perfectly at the bottom end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"A nitrous-injected BMW R 1300 R by BMW Motorrad\u0026#39;s R\u0026amp;D team\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/custom-bmw-r-1300-r-11.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nThere are two noticeable upgrades: a one-off titanium exhaust system from long-time BMW Motorrad partner Akrapovič, and a nitrous oxide injection system. The exhaust is mechanical art, snaking its way along the bottom of the engine block before crossing over itself and exiting at the tail. It’s fitted with a pair of GP-style mufflers and carbon fiber heat shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nitrous system is linked directly to the bike’s ECU, adding 30 and 40 more horsepower at a twist of the wrist.
