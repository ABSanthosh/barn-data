  "text": "One of the suspects allegedly used a suppressed AR-15 rifle and about eight Molotov cocktails March 20, 2025 at 20:43 by Michael Gauthier The Department of Justice is targeting those behind Molotov cocktail attacks on Tesla. Three individuals face charges and could face up to 20 years in prison for the attacks. Attorney General Pamela Bondi recently called attacks on Tesla “domestic terrorism.” Attacks on Teslas have become a common occurrence and now the federal government is getting heavily involved. As part of this effort, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi has announced charges against three people for the “violent destruction of Tesla properties” using Molotov cocktails. While the Department of Justice didn’t release many specifics, one of the defendants was involved in an attack on a Tesla dealership in Salem, Oregon. The government says this person was armed with a suppressed AR-15 rifle and was arrested after throwing approximately eight Molotov cocktails. More: Man Arrested After Alleged Molotov Cocktail Attack And Shooting At Tesla Store The second individual was arrested in Loveland, Colorado after allegedly attempting to light Teslas on fire with Molotov cocktails. The government also claimed the “defendant was later found in possession of materials used to produce additional incendiary weapons”. Lastly, a person in Charleston, South Carolina allegedly wrote “profane messages against President Trump” around Tesla charging stations. They then lit the chargers ablaze with Molotov cocktails. Salem Police Attorney General’s Statement Attorney General Bondi was direct in her response to the situation, stating: “The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended. Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.” Her office added they’re “committed to ending all acts of violence and arson directed at Tesla properties and otherwise.” The news comes two days after Bondi released another statement saying that “The swarm of violent attacks on Tesla property is nothing short of domestic terrorism. The Department of Justice has already charged several perpetrators with that in mind, including in cases that involve charges with five-year mandatory minimum sentences.” As for the three people charged in this latest round, they now face prison sentences ranging from five to 20 years, depending on the specifics of their actions.",
