  "text": "Merger talks between Honda and Nissan, which began in December 2024, may fail to materialize, according to several reports. Multiple outlets are reporting that Honda wanted to acquire Nissan as a subsidiary, a move Nissan's leadership opposes. In separate statements to Car and Driver, both automakers confirmed that integration discussions are ongoing. Merger talks between Honda and Nissan may be ending before the partnership has a chance to take hold. A new report from Reuters explains that Honda approached Nissan with a proposal to acquire the latter as a subsidiary brand—a move Nissan's leadership strongly opposes. Tomohiro Ohsumi|Getty ImagesWhile seemingly shaky, discussions between the two brands continue. In separate statements to Car and Driver, representatives for Honda and Nissan confirmed that discussions about integrating the two brands are ongoing. While initially planned for the end of January, Nissan's statement points to the middle of February as a new target for the brand finalizing its direction, which it says will be announced at that time. Discussions for the merger began last December when the two Japanese automakers signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that began discussions to establish a single holding company. The discussions come at a time when Nissan is in dire straits financially. Last year, the automaker announced it would restructure its corporate layout in a plan that included widespread job cuts and a 50 percent salary reduction for the CEO.A separate report from Bloomberg claims Nissan may hold a board meeting, potentially on Wednesday or later, to vote on the proposal. If the merger/acquisition does go through, the combined companies would become the third-largest automaker in the world behind Toyota and the Volkswagen Group. Last month during a media roundtable at CES, a Honda executive suggested the potential merger could see the brand utilizing Nissan's experience in the full-size-SUV market. Honda's current largest vehicle is the mid-size Pilot SUV, which measures nearly nine inches shorter than full-size offerings such as the Nissan Armada.Jack Fitzgerald’s love for cars stems from his as yet unshakable addiction to Formula 1. After a brief stint as a detailer for a local dealership group in college, he knew he needed a more permanent way to drive all the new cars he couldn’t afford and decided to pursue a career in auto writing. By hounding his college professors at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he was able to travel Wisconsin seeking out stories in the auto world before landing his dream job at Car and Driver. His new goal is to delay the inevitable demise of his 2010 Volkswagen Golf.",
