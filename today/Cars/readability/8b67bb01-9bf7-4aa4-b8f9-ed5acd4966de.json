  "text": "Authorities advise the public to avoid clicking texted links and instead contact local parking entities 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers Authorities say scammers are using a new tactic to trick unsuspecting victims into paying money. Criminals send text messages requesting payment for fake parking tickets that don‚Äôt actually exist. This scam isn‚Äôt unlike other ones we‚Äôve seen with physical parking tickets that are also fake. Scammers are nothing if not innovative. Just when you think you‚Äôve seen it all, they come up with new ways to part you from your cash. They‚Äôve gone from working in person to using sophisticated digital methods, and now, they‚Äôve decided to mix the old tricks with new technology. Authorities are warning drivers that scammers are sending texts about unpaid tolls or parking tickets. If you receive one of these messages, here‚Äôs how to avoid getting scammed. I At first glance, these scams don‚Äôt look too sinister. You receive a message claiming you have an unpaid bill. In some cases, it focuses on a parking ticket. In others, it references an unpaid toll or other municipal fine or fee. The scammer might even include the amount you supposedly owe, which often seems small ‚Äì just a few bucks here and there. It‚Äôs a tactic designed to make you think ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt worth fighting over‚Äù. And that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôre hoping for. More: How A Fake Hertz Customer Support Line Stole Over $600 From A Renter In one example, the Illinois State Police reported a message where the texter threatened to issue an additional charge of $75.90 if the recipient didn‚Äôt pay the $7.59 balance. It‚Äôs easy to see why someone would rush to pay such a bill if it was legitimate. That‚Äôs what scammers are hoping on when they send that sort of message. The Simple Steps to Avoid Getting Scammed Thankfully, the solution here is the same regardless of what sort of message one might get. First, don‚Äôt respond at all. Don‚Äôt send any messages back at all. Next, block the number, and finally, delete the text. r. If you want to take things a step further, you can report the message and phone number to the FTC to help prevent future scams. ‚ö†Ô∏èPHONE SCAM ALERT‚ö†Ô∏è The Illinois State Police is warning the public of a telephone scam currently circulating in Illinois.

Verify everything in the message before sending any money anywhere. And remember, many government agencies make it clear online that they do not contact people via text for payment requests. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve seen something like this. Last year, scammers were actively placing physical parking tickets on cars across the country. The tickets sometimes looked genuine and other times didn‚Äôt. Ultimately, the payment options on those tickets led to portals where victims could send money if they weren‚Äôt suspicious enough.¬† Image Credit: FTC",
