  "description": "This 2000 Ferrari 550 Maranello is a European-market example that was imported to the US and federalized in 2001, and it was acquired by the selling dealer after it was listed on BaT in September 2022 and relocated to Canada. Powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, it is finished in Rosso Corsa over black leather upholstery. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, a gated shifter, 18″ five-spoke wheels, a Tubi Style exhaust system, and Scuderia Ferrari fender shields as well as power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, automatic climate control, and a Blaupunkt Bremen stereo. A timing-belt service and fluid changes are said to have been carried out in preparation for the sale, and the odometer shows 16k miles. Previously listed by the selling dealer on BaT in April 2024, this 550 Maranello is offered again in Canada with manufacturer’s literature and accessories, service records, car and interior covers, spare parts, a clean US Carfax report, and British Columbia registration.",

Powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, it is finished in Rosso Corsa over black leather upholstery. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, a gated shifter, 18″ five-spoke wheels, a Tubi Style exhaust system, and Scuderia Ferrari fender shields as well as power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, automatic climate control, and a Blaupunkt Bremen stereo. A timing-belt service and fluid changes are said to have been carried out in preparation for the sale, and the odometer shows 16k miles. Previously listed by the selling dealer on BaT in April 2024, this 550 Maranello is offered again in Canada with manufacturer’s literature and accessories, service records, car and interior covers, spare parts, a clean US Carfax report, and British Columbia registration. The 550 Maranello was styled by Pininfarina, and this example is finished in Rosso Corsa. Exterior details include projector-style headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, and a front spoiler in addition to front-fender vents, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover. Clear paint-protection film was applied to the hood, front bumper cover, and mirror housings under prior ownership. The outdoor photos provided in the gallery were taken prior to April 2024. Silver-finished 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 255/40 front and 295/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport tires that have 2016 and 2018 production-date codes. Braking is handled by a red-finished Ferrari-branded caliper and a cross-drilled and ventilated rotor at each corner. Power-adjustable Daytona-style seats are upholstered in black leather with red stitching, and the dashboard, center console, and door panels are trimmed to match. Additional appointments include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, power windows, rear luggage straps, a hi-fi sound system, and a Blaupunkt Bremen digital-media receiver. Sticky control buttons were repaired under prior ownership. The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a Jaeger gauge cluster with a replacement 220-mph speedometer as well as a tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline and gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure, while an analog clock and gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are located atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 16k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The 5.5-liter quad-cam F133A V12 features 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory-rated output of 478 horsepower and 419 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer reports changing the fluids and carrying out a timing-belt service in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Tubi Style exhaust system has been added, and the clutch was replaced in 2016. A binder of records, a leather-cased tool and spares kit, a tire-inflation kit, a battery charger, and the removed radio will accompany the car along with car, seat, and steering-wheel covers. The US Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries. This vehicle is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in that Canadian province.
