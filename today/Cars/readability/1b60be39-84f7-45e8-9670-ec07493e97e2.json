Powered by a Nür-specification 2.6L twin-turbocharged RB26DETT inline-six, it has a six-speed manual transmission, an ATTESA all-wheel-drive system, Super HICAS rear-wheel steering, coilover damping, a limited-slip rear differential, NISMO LMGT4 19″ forged wheels, Brembo brakes, heated front seats, and a factory CD player, DVD-based navigation system, and multifunction LCD screen. The car was auctioned in Japan in 2008 and 2019, and it was imported to the US by its current owner in the fall of 2023. This R34 GT-R M-Spec Nür is offered on dealer consignment in California with a CarVX report, a Show or Display letter, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC. Exterior details include xenon headlights, side marker lamps, an aluminum hood, a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, an adjustable rear wing, a rear fog light, and a rear wiper. NISMO side skirts are also noted by the selling dealer, who reports paint correction work and exterior ceramic coating were completed under current ownership. An electronically actuated Super HICAS rear-wheel-steering system was standard equipment, and M-Spec cars were also fitted at the factory with larger rear brakes compared to the standard R34. The selling dealer adds that HKS coilover dampers are fitted. NISMO LMGT4 forged 19″ wheels have been installed, and the car has gold-finished Brembo calipers. The heated M-Spec sport seats have harness pass-throughs and are trimmed in black leather with perforated inserts and contrast stitching. Other details in the right-hand-drive cabin include a DVD-based navigation system, a CD player, automatic climate control, aluminum pedals, GT-R branded floor mats, and power windows, mirrors, and locks. A leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts the instrument cluster, and a multifunction LCD screen in the center of the dashboard provides information including boost pressure, throttle input, injector workload, and temperature readings. The digital odometer shows 45k kilometers (~28k miles). The twin-turbocharged 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six came from the factory with a reinforced N1 engine block. It is linked with a six-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA four-wheel-drive system with an electronically controlled active limited-slip rear differential. Additional photos of the undercarriage are provided in the gallery. The firewall-mounted chassis tag decodes as follows: G – Two-door coupe GJ – RB26DETT engine P – 4WD Super HICAS R – Right-hand-drive cabin W – V-Spec / V-Spec N1 / V-Spec II / V-Spec II N1 / M-Spec / V-Spec II Nür / M-Spec Nür Y – Six-speed manual transmission R34 – Model designation Z – Twin-turbo configuration Z – Cold Weather package A – Four-person seating capacity A – Super-fine hardcoat paint G – Rear wiper, privacy glass M – Large rear brakes, multi-display meter, advanced aero system, Ripple Control shocks, M-Spec Nür A – TV receiver, single-DIN Stereo, 120-watt amplifier with six speakers, navigation D – Rear fog lamp A redacted copy of a NHTSA Show or Display exemption letter for the vehicle is shown further at the end of the gallery below.
