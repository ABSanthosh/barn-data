  "text": "This 1969 Chevrolet Corvette convertible is powered by a 427ci V8 topped with three Holley two-barrel carburetors and is refinished in green over a reupholstered Saddle interior. Equipment includes a replacement Muncie four-speed manual transmission, a Positraction limited-slip differential, a beige convertible soft top, 15″ Rally wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, power windows, a retro-style stereo, chrome bumpers, and hideaway headlights. This C3 convertible is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with a clean South Carolina title. The car was factory-finished in Fathom Green and has been refinished. Features include a beige convertible soft top, hideaway headlights, dual side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. The 15″ Rally wheels wear chrome trim rings and center caps and are mounted with 215/70 BFGoodrich Silvertown radial tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs. The cabin was refurbished and features two bucket seats reupholstered in Saddle vinyl as well as color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Amenities include headrests, a heater, a retro-style stereo with auxiliary input, an analog clock, power windows, and lap belts. A pair of subwoofers are mounted in the rear cargo area. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,600-rpm redline, while auxiliary gauges for fuel level, battery charge, oil pressure, and coolant temperature are mounted in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 74k miles, approximately 14k of which were added under current ownership. The 427ci V8 is equipped with three Holley two-barrel carburetors, polished valve covers, and exhaust headers. The alternator and starter were replaced. The engine stamping is shown above. The LM suffix corresponds with a 390-horsepower, 427ci V8 for use with a manual transmission. Additional parts stamping and casting numbers are shown in the gallery below. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a replacement Muncie four-speed manual transmission and a Positraction limited-slip differential. Decoding the trim tag reveals: B06 – September 6, 1968 build date Trim 420 – Saddle vinyl upholstery Paint 983 – Fathom Green Filed under: c3 You are not connected to real-time updates.
