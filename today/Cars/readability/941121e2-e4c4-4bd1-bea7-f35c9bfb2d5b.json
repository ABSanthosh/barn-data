  "text": "Published:  October 18th, 2024 In our last Eldorado episode, we reviewed the interior changes made to Cadillac’s flagship convertible as it was refreshed for 1963. In its move upmarket, the Eldorado joined the Fleetwood assembly line with the Sixty Special and Seventy-Five. It received wood trim for the first time in 1963, alongside a modernized and more cockpit-style dashboard. Outside, it adopted the subtle de-chromed look present on other contemporary Fleetwood models. In 1964 for the sixth generation’s second and final year, Eldorado was refreshed yet again. (Note: The red convertible is a 1963 Eldorado, and the light blue is a ‘64.)The 1964 model’s visual update was subtle, but enough for the educated viewer to notice. The grille’s texture was simplified and featured a flatter design as the stepped look of 1963 vanished. The grille was also leaned rearward, less upright than the prior year. Within the grille, the dividing central bar was painted body color in 1964, a most unusual touch for Cadillac.  Other changes at the front end included a new grille-like detailing that wrapped around the front corners and ended at the wheel arch. Contained within it were the indicator lamps, now hidden behind grille detail and not as visible as they were previously. On the hood, Cadillac’s modern crest and wreath appeared, at that point still reserved for Fleetwood models. Lesser Cadillac offerings wore the crest and V-shaped decor. Additional trim detailing appeared along the lower flanks of the Eldorado, as the simple chrome rocker panel of 1963 was replaced by a version with ribbed detailing in 1964. Cadillac vacillated to and fro with ribbed detailing in the period, an affordable way to distinguish the new models. In a nod to the marketing Cadillac attempted with the Eldorado in 1964, there were other differences along the side flanks for Eldorado not shared with the Series 62.  The 62 went with an untrimmed rocker area that carried nary a chrome decoration. And it persisted with more conservative and traditional fender skirts, while the Eldorado was newly a “sports” convertible. That meant the rear wheels were suddenly exposed to the world. New chrome fender trim arrived to highlight the exposed rear wheel, and mirrored trim at the front wheel.  The shiny aluminum-look rear trim panel of 1963 was replaced by a pattern that matched the front grille in 1964. It was less overworked looking, and was shorter vertically than the prior year. The panel on the Sixty Two convertible was a simple horizontally ribbed piece of trim, and lacked any grille detailing. The trim panel change was visually notable as it required a redesign of the trunk lid: The lid now wrapped around the top portion of the license plate. Elsewhere at the rear, the trunk lid sported the Cadillac crest and wreath like the front end, with a new concealed lock cylinder behind the crest. This lock cylinder lasted a long time at Cadillac, at least 35 years. The long-running fins were updated as well; the 17th consecutive year fins appeared on the Cadillac line. This year they were slimmed and shrunk to an even lower profile, and were more pointed than in 1963. Below the fins, rear light clusters were notably revised. More pointed than before and in a thinner chrome housing, the lamps were a very early take on the Toyota Altezza design that would infect many cars some 30-plus years later. Clear lenses for indicators replaced the red lenses of the prior year. The two large clear lenses were complemented with thin dual strips of red reflector in the middle, and red running and brake lamps in the fin. There were some small interior updates made for the Eldorado of 1964, a change in methodology compared to other final years of past generations. On the steering wheel, customers of 1964 saw a center cap that was newly clear, with a more sophisticated looking floating wreath and crest. The steering wheel returned to a two-tone color scheme, with contrast colors on the middle and upper/lower sections of the wheel. Door panels were revised too, and featured less chrome detailing than in 1963. The stylized interior door pull of 1963 proved a one-off, as in 1964 it was replaced with a padded pull handle that was wrapped to match the interior. Above the pull handle was a new Cadillac crest and wreath.Additional interior changes included a revised wrap-around dash. This feature was realized via a new, curved piece of trim that served as a bridge between the door panel and the main dash area (see under the vent window). It served to further the cockpit design goals of the interior. Under the arm rest, the chrome strip that previously extended from the door buttons and through to the rear seats was removed and replaced with a piece of trim that matched the interior.  Seats were also updated in 1964, as Cadillac took further steps toward modernity. The simple two-cushion shape of 1963 was replaced by contoured padded seats in 1964. Ribbing in the vinyl was made even wider than previously, and there were new piped sections at each corner. Seats had more curvature to them, and the beginnings of what could be considered side bolstering. In the particular 1964 Eldorado pictured, an option was fitted that was on its way to a mandate the following year: seat belts. By 1965 all states had a seat belt law in place, following the lead of California that made seat belts mandatory on all new cars in 1955. The state laws were supplanted on January 1, 1968 by Title 49, Chapter 301 of the Motor and Safety Standard which required all manufacturers to install seat belts in cars. We’ll wrap up the sixth generation Eldorado in our next installment, and cover mechanical changes of 1964 as well as its pricing and sales figures.[Images: seller, seller]﻿Become a TTAC insider.
