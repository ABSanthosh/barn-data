  "text": "It’s been a big week with the conclusion of the BaT Awards, a big international announcement, and the launch of two different collections from great BaT sellers. But we still want to close out by noticing a few of the most unique, important, and strange vehicles on our site this week. This is by no means a comprehensive list. There’s certainly much more to be seen on the live auctions page, but here are this week’s Weird and Wonderful! 1. Flintmobile-Style Golf Cart There are certain vehicles that can convey a whole lifestyle with a single picture. That is definitely the case with the Flintmobile. The listing copy describes it best: “Debuting in 1960 on ABC, The Flintstones followed the titular family and their neighbors in a fictional Stone Age setting. The citizens of Bedrock drove prehistoric vehicles assembled with wooden structures and stones that were propelled forward via their passengers. This golf cart was modified under previous ownership using composite materials, and it features bodywork replicating that of the Canopysaurus Flintmobile, which was driven by the family’s patriarch, Fred. Details include imitation wood, simulated stone wheels at the front and rear, brake lights, and a faux “YABADO” license plate styled after Fred Flinstone’s catchphrase.” 2. 1993 Jaguar XJ220-N When we think of Jaguar XJ220s racing, our minds go straight to the ignominious “Fast Masters” series (otherwise known as the world’s most expensive demolition derby). This car bears a more prestigious pedigree as one of three aluminum-bodied XJ220-N cars prepared for the Campionato Italiano Supercar GT, though it served as a backup car and wears its factory silver paint beneath the Team Total Race livery wrap. The “N”models were prepared by longtime Jaguar racing partner Tom Walkinshaw Racing; the owner of this example, who recommissioned it in 2019, states that the motor has been tuned for approximately 700 horsepower—up 100 horses from TWR spec. The car has been issued a 17-digit VIN. We desperately need to see video (paging @Wob), and while you’re at it, we’d love to see footage of someone trying to get in and out of the car gracefully. 3. ca.1998 Peugeot 605 4×4 Rally Raid Car Peugeot never fielded a 605 for the Dakar rally, so this car was never raced in period. Rather, it is the result of an aborted collaboration between between IPSO and French grocery store chain E.Leclerc. It’s still the real deal—built with composite bodywork over a tube-frame chassis with a race-prepped 3,997cc PRV V6 hanging out with the two spares under the clamshell. Both pilot and copilot have buttons for ventilation, so dual-zone climate control is technically an included amenity. 4. 1967 Lincoln Continental Convertible VIP \u0026 Government Parade Car Finally—finally—your reenactment club can pull off a historically-accurate Nixon inaugural parade. This specially-commissioned Lincoln Continental convertible was designated as a “marketing vehicle” by FoMoCo, and was driven in presidential motorcades and parades featuring elected and military officials, astronauts, foreign dignitaries, and celebrities between 1968-1975, including both Nixon inaugurations. The listing shows period photos of the car in service, with and without its distinctive plexiglass hardtop. Other features include flashing red lights on the front bumper, a siren, flag holders, and A-pillar spotlights. 5. 1969 Ferrari Dino 206 GT Enzo may have labeled the Jaguar E-Type the most beautiful car ever made, but he said that years before Pininfarina (specifically Fioravanti and Aldo Brovarone) penned his Dino 206 GT. The early-production 2.0-liter cars wore Scaglietti-built aluminum bodywork and rode on a shorter wheelbase than the later 246. This example is said to be one of three originally finished in Azzurro Metallizzato, and lived in Italy until 2023. The extensive paper trail includes order documents, correspondence between Ferrari and the original owner, its original Italian registration booklet, reports from Matthias Bartz and Marcel Massini, and refurbishment photos. 6. 1926 Stutz AA Boattail Race Car This history of this Stutz AA sounds like a documentary waiting to be made. Originally built as a five-passenger sedan, it very quickly shook off street car duties when a Canadian engineer and driver fabricated roadster bodywork, dropped in a 7-liter Duesenberg engine, and took it racing as the “Stutzenberg.” The car languished during the Second World War, picked up a replacement Stutz straight-eight, and was recovered out of Canada in 1980. The subsequent owner commissioned the boattail roadster body and drove it in VSCC races for many years before selling it to a German collector. The flyby videos of this old war horse are not to be missed. 7. 1969 Iso Grifo 7 Litre Series I Number 7 is this rare 7-liter Iso Grifo—one of a claimed 90 built with a 427/435 Chevy V8. Its Giugiaro-designed fastback bodywork is achingly gorgeous and has introduced to us the concept of the “pagoda scoop,” which is a feature we need to see more often. No notes, Giorgetto. No notes. This car is the first fruit of 1600veloce’s European expansion, and makes us very eager to see what else they’re going to bring to the site. 8. 1999 Mercedes-Benz A190 Avantgarde The A190 A-Class was a huge departure for Mercedes-Benz—a triumph of efficient packaging and ergonomics. The model was famously bested by an imaginary Swedish moose, which caused CEO Jürgen Schrempp to mandate that the company’s electronic stability program (ESP) be retroactively fitted to the whole production run. The Avantgarde trim level seen here also featured a sport suspension and interior accents that were…slightly less conservative than the standard pieces, which surely scandalized the European buyers. We’re just happy to see this car here so soon after its 25th birthday, and we’re hoping it can single-handedly revive the lost art of parallel parking. 9. 1999 Suzuki Alto Works ie 5-Speed We’ll keep going with the theme of 25-year-old tiny hatches. The Suzuki Also Works ie was a performance variant that featured a turbocharged 657cc triple with an intercooler under that big hood scoop. We don’t see many Altos in the US, and even fewer of the hotter Works cars. In fact, the last time one was auctioned here was 2022. 10. Ex–Arturo Merzario Symbol Sport LM-S Race Car This is one of 20 LM-S race cars built by former Formula One driver Arturo Merzario’s Symbol Sport company for competition in the 1990 season of the Italian Prototype Championship, which is incidentally the second Italian racing series that we have learned about while writing this post. In spirit, the Symbol Sport seems quite similar to 1960s Targa Florio cars with its open cockpit and simple construction. Like many retired European race cars, it went on to compete in various hill climbs across Italy. It’s a treat to hear the song of its race-tuned Busso V6 echoing off the mountains. Honorable Mentions: Honorable Mention: Aero Precision Metal Works Chameleon We are blown away by the craftsmanship on this one-of-a-kind bike by Corey Mauck of Aero Precision Metal Works. Do yourself a favor and go stare at the gallery for a very long time. There’s a lot to appreciate. Honorable Mention: Hellcat-Powered 1991 Jeep Grand Wagoneer “Hell Wagon” “Restraint” is not a word that typically applies to Hellcat-swapped vehicles, and yet here we are. Until (we imagine) it pops a wheelie leaving the country club parking lot, the only external clue that this Grand Wagoneer is anything but stock is the subtle “Hell Wagon” fender badges. Honorable Mention: 1939 MG TB Tickford Drophead Coupe Coachbuilt bodies weren’t uncommon in the prewar era, but they were rarely fitted to T-series MGs. This car is one of a claimed 57 with Tickford “three position” bodywork, meaning that the top could be positioned open, “Surrey style” as shown above, or fully enclosed. The Tickford bodywork elevates the significance of this MG, enough to earn it awards at Pebble Beach in the 1990s. Like we said, this list is by no means comprehensive; there are many more weird and wonderful vehicles on our pages at any moment. These are just some that we found noteworthy, but we’d love to hear what caught your eye! Let us know in the comments.",

Originally built as a five-passenger sedan, it very quickly shook off street car duties when a Canadian engineer and driver fabricated roadster bodywork, dropped in a 7-liter Duesenberg engine, and took it racing as the “Stutzenberg.” The car languished during the Second World War, picked up a replacement Stutz straight-eight, and was recovered out of Canada in 1980. The subsequent owner commissioned the boattail roadster body and drove it in VSCC races for many years before selling it to a German collector. The flyby videos of this old war horse are not to be missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1969-iso-grifo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e7. 1969 Iso Grifo 7 Litre Series I\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413\" alt=\"This Week\u0026#39;s Weird and Wonderful: January 18, 2024\" width=\"620\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=2048 2048w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=300 300w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=620 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=1240 1240w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG-1938-93159-scaled-1-59431.webp?resize=620%2C413?w=1860 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber 7 is this rare 7-liter Iso Grifo—one of a claimed 90 built with a 427/435 Chevy V8.

We’re just happy to see this car here so soon after its 25th birthday, and we’re hoping it can single-handedly revive the lost art of parallel parking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1999-suzuki-alto-works/?utm_source=dm\u0026amp;utm_medium=email\u0026amp;utm_campaign=2025-01-16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. 1999 Suzuki Alto Works ie 5-Speed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C425\" alt=\"This Week\u0026#39;s Weird and Wonderful: January 18, 2024\" width=\"620\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=1761 1761w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=300 300w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=620\u0026amp;resize=620%2C425 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=155 155w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5911-44135-scaled-1-60721-e1737160756389.webp?w=1240 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465\" alt=\"This Week\u0026#39;s Weird and Wonderful: January 18, 2024\" width=\"620\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=2048 2048w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=300 300w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=768 768w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=620 620w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=1536 1536w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=460 460w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=144 144w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=940 940w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=1240 1240w, https://bringatrailer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5776-43798-scaled-1-60819.webp?resize=620%2C465?w=1860 1860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll keep going with the theme of 25-year-old tiny hatches.

of the Italian Prototype Championship, which is incidentally the second Italian racing series that we have learned about while writing this post. In spirit, the Symbol Sport seems quite similar to 1960s Targa Florio cars with its open cockpit and simple construction. Like many retired European race cars, it went on to compete in various hill climbs across Italy.
