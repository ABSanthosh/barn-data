  "text": "Modified JDM Mazda ɛ̃fini RX-7 for sale in the US has a radical body kit and a single-turbo conversion for its rotary engine May 25, 2025 at 21:08 by Chris Chilton A JDM Mazda RX-7 with a distinctive tuned look is being auctioned on Cars \u0026 Bids. The ɛ̃fini-branded rotary coupe has a custom bodykit, rear spoiler and coilovers. Bride seats offer extra support but are so fat they stop the doors fully closing. Modifying cars is all about self expression, in the same way that changing your body with piercings and tatoos is. It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks – until you need to sell that car, of course, when you find some of those changes you made are a a big turn-off to many potential buyers. Also: This Mazda RX-7 Is So Quiet It’s Causing An Uproar This third-generation 1993 Maza RX-7 seen here is a case in point. A JDM-spec car originally sold by Mazda’s upscale ɛ̃fini sub-brand and now living in the US, it’s been heavily modified during the past 25 years and the results are polarizing to say the least. A Love-Hate Transformation The listing on the Cars \u0026 Bids auction site is a battlefield of opinions. Comments are split with as many people hating the Fast \u0026 Furious-style makeover as digging it. “This looks like my grandmother’s Dust Buster,” says one commenter. Another reckons it’s the “Jar Binks edition,” referencing the bug-eyed (and widely disliked) creature from the Star Wars prequel trilogy. But others seem to really appreciate the Japanese tuning vibe. “This is so cool, it just screams early 2000s JDM!” says one. “Love it! Fast \u0026 Furious dreams do come true!” chimes in another. Photos Cars \u0026 Bids Aside from the controversial new nose, this RX-7 has also gained flared fenders, a giant rear spoiler, coilover suspension, Zauber wheels, LED taillights, and Ganador mirrors. There’s also a single turbo conversion for the rotary engine which would have been rated at 255 hp (258 PS) when new in sequential turbo form, but now makes an estimated 400 hp (406 PS) according to the seller. The combination of gaudy red plastics and a gazillion gauges means the interior does a good impression of a quintuple homocide bloodbath in a 1950s nuclear power station control room, and though the Bride seats look like they offer plenty of support, there’s one major problem with them: they’re so fat, the doors now don’t close flush. But hey, with the bodykit being such an eyeful there’s a good chance no one will even notice, right? So, what’s your take? Are you on board with this RX-7’s bold, aftermarket journey, or would you rather have something a little more stock? Check out the listing over here and drop a comment below to share your thoughts.
