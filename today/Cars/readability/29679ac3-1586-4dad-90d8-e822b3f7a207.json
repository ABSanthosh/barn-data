  "description": "Rather than cranking the dial up to 11 as the CSL did, this car aims for a perfect 10 BMW’s recent appetite for extra-special versions of its mainline M cars shows no sign of letting up, and the latest derivative to arrive in the UK is this: the wild-looking M4 CS.This is a model its maker says exists in the “broad space between racetrack experience and soul-stirring road performance”, and there’s certainly evidence to back up that sentiment. The car’s engine, cabin and use of composite materials closely resembles that of the hardcore, Porsche 911 GT3-baiting, rear-drive M4 CSL of 2022, yet here the highly adaptable four-wheel drive system of the regular M4 Competition is retained, as are the back seats that were sacrificed to save 21kg in the track-ready CSL.Garching’s form when it comes to cars like this can be variable, but when it nails the recipe, the results are generally world class, and very special indeed. The previous M4 CS was a success but a qualified one, its honed dynamics not entirely justifying an at times frustratingly spartan cabin. But since then we have also had the M5 CS – a five-star Autocar road test car and, depending on who you ask, perhaps the greatest super-saloon of all time.BMW has never offered cars such as the M4 CS cheaply, and a price the far side of £120,000 will certainly give even M diehards pause for thought, not least because it puts the car into the same airspace as the recent, and very fine, Porsche 911 Carrera GTS. But if this latest CS is as good as we know it could be, it might justify the outlay. Massive performance, handling exploitability and genuine usability in a single package is on the cards.",

  "text": "Drive flows through an eight-speed automatic gearbox from ZF, which then feeds an electronically controlled limited-slip differential between the rear wheels. The front-rear torque split is constantly changing, though in the default ‘4WD’ it still overtly favours the back axle, and does so to an even greater extent in ‘4WD Sport’. At the back of the car you’ll find an aggressive carbonfibre diffuser to match the splitter at the front. More meaningfully, the CS gets a titanium exhaust system some 4kg lighter than the regular car’s stainless-steel plumbing. Move round to the flanks and you can’t help clocking the pronounced negative camber, especially on the front axle. It’s quite the statement of intent, and is the only visible trace of a suite of model-specific tweaks applied to the CS’s damping rates, springs (3% stiffer than those of the Comp at the front, 5% at the rear) and anti-roll bars, whose droplinks are now rose-jointed. The aim is to make the CS feel more connected on the road and quicker on the track. The same applies to CS-specific steering mapping and the tune for the Dynamic Stability Control and much-loved M Dynamic Mode, all of it to minimise lap times and put a smile on your face while doing so, for novice or expert. At least, that is the intention here. The other notable element of the CS package is a touch of weight-saving. As standard, the bonnet, roof and plenty of aero addenda are wrought in CFRP, and this car is also fitted with M carbon-ceramic brakes, at a cost of £8800. All in, this car weighed 1747kg, versus 1800kg for the pre-facelift M4 Competition we tested in 2021, which had cast-iron brakes. It’s a notable saving, though doesn’t threaten the 1607kg of 911 Carrera GTS we tested recently – undoubtedly the M4 CS’s closest rival in terms of price, power and philosophy. Even so, 309bhp per tonne is hardly to be sniffed at.Both cars share the same 542bhp 3.0-litre straight six, plus the punchy stripes adorning a full-carbon bonnet, as well as having standard-fit carbon-ceramic brakes.  The CSL also donates its titanium exhaust silencer, which hangs provocatively from the CS’s reprofiled, carbon apron. Under the skin, the CS has a bespoke tune for the damping, springs, DSC, steering and brakes.",
