  "description": "The Mahindra XUV 3XO is available with three engine options – an entry-level 1.2-litre multi-point fuel injection (MPFi) turbo-petrol, a more modern direct injection (TGDi) turbo-petrol, and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel, which are all available with manual and automatic gearbox options. In this review, we focus on the AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual gearbox – priced at Rs 11 lakh (ex-showroom) – to find out why it is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. AX5 is one of the most demanded variants in the XUV 3XO line-up. Differentiating the AX5 from the top-spec variant is the absence of fog lamps; these are replaced by a prominent black casing. This variant retains the LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) and headlamps, as well as the chrome inserts on the grille panel. It gets smaller, 16-inch wheels (not 17s from the top-spec) that are carried over from the outgoing XUV300. It also gets roof rails, a rear spoiler, connected tail-lamps, and a rear wiper and washer. What’s missing is a variant badge on the boot.  Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 interiors The interior retains the dual-tone colour scheme with the top half of the dashboard and door pads being black, and the lower half finished in white. While the dual colours elevate the cabin’s appeal and sense of space, its white areas get soiled very easily and warrant utmost care to keep clean. It doesn’t get soft-touch materials on the dashboard like the higher variants, but it still sports generous piano black garnishing, some silver highlights, and an upmarket, perforated leather-wrapped steering. Dual tone interiors look premium but the bottom half will get soiled very easily. It gets black fabric seats, which are more suited to our conditions. Not only are these easier to maintain compared to the white leatherette seats available in the top-spec but these are also a lot more breathable, so you won’t be left with a sweaty back on a hot day. The seats, however, are small, and occupants with large body frames will find these too snug for comfort. Also, the driver footwell is cramped, just like the other variants. The rear seat is a spacious and comfortable place, even for three adults. A space saver spare tyre beneath its floor has enabled Mahindra to liberate a bit more luggage space (compared to the XUV300), but the 3XO’s 295-litre boot is still small by segment standards, and its loading lip is high. Also read: Mahindra XUV 3XO gets five star BNCAP crash test rating Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 equipment This variant gets a small, single-pane sunroof. As far as equipment goes, the AX5 variant gets twin 10.2-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and one for the touchscreen – with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It also gets a sunroof (single pane), a wireless charger, dual-zone climate control, auto LED headlamps, power-folding mirrors, rear air-con vents, a reversing camera, hill-start assist, 6 airbags and ESP, to name a few. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 performance Carried over from the outgoing XUV300 is the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine that now makes 111hp and 200Nm. The good news is that despite being a three-cylinder unit, it is very smooth and refined. Compared to the TGDi direct-injection turbo-petrol unit (available in higher variants), this unit makes 20hp and 30Nm less, but we’re happy to report that in the real-world, this deficit hardly comes to light. .  It is quicker than its predecessor in both outright and rolling acceleration. It isn’t devoid of turbo lag, but once it is on boost – beyond 2,000rpm – it accelerates with a sense of urgency. Performance feels strongest and most effortless, in the 2,000-4,500rpm band. At 1,362kg, the XUV 3XO is heavy, but it still accelerates to 100kph from a standstill in a respectable 11.58 seconds. Interestingly, the 3XO’s outright as well as rolling acceleration times from 20-80kph in third gear and 40-100kph in fourth gear are much quicker than its predecessor.

To keep a check on fuel consumption while idling, it gets an automatic engine stop-start function, too.   The XUV 3XO’s clutch is light but has a long travel. Also, while its 6-speed gearbox is smooth, its throws are too long and it doesn’t feel as slick as some of its Japanese or Korean rivals. Its steering feels effortless, and even though it gets adjustable steering modes that alter its weight and resistance, it doesn’t make it sportier or sharper.   Ride quality feels even better than the top-spec due to the AX5's higher profile tyres. Its ride and handling balance is spot on, but what further enhance the ride comfort are its high profile tyres (with 16-inch alloys). These absorb road shocks better than its higher variants that come equipped with 17-inch alloys. Mahindra XUV 3XO AX5 price and verdict Performance is so good, it makes you question the need to spend more for the TGDi version. The entry-level MPFI turbo-petrol’s performance and refinement are so good, it makes you question the need to spend more for the more powerful and advanced TGDi turbo-petrol engine. Sure, the latter is available in higher variants only and packs some premium features but despite being limited up to the mid AX5 variant, the MPFi engine gets more than just the mere basics. And for Rs 11 lakh, this AX5 variant with the MPFi turbo-petrol and manual transmission spells excellent value for money, which explains why it is in such high demand.
