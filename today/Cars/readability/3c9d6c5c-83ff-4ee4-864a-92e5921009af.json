  "description": "Mahindra is usually known to keep away from public motor shows, but this time, the homegrown manufacturer will be looking to make a lasting impression with its new range of EVs at the upcoming Auto Expo 2025. The new BE 6 and XEV 9e will be headlining Mahindra pavilion at the Auto Expo, and the carmaker will also have a couple of concepts on display. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. Mahindra BE 6 and XEV 9e The recently launched BE 6 and the XEV 9e will be of high interest. Both SUVs are based on Mahindra’s cutting-edge born-electric INGLO platform, but they take different approaches to design. The 4.3-metre BE 6 is sportier and more radical, while the larger 4.8-metre XEV 9e adopts a more practical style despite its coupé-SUV form factor. The duo share their powertrain and battery. The base model is offered with a 59kWh battery with a single rear motor setup producing 231hp and 380Nm. The BE 6 has a claimed range of 556km, while the XEV 9e returns 542km (MIDC range). Meanwhile, the top-spec Pack Three variant with the 79kWh battery produces 286hp and 380Nm of torque. Claimed range stands at 682km and 656km for the BE 6 and XEV 9e, respectively. Prices for BE 6 range between Rs 18.90 lakh and Rs 26.90 lakh, while the XEV 9e is priced between Rs 21.90 lakh and Rs 30.50 lakh (ex-showroom).     Mahindra Rall-E concept Also on display at Mahindra’s pavilion will be the Rall-E concept, which was first showcased in February 2023 at Mahindra’s EV Fashion Festival in Hyderabad. The rugged-looking Rall-E is essentially an off-road-focused iteration of the BE 6. It gets major design updates to suit its image as an off-road-ready alternative. The BE 6’s C-shaped daytime running lamps make way for just one sleek strip, and it gets round headlights that are nestled in the heavily cladded front bumper.  The cladding carriesover to the profile, with Mahindra giving it more rugged tyres. At the rear, the BE 6e’s C-shaped tail-lights make way for a single strip, and it gets a more aggressive-looking rear bumper. What completes its off-road look are a bunch of accessories like the roof-mounted carrier, a spare wheel on top of it and a couple of jerry cans. Mahindra XEV 7e Mahindra is also expected to showcase the conventional SUV body style version of the XEV 9e, which will likely be called the XEV 7e. It is essentially an EV equivalent of the ICE-powered XUV700, which means it ditches the raked roofline of the XEV 9e for a three-row seating layout on the inside. It’ll likely share all of the 9e’s features, safety kit, tech, battery and powertrain options. Mahindra is expected to launch the XEV 7e in the second half of this year.
