  "text": "The Ioniq 2 has been spied and it could be previewed by a concept later this year 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Spy photographers have snapped the first photos of an affordable Hyundai EV. Expected to be called the Ioniq 2, the model looks like a hatchback version of the Kia EV2. The car could have around 201 hp and slot above the Inster. Kia has introduced a slew of affordable electric vehicles including the EV3 and EV4. The company has also shown an EV2 concept, which is headed for production. Hyundai, on the other hand, has been focused on larger and more expensive vehicles such as the Ioniq 6 N and the Ioniq 9. However, an affordable model is on the way as spy photographers have caught what is believed to be the Ioniq 2. More: Kia EV2 Spied As An Affordable Electric Box The prototype is heavily disguised, but appears to be roughly the same size as the EV2. Despite the similarities, the Kia is positioned as a crossover while the Ioniq 2 is a more traditional hatchback. It sports an upright front fascia with a wide lower intake. They’re joined by an angular sensor and what appears to be slender lighting units. The profile screams hatchback and the car features a gently sloping roof. We can also see a compact greenhouse as there’s a curvaceous sweeping beltline, which is contrasted by angular upper window frames. Hyundai also gave the prototype a set of modestly sized wheels, which are wrapped in Hankook iON GT rubber. These are summer tires designed specifically for compact electric vehicles. shproshots The rear end isn’t as tall as the camouflage suggests, but it appears the Ioniq 2 will have an upright rump with a relatively plain bumper. We can also get a glimpse of LED taillights and an angular rear window. Little is known about the car at this point, but it will presumably have a lot in common with the EV2 as well as the EV3. This means it should ride on the Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) and have a 58.3 kWh battery pack. They could be joined by a front-mounted motor producing 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS). shproshots",
