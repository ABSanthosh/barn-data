Other equipment comprises a rear spoiler, a rearview camera, Nissan sport brakes, and a Bose sound system. This 370Z is now offered in Arizona with the removed factory exhaust manifolds and catalytic converters, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s trust. The car is finished in Chicane Yellow (EAC) and features bi-xenon headlights, a front chin spoiler, a rear spoiler, an F1-style brake light, and dual exhaust outlets with polished finishers. The glass and lenses have been covered with tinted film and the badges are covered with dark vinyl. Clear paint protection film is installed and a ceramic coating has been applied. Aftermarket 19″ Vivid Racing (VR) Forged wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Aftermarket coilover suspension is installed, and Electronic Brake force Distribution (EBD), a Traction Control System (TCS), and Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) were fitted from the factory. The Nissan sport brakes have vented discs and four- and two-piston front and rear calipers, respectively. Manually adjustable seats are upholstered in black cloth with patterned centers. Other appointments include a rearview camera, a Bose sound system, cruise control, automatic climate control, and illuminated Z-branded kick plates. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer, a digital display, and readouts for fuel level and coolant temperature. An AEM boost gauge is installed in the center stack cubby. A digital clock and gauges for oil temperature and voltage are mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 36k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.7-liter VQ37VHR DOHC V6 is fitted with a Stillen V3 supercharger, an Aeromotive 340 fuel pump, Injector Dynamics 1,050cc ID1050x injectors, and a Sprint Booster throttle control module. The seller states that the car was tuned by UMS Tuning in Mesa, Arizona. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a SynchroRev Match six-speed manual transmission and a viscous limited-slip differential. The exhaust system is modified with a Stillen cat-back system, DC Sports headers, and Berk Technology test pipes. The removed factory exhaust manifolds and catalytic converters are included in the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
