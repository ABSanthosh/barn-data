Having 7k miles, it is powered by a 1.8-liter inline-four paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Magnetic Blue Metallic over Biscuit leather upholstery. The car has the Touring Package, 16″ and 17″ eight-spoke alloy wheels, a removable soft top, a Blaupunkt stereo, a Cobra alarm system, power windows, and air conditioning. This Elise is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Magnetic Blue Metallic and has a removable soft top, dual exhaust outlets, Star Shield, side air intakes, and an integrated rear spoiler. The 16″ and 17″ eight-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Yokohama Advan tires. Braking is handled by ventilated and cross-drilled discs with AP Racing and Brembo calipers. The seats are trimmed in Biscuit leather and are joined by matching door panel inserts, and interior equipment includes a Blaupunkt stereo, power windows, carpeted floor mats, aluminum pedals, and air conditioning. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and a digital display. The digital odometer indicates 7k miles. The transverse 1.8-liter 2ZZ-GE inline-four was sourced from Toyota and was factory rated at 190 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. The car passed an emissions inspection in September 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Lotus of Los Gatos in California, along with factory equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $46,795. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
