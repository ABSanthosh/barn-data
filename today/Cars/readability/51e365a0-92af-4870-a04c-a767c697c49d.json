  "text": "Rumors suggest we could be about to meet a new T-Rex and maybe more 1 hour ago by Stephen Rivers Ram teases mystery reveal for June 8, hinting at major product or powertrain news. Video features cryptic messaging and subtle clues, fueling speculation of a V8 return. Sources suggest new TRX with Hemi V8 is in development for the 2026 model year. Ram is clearly trying to get back in the good graces of truck buyers, and it might finally be listening to what those buyers actually want. After a rocky shift away from V8 power last year, the brand seems ready to change course. One way it’s reportedly doing that? By reviving the legendary Hemi. Now, Ram is teasing that “big things are on the horizon,” with a reveal set for June 8. It’s no surprise that Ram has a lot coming soon. In April, it told us that it would launch 25 new models, which include trims of course, over the next 18 months. In fact, it went far enough to say that the first would show up on June 8. This new teaser video below is the first that gives us any insight into what it might be. More: Dodge Charger Rumored To Get Hemi V8 Power In 2026 The short clip posted online by Ram features the caption “Fire up the engines – Big things are on the horizon. 06.08.25.” In it, we see newly re-appointed CEO Tim Kuniskis talking with Dave Sparks from the TV show Diesel Brothers. As they stand behind a table with snacks and coffee, a person wearing what looks like fighter-pilot attire approaches. “Excuse me guys,” he says before grabbing a cookie, remarking about it, and telling Kuniskis that he has a ‘nice jacket.’ It’s a very short clip and, unlike many previous Stellantis teasers, it doesn’t have anything super clear inside of it to tell us what is coming. That said, the rumors swirling about the TRX are so loud that it’s hard to not put the two together. Everything we’ve heard and reported on here at Carscoops points to Stellantis already building new Hemi V8 engines for Ram 1500 production. For the most part, that seems focused on the 5.7-liter version. Notably, YouTuber ButtaDaInsider has also reported that leaked internal documents confirm the TRX for the 2026 model year. If true, it would be a huge win, at least in terms of publicity for the brand. It’s also worth noting that the appearance of Sparks in this clip could also mean that Ram is working on something bigger or in addition to the TRX. We think a high-powered diesel Ram could very well get a prehistoric name that fits nicely in the family. What do you think? Is this the right move for Ram? Let us know below!",
