The car is powered by a 2.9-liter quad-cam V8 linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and is finished in Rosso Chiaro over beige leather. Equipment includes 14″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a removable roof panel, pop-up headlights, a quad-exit exhaust system, air conditioning, a gated shifter, a Pioneer cassette radio, a metric speedometer, a MOMO steering wheel, and electric windows. Work in preparation for the sale has included fluids services, rebuilding the brake calipers, and changing the fuel filter. This 308 GTS has covered approximately 6k kilometers under current ownership, and it is now offered on dealer consignment in Canada with service records, tools, and Alberta registration. The hardtop 308 GTB debuted at the 1975 Paris Motor Show, while the targa-top GTS model was introduced at the 1977 Frankfurt Motor Show. The car is finished in Rosso Chiaro and features a black removable roof panel, pop-up headlights, dual side mirrors, a vented decklid, and quad exhaust outlets. Silver 14″ five-spoke Cromodora wheels are mounted with Pirelli Cinturato P3000 tires that show date codes from 2005. The car features a fully independent suspension with double wishbones front and rear, and stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at each corner. Work in preparation for the sale included rebuilding the brake calipers and flushing the brake fluid. The cockpit features bolstered seats trimmed in beige leather upholstery along with matching door panels. Equipment includes air conditioning, a Pioneer cassette radio, electric windows, a MOMO steering wheel, an aluminum pedal set and driver’s footrest, and a gated shifter with a dogleg gear pattern. Close-up photographs of the interior upholstery and trim are shown in the gallery below. Instrumentation includes a 280-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges with imperial units The five-digit odometer shows 1,100 kilometers (~697 miles), but has reportedly rolled over once. Approximately 6k kilometers have been added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 2.9L quad-cam V8 is equipped with four twin-choke Weber 40DCNF carburetors and was factory rated at 237 horsepower. Work in preparation for the sale has included an oil change, changing the gear oil, and replacing the fuel filter. The most recent timing-belt service was performed in May 2016, and approximately two decades of service invoices are shown in the gallery below. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Filed under: 308 You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
