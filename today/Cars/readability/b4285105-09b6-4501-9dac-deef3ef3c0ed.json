  "text": "Although it's currently a study, Delta 4x4 could build that conversion for interested Purosangue owners 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas Delta 4×4 explores the possibility of an off-road-focused Ferrari Purosangue. Upgrades include all-terrain tires, wide fenders, a lifted suspension, and a roof rack. The model only exists in renderings, but could translate into an actual build. The Purosangue is the first high-riding model from Maranello, but it was never designed for extreme off-roading. For those who want to explore further, Delta 4×4 imagines a wild conversion of the Purosangue with off-road modifications and a rooftop tent, transforming it into an adventurous camper. The Ferrari Purosangue Fuoristrada (which is Italian for “off road”) is presented in a bunch of renderings as a design study. However, Delta 4×4 could make it happen, if there’s enough interest from its customers. More: Mansory’s Purosangue Shows You Can Always Make A Ferrari Louder And Uglier The conversion includes a lift kit for the suspension and a new set of wheels, contributing to a notable increase in the ground clearance. Delta 4×4’s signature beadlock rims are shod in all-terrain tires, sacrificing some of the handling credentials of the Purosangue for more grip on rough surfaces. Furthermore, a full-size spare wheel is mounted on the tailgate, alongside a shovel. The custom bodykit comprises extended wheel arches that follow the lines of the original, while adding a few inches of width. The Purosangue Fuoristrada also benefits from extra LEDs on the front bumper, hood, and roof, improving visibility in the dark. A custom roof rack houses a retractable tent with a ladder, allowing occupants to spend the night in the wilderness. The renderings also depict a couple of gasoline canisters in case the model is driven in a very remote location. Alternatively, the rack can be used to transport larger items of other kinds of equipment that won’t fit in the Purosangue’s boot. The finishing touch is a two-tone livery with red and white graphics. Interestingly, the Prancing Horse and Ferrari emblems have been removed, possibly to reduce the risk of a lawsuit from the Italian brand. Delta 4×4 didn’t bother to plan any performance modifications, since the naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 of the Purosangue generates 715 hp (533 kW / 725 PS) right from the factory. Power is channeled to all four wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission and a performance-oriented AWD system. Judging from the exclusive nature of the Ferrari Purosangue, it sounds unlikely that any owners would opt for an off-road conversion. Still, there might be some individuals that want to stand out from the crowd and drive their Ferrari off the beaten track. Delta 4×4 / Instagram",
