  "text": "Responding to the ever-changing tariff tax landscape in America, the crew at Mitsubishi has – for the moment – halted the shipping of additional inventory to dealers in this country.“We are holding vehicles at the port until we have additional visibility on tariffs and decisions made on next steps,” spox from Mitsu told reporters at  Automotive News. They went on to point out the company has roughly 100 days of inventory already on the ground, a sum which apparently equates to just over 20,000 machines. Most of those are at dealers already; Mitsu has 330 dealerships in America, if you’re wondering. Every new vehicle currently sold by Mitsubishi in the United States is assembled in Japan, meaning they are impacted by the 25 percent tariff tax on imported vehicles, a policy which went into effect during the first week of April. It is worth noting that Mitsu has an alliance with Nissan, a company which does have a manufacturing presence in America – some of which is reportedly underutilized. While it is true the days of simply swapping a grille and trunk badging are long gone, it is also true that the Outlander (Mitsu’s most popular model) and the Rogue share a platform. Still, there would be many hurdles to clear if both machines were to roll off the same assembly line. Mitsubishi sold 109,843 vehicles in America last year. The cessation of imports, no matter how temporary, could hamper growth efforts – especially if the pause drags on. Through to the end of Q1 this year, total sales for the brand are up 11 percent compared to the same timeframe in 2024, with 31,637 vehicles sold. Eagle eyes will note that 71 percent of that 3,234 unit gain came from the little Mirage, a discontinued model which saw 7,301 takers in Q1 compared to 5,003 units in Q1 last year.[Image: Mitsubishi]Become a TTAC insider.
