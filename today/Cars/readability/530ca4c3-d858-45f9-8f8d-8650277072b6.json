  "description": "It’s one of those days when I’m glad I get to do what I do. The day starts off like any other, getting up at way-too-early o’clock, driving to the shoot location and reviewing a car. But what’s making it different is the car. Way before the sun comes up, I’m already at the location. I hear a deep grumble approaching, and I see the six LED light signatures, followed by a sleek silhouette cutting through the dark. Now, I had promised myself I wouldn’t make any James Bond references, but this really feels straight out of one of those legendary films. Aston Martin Vantage exterior design Borrows design cues from DB12, One-77 As the sun comes up, I get my first proper look at the Vantage, this one being finished in a beautiful shade called Ion Blue. The new Aston Martin Vantage commands your attention, irrespective of what you make of its looks. It borrows a lot of styling cues from bigger Astons, like the new DB12 and the One-77 supercar, and, in general, is a lot more aggressive-looking than the outgoing car. The biggest change is at the front, with larger LED Matrix headlamps, a larger grille, new air curtains on the outer edges of the bumper and a more sculpted bonnet. Full of gorgeous details, like these strakes. 21-inch wheels The rest of the car is largely unchanged; it still has a vent on the fenders, which helps remove turbulent air from the wheel wells, but it now features a side strake with the Aston Martin lettering. There’s new wheel options, with this one riding on 21 inchers with the optional black brake calipers. I also love the look of the mirrors, whose entire housing moves, rather than just the glass, and the large side skirts. The Vantage also has a ground clearance of 94mm, which may not sound like much, but with short overhangs and a small wheelbase, relatively speaking, it’s very capable at tackling speed breakers. In fact, getting to the shoot location involves going over around 10 speed breakers and some really rough patches of road, and surprisingly, the Vantage doesn’t scrape its belly even once. And that’s without a front axle lift system - commendable! It’s wider; has more aero and larger exhaust tips. 30mm wider from before Around the back, it still retains the now-iconic Vantage light signature, but it’s 30mm wider than before. Aston Martin says that the underbody aero, the diffuser and the ducktail spoiler have all been revised for more downforce, and the quad exhaust tips are now larger. It also has a properly usable boot and can easily swallow up your luggage for a weekend road trip. Getting into the cabin is an event. It’s got the swan doors, like you’d expect from an Aston that not only look cool sweeping slightly upwards but also help avoid contact with curbs and footpaths. Inside, I’m greeted by a completely new interior that looks and feels much more modern and driver-focused than the outgoing car’s. Aston Martin Vantage interior and features Digital cluster has nice graphics, but the data appears too small. 10.25-inch touchscreen and driver's display  There are two 10.25-inch screens – one for the instrument cluster and another for the infotainment. The touchscreen is set low and at an angle in the centre console and features nice graphics, while the instrument panel is set in a sporty binnacle. However, some of the data appears too small to read on the go. The new interior is more driver-centric and gets more tech; seat controls fall easily to hand. ADAS added The angled centre console has a myriad of buttons and switches, all of which are finished beautifully, and they control various aspects of the car. Then there are the optional Sports Plus seats, which are comfy and supportive and are finished in a lovely soft leather. A shoutout also goes to the optional ‘Oxford Tan’ upholstery this car features, which really complements the exterior colour well. Practicality is also decent by supercar standards, as it does get a glovebox, some space behind the seats, slim door pockets and a wireless charger under the centre console. And yes, it packs in ADAS tech now. Endless customisation options This test car is also equipped with options such as carbon-fibre trim, blue contrasting stitching, a sports steering wheel and satin dark chrome ‘interior jewellery’ - all of which undoubtedly look pretty but cost a pretty penny. And the possibilities to customise your Vantage are endless. Overall, the interior feels special, and the quality and finish are top-notch, marking a step up from the outgoing car. Aston Martin engine and performance AMG’s 665hp V8 now puts out 30 percent more power. 0-100kph takes 3.5 seconds; 325kph top speed The engine is one of the stand out elements of the car. The Mercedes-AMG-sourced 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8 has been tuned to put out supercar numbers – 665hp and 800Nm – which is 30 percent more than its predecessor. This propels it from 0-100kph in a claimed 3.5 seconds and on to a top speed of 325kph. And what stands out apart from the wild performance is the noise. This V8 burbles at idle, makes some great intake and turbo whooshing sounds on the move, and there’s delightful exhaust cracks and pops on downshifts. There is some turbo lag, and the meat of the power band is between 3,000rpm and 5,500rpm, but it pulls relentlessly till its 7,000rpm redline. A stiffer chassis and quicker steering make it feel much more agile than the older Vantage. Misses out on a GT mode There are three drive modes to choose from – Sport, Sport+ and Track – all of which alter throttle response, steering weight, damper stiffness and exhaust volume. However, there’s no GT mode, like on the bigger DB12 or the DBX SUV, so Sport is the mode to be in for everyday use. It’s in this mode where the Vantage feels its most relaxed and supple, but it isn’t as relaxed or pliant as some other supercars out there. Sport+ dials things up further with more response and noise, and it’ll even allow some playful action from the rear end without being dangerous. Track mode, however, is best saved for, well, the track. In this mode, the Vantage feels like a sportscar that the brand says it is, with a very firm suspension, sharp responses and twitchy handling out on a public road. You really have to have your wits about you to use this mode on tight public roads. And best reserved for a track, there’s nine settings for the traction control, so you can choose how much slip you want from the rear. Torque converter is smooth Paired to the V8 is an 8-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox that gets a shorter final drive ratio. It’s fairly quick, but it doesn’t have the lightning responses or that small but noticeable shunt you get from DCTs - something you’d expect from a sportscar. But the Vantage isn’t an all-out sportscar, and the torque converter’s smoothness actually complements its GT characteristics and makes it much nicer to drive at saner speeds. Having driven the Vantage through smaller village roads, too, I got a good idea about its ride and handling balance. The ride is firm and, though, not jarring, and given its touring abilities, a more pliant GT setting would have been welcome. The refinement could also have been better as you do get some road and tyre noise inside the cabin. In terms of handling, apart from being wider, the new Vantage is stiffer, thanks to additional cross bracing at both axles and in the floor. With the engine sat behind the front axle, it’s got a perfect 50:50 weight distribution; the quicker steering and more aero means it’s much more agile, planted and responsive around corners than the older Vantage. Aston Martin price and verdict Priced at Rs 4.20 crore (ex-showroom, before options), the new Vantage currently sits in a space of its own, between the Porsche 911 Turbo S at the lower end and the Ferrari Roma above it. And that goes for its positioning, too. It’s in a pretty unique spot; a front-engined, two-seat sportscar is rare. It’s got beautiful lines, aural drama, ferocious performance like a proper sports car, is usable over a wide variety of roads, can tackle speed breakers, and has the ability to carry your weekend luggage. Think of it as a sports car with some GT abilities or a GT with sports car capabilities – the latter is what I’m leaning towards. This is what makes it such good sense for India.

There is some turbo lag, and the meat of the power band is between 3,000rpm and 5,500rpm, but it pulls relentlessly till its 7,000rpm redline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"ArticleImage\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Aston_Martin_Vantage_Rear_Quarter_Tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003eA stiffer chassis and quicker steering make it feel much more agile than the older Vantage.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMisses out on a GT mode\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are three drive modes to choose from – Sport, Sport+ and Track – all of which alter throttle response, steering weight, damper stiffness and exhaust volume. However, there’s no GT mode, like on the bigger DB12 or the DBX SUV, so Sport is the mode to be in for everyday use. It’s in this mode where the Vantage feels its most relaxed and supple, but it isn’t as relaxed or pliant as some other supercars out there. Sport+ dials things up further with more response and noise, and it’ll even allow some playful action from the rear end without being dangerous. Track mode, however, is best saved for, well, the track. In this mode, the Vantage feels like a sportscar that the brand says it is, with a very firm suspension, sharp responses and twitchy handling out on a public road. You really have to have your wits about you to use this mode on tight public roads. And best reserved for a track, there’s nine settings for the traction control, so you can choose how much slip you want from the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTorque converter is smooth\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaired to the V8 is an 8-speed ZF torque converter automatic gearbox that gets a shorter final drive ratio. It’s fairly quick, but it doesn’t have the lightning responses or that small but noticeable shunt you get from DCTs - something you’d expect from a sportscar. But the Vantage isn’t an all-out sportscar, and the torque converter’s smoothness actually complements its GT characteristics and makes it much nicer to drive at saner speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Aston_Martin_Vantage_Front_Quarter_Tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving driven the Vantage through smaller village roads, too, I got a good idea about its ride and handling balance. The ride is firm and, though, not jarring, and given its touring abilities, a more pliant GT setting would have been welcome. The refinement could also have been better as you do get some road and tyre noise inside the cabin. In terms of handling, apart from being wider, the new Vantage is stiffer, thanks to additional cross bracing at both axles and in the floor. With the engine sat behind the front axle, it’s got a perfect 50:50 weight distribution; the quicker steering and more aero means it’s much more agile, planted and responsive around corners than the older Vantage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAston Martin price and verdict\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Aston_Martin_Vantage_Rear_Tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePriced at Rs 4.20 crore (ex-showroom, before options), the new Vantage currently sits in a space of its own, between the \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/porsche/911\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePorsche 911 Turbo S\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e at the lower end and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/ferrari/roma\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFerrari Roma\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e above it.
