  "text": "This 1968 DeTomaso Mangusta is one of approximately 401 examples built during four years of production and was delivered new in Mexico. Chassis 8MA882 underwent a refurbishment in the 2000s before being purchased by the seller approximately a year ago. Finished in orange over black leather, the car is powered by a 302ci Ford V8 mated to a ZF five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include power-assisted disc brakes, coilover independent suspension, 15” Campagnolo alloy wheels, fixed quad headlights, air conditioning, and power windows. This Mangusta is now offered with a clean Massachusetts title in the seller’s name. Development of the Mangusta arose from the remnants of an ill-fated Can-Am design project initiated under a partnership between Alejandro de Tomaso and Carroll Shelby, the latter of whom retreated from the agreement before completion of the prototype. The P70 prototype’s underpinnings were instead used as the basis for DeTomaso’s second production car, which was named after the mongoose, a small carnivorous mammal known for its predation of cobras. Featuring bodywork designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Ghia over a backbone chassis, the Mangusta debuted at the 1966 Turin Motor Show before entering production the following year. This example underwent a refurbishment under previous ownership that included a repaint in orange, which is reportedly its original color. Exterior features include fixed quad headlights, round side markers, a mesh rear grille, and gullwing-style engine compartment doors, the latter of which incorporate rectangular glass panels, rear vents, quarter windows, and side louvers. Campagnolo wheels are wrapped in Michelin XWX tires measuring 185/70VR15 up front and 225/70VR15 at the rear. Stopping is handled by power-assisted disc brakes, and service under current ownership is said to have included rebuilds of the calipers and replacement of the brake lines as well as replacement of the wheel bearings. The cabin is trimmed in black leather over bucket seats along with matching upholstery covering the door panels, center tunnel, and dashboard. Additional features include color-keyed carpeting, lap belts, a gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows. The Ferrero three-spoke steering wheel features a wood- and leather-trimmed rim and frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,900-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 26k kilometers (~16k miles), approximately 25 of which have been added under current ownership. Auxiliary instruments include a clock and gauges monitoring oil pressure, oil temperature, amperage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The 302ci Ford V8 is topped by a four-barrel carburetor and blue DeTomaso-branded valve covers. Service in August 2024 is said to have included replacement of the fuel lines and an oil change. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a ZF five-speed manual transaxle. The slave cylinder was reportedly rebuilt under current ownership, at which time clutch hydraulic lines were replaced. Suspension incorporates a double-wishbone front setup with reverse lower wishbones and trailing arms at the rear. Coilover shock absorbers and anti-roll bars are utilized at both ends, and the former are said to have been replaced under current ownership. You are not connected to real-time updates.
