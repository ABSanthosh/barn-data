Features include a power-folding hardtop, bi-xenon headlights, 18″ Alphard alloy wheels, heated seats, a Bose sound system, and COMAND with navigation. The car has 35k miles following ownership history in Georgia and Florida. This R230 is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a battery charger, and a clean Florida title. The car is finished in Black (040) and is equipped with a power-folding convertible hardtop, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, and fender air vents. The Carfax report lists “minor damage” in a May 2024 entry. The 18″ Alphard alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ContiProContact tires. The car features Active Body Control (ABC) suspension as well as an Electronic Stability Program (ESP) and Automatic Slip Control (ASR). The cabin features heated and power-adjustable seats that are upholstered in Charcoal leather. Amenities include dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, a Bose sound system, and COMAND with navigation. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 35k miles. The 5.0-liter M113 V8 was factory rated at 302 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in November 2024.  Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed automatic transmission. Additional photographs of the underside are shown in the gallery below.
