  "text": "The recall impacts a broad range of Honda and Acura models produced between 2021 and 2024 3 hours ago by Brad Anderson An improperly manufactured steering component has triggered Honda’s largest recall in years. The recall even extends to sportier models, such as the Civic Type R and Acura Integra Type S. Owners of affected models will be notified of the recall by mail starting November 18. A steering issue has prompted Honda to recall nearly 1.7 million vehicles across the United States, including many of its top-selling and highest-performing models. The problem doesn’t stop at the U.S. border, either, as another 240,000 vehicles in Canada and 58,000 in Mexico are also impacted, spreading the defect’s consequences across North America. Faulty Worm Wheel Leads to Steering Issues The widespread recall was announced this month after Honda discovered that impacted models may have a steering gearbox worm wheel that was improperly produced. Honda says this wheel can swell during use, reducing the grease film thickness between the worm wheel and worm gear. But that’s not where the trouble ends. The worm gear spring preload—essentially the tension in the spring—was set too high, leading to increased sliding force between the components. This exacerbates the steering difficulty, making vehicles harder to control. Read: Honda Tried And Failed To Fix Fit And HR-V Rearview Camera, Will Try Again Vehicles with these defects may require significantly more steering effort, a dangerous issue that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) warns increases the risk of crashes and injuries. Which Models Are Affected? The recall impacts a total of 1,693,199 vehicles. These start with 2022-2025 Civic Sedan and Civic Sedan Hybrid models built between February 16, 2021, and September 3, 2024, and March 21, 2023, and August 30, 2024, respectively. Also impacted are 2022-2025 Honda Civic Hatchback and Civic Hatchback Hybrid models built from February 9, 2021, and August 14, 2014, as well as May 25, 2023, and February 4, 2024. The high-performance 2023-2025 Civic Type R has also been caught up in the recall. Impacted models were assembled from March 1, 2022, to August 29, 2024. The Civic-based 2023-2025 Acura Integra and 2024-2025 Integra Type S are also being recalled, as are 2023-2025 Honda CR-V, 2023-2025 CR-V Hybrid, and 2025 CR-V Fuel Cell models. Honda also needs to repair 2023-2025 Honda HR-V models built from April 26, 2022, and August 23, 2024. What Caused the Issue? Honda’s recall notice reveals that an insufficient annealing process and high load single unit break-in during production of the worm wheel is to blame for the issue. The recall was announced roughly three years after Honda received its first complaint of the fault. What’s Next for Owners? Starting November 18, 2024, registered owners of the impacted vehicles will be notified by mail. Honda will instruct them to bring their cars to authorized dealerships, where the worm gear spring will be replaced free of charge.",
