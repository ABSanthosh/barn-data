Now with 116 miles, it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automated transaxle and is finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero leather upholstery. Features include an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, a retractable hardtop, 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, SCM-E magnetorheological suspension, front and rear cameras, parking sensors, heated power-adjustable seats, a passenger display screen, Apple CarPlay, and navigation. This F8 Spider is now offered in Massachusetts with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, memorabilia, a car cover, a battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The car is finished in Rosso Corsa (322) and features a retractable hardtop, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, LED headlights, parking sensors, quarter panel air intakes, and dual exhaust outlets with optional sport exhaust pipes. This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in August 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded. The 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 245/35 and 305/30 Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires. The car was factory-equipped with an SCM-E magnetorheological suspension, and braking is handled by Brembo calipers fitted over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors at each corner. The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in Nero leather with Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests and color-contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Interior amenities include red seatbelts, a passenger display screen, front and rear cameras, Apple CarPlay, dual-zone automatic climate control, and navigation. The carbon-fiber- and leather-trimmed steering wheel sits ahead of paddle shifters and features an engine-start button, a manettino drive-mode selector, and shift lights. Instrumentation consists of a central 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by configurable digital displays. The digital odometer indicates 116 miles. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.9L F154 V8 was factory rated at 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque, and it sends power to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Ferrari of New England in Norwood, Massachusetts, and lists factory equipment, colors, and a total suggested retail price of $344,540.
