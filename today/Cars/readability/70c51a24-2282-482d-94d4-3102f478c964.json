  "text": "The i-VTEC-powered coupe might be the solution for those who can't afford a genuine Mercedes 3 hours ago by Thanos Pappas A late 1990s Honda Civic underwent extensive visual modifications inspired by Mercedes. The so-called “supercar” features genuine Mercedes lighting units and a custom body kit. The altered roofline suggests the donor car may have been involved in an accident. Modifying cars takes a mix of creativity, determination, and a willingness to ignore the laws of good taste. An Indonesian Honda Civic owner has certainly embraced the creative part, turning his humble sedan into a custom “Mercedes supercar” using a blend of genuine and aftermarket components. What started as a 1996 Honda Civic is now barely recognizable thanks to extensive visual modifications. The headlights appear to be sourced from a first-gen Mercedes-Benz M-Class (W163) SUV, flanking a custom grille that mimics the Mercedes-McLaren SLR. The bumper intakes and hood vents borrow styling cues from past AMG models, while the side profile sports fake gills for that extra performance “illusion.” More: Would You Spend $25,000 On This Honda Civic-Based Lamborghini Reventon Replica? The roofline and the pillars of the Honda Civic have been reshaped, making us believe that the donor car might have been involved in a rollover accident. As a result, the fake Mercedes has frameless doors and unconventional proportions. If you squint hard, you might get a hint of a CLK, but certainly not strong enough to call it a replica. At the back, smoked taillights borrowed from the second-gen Mercedes-Benz SLK (R171) roadster pair with a custom tailgate and rear bumper. Staying true to the AMG-inspired theme, the car features quad tailpipes housed in a diffuser. Other details include a fixed rear wing, ultra-slim mirrors, and a set of 18-inch Meister alloy wheels, giving it a distinctive—if not entirely convincing—performance look. Santri Otomotif Channel / YouTube, Ghaniy Alfatih / Facebook Moving inside, the Civic’s interior gets a Mercedes emblem on the steering wheel, yellow door inserts, and an oversized infotainment screen in the center console. The aftermarket audio system is particularly ambitious, with enough speakers crammed in to make cargo space a distant memory. Under the hood, however, it’s still all Honda. Power comes from the Civic’s signature iVTEC engine, mated to a five-speed manual gearbox. Unlike every two-door Mercedes coupe, which sends power to the rear wheels, this front-wheel-drive creation sticks to its original layout, meaning the “supercar” transformation is strictly visual (obviously).

In a rather creative marketing move, the seller has photoshopped various Ferraris next to the build. After all, nothing says “supercar status” like a little digital wishful thinking. Depending on the listing (there are at least two), the “Mercedified” Honda is priced between 75 and 79 million Indonesian Rupiahs, but don’t panic, that’s the equivalent of only about $4,600–$4,800. The modifications alone are estimated to have cost 40 million Rupiahs ($2,400), meaning someone has sunk a relatively fair amount into this project.",
