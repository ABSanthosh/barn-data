  "text": "Niche as it is, the performance bagger scene is having its moment in the spotlight—thanks largely to the wildly entertaining King of the Baggers racing series. Baggers are fast evolving from grandad tourers into adrenaline-fueled machines with miles of attitude. The whole concept is slightly unhinged, but we’re here for it. Indian Motorcycle’s latest custom build initiative is a full-throttle tribute to performance bagger culture. As part of the American marque’s ‘Forged’ series, three Indian Chieftain PowerPlus tourers were handed to custom builders to do with as they pleased. The menacing example you’re looking at here was built by the V-twin specialist shop and parts maker Kraus Motor Co. It’s no fluke that Kraus Motor Co. ended up on the Forged roster. Based in Utah, USA, the company has deep roots in the performance V-twin scene and boasts a burgeoning catalog of Indian-specific parts. (Case in point; the other two bikes in the Forged series both sport multiple Kraus parts.) Kraus kicked the project off with a bone-stock 2025 Indian Chieftain PowerPlus 112. As per its name, it’s powered by Indian’s 112 ci PowerPlus engine, which pumps out 126 hp and 180 Nm of torque. It also comes with all the tech and trimmings that you’d expect from a premium bagger. To the uninitiated, it might appear that Kraus has just lightly fettled the Chieftain. But its understated matte black paint job belies the amount of work that went into it. Behind the fairing and cases lurks a gnarly parts spec. “This bike is a straight street ripper,” says shop founder Satya Kraus. “There’s no bullsh*t. No glossy paint. There’s no fancy ‘this or that.’ It’s classy, but it’s mean and it’s all about business.” The changes start up front, where Kraus fitted their KR8 front-end kit. The kit matches inverted Öhlins forks to Kraus yokes, radial brake mounts, and fork guards. An Öhlins shock hides away at the back; its preload adjustment wheel is accessible on the left-hand side of the bike, thanks to a machined bracket. The Chieftain now rolls on a set of luxe forged carbon wheels from BST, shod with Metzeler Cruisetec rubber. The braking system features Kraus billet aluminum calipers, mounts, pads, and hardware, with OEM rotors and Spiegler lines throughout. Moving to the cockpit, the crew installed a set of stainless steel moto bars, finished in a fetching champagne gold hue. They’re held in place by Kraus mounts, and set closer to the rider by way of an offset Kraus x Hart-Luck riser base. Other upgrades include ODI x Hart-Luck parts, Kraus controls, and Rizoma mirrors. You’ll find more Kraus parts lower down—from the floorboards and wide passenger pegs to the brake and shift levers. The Chieftain’s also been converted from a belt to a chain drive, with a modified front sprocket cover. A stainless steel exhaust system from Fab28 Industries adds a suitable soundtrack. Kraus’s changes to the Chieftain’s bodywork are subtle, yet effective. The OEM fairing is kitted with a full complement of Denali LED lights, and a tinted Klock Werks windscreen. The carbon fiber fenders and dashboard trim come from DTF Performance. Not content to simply fit the rear fender as-is, Kraus trimmed it and treated it to a CNC-machined edge. They also modified the bike’s stock side panels, and finished the tank off with custom-made Indian badges. The seat is from Kraus’s catalog, made to spec by Saddlemen. As a finishing touch, Kraus narrowed the stock panniers through a clever process of cutting out the sections they wanted to slim down, 3D-scanning the case, and 3D-printing new panels. They also added case-mounted LED taillights from Ciro3D, plus Kraus bag mounts and hinge covers. Kraus’s fine-tuned Indian Chieftain PowerPlus cuts an imposing figure, its black finishes punctuated only by selective carbon fiber and gold details. A handful of polished highlights, including the swingarm, add just the right amount of contrast. There’s one more notable detail—a custom derby cover inscribed with “No Love.” That’s the nickname of the bike’s new owner and seasoned UFC fighter, Cody Garbrandt. Building a hard-hitting bagger for a professional brawler feels a little on the nose, but we’ll let it slide.

The carbon fiber fenders and dashboard trim come from DTF Performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot content to simply fit the rear fender as-is, Kraus trimmed it and treated it to a CNC-machined edge. They also modified the bike’s stock side panels, and finished the tank off with custom-made Indian badges. The seat is from Kraus’s catalog, made to spec by Saddlemen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Indian Chieftain performance bagger by Kraus Motor Co.\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/indian-chieftain-performance-bagger-4.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nAs a finishing touch, Kraus narrowed the stock panniers through a clever process of cutting out the sections they wanted to slim down, 3D-scanning the case, and 3D-printing new panels. They also added case-mounted LED taillights from Ciro3D, plus Kraus bag mounts and hinge covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKraus’s fine-tuned Indian Chieftain PowerPlus cuts an imposing figure, its black finishes punctuated only by selective carbon fiber and gold details.
