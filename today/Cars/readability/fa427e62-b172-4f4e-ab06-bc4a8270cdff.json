The car was purchased by the seller in 2023 and now has 39k miles. Additional equipment includes  20″ Kalimnos wheels, an active differential, a power-operated black soft top, parking sensors, bi-xenon headlights, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system, a rearview camera, navigation, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This XKR convertible is now offered with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the name of the seller’s LLC. XKR-specific styling cues include hood vents, mesh front grilles, and revised front and rear spoilers. This example is finished in Ultimate Black, and features include a power-operated Black soft top, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, parking sensors, and polished exhaust outlets. The 20″ Kalimnos alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires. The car is equipped with an Adaptive Dynamics suspension. Stopping power is provided by gray-finished brake calipers over ventilated discs at all four corners. The front brake rotors and all brake pads were reportedly replaced in July 2024. The heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in black leather, and equipment includes carbon-fiber interior trim, a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system, navigation, a power-retractable rotary shift dial, a rearview camera, push-button ignition, cruise control, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with paddle shifters and frames a 190-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as a central digital display. The digital odometer indicates 39k miles, approximately 6k of which were added under current ownership. The supercharged and intercooled 5.0-liter AJ Gen III V8 features variable valve timing and was rated at 510 horsepower and 461 lb-ft of torque. A coolant flush was performed in December 2021. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed automatic transmission and an active limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
