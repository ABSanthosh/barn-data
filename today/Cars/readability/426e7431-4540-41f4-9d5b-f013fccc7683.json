It planted the seed long before I ever drove a BMW. And when I finally did? It wasn’t some M car or Autobahn monster.It was a 318i E30—my little panda. It didn’t have a ton of power. Honestly, it didn’t even have that much reliability. But it was raw, it was fun, and it was cool as hell. It had this honest mechanical feel, this direct connection between driver and machine that I hadn’t felt in anything else. That was it. I was in.The Aha MomentThen came the moment that sealed it: BMW European Delivery.If you ever did one, you know exactly what I’m talking about. If you didn’t? I’m sorry you missed the golden age. I ended up doing it three times—each one better than the last. First was the E46 325i, then the twin-turbo thrill of the E90 335i, and finally the unforgettable 1M Coupe.

I wasn’t expecting to find such a loyal, tight-knit, and genuinely helpful group of owners and fans. Whether it was advice on a forum, someone helping out with coding a car, or just a quick thumbs-up at a gas station—BMW people show up. In some ways, it reminded me of Porsche’s crowd.

By 2009, BMW was already deep into electrification projects—long before Tesla was cool, or even really on anyone’s radar.

They were imagining what came next.Masters of StorytellingAnd, of course, there’s the storytelling.BMW knows how to tell a story through a car. The 2002. The E39 M5. The i8. Even something like the G87 M2—you can feel the lineage, the intent, the attitude. It’s baked in. That’s what I keep coming back to. It’s not just performance stats or design details—it’s the feeling each car gives you. The way it becomes a chapter in your life.I could go on. And honestly, I probably will at some point.

Your “little panda” or your Autobahn blast or that first turn-in that told you this was something different? Tell me. I’d love to hear it.",
