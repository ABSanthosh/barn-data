  "description": "Can Jaguar’s compact SUV bring enough flair and dynamic polish to make it a tempting used buy? When it launched, the Jaguar E-Pace diversified the brand away from its regular crop of buyers by appealing to a younger and trendier audience.And this bold move proved successful, with the compact SUV having scored almost 100,000 sales across Europe to date.The F-Type sports car had the biggest influence on the E-Pace’s design, with its ovoid headlights, wraparound tail-lights, pronounced haunches, and wheels pushed as close to the car’s extremities as was reasonably possible.It’s a handsome thing that still has presence today.Less appealing was its technical make-up: it had an all-steel body and sat on an old Ford platform, which meant it tipped the scales at 1768kg, making it similar in weight to the considerably larger F-Pace.As such, when we first drove the E-Pace, we found it didn’t deliver the poise and finesse that we had come to expect from a Jaguar.It was inoffensive and by no means bad to drive, with its well-tuned steering shining through, but a brittle low-speed ride meant that it didn’t excel at balancing athleticism with comfort.Several diesel and petrol engines were offered in various tunes.Mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains were added later when the E-Pace received a number of upgrades, the most notable being a switch to JLR’s PTA platform, which underpinned the second-generation Land Rover Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque of 2019.Both front- and four-wheel drive were available, while a smooth, ZF-supplied nine-speed automatic gearbox was standard on all cars.The 1.5-litre petrol fours and lesser 2.0-litre diesel fours were a bit sluggish, so we would suggest the 178bhp D180 as a used buy: it struck the best compromise between oomph and economy (expect around 50mpg).If you don’t do enough miles to justify a diesel, the 2.0-litre petrol four could be had with 197bhp, 247bhp or, later on, 296bhp. If you want to tow, the 237bhp D240 should be ideal.The 296bhp P300e plug-in hybrid, introduced in 2019, promised up to 34 miles of electric-only range and was a welcome addition for its punchy combination of petrol engine and electric motor.A used PHEV E-Pace will always be dearer than its pure-ICE counterpart, though, and you will need to have reliable access to a charger at home or work.Crucially, the E-Pace espoused the traditional luxury brand values of its F-Pace big brother inside, with plush leather seats, chrome trim and a neatly organised dashboard.A selection of cheaper plastics conspired to lessen the upmarket feel, but it still had rivals like the Volkswagen Tiguan licked for material quality.Opt for the later facelifted car if you want even more opulence and slicker technology (primarily a new touchscreen that’s larger and nicer to use).The E-Pace is also capacious for its size, being able to comfortably accommodate both children and adults in the rear, with the latter able to find a relaxing seating position thanks to generous rear head and leg room.Impressive interior quality and clever packaging are Jaguar hallmarks, of course, but they are likely to come at a much higher price in future as the brand remodels itself as a maker of ultra-luxury electric cars.A used E-Pace for £9000 seems like a bargain when you consider that direction of travel – and, now that it’s on the chopping block, should bring an air of exclusivity to your everyday commute.",

  "text": "Is the Jaguar E-Pace reliable? A well-maintained and regulalry serviced E-Pace should serve as a relaible family wagon, but keep in mind that it is prone to common faults which are widely known (se below). With a strong dealer and service network across the UK, as well a great number of independent specialists, shoudl you car go wrong it will be easy to source parts.  It is worth noting that in the What Car? reliability survery, the E-Pace came 29th out of 34 cars in the family SUV categroy, with an overall score of 83.8%. While it finished above rivals like the Range Rover Evoque and Skoda Karoq, the Nissan Qashqai and Volvo XC40 scored better for reliability.  Engine: Test a used diesel Ingenium model from cold, because an engine rattle on start-up could be a sign of a worn timing chain. The chain can stretch and snap, causing engine failure. Jaguar dealers can fit an upgraded chain to eliminate the issue. A blocked diesel particulate filter (DPF) is common, and oil dilution can happen as a result. Test drive a diesel on a long journey and see if it goes into limp mode or an engine management warning light illuminates. Replacement DPFs are pricey. Watch for any AdBlue leaking from hoses and filler caps and that the air breather pipes aren’t rubbing on engine components. The engine fan can burn itself out by running at full speed for too long. A software update resolved the issue, but check the history of any car you’re viewing. Gearbox: The gearbox has been known to kick itself out of gear, and there can sometimes be a delay between selecting a gear and the vehicle moving. Take any used car on a lengthy test drive and feel for any jerky gearchanges. Brakes: Brake hoses on early models are known to chafe on the wheel, resulting in a brake fluid leak. This ought to have been resolved, but a dealer should tell you if your car was affected, and be sure to check the service history. Infotainment: Later touchscreen displays can suffer from software glitches. An update by a dealer should resolve the issue, but make sure you play around with the system to check it works properly. Body: Check the tailgate opens and closes properly, as the struts are prone to failure. An owner’s view Dan Walker: “During my nearly four-year ownership of my E-Pace, it has proved a comfortable motorway cruiser, and it feels pretty settled on a twisty B-road. \"It’s surprisingly economical for a heavy, four-wheel-drive SUV, too. The Pivi Pro infotainment system can be temperamental at times, but I’ve not had any out-of-the-ordinary maintenance costs or issues. \"The Chequered Flag special edition commands a higher road tax, though, and servicing costs can be expensive. I’ve put just shy of 60,000 miles on my car, and overall I’m very happy with it.” Also worth knowing The E-Pace gained a five-star Euro NCAP safety rating, scoring highly for both adult and child occupant safety. Several trims were offered across the E-Pace range, the main ones being S, SE and HSE. The range-topper gets you 20in wheels, a 12.3in touchscreen and keyless entry. Sportier-looking R-Dynamic trims came later.",
