  "description": "The new Skoda Kodiaq has made its India debut at the Auto Expo 2025, ahead of its scheduled market launch later this year. Skoda India has also displayed the Elroq mid-size electric SUV and the Vision 7S SUV concept at the event. The new Kodiaq continues with a 2.0-litre petrol engine The Elroq sits below the Enyaq iV SUV in Skoda’s line-up The Vision 7S concept previews the future Skoda SUVs New Skoda Kodiaq India launch by June 2025 As we reported earlier, the new Kodiaq will go on sale in the April-June quarter this year. Skoda has the top-spec Kodiaq L\u0026K on display at the Auto Expo. The SUV has been undergoing road tests in India for the past few months, and spy shots have hinted at more than one variant being readied for the India launch. Skoda’s flagship SUV continues to use the 2.0-litre petrol engine, delivering 190hp and mated to a 7-speed DCT gearbox. Higher variants will come with 4X4 tech at launch. The new Kodiaq is slightly larger than the outgoing model and gets Skoda’s “Modern Solid” design language. Now longer than before, the SUV offers more interior space and higher boot capacity. We expect the brand to offer the new Kodiaq in India with a 7-seater layout. Key features include a 13-inch infotainment screen, a fully digital instrument cluster and additional safety tech, such as a Level 2 ADAS suite. Expect the new Kodiaq to be slightly higher in price than the outgoing one, which starts at Rs 39.99 lakh (ex-showroom, India). Skoda Elroq EV is here to gauge customer response Apart from the Kodiaq, the Elroq electric SUV is on display at the show, making its India debut. While Skoda has not confirmed whether it will launch the Elroq in India, it has brought the electric SUV to the expo to gauge customer response. The Elroq is underpinned by the Volkswagen Group’s MEB architecture, which is also used by the Audi Q4 and Volkswagen ID.3, among others. It has been stretched to 4.49 metres, making it slightly larger than the ICE-powered Karoq (4.39 metres) but significantly smaller than the Enyaq (4.65 metres). The Elroq sits below the flagship Enyaq iV in Skoda’s global line-up and gets three battery pack options, with outputs ranging from 170hp to 285hp. Skoda India is considering bringing the Elroq here, and if launched, it will find itself in the company of the Tata Curvv EV, the upcoming Hyundai Creta Electric, and the Maruti e Vitara, among others. Vision 7S concept previews future Skoda SUVs The Vision 7S concept from Skoda is not all-new. It debuted in 2022 as Skoda’s demonstrator, hinting at the design and tech for its future models. The concept previewed many firsts for Skoda, including its new logo and the “Modern Solid” design language. A 7-seater SUV based on this concept is set to make it to production by 2026. While the all-new SUV based on the Vision 7S isn’t out yet, some of the styling cues from the concept are already visible on the Elroq electric SUV. The concept also features very cool suicide doors, although it is unlikely to make it to production on any model.  Apart from the exterior, the Vision 7S concept also previews a new look for the cabin, where the steering wheel and central boss design are oval-shaped, the interiors are clean and devoid of buttons, and the car also gets a large central touchscreen that can be used in portrait or landscape position, similar to what we see on the BYD models. The showcar had typical concept-like interiors with individual seats for four passenger, a center console that cuts through the entire length of the cabin and also very interesting textures on the floor board and door pads.  Besides the new Kodiaq, the Elroq and the Vision 7S concept, Skoda India has also displayed the new Superb and the Octavia RS at the motor show.
