It is finished in Oxford White with blue racing stripes over Ebony upholstery and is powered by a 5.2-liter Voodoo V8 linked with a six-speed manual transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes 19″ multi-spoke black wheels, Brembo brake calipers, a rearview camera, HID headlights, and Recaro front seats. Acquired by the seller in 2021, this GT350 is offered with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Wisconsin title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Oxford White (YZ) with optional over-the-top blue racing stripes and features HID projector headlights, hood and fender vents, a front splitter with the Shelby logo, LED taillights with sequential turn signals, and quad exhaust outlets. The Track Package added a larger rear trunk spoiler. Xpel paint protection film was applied to the front bumper cover, headlight lenses, and mirror caps in 2019. A blemish in the stripe on the lower front bumper cover is noted. Black 19″ multi-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires measuring 295/35 up front and 305/35 out back. The car rides on MagneRide dampers and is equipped with six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo brake calipers. The Recaro front sport seats are trimmed in Ebony cloth and Miko suede and are joined by color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Equipment includes a rearview camera, a CD stereo, air conditioning, and cruise control. The passenger-side dashboard plaque designates this GT350 as chassis G0297. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with an 8,250-rpm redline, auxiliary gauges, and a central multi-function digital display. Additional gauges for oil pressure and oil temperature are mounted in the center stack. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles, approximately 6k of which were added under current ownership. The 5.2-liter Voodoo V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft along with dual overhead camshafts, variable valve timing, an engine oil cooler, and additional coolers for the engine, transmission, and differential. A commemorative plaque displays the signature of the engine builder, and factory-rated output was 526 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Tremec TR-3160 six-speed manual transmission and a 3.73:1 Torsen limited-slip differential. Dual JLT oil catch cans have been installed. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Legacy Ford Lincoln of La Grande, Oregon, and shows factory colors, equipment, and a total MSRP of $56,970. An owner’s supplement kit and service records will also accompany the car. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
