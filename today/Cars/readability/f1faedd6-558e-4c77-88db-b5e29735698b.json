  "text": "Apr 17, 2025 6:30 PM EDTThe next-generation Outback is here, and it follows the industry’s current love of right angles Subaru has been selling the Outback, which began life as an off-road-ready station wagon, for more than three decades. With each new generation, the would-be wagon sheds its skin and creeps just a little bit closer to being an SUV, and it appears that Subaru has had enough of the confusion. The just-released seventh-generation Outback pushes the nameplate unequivocally into SUV territory. For better or for worse, the 2026 Subaru Outback is the biggest and boxiest Outback yet. Outside, the 2026 Subaru Outback is a total square, but it’s got more hip room inside than predecessors, and real buttons We promise the Outback used to be a wagon, but you’d never know that by looking at the 2026 Subaru Outback. New split headlights, which oddly enough resemble those of the BMW X7, flank a larger and more rectangular grille than before. Gone are the rounded wheel arches; instead, they are replaced by squared-off flares that retain their black plastic look and scratch-resistant finish. The same material adorns the bottom of the front bumper, which should give a little bit of peace of mind to people who plan to leave the beaten path — something the Forester has always been pretty good at. The changes continue around back. The new Outback now has brake and tail lights stretching nearly the width of the rear hatch. The Subaru logo is proudly embossed on the black plastic lower half of the bumper, in line with the new “Outback” badging that runs prominently across the rear. Those behind you in traffic will always know what kind of vehicle you’re driving. The 2026 Subaru Outback also touts available 19-inch wheels, a first for the nameplate, but we’re interested in seeing what the adoption rate looks like, as they won’t be much help in off-roading scenarios. Of course, the truly off-road-oriented will opt for the Outback Wilderness with its 17-inch wheels and all-terrain tires. The Wilderness trim also features unique grille and lighting designs, along with a modest suspension lift, roof rails, and other added features. Subaru says the roofline is two inches taller than the previous Outback, contributing to more cargo space and a wider load floor. Wind noise — a complaint I had when I last reviewed the Outback — has been cut down by 10%. The new model, predictably, also has more headroom in the rear seats. In the front seats, a new 12.1-inch display and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster come standard. The biggest news? Subaru extracted the climate control functions to physical buttons, a welcome change that the brand says will make the climate system “easier to use in cold weather, even when wearing gloves.” We can’t disagree. The new look joins a familiar boxer-centric powertrain While big changes occur almost everywhere else in the 2026 Subaru Outback, underneath the sheet metal and scratch-resistant plastic beats a familiar heart. The 2026 Subaru Outback relies on your choice of either a 2.5-liter boxer with 180 horsepower or a turbocharged 2.4-liter boxer making 260 horsepower. Both engines are mated to a continuously variable automatic transmission, and the Outback only comes with all-wheel drive. Subaru says it has outfitted a tweaked version of the WRX’s steering rack, which it claims will result in more direct and responsive steering. Combined with the available 19-inch wheels, it might be the best Outback yet to hustle through the corners. Every Outback has 8.7 inches of ground clearance, the same as last year. Lastly, there are driver assistance features. While largely unchanged from last year’s model, the 2026 Subaru Outback does add new radar sensors for even more seamless integration. A new wide-angle camera and Emergency Stop Assist round out the existing suite of EyeSight Driver Assist Technology, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and blind-spot monitoring. Final thoughts The 2026 Subaru Outback is a logical evolution from the models preceding it, although it’s a little sad that one of the last remaining wagons has fully committed to SUV life. Most versions of the 2026 Subaru Outback will start showing up in dealerships in late 2025, with Wilderness models following early 2026. We look forward to putting the wagon — er, SUV—through its paces on and off the street.",
