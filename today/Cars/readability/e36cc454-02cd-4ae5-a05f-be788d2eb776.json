  "text": "Police seized $20 million worth of assets that were purchased using illegally obtained funds July 2, 2025 at 21:11 by Brad Anderson A man is accused of making false claims under Australia’s subsidized medication program. The charges leveled against the man carry a combined maximum prison sentence of 35 years. Cars seized included a BMW M3, a Lamborghini Aventador Ultimate, and a BMW 7-Series. Crime doesn’t pay – or so they say. Anyways, an Australian man recently got a stark reminder of that when authorities seized multiple exotics from his sprawling property in New South Wales. Among the high-end vehicles were a custom Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, a Ferrari 488 Pista, and a McLaren 765LT. Read: Aussie Police Seize Lamborghini From Local Claiming Unemployment Benefits The Australian Federal Police started to investigate the unnamed 58-year-old man in February 2023 after being tipped off to a pharmacist who was allegedly making false claims under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme between 2014 and 2023. In Australia, this program is used to subsidize prescription medication for citizens and visitors. $7 Million Fraud Investigation Authorities swooped on a property owned by the man in Dural, as well as a pharmacy in Cabramatta East. They suspect the value of his offending is estimated at more than AU$10 million (nearly US$7 million), and charged him with two counts of dealing with proceeds of crime worth AU$1 million (about $657,000) or more. He was also charged with two counts of dishonesty causing a loss to the Commonwealth. These charges carry a combined maximum prison sentence of 35 years if found guilty. Photos AFP A total of 12 vehicles were seized. These included seven BMWs, among them a matte black G80 M3 and a 7-Series. Also taken were a Ferrari 488 Pista, a Ferrari 488 GTB, a dark purple Lamborghini Aventador, and a black Lamborghini Aventador Ultimae. A black McLaren 765LT with red accents and MSO options was seized as well. In addition to the cars, police confiscated the man’s house, pharmacy, and several bank accounts. The total value of the seized assets exceeds AU$20 million (approximately $13.15 million). Asset Forfeiture Could Fund Law Enforcement Efforts If the prosecutors can prove their case, the man’s assets will be liquidated, and the proceeds will be placed in the Commonwealth Confiscated Assets Account, which can be reinvested to support crime prevention and law enforcement programs.
