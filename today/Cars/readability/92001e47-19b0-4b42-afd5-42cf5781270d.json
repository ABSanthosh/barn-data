  "text": "Officers tracked the group after a suspect allegedly stole a Rolls-Royce Spectre from a valet July 4, 2025 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers Plano police busted a group that allegedly stole $1.5 million worth of luxury cars. Recovered vehicles included Rolls-Royce, Audi, Maserati, and other high-end models. Security cameras captured the moment officers moved in for the dramatic bust. Stealing any car is a crime, but not all cases are the same. Boost a Honda Civic, and it might be relatively easy to fly under the radar. Steal a Rolls-Royce and it’ll get lots of attention, including from authorities. Nab several high-end cars, and the police will work very hard to bring such a thief to justice. That’s exactly what happened in Plano, Texas. Officers responded to a restaurant in early June after a call about a stolen Rolls-Royce. This wasn’t a 30-year-old car at the bottom of its depreciation curve either. It was a 2024 Spectre valued at nearly $500,000. Authorities say a person managed to get the keys from a valet station and drive off with the car. The entire incident brought more heat on the suspects. More: Clown Fish Orange M5 Shows Color Can Be A Criminal’s Biggest Mistake Police tracked the person who took the Spectre to another car, a 2025 Mercedes S63 AMG that they say was already on their radar for potentially being stolen. Less than a week later, and with the help of the FBI, Plano police raided two residences with warrants to search each. They found a Rolls-Royce Spectre, a Rolls-Royce Cullinan, a Cadillac Escalade-V, a Maserati Levante, and an Audi RS7. Combined, these vehicles are worth an estimated $1.5 million. In the process, police arrested three men: Miguel Hernandez, Salvador Hernandez, and Oscar Valdez Garcia. All three are charged with theft of over $300,000. Valdez Garcia had 15 active felony warrants, according to Fox 4 News. He’s also facing charges of evading arrest, aggravated assault, and burglary of a habitation. “It was a combination of good investigative work, good collaboration, putting all the pieces together from separate investigations from different agencies and actually recover the five vehicles and make an arrest all at the same time,” said Plano Police Department’s Public Information Officer Jerry Minton. A security camera at the home of the alleged thieves caught the moment when officers moved in. It shows the arrest of Salvador Hernandez with what almost looks like a military operation in the background. For now, it’s unclear what the suspects were planning to do with the cars but no doubt, officers will work to return them to their rightful owners.  Credit: Plano PD",
