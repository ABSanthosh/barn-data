  "description": "This 1966 Aston Martin DB6 is one of approximately 268 Mark I Vantage saloons built during four years of production and was completed on January 26, 1966, before being distributed in the US via British Motor Car Distributors. Finished in white over black leather, the car is powered by a 4.0-liter DOHC inline-six that breathes through triple Weber 45 DCOE carburetors and is mated to a ZF five-speed manual transmission. Additional features include a limited-slip differential, servo-assisted Girling disc brakes, 15” chrome wire wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt radio. Purchased by its current owner approximately six months ago, this DB6 Vantage is now offered on dealer consignment in Dripping Springs, Texas, with a copy of its build sheet, a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certificate, and a clean Arizona title that lists the car as a 1967 model.",

Finished in white over black leather, the car is powered by a 4.0-liter DOHC inline-six that breathes through triple Weber 45 DCOE carburetors and is mated to a ZF five-speed manual transmission. Additional features include a limited-slip differential, servo-assisted Girling disc brakes, 15” chrome wire wheels, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt radio. Purchased by its current owner approximately six months ago, this DB6 Vantage is now offered on dealer consignment in Dripping Springs, Texas, with a copy of its build sheet, a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certificate, and a clean Arizona title that lists the car as a 1967 model. Introduced in 1965 as a successor to the DB5, the DB6 featured a wheelbase 3.75” longer than its predecessor, while the previously utilized Superleggera construction technique gave way to a superstructure of folded steel box sections. Aluminum bodywork shared much of the DB5’s Touring design but incorporated a Kamm-tail rear profile, a higher roofline, an increased overall length, front quarter windows, and an oil-cooler air scoop with horizontal slats in the front valance. This example is finished in its original shade of Platinum, and closeups of the finish, trim, and lenses are provided in the photo gallery below. Exterior features include split front and rear bumpers with overrider bars, faired headlights, a low-profile hood scoop, fender vents, a fender-mounted antenna, and a driver-side mirror. Chrome wire wheels are secured by three-eared knocks-offs and are wrapped in 215/70R15 Pirelli P4000 tires. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted disc brakes all around, while steering is also power assisted. The left-hand-drive cabin is trimmed in black leather over 2+2 seating with matching upholstery over the door panels and color-keyed carpeting over the floors and center tunnel. Features include silver front shoulder belts, a lockable glovebox, air conditioning, power windows, a Blaupunkt push-button radio, and a fire extinguisher mounted along the passenger side of the console. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation including a 180-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and an ammeter. The five-digit odometer shows 59k miles, approximately 500 of which have been added under current ownership. Auxiliary instruments include a clock and gauges monitoring fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The 4.0-liter straight-six used in the DB6 was an evolution of the dual-overhead-camshaft engine design developed by Tadek Marek for the DB4 and incorporates an aluminum block and cylinder heads. The Vantage variant featured revised camshaft profiles, a higher 9.4:1 compression ratio, and triple Weber 45 DCOE carburetors for a factory rating of 325 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. Standard equipment for both standard and Vantage models included an oil cooler and an alternator. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a ZF five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Suspension incorporates a double-wishbone independent front setup and a solid-axle rear with parallel trailing links and a Watt’s linkage. The factory build sheet lists the original colors and equipment numbers as well as optional equipment including a Vantage engine, a 3.73:1 limited-slip differential, air conditioning, an engine breather system, chrome wheels with three-eared knock-offs, a heated rear window, Fiam horns, Britax shoulder belts, and a power antenna.
