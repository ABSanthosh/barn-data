It is finished in black over multi-tone leather upholstery and is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a seam-welded chassis, an aluminum hood, a speed-activated rear spoiler, magnesium 17″ Cup wheels, adjustable Bilstein coilovers, and fixed-back Recaro bucket seats. This 964 911 Carrera RS shows 47k kilometers (~29k miles) and is now offered in California with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The Carrera RS was reintroduced with the 964 chassis and featured a seam-welded bodyshell as well as an aluminum hood, rolled fenders, and thinner side and rear windows than those used on the standard Carrera. This example is finished in black (700) and was repainted some time ago. Features include faux fog lights, side marker lamps, dual side mirrors, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. Work under current ownership involved repairing a crack on the hood and repainting it along with refinishing the front and rear bumpers. A ceramic coating is also said to have been applied to the body. Photos taken of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery. Magnesium 17″ Cup wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires that are noted to have been installed in 2022. The Carrera RS features a lowered and stiffened suspension with adjustable Bilstein coilovers as well as adjustable front and rear sway bars. Stopping power is provided by an anti-lock system featuring four-piston calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The brake fluid was changed under current ownership. The cockpit features fixed-back Recaro bucket seats trimmed in black and gray multi-tone leather. Interior amenities include roll-up windows, door pull straps, blue seatbelts, and a heater. The car is not equipped with a head unit, and it was delivered from the factory without airbags, air conditioning, carpeting, or sound-deadening material. The leather-wrapped four-spoke steering wheel frames a central tachometer, a 300-km/h speedometer, a clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 47k kilometers (~29k miles), approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.6-liter M64/03 flat-six was equipped from the factory with a lightened flywheel and was rated at 260 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Additional features include a sport-tuned Bosch engine management system and a cooling fan driven by a single belt. An oil change was performed and the spark plugs, fuel filter, and air filter replaced under current ownership. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle that features steel synchronizers, closer ratios than the standard Carrera, and an asymmetrical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists one open recall. The car has not completed a California emissions test.
