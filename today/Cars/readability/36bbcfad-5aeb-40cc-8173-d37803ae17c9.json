  "text": "These are the two top dogs of the electric vehicle sedan world and now they're going racing October 17, 2024 at 20:15 by Stephen Rivers The Lucid Air Sapphire and Tesla Model S Plaid are two incredibly fast EV sedans. Now, the pair are going head-to-head in a U-Drag race. The results are as definitive as they get in this 2,254-horsepower battle. Drag races are great for seeing how fast a car can accelerate, but a U-drag race tests braking and cornering too. Now, Tesla and Lucid are going head to head with their most potent sedans ever. These are two dramatically different cars but each boasts a four-figure horsepower claim and the performance to back that up. Tesla’s Model S Plaid packs 1,020 horsepower (760 kW) and the example in this video has the optional $20,000 track pack that includes bigger brakes for better stopping power. The Lucid Air Sapphire comes standard with 1,234 horsepower (920 kW) and multiple track modes including drag strip, hot lap, and endurance. The Air also has some 400 lb-ft (541 Nm) of additional torque. More: Lucid Air Sapphire Makes A Dodge Demon 170 Look Slow In race one of this Edmunds U-Drag, we see the Lucid leverage every bit of its extra power and twist to get out to a lead early. In fact, it’s powerful enough that it keeps that lead all the way through the quarter of a mile and into the first turn. Despite having huge brakes, the Tesla can’t reel the Lucid in enough at the bend and the Air Sapphire takes off for the finish line with lots of room between the sedans. Race two plays out largely the same but with one key differentiator. The Tesla actually begins to reel in the Lucid on the back straight but isn’t quick enough to catch it before the end. Still, it’s an interesting result given that the Lucid has a top speed north of 200 mph (322 km/h). Don’t feel too bad if you’re a big Tesla fan though. This set of races set a new U-Drag record. In fact, the Lucid Air Sapphire is so quick at this test that it’s a full 1.7 seconds faster than the second-place car, a McLaren 765LT. For its part, the Tesla managed fourth overall, losing to both the 765LT and to a McLaren 750S with a best time of 29.8 seconds. Image Credit: Edmunds",
