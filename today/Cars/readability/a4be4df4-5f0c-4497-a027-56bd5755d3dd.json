Finished in Rosso Corsa with Nero lower body panels over Nero leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, fog lights, center-lock metric five-spoke wheels, a Pioneer cassette radio and graphic equalizer, air conditioning, and a gated shifter. The clutch, timing belts, and fuel pumps were replaced in 2020 and the car was sold on BaT in September 2023. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this 512 BBi shows 21k kilometers (~13k miles) and is offered at no reserve in California with a clean Carfax report and a clean Washington title. The Berlinetta Boxer model was styled by Pininfarina’s Leonardo Fioravanti and was introduced at the 1971 Turin Auto Show. The car features a steel-paneled cabin section paired with a tubular chassis. Aluminum is incorporated for the front and rear clamshells and door panels, while the lower panels are fiberglass. The 512 BBi variant was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1981. The cars were not officially offered in the US and were imported and federalized in-period via the gray market. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa with Nero lower panels and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, a front spoiler, NACA side ducts, and quad exhaust outlets. The seller states clear paint-protection film has been applied. Center-lock 415mm five-spoke wheels are mounted with 240/55 Michelin TRX tires produced in 2022. The 512 BBi features a fully independent suspension with unequal-length double wishbones, coilovers up front, a double coilover setup out back, and anti-roll bars fore and aft. Braking is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs, and the car is equipped with Koni shocks. The seats are upholstered in Nero leather and are accompanied by a color-coordinated center console and door panels. Additional appointments include air conditioning, a gated dogleg shifter, power windows, and a Pioneer cassette stereo and graphic equalizer. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges that extend to the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 21k kilometers (~13k miles). The 4.9-liter F110A flat-12 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection utilizing twin CIS fuel distributors and was factory rated at 340 horsepower. A timing-belt service was carried out in 2020, the water pump was rebuilt at that time, and the ignition box, fuel pumps, fuel filters, and fuel lines were replaced. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch was replaced during the 2020 timing-belt service.
