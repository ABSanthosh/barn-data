In addition to being the hot M Performance model, it’s dressed to impress in Frozen Black. It’s a pricey matte finish from the Individual catalog. The heavily darkened Shadowline headlights are standard on the iX M70.If you’re wondering about the two-tone wheels, the 1026 M set measures 22 inches. However, the iX M70 is also available with a smaller 21-inch set. For the first time, the electric SUV can be had with 23-inch alloys, a €1,100 Individual option in Germany, where the configurator is already up and running. The iX isn’t the company’s only model offered with 23-inch wheels from the factory. Other luxobarges, such as the X7 and XM, are also available with supersized alloys.2026 BMW iX M70 Frozen Black / https://www.instagram.com/tim1king/Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but we can all agree that the iX is far from the prettiest X model in BMW’s vast range. However, I do think this Life Cycle Impulse has improved the striking front fascia. I’m particularly talking about this iX M70, which has a more aggressive front grille. The kidneys now have a new horizontal pattern, in line with the company’s gasoline M Performance and M cars.The sporty version needed to stand out more from the lesser iX models. For the LCI, the front bumper is much more aggressive, featuring huge air intakes and a split theme akin to the new M5. We still very much prefer the look of a gasoline M Performance large SUV, such as an X5 M60i.Photos: tim1king / Instagram, Video: Tim King / YouTube",
