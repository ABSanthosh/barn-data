They sell a whopping three million units a year—which makes them the country’s third-largest marque—and they own Norton. Most notably, all of the motorcycles they produce have a capacity of 312.2 cc or less. Proving that small bikes are big fun, TVS makes models like the neo-retro TVS Ronin 225, the fully-faired TVS Apache RR 310, and the edgy TVS Apache RTR 310 naked. They also regularly work with custom workshops like Smoked Garage to show off the potential of their plucky street bikes. Based in Jakarta, Indonesia, Smoked recently buttoned up two custom TVS motorcycles—and we don’t know which one we love more. The first is based on the 225.9 cc TVS Ronin, while the second is based on the 312.2 cc TVS Apache RTR 310 [above]—which uses the same platform that the BMW G310R does. Smoked founder Nicko Eigert explains that the project’s goal was to show that the pint-sized TVS machines are well-made and ripe for customization. To drive the point home, Smoked picked contrasting styles for the two bikes. The Apache’s been turned into an angular street tracker, while the Ronin takes its cues from café racers and race bikes. Finished in silver and black with red accents, the TVS Apache RTR 310 has shed its bodywork for a full set of handmade aluminum parts. Smoked went all-out, fabricating a new headlight nacelle and fork shrouds for the front, along with a generous radiator cover that flows into an integrated belly pan. A new fuel tank sits up top, followed by a custom tailpiece that carries the geometric design through to the rear of the bike. It’s finished off with a neatly tailored split seat, sporting contrasting stitching. The Apache retains its OEM wheels, swingarm, and front suspension, but the wheels are now enclosed in custom-made covers. The rear suspension was upgraded and lowered, and the foot controls were swapped out for new units that are set further back. Moving to the cockpit, Smoked added lower handlebars with bright red grips, bar-end turn signals, new levers, and micro switches. The head- and taillights are custom parts, made using LEDs and acrylic covers. Flanking the finned taillight are two handmade exhaust mufflers. Tipped with red paint, they’re so well integrated into the design that we had to do a double-take. If the Apache’s stock design is a little too street racer for you, this neo-futuristic take on the zesty little 310 might be just the ticket. Compact and aggressive, it has the attitude of bikes more than twice its size (and price). Smoked Garage had an entirely different vibe in mind for the Ronin [above]. The black and yellow livery stands out—but so does the judicious blend of vintage and futuristic café racer details. The Ronin needed more changes to its rolling chassis than the Apache did—but only because Smoked wanted to set it low and long. The swingarm was generously extended, and the rear wheel was swapped for a 17” unit that could accommodate wider rubber. At the opposite end of the bike, the crew lowered the OEM front fork to perfect the stance. The Ronin benefits from a braking upgrade too, as well as an adjustable rear shock. The shock spring hides behind bespoke side covers—but look closely, and you’ll notice cutouts with measurement markings that assist in setting the rear suspension sag. Like its stablemate, the custom Apache wears all-new handmade aluminum bodywork. The set includes a full fairing, and a stretched fuel tank that’s reminiscent of vintage race bikes. A tapered shroud caps off the tail. The front of the fairing features a conical headlight housing with a deeply recessed LED projector. The housing is drilled around the actual headlight, providing much-needed airflow to the bike’s oil cooler. Behind the fairing, you’ll find a set of clip-on bars, new switches, and the remounted stock dash. Lower down, Smoked pushed the foot controls way back by fabricating a set of trellised rear-set mounts that are more than half the length of the swingarm. Finishing touches include a split seat, wheel covers, and a one-off taillight. Minimalist yellow graphics adorn the Ronin’s black fairing, matched to the bright yellow tank and seat. The Ronin once again demonstrates Smoked’s sharp eye and deft hand—particularly when you consider details like the neatly integrated stubby exhaust muffler. Even though this TVS Apache RTR 310 and TVS Ronin 225 walk totally different paths, they show equal amounts of imagination and craftsmanship. The only question is, which one do we like more?

The black and yellow livery stands out—but so does the judicious blend of vintage and futuristic café racer details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ronin needed more changes to its rolling chassis than the Apache did—but only because Smoked wanted to set it low and long. The swingarm was generously extended, and the rear wheel was swapped for a 17” unit that could accommodate wider rubber. At the opposite end of the bike, the crew lowered the OEM front fork to perfect the stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Custom TVS Ronin 225 by Smoked Garage\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-3.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe Ronin benefits from a braking upgrade too, as well as an adjustable rear shock.

Lower down, Smoked pushed the foot controls way back by fabricating a set of trellised rear-set mounts that are more than half the length of the swingarm. Finishing touches include a split seat, wheel covers, and a one-off taillight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-745x745.jpg\" alt=\"Custom TVS Ronin 225 by Smoked Garage\" width=\"745\" height=\"745\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-745x745.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-420x420.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-768x768.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-380x380.jpg 380w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-90x90.jpg 90w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-1200x1200.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-360x360.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-720x720.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-275x275.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11-150x150.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/custom-tvs-motorcycles-smoked-11.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nMinimalist yellow graphics adorn the Ronin’s black fairing, matched to the bright yellow tank and seat.
