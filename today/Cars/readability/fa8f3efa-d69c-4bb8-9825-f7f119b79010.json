Work completed in 2024 involved replacing the ignition coils, tires, front wheel bearings, and front hubs. This 997.2 C2S cabriolet has 124k miles and is now offered by the selling dealer with owner’s literature, a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Missouri title. The car is finished in Midnight Blue Metallic and features a Metropol Blue power-operated soft top. Exterior details include a speed-activated rear spoiler, bi-xenon headlights with dynamic cornering, integrated fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and quad exhaust outlets. The front bumper cover was repainted and the convertible top clamshell was repaired under current ownership. The 19” Carrera S II wheels were mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport N2 tires in May 2024, and the front wheel bearings and hubs were replaced at that time. Braking is handled by red multi-piston Porsche-branded brake calipers fitted over cross-drilled and vented rotors at all four corners. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) as well as Porsche Stability Management (PSM), an active brake differential (ABD), and Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR). The cabin features heated and ventilated front seats upholstered in Stone Gray leather. Features include a CD stereo, automatic climate control, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, driver’s position memory, Bose audio, and cruise control. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer and a 200-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 124k miles. The 3.8-liter 9A1 flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam Plus variable valve timing, and a factory-rated output of 385 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The ignition coils were replaced in September 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage.
