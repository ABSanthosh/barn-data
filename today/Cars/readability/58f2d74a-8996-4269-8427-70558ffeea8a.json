  "description": "Mere days after Ducati revealed its new 890cc, 90-degree, V-twin engine, it has now revealed the first new models it has plonked it into - the all-new Panigale V2 and Streetfighter V2. The 890cc motor is rated for the same 120hp and 93.3Nm of torque on both the 2025 Panigale V2 and Streetfighter V2. Both bikes available with a higher-spec S variant Full suite of electronic rider aids on both Both models lighter than outgoing 955cc quivalents Ducati Panigale V2, Streetfighter V2: Step down from the Superquadro? The outgoing 955cc Superquadro engine makes over 150hp so on paper, this new 890cc engine with just 120hp might feel like a step down. But where Ducati has really focused on with these models (and this engine as well) is in making them lightweight. The Panigale V2 S weighs 176kg, while the Streetfighter V2 S is a kilo lighter, at 175kg. This marks a big step down from the near 200-kilo kerb weights their outgoing equivalents were approaching.  An aluminium monocoque frame is on both bikes with a conventional double-sided swingarm on offer, unlike the Ducati staple single-sided unit seen on the Superquadro-powered Panigale and Streetfighter models.    Both bikes have 15 litre fuel tanks and rather tall seat heights. The Panigale V2 has an 837mm perch, while the Streetfighter V2 is marginally taller, at 838mm. With the move to the new 890cc motor, Ducati has gone back to a twin-exit underseat exhaust muffler design, similar to some of its erstwhile models. As is the case with most Ducatis, there are two variants on offer - standard and S. The standard bike is suspended by a Marzocchi fork and KYB monoshock (both fully adjustable), while the S variant gets Ohlins componentry at both ends. The S variant comes standard with a single-seat configuration and the base variant is the only one to come with provisions to carry a passenger. The base variant of both bikes is also 3 kilos heavier than the S variant.  Pirelli supplies the rubber on both bikes, with Diablo Rosso 4 tyres being offered in 120/70-ZR17 (front) and 190/55-ZR17 (rear) sizes. Brembo’s M50 monobloc calipers are on stopping duty here and are mated to 320mm discs.  As is expected of a modern sporty middleweight machine, both the Panigale and Streetfighter V2 come with a full set of electronic nannies such as riding modes, traction control, ABS, wheelie control, engine brake control and a bidirectional quickshifter. Then you can optionally purchase some sort of a tech pack to unlock cruise control, lap timer, turn-by-turn navigation and heated grips on both bikes. All this information is controlled via a 5-inch TFT dash. We expect both of these bikes to come to India sometime next year. Interestingly, this is one of those few times in motorcycling when the successor to a bike is a less powerful and more manageable model. It would not be inaccurate to say that the 2025 Panigale V2 and Streetfighter V2 are expected to be priced lower than the outgoing versions. For reference, the standard variants of the Streetfighter V2 and Panigale V2 are priced at Rs 18.50 lakh and Rs 20.98 lakh, respectively. With this shift to a new 890cc V-twin, the Ducati V2 models are now direct rivals to the likes of the Yamaha 890cc triple-cylinder models (R9, MT-09) as well as KTM’s 990cc parallel-twin bikes (990 Duke, 990 RC R).
