  "text": "Lawsuit claims Nissan knowingly concealed defective door lock actuators across multiple model years 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Plaintiff says she wouldn’t have purchased her Rogue if informed of the potential defect. Nissan recalled defective door lock actuators in July 2015 affecting limited model years. Many customers have reported being locked out due to malfunctioning door lock actuators. It’s not every day a car company gets hit with a lawsuit for allegedly selling vehicles that might fling their doors open mid-drive, but that’s exactly what Nissan is facing. The automaker is now the subject of a class action suit in California, accused of hiding a known defect in its door lock actuators, components that, when they fail, can pose serious risks to both drivers and passengers. The lawsuit targets several popular models, including the 2013–2025 Altima, 2014–2025 Rogue, and 2013–2025 Sentra. According to the complaint, the defect can cause doors to unexpectedly open while the car is in motion or, in some cases, prevent them from opening at all. Read: Nissan Rogue Owners Sue Over Smelly Gas Fumes Entering Cabin At the center of the suit is Deena Khalifa, who purchased a 2020 Nissan Rogue on March 13, 2020, from a dealership in California. She does not claim to have been impacted by a faulty door lock actuator, but has taken issue with Nissan not informing her of the problem before she purchased her new SUV. Had she known about the potential defect, she claims, she wouldn’t have bought the SUV in the first place. Several customer complaints have been filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) alleging faulty door lock actuators in Altima, Rogue, and Sentra models. In one case, the owner of a 2018 Rogue says that while fleeing from a “strange acting man” following her through a parking lot, she was unable to get inside her SUV because the door lock actuator failed. In another case, the owner of a 2019 Rogue says all four door locks on her vehicle failed while her 5-month-old was stuck inside, forcing her to break one of the side windows. Nissan has known about door lock actuator problems, issuing a recall for 2015 Sentra, Versa Note, and Rogue models in July 2015, due to faults with the driver-side door locks. The recall was limited to 6,595 vehicles. The class action notes that in addition to doors possibly flying open while the car is in motion, they can spontaneously lock or unlock, and some owners have reported being trapped inside their vehicles. In some other reports, the automatic doors have reportedly malfunctioned at the same time as the door locking mechanism. Khalifa alleges that Nissan is guilty of violations of California’s Consumers Legal Remedies Act and Unfair Competition Law, as well as unjust enrichment. She is seeking a jury trial.",
