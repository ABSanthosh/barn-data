  "description": "These three cars all earned a full five star score on our road test in the past year - we took them to a racetrack to find out why What do the Lamborghini Revuelto, McLaren Artura and Porsche 911 S/T all have in common? They're all winners at the Autocar Awards 2025. And all for different reasons. Recently we named the McLaren Artura as our winner in the Britain's Best Driver's Car shootout. The Porsche 911 S/T scored a rare and coveted Five Stars in its Autocar Road Test. And the extraordinary 1001bhp Lamborghini Revuelto was named our Dream Car. Now they're together on track. Not for a conventional group test - these cars are here to be celebrated, not compared - but join Matt Prior in the video above as he takes them out on circuit to get under their skin and find out why they're all Autocar Awards winners.
