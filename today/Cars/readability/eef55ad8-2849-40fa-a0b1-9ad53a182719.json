  "description": "This 1977 Lotus Esprit S1 is one of an estimated 718 examples produced between 1976 and 1978 and was sold new on May 8, 1978, from Lotus Mid America in Des Moines, Iowa. The original owner sold the car as a non-running project on BaT in September 2017, and it then underwent a $105k mechanical freshening that was completed by Benchmark Motor Studio of Covington, Louisiana, before being purchased by the current owner in 2019. It was subsequently displayed at the LeMay – America’s Car Museum of Tacoma, Washington, in 2019 and 2020. Work had included rebuilding the mid-mounted 1,973cc inline-four and five-speed manual transaxle in addition to suspension, brake, and ignition system overhauls. The car is finished in Oxford Blue over beige cloth, and equipment includes pop-up headlights, integrated driving lights, a clamshell hood, a rear hatch, 14\" GKN Wolfrace wheels, PerTronix electronic ignition, four-wheel disc brakes, an independent suspension, twin single-piece bucket seats, power windows, an AM/FM/cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This Esprit S1 is now offered in Berkeley, California, on dealer consignment with a Lotus Certificate of Vehicle Provenance, service records, a car cover, a tool kit, and a Washington title that lists the car as a 1978 model.",

  "text": "This 1977 Lotus Esprit S1 is one of an estimated 718 examples produced between 1976 and 1978 and was sold new on May 8, 1978, from Lotus Mid America in Des Moines, Iowa. The original owner sold the car as a non-running project on BaT in September 2017, and it then underwent a $105k mechanical freshening that was completed by Benchmark Motor Studio of Covington, Louisiana, before being purchased by the current owner in 2019. It was subsequently displayed at the LeMay – America’s Car Museum of Tacoma, Washington, in 2019 and 2020. Work had included rebuilding the mid-mounted 1,973cc inline-four and five-speed manual transaxle in addition to suspension, brake, and ignition system overhauls. The car is finished in Oxford Blue over beige cloth, and equipment includes pop-up headlights, integrated driving lights, a clamshell hood, a rear hatch, 14″ GKN Wolfrace wheels, PerTronix electronic ignition, four-wheel disc brakes, an independent suspension, twin single-piece bucket seats, power windows, an AM/FM/cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This Esprit S1 is now offered in Berkeley, California, on dealer consignment with a Lotus Certificate of Vehicle Provenance, service records, a car cover, a tool kit, and a Washington title that lists the car as a 1978 model. The wedge-shaped fiberglass body was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and is mounted to a steel backbone chassis. This example is the 14th of 36 Series 1 Esprits delivered in the US in Oxford Blue (A01, L32), and exterior equipment includes pop-up headlights, integrated driving lights, a clamshell hood, replacement bumpers, a rear hatch, dual fuel-filler caps, and a single pantograph windshield wiper. The 14″ GKN Wolfrace wheels were refinished as part of the refurbishment and are wrapped in staggered Hankook Optimo tires. A spare wheel and tire are stowed in the front trunk. The four-wheel disc brakes received new rotors, pads, a master cylinder, and hard and soft brake lines during the project, while the hardware was refinished and the calipers and parking brake system were rebuilt. The brake master cylinder was rebuilt in 2024. Suspension work performed between 2017 and 2019 included replacing the shocks, bushings, upper and lower front ball joints, tie rod ends, and wheel bearings. The suspension arms were refinished along with the rear hubs. The steering rack was also rebuilt. The cabin houses twin single-piece bucket seats trimmed in beige cloth, and darker cloth lines the center tunnel and door panels, where it is torn on the armrests. Interior equipment includes a center console and fixed center armrest, a digital clock, a wooden shift knob, power windows, an AM/FM/cassette stereo, and air conditioning. The two-spoke steering wheel frames green-dial Veglia instrumentation consisting of a 160-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, fuel level, and voltage. The five-digit odometer shows 19k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted twin-cam 1,973cc Lotus 907 inline-four was factory rated at 140 horsepower and 130 lb-ft of torque and was rebuilt by Benchmark Motor Studio with new main and rod bearings, connecting rod bearings, valve guides, valve seats, and piston rings. The crankshaft was also polished, and the cylinders were honed. Various gaskets and seals were also replaced, and the distributor, alternator, radiator, and dual carburetors were rebuilt. The ignition system was updated with a PerTronix electronic system in 2019. Work in 2024 reportedly included replacing the timing belt, water pump, fuel filter, engine oil, and coolant. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle that was rebuilt as part of the mechanical refurbishment. The clutch hydraulics were also rebuilt, with the slave cylinder replaced in 2024. The clutch disc, pressure plate, and release bearing were replaced at the time of the gearbox rebuild. The project also included replacing sound-deadening material and refinishing the backbone chassis in black. The Lotus Certificate of Vehicle Provenance shows a September 1977 build date, the original colors, and production statistics. The Washington title is listed as a duplicate and lists an Antique brand. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
