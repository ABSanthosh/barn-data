  "description": "Mercedes-Benz has revealed the ‘G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s’, a limited-run version of the off-roader that serves as a throwback to the 1979 original. To that end, the new G-Class special edition gets a bevy of vintage-inspired styling flourishes inside and out, new paint finishes, an expanded features list, and more. G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s gets two new colours and classic-style exterior fitments Inside, it has bespoke lettering, Dove Grey upholstery for the seats, and more It can be had with either petrol or diesel straight-6 engine and 9-speed auto gearbox Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s exterior design Night Black accents and two classic-style colours Most of the design elements of the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s have been carried over from the one-off anniversary edition of the G-Class that celebrated 5,00,000 units produced. Up front, notable changes include orange indicators (the standard model has darkened/clear units), a classic Mercedes-Benz emblem on the bonnet, headlight cages, and a blacked-out finish for the fascia and bumper. Over to the side, the SUV gets new 5-spoke silver alloy wheels, and the B-pillar sports a 1980s-style ‘Schöckl Proved’ badge. All G-Class vehicles since 1979 get the Schöckl Proved badge to signify that they have passed rigorous testing on the Schöckl mountain in Austria. There’s also a large roof rack on top. At the rear, the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s prominently features classic-style Mercedes-Benz lettering on the tailgate, an exclusive soft cover for the spare wheel and a ladder. Much like the original, the special edition G-Class can be had with either an Agave Green or a Colorado Beige paint finish to contrast the Night Black Magno accents sprinkled across the bodywork. Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s interior and features Dove Grey cloth upholstery and exclusive lettering The G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s has an all-black cabin, and the centre portions of the seats have chequered cloth upholstery finished in Dove Grey fabric, which was highly popular then. The large grab handle for the front passenger has “Stronger than the 1980s” embossed on it, and the centre console has “1 of 460” lettering right behind the trackpad, referring to the model’s exclusivity. The list of features comprises a duo of 12.3-inch screens for the infotainment system and instrument cluster, a sunroof, a Burmester 3D surround sound system, and more. Interestingly, the puddle lights in the rearview mirrors project “Stronger than Time” onto the ground upon opening either of the front doors. Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s powertrain and performance Available in petrol and diesel guises; no AMG version Under the hood, the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s is the same as the G450d and G500 models sold in overseas markets, both of which are powered by mild-hybrid straight-6 engines mated to 9-speed automatic transmissions: the G450d has a 2.9-litre turbo-diesel mill developing 367hp and 750Nm, and the G500 gets a 3.0-litre turbo-petrol unit good for 449hp and 560Nm. The 1980s-inspired edition cannot be had in the range-topping V8-powered Mercedes-AMG G 63. The G450d can dispatch the 0-100kph run in 5.8 seconds, while the G500 is slightly faster at 5.4 seconds. Top speed is limited to 210kph for both models. Mercedes G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s launch details Bookings open in global markets Mercedes-Benz will build only 460 units of the G-Class Stronger Than the 1980s edition, with order books now open in international markets. It is currently unconfirmed if any of those units will make it to India.
