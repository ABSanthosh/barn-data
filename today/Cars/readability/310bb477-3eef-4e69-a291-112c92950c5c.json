On a road trip, though, they’re also a convenient place to stretch your legs, go to the bathroom, regret attempting to drive so far in one day, refill your cooler with drinks and grab some snacks. In fact, if you’re brave enough, you can even get an actual meal at a gas station now. The question is, which ones are worth eating at, and which ones do you need to be wary of?Suggested Reading2025 Bentley Continental GT Speed Is Out Of This World GoodOffEnglishSuggested ReadingThankfully, Food Theory’s Santi recently moved from Los Angeles to Miami and decided to road trip instead of flying. While it still remains to be seen whether or not he’ll survive his first Florida summer, driving across the country did give him the opportunity to stop at a long list of gas stations. Since he hosts a food channel on YouTube, of course he was going to compare the food they sell at different gas stations. You probably don’t have every single one on this list in your immediate area, and there are several notable gas stations missing that should have been included. How can you drive from LA to Miami without including QT, RaceTrac or 7-Eleven but somehow have time to swing by Sheetz? There are plenty of Wawas in Florida, but unless Google is lying to me, Sheetz doesn’t have a location any further south than North Carolina. So he went way out of his way to eat at Sheetz but somehow missed every single QT? Unfortunately for Sheetz fans, even though Wawa was slower and more expensive, its higher quality blew Sheetz out of the water. Buc-ee’s, of course, nailed it, although, if you’re looking for coffee, it sounds like you’re better off stopping at Love’s or Circle K. In fact, if you’re driving past a Love’s and need gas, you really should consider stopping. It really is doing its best to become the perfect road trip stop, even for EV owners.",
