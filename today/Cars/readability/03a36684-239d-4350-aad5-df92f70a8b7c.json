  "description": "This 1971 Porsche 911T coupe was acquired by the current owner approximately two decades ago and was the subject of a multi-year, RSR-style build at Kostopoulos AutoSport of Port Richey, Florida, that was completed in 2016. The car features widened composite bodywork along with a carbon fiber hood finished in Viper Green with black Carrera stripe graphics. Power comes from a 2.7-liter flat-six with a magnesium case, a carbon-fiber fan shroud, twin-plug cylinder heads, and GE40 camshafts. The engine is linked with a five-speed manual transaxle, and chassis modifications include Weltmeister steering and suspension components as well as Koni shocks, billet front camber plates, spherical bushings, and Sway-Away hollow torsion bars. Custom interior appointments include black leather fixed-back bucket seats, a roll bar, air conditioning, a Weltmeister shifter, Rennline footboards, a Zuffenhaus steering wheel, and RundenMeister stopwatches. An MSD rev limiter, PerTronix electronic ignition, an ATL fuel cell, a ceramic-coated exhaust, and Fuchs-style 17” wheels are other highlights. This modified 911T is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a clean Florida title.",

The car features widened composite bodywork along with a carbon fiber hood finished in Viper Green with black Carrera stripe graphics.

The engine is linked with a five-speed manual transaxle, and chassis modifications include Weltmeister steering and suspension components as well as Koni shocks, billet front camber plates, spherical bushings, and Sway-Away hollow torsion bars. Custom interior appointments include black leather fixed-back bucket seats, a roll bar, air conditioning, a Weltmeister shifter, Rennline footboards, a Zuffenhaus steering wheel, and RundenMeister stopwatches. An MSD rev limiter, PerTronix electronic ignition, an ATL fuel cell, a ceramic-coated exhaust, and Fuchs-style 17” wheels are other highlights. This modified 911T is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a clean Florida title. The body was modified with a carbon-fiber hood in addition to a composite decklid, front and rear bumpers, fenders, and flared quarter panels produced by CCP Fabrication of Port Richey, Florida, before the car was repainted in Viper Green with black RSR-style Carrera graphics. Weatherstripping and seals were also replaced, and H4 headlights, European-specification turn signals, and reproduction Cibié driving lamps were added. Further details include a ducktail spoiler, a central fuel filler, rubber hood and decklid latches, and dual exhaust outlets. Fuchs-style 17” wheels are wrapped in 245/45 front and 315/35 rear Nitto NT555 G2 tires that were mounted in March 2023. Suspension components installed at Kostopoulos AutoSport include Koni shocks, billet front camber plates, gusseted upper-rear shock mounts, spherical bushings, and Sway-A-Way hollow torsion bars as well as a Weltmeister bump steer kit, adjustable rear spring plates, swing arm bushings, and sway bars. The four-wheel disc brakes feature four-piston front calipers, Brembo rear calipers, stainless-steel-braided hoses, and drilled rotors all around. The fixed-back bucket seats and custom door panels were upholstered in black leather at Southern Threads in Port Richey, Florida. The radio, clock, heater, sun visors, and rear jump seats were removed, and a four-point roll bar was added along with a dash cap, a Weltmeister shifter, an aluminum throttle pedal, a perforated dead pedal, and Rennline footboards. Three RundenMeister stopwatches are mounted in the center of the dash, and additional appointments include a retro-style air conditioning system, a battery cutoff switch, Repa harnesses, and red fabric door pulls. The Zuffenhaus leather-wrapped steering wheel features an RS-style horn button. VDO instruments were refurbished by Palo Alto Speedometer and include a central 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by a 300-km/h speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 2,600 kilometers (~1,600 miles), which is said to represent the distance added since the build was completed. An ATL fuel cell is mounted in the front trunk, and a Weltmeister strut tower brace has been installed. The 2.7-liter flat-six was rebuilt and modified before being installed in 2014. The magnesium case was fitted with thread inserts and ARP cylinder head studs at JB Racing in Tavares, Florida. The twin-plug cylinder heads were ported and polished by Scotty’s Racing Engines in Shady Hills, Florida, and stainless-steel valves were installed. The engine was assembled at Kostopoulos AutoSport utilizing RS-specification pistons, GE40 camshafts, and a replacement timing set. The engine tins were powder-coated, and a carbon-fiber fan shroud was added along with a Mazda-sourced oil cooler, an MSD rev limiter, a PerTronix electronic ignition conversion kit, and a ceramic-coated exhaust system with removable baffles. Photos taken during the engine rebuild are presented in the gallery along with service and parts invoices. The five-speed manual transaxle is equipped with a magnesium case and was rebuilt at Extreme Euro of Hudson, Florida. The clutch assembly was also replaced at that time.
