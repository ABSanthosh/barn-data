  "text": "If I put a photo of the wagon in this post, can I manifest BMW offering the next-gen wagon to the U.S.?Photo: BMWWhile the size of a crossover makes it a great starting point for an electric vehicle, and the shape of a sedan slips easily through the air for better range, electric sports cars are a much scarier proposition. Hyundai proved it’s possible to make an EV a blast to drive with the Ioniq 5 N, but batteries are heavy, and weight is often the enemy of fun. So it’s understandable that BMW M3 owners might be worried the next-generation sport sedan would be electric-only. As BimmerToday reports, though, the gas-powered M3 isn’t going anywhere just yet.Suggested ReadingBMW F 900 GS And BMW CE 02: What Do You Want To Know?OffEnglishSuggested ReadingIt won’t be a new engine, either. Instead, BMW M division head Frank van Meel told BimmerToday that the next gas-powered M3 will use an updated version of the S58 inline-six found in the current M3 that meets the upcoming stricter Euro 7 emissions requirements. So, presumably, you’ll be able to buy an M3 with an engine (and hopefully a manual transmission) for years to come. While van Meel didn’t share any power figures, it’s also hard to imagine you’ll get less than the 473 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque the current M3 offers.That said, this news isn’t necessarily all sunshine and rainbows. We know BMW plans to keep the internal combustion engine around, but what we don’t know is whether or not it will be a hybrid. Considering the direction BMW chose to go with the new M5, we wouldn’t be surprised if the new M3 shows up with a hybrid powertrain. On paper, that shouldn’t be a problem. Hybrid systems have been around for ages, and pretty much everyone is electrifying their vehicles these days. Where it becomes a problem is that, when BMW redesigned the M5, it gained about 1,000 pounds compared to the previous generation. If the new gas-powered M3 gets the same treatment, we could be looking at a 4,800-pound M3. That’s about what the Ioniq 5 N weighs, so it’s not like you can’t have a blast driving a car that heavy, but the current Ioniq 5 N also didn’t replace a previous-generation version that was 1,000 pounds lighter and decades of history behind the name. There’s also no guarantee that BMW will add that much weight to the next M3, so we don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves. Just, you know, don’t throw too big of a celebration just yet. Let’s at least wait until the new M3s are officially announced before we decide the nameplate’s been ruined.",
