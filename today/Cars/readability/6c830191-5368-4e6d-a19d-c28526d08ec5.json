  "text": "The gorgeous Viper Red paint makes this iconic Dodge all the more desirable 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The massive 8.3-liter V10 of the Viper delivers 500 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent through a six-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels. This Dodge has only ever been driven about 18,000 miles (~29,000 km). America still builds some extraordinarily exciting performance cars, none more so than the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Mustang. Yet, the landscape isn’t what it used to be. Gone are the glory days of the early 2000s when options were more plentiful, and the Dodge Viper stood tall among the greats. Dodge built the Viper for 26 years, starting in 1991, but it was sadly axed in 2017. Fortunately, it’s still possible to find well-maintained Vipers on the used car market, and this 2003 SRT-10 Roadster is one of the nicest we’ve seen. It’s currently listed up for auction with no reserve and has only been driven around 18,000 miles (~29,000 km). Watch: Dodge Viper Smashes Into SUV After Goaded By Peanut Gallery It’s draped in a classic shade of Viper Red and sports a black soft top. Despite being a 2003 model, it looks to be in excellent condition and retains the original polished 18-inch front and 19-inch rear wheels, wrapped in 275/35 front and 345/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The beating heart of the 2003 Viper SRT-10 is an 8.3-liter naturally-aspirated V10 pumping out 500 hp and 525 lb-ft (712 Nm) of torque. This engine is mated to a Tremec six-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels through a limited-slip differential. We can only begin to imagine how phenomenal this thing must be to row through the gears with the roof down and that huge-capacity V10 roaring. Yes, there are still some exciting naturally-aspirated engines on the market, but they’re becoming less common and aren’t quite as ridiculous as the Viper’s powertrain. While we think the exterior design of the Viper has aged quite gracefully over the decades, the interior does show its age. Fortunately, there are enough creature comforts, including air conditioning and a six-disc CD changer. According to the Bring a Trailer listing, the Viper comes with all the essentials: the original window sticker, owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report showing no accidents, and a clean New Jersey title. If you’re looking to snag a piece of American automotive history, you’ll want to check out the listing before the auction wraps up next week.",
