  "description": "After months of rumours and whispers in the motorcycling community, Yamaha has finally taken the covers off the R9 supersport. The new Yamaha R9 is essentially a sportbike that utilises the MT-09’s feisty triple-cylinder motor and (sort of) replaces the R6 in the line-up.  Same engine as MT-09, makes 119hp and 93Nm of torque New frame, fully adjustable suspension and Brembo brakes Full suite of electronics controlled via 5-inch TFT dash Powering the Yamaha R9 is the much-loved 890cc, 3-cyl motor that makes the same 119hp and 93Nm of torque as its naked counterpart. This engine is largely unchanged, and the only noteworthy difference is in the final drive gearing. That’s where the similarities between the MT-09 and the R9 end, at least from a mechanical standpoint. Housing this engine is a brand-new aluminium Deltabox frame, which weighs just 9.7kg and is claimed by Yamaha to be the lightest on any of its supersport models. Suspension duties are handled by a 43mm KYB USD fork and monoshock (with a handy remote preload adjuster), both of which are fully adjustable and were developed side-by-side with the 2025 R1, claims the Iwata-based company. Braking is handled by a radial Brembo master cylinder and twin Stylema calipers, mated to 320mm front discs and a single-piston caliper paired to a 220mm rear disc.    The R9 uses a 14-litre fuel tank (the same capacity as the MT-09), and when filled up to the brim, it weighs 195kg. This makes it just 2kg heavier than the standard MT-09. As is the case with most supersport bikes today, Yamaha has given the R9 winglets, which do help with downforce at high speeds, but the company hasn’t released any concrete numbers for the same. In typical supersport fashion, the R9 has an aggressive seating position, with a tall seat and clip-ons placed below the top yoke.  Dual-channel ABS is standard, as is a laundry list of other electronic aids. To list them all, the Yamaha R9 has three preset riding modes – Sport, Street, and Rain – accompanied by two fully customisable modes and four Track modes. A six-axis IMU enables cornering functionality for traction control, ABS, slide control, and brake control. Furthermore, it includes lift control, power modes, engine braking modes, and back slip regulator. A bidirectional quickshifter and cruise control are also part of the electronic aids.    All the functions and features of the Yamaha R9 are controlled via a 5-inch colour TFT dash. The display can be connected to a smartphone via Yamaha's MyRide app, allowing the display of phone calls, messages, and other information on the dash. The R9 can be had in three colours – blue, black, and red/white.  Currently, the R9 is offered in only one variant, but it's not out of the realm of possibility that a higher-spec M or SP variant could debut down the line. Yamaha also equipped its Y-AMT gearbox on the MT-09 so that there is a possibility for the R9. Yamaha India has been saying for a long time now that some of its big bikes will come to our country soon, but as of now, nothing has materialised. It remains to be seen if and when the R9 will come here.  Also See: Yamaha MT-09 review: Standard, SP, Y-AMT ridden",
