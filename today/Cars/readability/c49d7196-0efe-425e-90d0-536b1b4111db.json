  "text": "We're testing the updated version of Rivian's flagship SUV across the state of New York and taking your questions January 11, 2025 at 19:19 by Stephen Rivers Rivian R1S offers dual, tri, or quad motor setups with prices starting at $75,900. Our test model has 665 horsepower, a 0-60 time of 3.4 seconds, and 22-inch wheels. Total cost of this Rivian R1S with options is $98,950 including destination charges. The 2025 Rivian R1S is a large electric SUV aimed at doing just about everything well. It’s meant to be spacious, good off-road, and wildly capable on pavement too. And for the first time, we’ve got one in our hands. Over the next few days, we’ll be putting it to the test across New York state, from the chaos of NYC traffic to the winding, snowy roads upstate. Got questions? Let us know, and we’ll report back with answers. Rivian offers the R1S in several configurations, each catering to a different flavor of SUV performance. You can go for a dual-motor setup (one motor per axle), step up to a tri-motor (two motors at the rear, one in the front), or go all-in with a quad-motor system (a motor for each wheel for maximum control). Prices start at $75,900, but can easily tip past six figures depending on how many boxes you tick on the options sheet.

It’s a family-friendly SUV that can outrun some sports cars – just what every suburban parent needs, right? Let’s break down the options on our tester. First, the Max battery pack adds $14,000 for those extra miles. The El Cap Granite paint on the exterior is another $2,500 and the 22-inch wheels we have tack on an additional $1,000 to the final price. The cabin features what Rivian calls an “Ocean Coast with Dark Ash” color pallet for $2,000. The brand also added its own premium audio option to this car for another $1,750. In total, this same SUV would cost you $98,950, including a destination fee of $1,800. But here’s one perk: Rivian sells direct to customers, so there’s no need to worry about dealer markups, as what you see is what you pay, whether you’re in New York or anywhere else in the USA. From Urban Chaos to Upstate Adventures Over the next few days, we’ll be treating this R1S like it’s our daily driver, pushing it to do all the things SUVs are supposedly built for. On top of that, we’ll be testing it with a party of five and all of their luggage, navigating tight city streets, and heading into the countryside to see how it handles less forgiving terrain. The goal? To figure out if the R1S can really deliver on its promise of being the ultimate do-it-all SUV. Can it thrive as both a luxury commuter and a rugged adventurer? Does it justify its near-six-figure price tag? And, perhaps most importantly, how will those 22-inch wheels look when caked in mud? If there’s something specific you’re curious about, be it the ride quality, the tech, or just how bad the range drops when you’re flooring it on the highway, just drop us a comment. We’ll make sure to put it to the test and return with answers soon. Photos Rivian",
