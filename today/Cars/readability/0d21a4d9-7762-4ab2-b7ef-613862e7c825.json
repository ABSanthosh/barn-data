  "description": "Hyundai has takn the wraps off the Initium concept, a hydrogen fuel cell SUV that may preview the styling and technology of the next-generation Nexo. The concept is meant to demonstrate Hyundai’s commitment to hydrogen as a fuel source, and comes with a new powertrain that’s said to offer much greater performance than the one in the Nexo FCEV. Hyundai Initium concept gets 204hp motor Hyundai is targeting a 650km range Plus-shaped graphic to help differentiate Hyundai’s hydrogen cars Hyundai Initium concept: powertrain The Initium concept gets a single electric motor that puts out up to 204hp, 40hp more than the Nexo, and it is said to provide a smoother drive at highway speeds. The Korean company says it is targeting a range of more than 650km between fill-ups, which is equivalent to the official 666km figure for the Nexo. It also has vehicle-to-load capability, which allows the battery to power external devices. Hyundai Initium concept: design In addition to the technical developments, the Initium is the first Hyundai that sports the new design language called ‘Art of Steel’. It is said to be “solid and safe”, having been created in response to customer demand for SUVs. The plus-shaped graphic on the front DRLs and tail-lights is new, and will be used to differentiate Hyundai’s hydrogen cars and SUVs from those with battery-electric powertrains and internal-combustion engines. That aerodynamics have been given a high priority can be seen in the roofline, which is more rakish than Hyundai’s other SUVs. Hyundai claims the Initium concept previews a production fuel cell car that’s scheduled to be unveiled by next summer. This is most likely to be the successor to the current Nexo, given its design closely mirrors that of prototypes that have been spotted testing on public roads around Europe. There’s no word on whether this model will come to India, though Hyundai had evaluated bringing the Nexo to our market, and had showcased it in New Delhi back in 2018. The company is currently working on bringing the Creta EV to a showroom near you early next year.
