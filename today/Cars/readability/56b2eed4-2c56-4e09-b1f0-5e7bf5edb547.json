  "description": "This 1981 Ferrari 512 BB is one of 929 carbureted examples produced between 1976 and 1981, and it has remained under the care of the selling dealer's family since 1990. The car was located in Europe until 2004 when it was shipped to the US, and around 2020 it was drained of fluids and kept on static display through 2024. Work in preparation for the sale involved a timing-belt service and replacing the tires, coolant expansion tank, belts, and fluids. Finished in Rosso Corsa and Nero over beige leather, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter F102B flat-12 that is backed by a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes air conditioning, a cassette stereo, a gated dogleg shifter, a MOMO steering wheel, and 15\" Cromodora wheels. This 512 BB is now offered with a tool kit and a clean New York title.",

Work in preparation for the sale involved a timing-belt service and replacing the tires, coolant expansion tank, belts, and fluids. Finished in Rosso Corsa and Nero over beige leather, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter F102B flat-12 that is backed by a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes air conditioning, a cassette stereo, a gated dogleg shifter, a MOMO steering wheel, and 15″ Cromodora wheels. This 512 BB is now offered with a tool kit and a clean New York title. The Berlinetta Boxer model was styled by Pininfarina’s Leonardo Fioravanti and was introduced at the 1971 Turin Auto Show. Aluminum is incorporated for the front and rear clamshells and door panels, while the lower panels are fiberglass. The car features a steel-paneled cabin section paired with a tubular chassis. The model was not officially offered in the US, though some were imported and federalized in-period via the gray market. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa with Nero lower bodywork and features pop-up headlights, fog lights, a front spoiler, NACA side ducts, and quad exhaust outlets. Photos of paint meter readings are presented in the gallery below. Center-lock 15″ Cromodora wheels were mounted with Michelin tires in preparation for the sale. Stopping power is provided by disc brakes at each corner, and the brake fluid was flushed following the selling dealer’s acquisition. The selling dealer notes that the interior was refreshed in the mid-1980s. Beige leather covers the seats, and cabin appointments include a gated dogleg shifter, air conditioning, a cassette stereo, and power windows. The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges that extend to the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 31k kilometers (~19k miles). The 4.9-liter F102B flat-12 features aluminum construction, dual overhead camshafts per bank, dry-sump lubrication, and quad triple-barrel Weber carburetors to produce a factory-rated 340 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer notes that a timing-belt service was performed in January 2025, and additional work in preparation for the sale involved replacing the tensioner bearings, accessory belts, and coolant expansion tank as well as flushing the coolant and changing the oil. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The gearbox oil was changed in preparation for the sale. The chassis plate is shown above, and the sequence 31551 is listed as the VIN on the current New York title. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
