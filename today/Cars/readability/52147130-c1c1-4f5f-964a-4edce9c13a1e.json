  "description": "More than the surprise India debut of this long-wheelbase iX1 at Auto Expo 2025, it was the price it was launched at that caught us all off guard. We’ve been conditioned to believe that EVs must be more expensive than their ICE counterparts; call it a technology tax, if you will. But, at Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the iX1 LWB costs Rs 1.8 lakh less than the petrol X1 (as well as all its EV rivals), while delivering much greater room in the back seat. The price is for the first six months of production only, and is the result of local assembly, this being the first BMW EV to be brought in as a CKD. BMW iX1 LWB exterior To the uninitiated, it’s hard to spot the extra 116mm of length at first glance, but to those familiar with the standard model, the stretch is immediately evident. The good news is it doesn’t look ungainly like, say, the 5 Series did after its stretch. In fact, where the standard iX1 looks just a little comical with its exaggerated headlamps, tail-lamps and grille, you don’t get as much of that sensation with this larger vehicle, and to these eyes, the proportions are better. Exaggerated headlamps and grille look more proportional in the LWB model. It’s a shame the wheels didn’t move up a size from the 18 inchers of the previous version; in fact, even their design is the same, and they look a little lost in the large, square wheel arches. 108mm of that increased length is in the wheelbase (now up to 2,800mm), and in case you’re worried about how this affects its speed breaker-crossing ability, BMW assures us the laden ground clearance is around 175mm, which means it’s closer to 190mm unladen. 18-inch wheels look a bit small on the LWB version. Increased length aside, it’s visually identical to the short-wheelbase iX1, even retaining its M Sport styling kit. This gives some requisite attitude to what is no longer a compact vehicle in any sense, and saves it from looking too slab sided. Yes, some of the details might still polarise – tail-lamps and grille especially – but there’s no doubt it looks striking. BMW iX1 LWB interior and features As you might imagine, the lengthening of the iX1 has all gone into the rear of the cabin, and the legroom here is just vast. As before, you’re sat low to the floor in a knees-up position, thanks to the battery, but it doesn’t bother you as much since you have so much more horizontal space to stretch out. It’s also because the seat base has been lengthened by 15mm and softer cushioning has been used throughout, making the seat subtly more comfortable. The backrest can even be reclined up to 28.5 degrees. Huge space at the rear now and seat comfort has improved too. All this makes for a more comfortable chauffeur-driven experience, with space that’s far superior to anything else in the segment. Enhancing the sense of space here is a larger glass area in the form of a bigger panoramic sunroof (now a fixed glass, rather than an openable one) and, naturally, longer windows. However, much like in the 5 Series, the iX1 misses out on rear window blinds, which would have been a worthwhile addition in the LWB version. Dash design is quirky and surprisingly practical. Other spec differences include the removal of the beige upholstery colour; mocha brown is your only option now, and some features that have been removed. Among these are the ‘boost’ paddle behind the wheel which would get you 10sec of extra torque, and the massage function for the front seats. Other features, meanwhile, are there, but for a price, as BMW is offering them as options or subscriptions, including onboard navigation, certain drive modes and even the spare wheel! BMW iX1 LWB performance and range It’s not just features that have been removed, though; the iX1 has ditched its rear motor and now uses a front-wheel-drive setup rather than AWD. With this new sDrive20 powertrain has come a drop in power from 313hp to 204hp, and torque from 494Nm to 250Nm. Naturally, that’s resulted in a dip in performance, with the 0-100kph acceleration times dropping from 5.49sec to 8.31sec, but with the same 66.4kWh battery, BMW’s certified range figure has jumped from 440km to 531km. However, in our short time with the car, we couldn’t do a real-world range test.  It uses the same 66.4kWh battery, but ditches the real axle motor from the SWB model. What we could verify was the performance, which feels noticeably subdued, and not just in comparison to the old xDrive30 version. 200hp sounds like a lot, but this is a larger and heavier vehicle, and during overtakes especially you feel wanting for power, or at the very least that EV-typical instantaneous punch. It definitely has that ‘entry level engine’ vibe about it, and once you make your peace with that and factor in the greater range, the trade-off seems fair. Some of X1's agility has been lost with the added length. The longer wheelbase has brought a more laidback demeanour to the handling too, and combined with the relaxed power delivery, you’re not inclined to push this car as you might have the xDrive30. What’s remained is the excellent ride quality, which is a trait BMW has lately stolen from arch rival Mercedes. Apart from an at-times hollow-sounding thunk on sharp bumps, the suspension is absorbent and even maintains good body composure. BMW iX1 LWB price and verdict The front half of the cabin hasn’t changed, for better or worse. This includes the quirky but practical dash and centre console, the hit-or-miss interior quality, and the frustratingly complex i-Drive 9 touchscreen which has swallowed up too many functions (here’s where Merc has stolen a march on BMW). But these are problems for your driver, as the focus with the iX1 LWB is the rear seat. BMW says the car was borne from two factors – buyers’ complaints that entry-level luxury cars felt too cramped for their asking price, and that while market leader Mercedes has a stranglehold on the top end of the market, the bottom end was there for the taking. Think if the iX1 LWB as a sister car to the 3 Series Gran Limousine, and it starts to make sense. It isn't just cheaper than its rivals; it's cheaper than its own SWB petrol counterpart, too. This car, then, is a statement of intent from the Bavarian brand, a flag to mark its territory. And if the combination of superb rear-seat space and a knockout price of Rs 49 lakh (ex-showroom, India) entice enough buyers, it might just be what can jump-start the waning entry luxury segment.
