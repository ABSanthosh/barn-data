  "text": "This is your chance to own one of the 25 Shelby GT500-H Fastbacks commissioned by Hertz in 2022 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas Hertz is selling three Ford Mustang Shelby GT500-Hs from its exclusive fleet. These limited-production specials were created for the rental company in 2022. Each is equipped with a 900-hp supercharged V8 and features unique styling details. While buying a used Mustang rental may not be the wisest move for your wallet, the rules change when it comes to limited-production specials, like those made specifically for Hertz. The rental giant is now parting ways with at least three Shelby GT500-H fastbacks, each carrying an asking price of $150,000. We know what you’re thinking—that’s a hefty price for a car that’s probably been subjected to every tourist’s idea of “spirited driving.” You know, the kind of “enthusiastic” behavior that looks great on Instagram, but doesn’t exactly help with resale value. The Shelby GT500-H was introduced in 2022 as the latest in a long line of special edition Mustangs commissioned by Hertz, inspired by the original GT350-H from 1966. Production was capped to just 25 units, including 19 finished in Shadow Black and 6 in Oxford White. All these cars are draped in gold stripes, equipped with carbon fiber hoods, forged aluminum wheels, and darkened windows. More: Hertz Selling Its Shelby Mustang Mach-E Fleet For A Price That’ll Short-Circuit Your Wallet The three models currently listed for sale on Hertz include one white example in California (located in Santa Clara) and two black ones in Florida (Clearwater and Tampa). Hertz offered these Shelby Mustangs as part of a rental program in 11 US cities, with prices set at $399 per day before taxes and insurance. That was a bargain if you were only looking for a weekend of mildly misguided muscle-car thrills. As for the cars themselves, the odometer readings are 22,213 miles, 15,142 miles, and 12,346 miles, respectively. All things considered, they’re in fairly decent condition. The car in Tampa could probably use a bit of a detailing session to restore its former glory, particularly the body kit, exposed carbon fiber accents, and 20-inch wheels, which could all use a polish to shine a bit more. All three GT500-H models share the same equipment lineup. Inside, you’ll find leather-wrapped, heated Recaro sport seats, dual-zone climate control, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, special floor mats, and numbered badges on both the dashboard and under the hood. 900 Horses under the hood The more significant upgrade comes in the engine bay, where you’ll find a supercharged 5.2-liter Predator V8 engine that’s been tweaked to produce a hearty 900 hp (671 kW/912 PS). That’s a healthy bump over the stock Shelby GT500’s 760 hp (567 kW/770 PS)—enough to make it the most powerful Ford-badged production car on the road, outpacing even the GT supercar. The supercharger itself is painted gold, because of course it is—no pony car would be complete without it. More: Hertz Fires Back At Manager Who Charged Customer $10,000 For 25,000 Miles On ‘Unlimited Mileage’ Monthly Contract On top of the Mustangs, Hertz is also offloading a collection of fully electric Shelby Mustang Mach-E GTs. While these electric models are cheaper and certainly more practical, their fake exhaust noises can’t hold a candle to the guttural growl of a big ol’ V8. Hertz",
