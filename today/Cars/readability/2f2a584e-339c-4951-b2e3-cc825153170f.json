  "text": "The duo hit the ball back and forth, setting two records in the process July 10, 2025 at 21:00 by Michael Gauthier Lexus has helped to set two new Guinness World Records for playing tennis on moving vehicles. The stunt saw Jamie Murray and Laura Robson hit the ball back and forth to each other. The duo completed 101 rallies, while traveling at speeds up to 29 mph on top of NX crossovers. Lexus has developed a boring and sensible reputation, but the company has been trying to shake things up for decades. This has brought us the beloved LFA, the beautiful LC, and an assortment of high-performance F models. Fast forward to today and the company is grabbing eyeballs with an odd stunt designed to get people talking. This is no easy feat, but it’s not often that you see two tennis stars playing the sport on top of moving vehicles. More: 2025 Lexus NX Gets Small Updates But Sizable Price Hikes The bizarre campaign saw Jamie Murray and Laura Robson hitting a tennis ball back and forth 101 consecutive times, while traveling at speeds of up to 29 mph (47 km/h). Needless to say, Lexus didn’t just throw the duo onto the top of NX crossovers and wish them the best of luck. Quite the opposite as the company created two aluminum platforms, which were then bolted through roof rack mounting points. Murray and Robson were also secured in place by four safety straps, while professional stunt drivers drove carefully down the runway of Duxford Airfield. After multiple attempts and a few swear words, the duo set two new Guinness World Records titles. This included the “longest tennis rally on two moving cars” as well as the “fastest speed achieved during a tennis rally on two moving cars.” It appears to have taken the pair roughly two hours to set the records and Laura Robson remarked, “Tennis is a sport that requires precision, skill and co-ordination, so playing a rally on top of moving cars travelling at speed is no mean feat!” She went on to describe it as a “surreal experience,” while Jamie Murray said it was the “most exciting and unusual challenge I’ve ever taken on.”",
