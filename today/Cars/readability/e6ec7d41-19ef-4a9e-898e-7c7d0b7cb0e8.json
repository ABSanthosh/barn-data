  "text": "The performance sub-brand isn’t limited to EVs, despite offering a zero-emission lineup in Europe 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas Hyundai N’s Vice President says the division isn’t limited to battery-electric vehicles. The sub-brand could gain access to upcoming hybrid and EREV powertrains from Hyundai. Kia’s GT lineup is going EV-only, while Genesis Magma remains open to using EREV setups. Hyundai’s performance arm is evolving fast, and Europe is about to see a major shift. The N division’s electric ambitions are picking up speed with a growing lineup of EV-only models, starting with the Ioniq 5 N that’ll soon be joined by the Ioniq 6 N. That doesn’t mean the combustion engine is getting kicked to the curb just yet, though, as Hyundai’s go-fast sub-brand isn’t ready to shut the door on other powertrain options. More: Kia Is Done With Gas GT Performance Cars While the Elantra N continues to wave the ICE flag in North America, Europe has taken a stricter turn. Emissions regulations have already pushed the i20 N and i30 N hot hatches off the map, sparking speculation that Hyundai N would go fully electric, much like Kia appears to be doing with its GT-badged performance cars. EVs Are Just One Part of the Plan Speaking to Autocar, Joon Park, Vice President of Hyundai N and head of the Global Marketing Strategy Team, pushed back on the assumption that N is going EV-exclusive. “The problem that we have is that there is a perception from the media and our fans that Hyundai N is only focusing on the EV world, which is not true,” Park said. “Even though we are going to introduce the Ioniq 6 N at Goodwood Festival of Speed, we are not limiting ourselves to EVs.” Park added that the division is open to exploring a wide range of ideas: “We’re going forward with EVs, of course, as well as all the other proposals we could do. Because for N, imagination and courage are the words we need to remember.” Room for Hybrids and More US-Spec Hyundai Elantra N The performance division’s boss, a self-declared fan of combustion-powered sports cars, didn’t go into detail about what kinds of powertrains future Hyundai N models might use. Still, it’s reasonable to think the brand could align with its parent company’s multi-pathway strategy. More: Genesis Says Its New Hybrids Will Surprise You The Hyundai Group has already confirmed it’s developing a variety of models with hybrid and EREV (extended range electric vehicle) systems. These are meant to complement its growing battery-electric lineup while reducing reliance on charging infrastructure. Not every one of those platforms will be a fit for Hyundai N’s performance focus, but the direction is clear. A similar approach is also in the works at Genesis, where the newly launched Magma sub-brand is expected to blend performance with a mix of powertrain technologies. What’s Coming Next The Hyundai i30 N, which launched in 2017, kicked off the sub-brand’s journey with a proper hot hatch that set the tone for future N models. Since then, the performance treatment has been applied to the i20, Kona, Veloster, Elantra, and more recently, the Ioniq 5. Now, the Ioniq 6 N is getting ready for its debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where it will serve as a showcase for what the next all-electric N car will look and feel like. Another model that could join the lineup in the coming years is a production version of the Vision N 74 Concept, positioned as a low-volume halo car. The concept featured a hydrogen-electric hybrid setup delivering 670 hp (500 kW / 680 PS), though it’s still unclear whether a similar powertrain would make it into a road-going version. The upcoming fully electric Ioniq 6 N.",
