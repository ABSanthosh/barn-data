Equipment includes an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, a Burmester high-end sound system, rear-axle steering, ceramic-composite brakes, 19″ and 20″ AMG multi-spoke wheels, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control, and heated AMG Performance seats. The car has spent time in Arizona and California and now has 12k miles. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this AMG GT R is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title. The car is finished in AMG Green Hell Magno (376) with a carbon-fiber roof panel, fixed rear wing, mirror caps, fenders, and diffuser trim, and additional features include front and rear Parktronic as well as LED headlights and taillights. The Carfax report notes that the windshield was replaced in December 2023. Black 19″ and 20″ AMG multi-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measuring 275/35 up front and 325/30 out back. Optional ceramic-composite brakes with gold-painted calipers are fitted at all four corners. The car came equipped from the factory with an AMG Adaptive Sport Suspension and rear-axle steering. The GT R features adaptive dampers and a larger rear anti-roll bar compared to the standard AMG GT. The cabin features heated and power-adjustable AMG Performance seats trimmed in black Exclusive Nappa leather and Dinamica with contrasting yellow stitching. Other interior details comprise a matte carbon-fiber rear crossbar and trim pieces as well as a Burmester high-end sound system, Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control, Keyless Go, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. The Dinamica-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and a central configurable digital display. The steering wheel wrap is worn. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles. The 4.0-liter V8 features revised twin-turbochargers, exhaust ports, and throttle mapping for a factory rating of 577 horsepower and 517 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber shroud covers the engine.
