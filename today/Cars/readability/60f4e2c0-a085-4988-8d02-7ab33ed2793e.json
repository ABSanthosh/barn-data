The car is finished in Inferno Orange over Ebony and Cashmere leather and equipment includes a six-speed manual gearbox, a limited-slip differential, the Z07 Package, the 3LZ Premium Equipment Group, the CFZ Carbon Package, black Cup wheels, Brembo ceramic-composite brakes, xenon headlights, a Bose sound system, a head-up display, an MGW shifter, and a McLeod RST clutch. This C6 Z06 has 16k-miles and is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. The C6 featured a hydro-formed aluminum chassis paired with composite and carbon-fiber bodywork. The car is finished in Inferno Orange and features xenon headlights, fog lights, a rear spoiler, and polished quad exhaust outlets. The car was also optioned with the CFZ Carbon Package, which added a raised carbon-fiber hood, fenders, and sill extensions, and front splitter. There is a scratch on the left front fender, as well as road rash and a crack on the front splitter. Black-finished 19″ and 20″ Cup wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measuring 285/30/R19 up front and 335/25/R20 out back. The car is equipped with the Z07 Package, which added magnetorheological dampers and Brembo ceramic-composite brakes. The cabin houses power-adjustable bucket seats upholstered in Ebony and Cashmere leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, door panels, and carpets. The car was optioned with the 3LZ Premium Equipment Group, which added heated seats and two-tone leather upholstery. Additional amenities include an MGW short-throw shifter, a Bose sound system, Keyless Access, push-button start, a head-up display, a CD stereo, cruise control, and automatic climate control. The central rear view mirror is hazy. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 16k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The 7.0-liter LS7 V8 features a dry-sump lubrication system and was modified with a COMP Cams LS7R camshaft, FAST LSXR intake manifold, a 102mm throttle body, a Vararam air intake system, a B\u0026B cat-back exhaust system, and ported cylinder heads by Excessive Racing Engines of Pearland, Texas. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. A McLeod RST clutch is said to have been installed in late 2024. The window sticker lists standard equipment and options, a total vehicle price of $99,780, and initial delivery to Champion Chevrolet of Houston, Texas.
