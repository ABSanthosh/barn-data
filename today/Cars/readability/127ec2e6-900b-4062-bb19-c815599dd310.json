Delivered new to Lexus of Stevens Creek in San Jose, California, the car was sold on BaT in April 2022 and spent time in Canada before it was returned to the US and acquired by the selling dealer in 2025. The carbon-composite bodywork is finished in Pearl White, and power is provided by a 4.8-liter V10 linked with a six-speed Automated Sequential Gearbox and a Torsen limited-slip differential. Features include 20″ BBS alloy wheels and carbon-ceramic brake rotors with Brembo calipers as well as heated power-adjustable seats, white leather upholstery, a back-up camera, a Mark Levinson audio system, and a Lexus Insider infotainment system with voice command and navigation. This LFA has 952 miles and is now offered at no reserve in California with a window sticker, an owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a Montana title. The design of the LFA was led by Kengo Matsumoto, and the car features aerodynamic carbon-fiber bodywork mated to a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer chassis with aluminum front and rear subframes. This example is finished in Pearl White (077) and features triple central exhaust outlets, side air intakes, a vented hood, F fender badges, a speed-sensitive rear wing, and bi-xenon HID headlights. The 20″ double-spoke BBS alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza tires measuring 265/35 up front and 305/30 out back. The double-wishbone front suspension is joined by a multi-link rear setup and remote-reservoir monotube dampers. Stopping power is provided by red-finished Brembo aluminum monoblock six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors measuring 15.4″ up front and 14.2″ out back. The 10-way power-adjustable heated seats are trimmed in white leather, and matching upholstery and carbon-fiber accents extend to the dashboard and door panels. Equipment includes automatic climate control, a Mark Levinson 12-speaker surround-sound system, a CD stereo, Bluetooth connectivity, a hill-assist system, and a Lexus Insider infotainment screen with voice command, navigation, and a back-up camera. A plaque listing the car as “LFA 235” is riveted to the rear bulkhead. The flat-bottom leather- and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel fronts column-mounted paddle shifters as well as a TFT LCD gauge cluster with a digital speed readout, a tachometer, a gear position display, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, fuel level, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 952 miles. The 4.8-liter 1LR-GUE V10 was developed in collaboration with Yamaha and features titanium valves and connecting rods, forged pistons, individual throttle bodies, dry-sump lubrication, dual VVT-i variable valve timing, and a titanium muffler. Lexus rated output at 552 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through an Aisin six-speed single-clutch Automated Sequential Gearbox and a Torsen limited-slip differential. Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Lexus of Stevens Creek in San Jose, California, along with factory equipment, colors, options, and a total of $388,600.
