It is finished in blue and white and features a receiver hitch, a sliding rear window, cab clearance lights, side steps, power steering, and front disc brakes. The cab is outfitted with a trailer brake controller, a cassette stereo, inward-facing rear jump seats, and TMI Products front buckets trimmed in black vinyl. The 351ci V8 breathes through an Edelbrock carburetor and intake manifold along with Hooker headers, and power is routed through a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. This dentside F-150 is offered at no reserve with initial sales documentation, the owner’s manual, a bench seat, service records, and a clean Idaho title in the seller’s name. The truck is a long-bed example that is finished in white and blue, and it was reportedly fitted with a slide-in camper and repainted during prior ownership. Details include side steps, cab clearance lights, a receiver hitch, chrome bumpers, and a sliding rear window. Rust is noted behind the right-rear window. Pro Comp aluminum 16″ wheels are mounted with 315/75 Toyo M/T Open Country tires. The truck rides on a 6″ lift kit that was fitted in 2013, and equipment consists of power steering, manually locking front hubs, and power front disc brakes. TMI Products black vinyl bucket seats are fitted above blue carpets, and faux woodgrain trim accents the dashboard and steering wheel. Equipment includes a trailer brake controller, a cassette stereo, and inward-facing rear jump seats. The steering wheel is mounted on a tilting column and frames a factory instrument cluster, and a slower speedometer gear is installed. The rear fuel tank readout does not work. The five-digit odometer shows 18k miles. Total mileage is unknown. The 351ci V8 was fitted with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and intake manifold in 2017, and Hooker headers and a dual exhaust system with glass-pack mufflers was installed at the time. The heater core was replaced in 2019. Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The truck came equipped from the factory with an auxiliary fuel tank. A rubberized underbody coating was applied in December 2024. The VIN is consistent with a 1979 F-150 Super Cab produced at the Manwah, New Jersey, plant, and powered by a 351ci V8 with a two-barrel carburetor. Initial sales documentation is included in the sale along with a removed bench seat and other literature. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
