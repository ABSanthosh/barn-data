This F430 Spider is now offered in California by the selling dealer at no reserve with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Giallo Modena and features a power-retractable black soft top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear parking sensors, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser. The 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza tires. Braking is handled by yellow-finished brake calipers fitted over Brembo carbon-ceramic rotors. The cockpit was upholstered by Schedoni, and it features Cuoio Naturale leather with crocodile leather inserts adorning the power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats, instrument binnacle, rollbars, center console, and door panels. Equipment includes carbon-fiber trim, air conditioning, drilled aluminum pedals, a wind deflector, and power windows and locks. A personalized plaque is stationed between the seats. A Schedoni plaque is stationed between the seats. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 480 miles. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque. Carbon-fiber trim adorns the engine bay.

The window sticker lists initial delivery to Ferrari of Newport Beach in California, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total suggested retail price of $419,534.
