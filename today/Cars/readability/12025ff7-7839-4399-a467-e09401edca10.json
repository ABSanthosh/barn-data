This Carrera Targa was purchased by the current owner in October 2024, and it is now offered on dealer consignment with tools, a jack, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title. The car is finished in Venetian Blue Metallic and features a black removable targa roof panel, integrated fog lights, and heated power-adjustable side mirrors. The hood and right fender have been refinished, and the rear valance was modified to accommodate a dual exhaust system. The front trunk and deck lid shocks were replaced in May 2024. The 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The car has been fitted with Bilstein sport shocks, Turbo tie rods, and a Rennline strut tower brace. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs. The front tires and steering support sleeve were replaced in May 2024, the turbo tie rods were installed, and the sway bar bushings were replaced in January 2025. The front sport seats are trimmed in Silver Grey special leather and joined by black upper surfaces. Amenities include a Blaupunkt Bremen SQR 46 stereo, Pyle speakers, cruise control, air conditioning, and power windows. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 55k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership. A note in the November 2021 service invoice states that the odometer was inoperable. The 3.2-liter M930/25 flat-six features Bosch Motronic engine management and was factory-rated at 217 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. The clutch kit, slave cylinder, and guide tube were replaced in January 2025.
