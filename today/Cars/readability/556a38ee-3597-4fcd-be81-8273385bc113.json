Power is provided by a twin-turbocharged 5.2-liter V12 backed by an eight-speed automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car rides on OHMSS Diamond Turned 21″ wheels and is equipped with an Adaptive Damping System, active torque vectoring, a carbon-fiber rear spoiler, LED lighting, and parking sensors in addition to heated and ventilated front seats, a 360-degree camera, and a Bang \u0026 Olufsen audio system. Acquired new by the current owner, the car now has 267 miles. This DBS Superleggera Coupe is offered in Massachusetts on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a DBS-branded case containing four champagne glasses, and a clean Tennessee title. The OHMSS Edition commemorates the 50th anniversary of the release of the James Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. All examples in the edition were finished in Olive Green. Superleggera-specific carbon-fiber bodywork includes the hood, trunk lid, front splitter, and rear diffuser. The car also has Aeroblade II with a carbon-fiber rear spoiler as well as body-color roof strakes, quad exhaust outlets, front and rear parking sensors, and LED headlights and taillights. OHMSS Diamond Turned 21″ wheels are mounted with 265/35 front and 305/30 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by slotted and ventilated ceramic-composite discs at each corner. The car came equipped from the factory with an Adaptive Damping System. The heated and ventilated front seats and rear bucket seats are trimmed in Pure Black leather with red accents, including the James Bond logo and “OHMSS Edition” script between the rear seats. Amenities include a 360-degree camera, an Alcantara headliner, front-seat position memory settings, keyless entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation, and a Bang \u0026 Olufsen BeoSound audio system. A plaque on the door sill identifies this as one of 50 OHMSS Edition examples produced. The flat-bottom steering wheel is mounted on a power-adjustable column and sits ahead of a configurable digital gauge cluster. The odometer indicates 267 miles. The twin-turbocharged quad-cam 5.2L V12 was factory rated at 715 horsepower and 663 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed in October 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted ZF eight-speed automatic transaxle that features a limited-slip differential and utilizes active torque vectoring. The window sticker lists factory equipment and a total suggested retail price of $400,838. Manufacturer’s literature and a DBS-branded case containing four champagne glasses will also accompany the car. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage.
