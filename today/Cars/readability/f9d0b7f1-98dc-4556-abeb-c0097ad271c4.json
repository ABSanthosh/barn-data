Equipment includes locking center and rear differentials as well as four-zone automatic climate control, 19″ Ahteo wheels, an air suspension, a sunroof, a receiver hitch, and heated power-adjustable front seats. The vehicle has remained registered in California since new and now has 174k miles. Purchased by the seller in 2024, this 7L Touareg is now offered at no reserve with partial service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the name of the seller and their spouse. The Touareg shares its platform with the Porsche Cayenne, and this example is finished in Wheat Beige Metallic (LD1W). Features include a sunroof, a receiver hitch, parking sensors, power-folding side mirrors, roof crossbars, and a rear window wiper. Faded and peeling finish is visible on the roof and right-front fender, the rear bumper cover has scrapes, and scratches can be seen on the body. The 19″ Ahteo alloy wheels have blemishes and are mounted with Westlake tires said to have been installed in March 2024. The vehicle came equipped from the factory with an air suspension that utilizes Continuous Damping Control. The heated power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in beige Cricket leather, while wood trim accents the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Amenities include four-zone automatic climate control, front seat memory settings, a CD stereo, and cruise control. Center stack buttons have missing finish, the passenger side of the dashboard has tears, the cigarette lighter plug is missing, and the seller notes sagging headliner upholstery. The heated leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, fuel level, and voltage. The digital odometer indicates 174k miles. TPMS and airbag warning lights are illuminated on the dashboard. The 4.2-liter FSI V8 was factory rated at 310 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. The seller states that the battery was replaced in May 2024 and the serpentine belt and tensioner were replaced the following month. Power is sent to all four wheels through a Tiptronic six-speed automatic transmission, a 4XMOTION permanent four-wheel-drive system, and a dual-range transfer case. The SUV was factory-equipped with locking center and rear differentials. Driveshaft replacement is noted on the Carfax report in August 2019. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
