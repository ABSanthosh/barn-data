Batman and his myriad motorcycles have captured our imaginations since; just think of how many times you’ve heard the phrase “That looks like something Batman would ride.” That exact phrase was the inspiration behind this brooding custom BMW R nineT. But this isn’t a replica of any one particular Batman motorcycle. Rather, it’s a homage to the aesthetics of The Dark Knight’s vehicles, masterfully executed by Smoked Garage in Jakarta, Indonesia. “A client walked into Smoked Garage with a childhood dream,” says the shop’s founder, Nicko Eigert. “As a boy, he had always been fascinated by the sleek, futuristic bikes of Batman—and now, he sought to bring his fantasy to life in a modern café racer.” Smoked’s mission was to nail the visual brief without compromising the BMW R nineT’s rideability. So they poured their energy into the bike’s bodywork, leaving most of its already-capable running gear alone. Smoked started with the BMW’s fuel tank—hand-shaping a new carbon fiber unit with a blocky look reminiscent of vintage BMW boxers. Further back, a carbon fiber tail unit sits atop the bike’s abbreviated subframe, cutting a classic café racer silhouette. Next, Smoked fabricated a complex array of aluminum fairings to envelope the lower half of the bike. The bottom section reads like a traditional sportbike belly pan—transitioning to a large scoop behind the front wheel before flowing into louvered side sections. Connecting the fairings to the fuel tank is a beautifully sculpted cover at the front of the tank, which also houses the ignition barrel. A generous windscreen rounds off the front of the bike, with a utilitarian LED headlight mounted behind it. Clip-on handlebars adorn the cockpit further back, while blank-off plates hide the original riser mounting points. The rider’s view includes Brembo brake and clutch levers, a Motogadget speedo, and Motogadget grips, bar-end mirrors, and turn signals. The parts are coated in contrasting matte and gloss black finishes, with plenty of carbon fiber poking through, while the modular and angular vibe points to modern Batman suits and utility belts. Traditional BMW roundels ensure that the bike has one foot planted in reality. Smoked’s finishing touches are subtle, yet effective. Keen eyes will notice the tidy side-stand extender and the barely legal license plate mount, plus the teeny LED taillights that flank the tailpiece. Then there’s the fact that practically everything, from the Brembo brake calipers to the boxer engine’s valve covers, has been murdered out. Lurking behind the gothic exterior lie a handful of upgrades, including an adjustable rear shock, new internals for the OEM forks, and a pair of handmade mufflers that are much more tapered than the stock setup. Practicalistas might scoff at the slick tires—but they look the business, and are easy enough to swap out. Without the need to replicate a fantasy vehicle bolt for bolt, Smoked was able to nail the balance between creating a machine fit for Batman, and a real-world café racer. “The client,” adds Nicko, “seeing his dream turned into reality, revved the engine and sped off into Jakarta’s night—leaving behind nothing but a shadow and whisper of Gotham’s legend.” Smoked Garage | Facebook | Instagram Sidecar subject: The Batcycle Comics 1960s Batcycle: Introduced in Batman #119 (1958), Batman’s early Batcycle was a relatively simple motorcycle compared to his other vehicles. It had the Bat emblem and was mostly a standard motorcycle with some minor customizations. Modern Comics: In later comics, the Batcycle became more advanced, akin to a futuristic, armored vehicle. It was outfitted with weaponry, and high-tech features like AI and GPS, and had designs inspired by super-sport or touring bikes. In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (1986), Batman’s bike was massive, almost like a tank, with huge tires to reflect the grittier tone of the series. Animated TV Series 1966 Animated Batman: The Batcycle made its first animated appearance in the Batman animated series by Filmation. It was simple and mostly resembled a standard motorcycle. Batman: The Animated Series (1990s): This version of the Batcycle was sleeker and more stylized, fitting the show’s dark and gothic aesthetic. It had a long, low-slung body with a high-tech look, often used by both Batman and Robin. The Batman (2004): This series featured a more futuristic design for the Batcycle, with a sleeker, aggressive style and advanced tech to suit Batman’s needs for high-speed chases and combat. Batman: The Brave and the Bold (2008-2011): The Batcycle here was more playful in its design, reflecting the more colorful and lighthearted nature of the show, but still packed with gadgets. Live-Action Films Batman (1966): The Batcycle in this film was a simple motorcycle with a sidecar for Robin. It had a minimalist design and was more about functionality than appearance. Batman \u0026 Robin (1997): The Batcycle used by Robin (Chris O’Donnell) was known as the Redbird, a sleek bike with a custom design, reflecting his personal style. The Dark Knight Trilogy (2008-2012): One of the most famous versions of the Batcycle appeared in The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Known as the Batpod, it emerged from the wreckage of the Batmobile (the Tumbler). This was a radically different design compared to previous versions—it had two massive wheels, mounted guns, and could rotate at sharp angles. The Batpod was iconic for its gritty, practical design, symbolizing director Christopher Nolan’s more realistic take on Batman’s world. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016): While the movie featured a militarized Batmobile, there was concept art that included a Batcycle design, though it didn’t appear in the final cut. The Batman (2022): This latest incarnation, driven by Robert Pattinson’s Batman, used a stripped-down, grounded version of the Batcycle, more in line with real-world motorcycles. The bike had a minimalist design, with a matte black finish, and wasn’t as overtly futuristic as in past films. This fit with the more gritty, detective-focused tone of the film.",
