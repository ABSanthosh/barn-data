The truck was repainted Medium Bronze, the interior was refreshed, and an aftermarket dual exhaust system was mounted. Additional equipment includes Dana 44 front and Dana 60 rear axles, an Edelbrock carburetor and intake manifold, a COMP Cams camshaft, a spray-on bedliner, a winch, power steering, manually locking front hubs, and a retro-style stereo. This bumpside F-250 is offered at no reserve with a Deluxe Marti report and a clean Oregon title in the seller’s name. The cab and bed were removed from the frame and the truck was repainted Medium Bronze. Equipment includes 1972-style grille inserts, a spray-on bedliner, a winch, and replacement chrome bumpers. The 16″ steel wheels are mounted with Specialty Tires of America Superlug tires. The truck is equipped with power steering and manually locking front hubs, and braking is provided by drums at each corner. During the refurbishment, the bench seat was reupholstered in black vinyl, the dash pad, carpets, and headliner were replaced, and a retro-style stereo, retractable seat belts, and black rubber floor mats were fitted. Additionally, sound-deadening material has been applied to the ceiling, floors, and door panels, according to the seller. The steering wheel frames a sweeping 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 23 miles. Total mileage is unknown. The 390ci V8 is said to have been sourced from a 1960s Thunderbird, and it was rebuilt before being installed. Components include a COMP Cams camshaft, an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and intake manifold, an aluminum radiator, and a billet electronic distributor. Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a C6 three-speed automatic transmission, an NP205 dual-range transfer case, and a limited-slip rear differential. A Dana 44 front and Dana 60 rear axle with 4.10:1 gearing were installed during the build. The H-pipe dual exhaust system features ceramic-coated headers, 2.25″ piping, Flowmaster mufflers, and stainless tips. The Deluxe Marti report lists factory equipment and production information as well as a build date of October 24, 1970. Photos taken during the refurbishment are provided in the gallery.
