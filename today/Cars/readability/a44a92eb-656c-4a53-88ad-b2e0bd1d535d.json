  "description": "Hero has had its sights set on younger scooter buyers for some time, and the Xoom line-up plays directly into that ambition. The new Xoom 125 offers more performance, better hardware and a more mature design than the Xoom 110. Armed with its competitive price and swanky design, is the Xoom 125 ready to take on the best in the segment? Well, here’s what we discovered. Hero Xoom 125 design and quality (8/10) It is well-equipped for the price with upmarket looks, though practicality has its limits.  The first thing that grabbed my attention was the sharper, more grown-up design. Compared to the quirky Xoom 110, this scooter feels more polished and upmarket. The 14-inch diamond-cut alloys are quite eye-catching and give it a good stance. This top-end ZX variant commands a premium of Rs 6,000 and brings a host of extra features. Key specificationsHero Xoom 125Kerb weight121kgSeat height777mmGround clearance164mmFuel tank capacity5 litresWheelbase1327mm These include two additional colour options (taking the total to four), machined alloy wheels, sequential LED indicators, a boot light, an illuminated start button, turn-by-turn navigation, an extra front storage pocket with a tethered USB charger and a boot lamp. Two fairly large cubbies that host a USB charger and can accommodate some knick-knacks. The Inferno Red paint pops nicely in daylight. However, the overall paint and plastic quality is about average, the switchgear feels a little basic, and the finish levels aren’t the best in the segment. The new sharper-looking headlamp performs quite well and will be a good companion for night commutes. That said, I’m not a huge fan of the rear design, and while the new tail-light does look sleek, it’s not nearly as unique or recognisable as the ‘X’ shaped tail-light found on the Xoom 110. This new design has also left some empty space, and the rear just ends up looking rather blank. The Xoom 125’s simple and easy-to-read LCD display does the job but with no extra flash or flair baked in. The LCD is basic and easy to read, with two buttons to help you toggle through. The USB charging port is covered with a rubber cap that appears to be reasonably weather-resistant and is tucked into the front cubby. Practicality, however, is a mixed bag. While there’s enough underseat storage for groceries and small items, it can only accommodate a half-face helmet. But the added storage at the front somewhat makes up for it, depending largely on what you’d be carrying. 17 litres of underseat storage is on the low side and won’t hold a full-sized helmet; a half-face helmet will fit. The cubby is large enough to hold small water bottles and other small items. In case you’re wondering, both cubbies have drain holes at the bottom, so they should be fairly easy to clean and rinse. The external fuel filler is a practical touch, and Hero has even added a buzzer reminder in case you forget to shut it. Overall, it’s a design that should appeal strongly to younger buyers without feeling over the top. Hero Xoom 125 riding position and comfort (7/10) The seat shape leaves both tall and short riders with some compromise. The Xoom 125 keeps the riding triangle friendly for everyday use, but it’s not what you’d call spacious. While the 777mm seat height is accessible on paper, the wide shape makes it a little tricky for riders shorter than 5’7” to be able to flat-foot. At the other end, at 6 feet tall, I found that the contour of the seat forces you to sit quite forward, which is awkward. While this seat is well-cushioned, its shape leaves both tall and short riders with a bit of compromise. There is still space for a tall rider’s knees, but the rider’s seat restricts room to move back, and you’ll start to feel cramped within half an hour. Despite having a well-cushioned seat, these factors make the ergonomics a slight compromise for both tall and short riders. Pillion space is decent and well-cushioned for short spins. Hero Xoom 125 performance and efficiency (8/10) Its peppy, low-end response makes it fun in the city. The Xoom shares its 124.6cc engine with the Destini 125, but it produces a marginal 0.79hp more. It feels eager and responsive off the line and has a good surge from standstill up to mid-range, making it enjoyable while cutting through dense city traffic. EngineHero Xoom 125Engine124.6cc, single-cyl, air-cooledPower9.9hp at 7250rpmTorque10.4Nm at 6000rpm In fact, performance is up there with the competition. In our tests, it managed 0-60kph in 7.56 seconds and 0-80kph in 15.39 seconds, on par with the company’s claims. That’s faster than Hero’s own Destini 125, despite the Xoom 125 weighing 6kg more and having larger 14-inch wheels.  PerformanceHero Xoom 125Acceleration0-60kph7.56s0-80kph15.39sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph4.49s30-70kph9.4s50-80kph11.34sBraking60-0kph (in meters)18.39m Engine refinement is another strong point, and the motor stays smooth and buzz-free even at 60-70kph and only just starts to feel a bit busy closer to 90kph. In everyday use, it offers a nice mix of pep and poise. I would have liked a nicer exhaust note to go with its sporty nature, but instead, you’re left with a rather ordinary, typical scooter drone. Despite being peppy, the Xoom 125 is quite frugal in daily use, and its city figure of 56.7kpl is aided by a start-stop system that works decently well but is not class-leadingly responsive. With a highway figure of 55.7kpl, the Xoom returns an average of 56.2kpl. A 5-litre fuel tank translates to a real-world range of a little over 250km, which is more than enough for weekly commuting duties. Hero Xoom 125 ride comfort and handling (8/10) The Xoom 125 feels agile and confident, but the braking feel could be better. One of the standout traits of the Xoom 125 is how light and flickable it feels in traffic and around corners. Despite the 14-inch wheels, it doesn’t feel cumbersome at low speeds, and their larger size only adds to its stability. The chassis feels composed and nimble, whether you’re filtering through tight spaces or taking a corner a little quicker than usual. UnderpinningsHero Xoom 125Suspension (F/R)Telescopic/monoshockBrakes (F/R)Disc/DrumTyres (F/R)110/80-R14 / 120/70-R14 In fact, even with a pillion on, the ride quality remains balanced and composed. The MRF Zapper tyres also offer solid grip in both dry and wet conditions. That said, braking performance leaves something to be desired, and while the actual stopping power is adequate, the levers feel hard and offer almost no feel, which isn’t what one would expect from a sporty scooter. The ZX variant’s 14-inch wheels are machine finished and add a touch of flamboyance. As for the ride, the suspension setup is quite well-balanced and slightly on the firmer side. That said, larger potholes and broken patches will filter through. On corners, though, it feels composed, eager and confident. It is evident that the suspension favours agility over outright plushness but still manages to find a commendable balance between the two. Hero Xoom 125 price and verdict (8/10) Not the fastest or the most practical, but it’s a stylish and capable scooter that has plenty of appeal. The ZX variant offers great additional value and equipment. At Rs 93,000, the Xoom 125 ZX finds itself priced close to the Suzuki Avenis 125 and below the TVS NTorq 125, which are its most direct rivals in terms of positioning, performance and features. The Xoom leans more toward a youthful, design-first approach, and if you’re a college student or young office-goer looking for something sharp, fun and frugal, it makes a strong case. But if comfort, space, and a premium feel matter more to you – or if you’re a taller rider – this may not be the scooter for you.
