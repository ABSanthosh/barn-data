  "text": "Tesla might not be universally loved, but at least it has a little fun with the production process January 4, 2025 at 19:20 by Stephen Rivers The Boring Company is finishing a tunnel construction project designed for Tesla. It includes a tunnel leaving the Giga Texas factory that goes under the highway nearby. The exit resembles a giant Cybertruck, with Tesla cheekily calling it a “birthing tunnel.” Back in 2020, Elon Musk floated the idea of building a tunnel out of Giga Texas—because when you’re Elon, a simple road just won’t cut it. Fast forward to today, and not only is the tunnel nearly finished, but Tesla has added a uniquely Tesla-esque flourish to it. As Cybertrucks and other models roll off the production line, they’ll make their grand exit through what can only be described as the frunk of a giant Cybertruck. The Boring Company (TBC) was working on this throughout 2024. A video from June shows the company’s Prufrock-3 boring machine carving its way under State Highway 130, connecting Tesla’s production facility on one side of the highway to its logistics site on the other. By mid-summer, TBC had moved on to the finishing touches, and now, as 2025 begins, we’re finally getting a look at what the public-facing end of this tunnel will look like. More: Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump Hotel Kills One, Injures Seven – Musk Responds The tunnel’s exit is unmistakably Tesla in design. Large, angular metal panels emulate the distinctive shape of a Cybertruck, complete with a sloping hood and even a strip of lighting meant to mimic the vehicle’s daytime running lights. It’s unclear exactly how much of the giant Cybertruck-shaped exit is viewable from the highway but it’s a fun touch regardless. In fact, Tesla’s attitude around the tunnel is fun too. On X, the Cybertruck account calls it the “birthing tunnel,” and jokes that “pre-canal” trucks are birthed via “CT Section.” The tunnel itself is a sleek and minimal affair, lined with clean white panels and designed to fit a single vehicle at a time. That’s perfectly fine since it’s a one-way tunnel designed specifically for one purpose. When cars make it to the end of the tunnel, they’ll go on their first post-production validation test drive before shipping and delivery. TBC might not be doing as much as Musk once proposed, but at least this is a quirky little project. Photos Joe Tegtmeyer/X",
