It is powered by a 1.6-liter flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Ivory over black leatherette. Features include chrome 15\" steel wheels, a luggage rack, a driver-side mirror, vent windows, body-color bumpers, an AM/FM radio, a GT Carrera-style steering wheel, and front bucket seats. This 356B coupe was previously listed on BaT in October 2024, and it is now offered again by the selling dealer with a copy of the Kardex, the owner's manual, a tool kit, and a clean Colorado title.",

It is powered by a 1.6-liter flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Ivory over black leatherette. Features include chrome 15″ steel wheels, a luggage rack, a driver-side mirror, vent windows, body-color bumpers, an AM/FM radio, a GT Carrera-style steering wheel, and front bucket seats. This 356B coupe was previously listed on BaT in October 2024, and it is now offered again by the selling dealer with a copy of the Kardex, the owner’s manual, a tool kit, and a clean Colorado title. The Karmann-built body came finished from the factory in Ivory (6204) and was repainted in the 1990s. Features include a luggage rack, a chrome driver-side mirror, a windshield washer system, vent windows, and body-color bumpers with chrome overriders. There is a rust bubble on the left fender. The underside of the front trunk lid features a Jimmy Fallon signature. The 15″ vented chrome steel wheels wear Deluxe hubcaps and are mounted with Pirelli tires measuring 185/70. The car was factory equipped with drum brakes at each corner. The front bucket seats and rear jump seats are upholstered in black leatherette, and interior appointments include a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, lap belts, Coco floor mats, an analog clock, and a body-color painted dashboard. The GT Carrera-style three-spoke steering wheel features a bright horn ring and frames green-letter VDO instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 4,500-rpm redline as well as a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 90k miles. The 1.6-liter flat-four came equipped from the factory with dual Zenith carburetors and was rated at 70 (SAE) horsepower. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. Engine stamping P☆0600535☆ is shown above, and a corresponding number is listed on the Kardex below. The copy of the Kardex lists the factory colors, production dates, and powertrain numbers. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
