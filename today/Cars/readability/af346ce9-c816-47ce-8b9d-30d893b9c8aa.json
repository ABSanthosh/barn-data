  "text": "The new Tempest pushes the Land Rover Discovery into Range Rover Sport pricing territory May 21, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Two new Discovery editions bring unique styling, trim upgrades, and curated accessory packages. The Tempest adds luxury with copper accents, 22-inch wheels, and special roof design. Accessory bundles include ski racks, media holders, and sunshades for specific lifestyle needs. The Land Rover Discovery recently celebrated its 35th anniversary and now the company is paying tribute with two new special editions. They’re known as the Tempest and Gemini, and show the old dog can still learn a few new tricks. Starting with the Tempest, it’s billed as the “most luxurious, comfortable, and highly‑specified Discovery vehicle ever produced.” It’s certainly an eye-catcher as it features a Charente Grey, Carpathian Grey or Varesine Blue exterior with a contrasting Petra Copper Gloss roof. They’re joined by copper accents and special badging. More: Next-Gen Land Rover Discovery Could Be Reimagined With Minivan-Inspired Styling The model rides on unique 22‑inch wheels that have gloss black accents as well as a Petra Copper tinted lacquer finish. Land Rover also installed special puddle lights that project a circular graphic onto the ground. Land Rover didn’t say much about the interior, but it sports Ebony Windsor leather and Shadow Aluminum trim. We can also see special treadplates and rear climate controls. Discovery Gemini The Discovery Gemini goes in a different direction and is available in six colors including an exclusive Sedona Red. Customers will also find a Narvik Gloss Black roof as well as Atlas Gloss flourishes. Other highlights include 21-inch wheels and puddle lights with a hexagonal graphic. The interior appears to mirror the one featured in the Tempest and Land Rover said it has a four-zone climate control system, a front cooler, special treadplates, and unique trim. Besides the two new special editions, the Discovery is getting a handful of updates as the S and Dynamic SE now have “enhanced specifications.” Land Rover didn’t go into detail, but confirmed there are new 21- and 22-inch wheel options. Discovery Tempest The company has also introduced a handful of curated accessory packages. The Beach Days pack has a collapsible organizer, a sunshade, and a roof rack that can be used to transport canoes or surfboards. The Snow Days pack is aimed at ski bunnies as it has cross bars for transporting skis and snowboards. Buyers will also find side steps and rubber floor mats. Lastly, the Road Trip package includes rear Click \u0026 Play media holders that can accommodate laptops and tablets. They’re joined by a sunshade, cross bars, and a roof-mounted storage box. The 2026 Land Rover Discovery is currently available and U.S. pricing starts at $60,200. The Gemini costs $70,800 while the Tempest will set you back $83,500. The S and Dynamic SE have a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing 296 hp (221 kW / 300 PS) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. Higher-end variants use a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six with 355 hp (265 kW / 360 PS) and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) of torque.",
