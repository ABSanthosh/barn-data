  "text": "One person reportedly suffered a broken arm after the door closed on them 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Several 2022-2023 Kia Carnival owners have submitted reports of injuries to the NHTSA. A new lawsuit claims the Carnival’s pinch sensor doesn’t properly detect obstacles. Plaintiffs argue Kia’s previous recall for the minivan’s door issue was ineffective. Automatic sliding doors are one of those modern conveniences designed to make family life smoother, especially when you’ve got your hands full or kids climbing in and out. But what happens when this feature turns from a convenience into a potential safety hazard? That’s the issue at the heart of a new class action lawsuit in the US, which claims that the sliding doors on the 2022 and 2023 Kia Carnival pose “a serious risk of bodily injury,” putting passengers in harm’s way. More: Lawsuit Claims Mazda’s Heated Seats Are So Hot They’re Burning Drivers The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleges that these Carnival models come equipped with a defective pinch sensor installed along the rubber seal on the edge of the doors. In theory, these sensors are supposed to detect any obstacle in the door’s path and prevent it from closing if something (or someone) is in the way. The suit claims that the Carnival’s pinch sensor frequently fails to recognize obstacles, leaving the only way to halt the door mid-close being a forceful press on the pinch sensor itself. Kia issued a recall for the reportedly defective doors in April of 2023. However, the class action claims this recall was “ineffective” as it was a simple software update that caused the door to shut more slowly while also adding warning chimes. The plaintiffs argue that it did not impact the force needed to trigger the pinch sensor. The recall involved 51,568 Carnivals from the 2022 and 2023 model years delivered in the United States. At the time, Kia said it had received reports of 9 injuries related to the faulty pinch sensor, including one where an individual’s thumb was fractured and another when someone’s arm was broken after the door closed on it. Read: 2025 Kia Carnival Gets Nearly $3k Price Hike To Accompany Facelift The lawsuit contends that many customers would not have purchased the Carnival had they known about the fault, or would have paid substantially less for the minivan. The plaintiffs accuse Kia of breaching both express warranty and of implied warranty, along with claims of fraud, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. Now, they’re pushing for a jury trial, seeking damages, interest, and full coverage of legal fees. For Kia, what started as a minor software recall could escalate into a costly courtroom showdown if this class action gains momentum.",
