  "description": "The Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge has launched in India, priced at Rs 9.5 crore (before options), with bookings now open at the brand’s Chennai and New Delhi showrooms. Revealed in February this year for international markets, the Spectre Black Badge is the most powerful Rolls-Royce yet; this EV delivers a total output of 659hm and 1,075Nm of peak torque. Spectre Black Badge costs almost Rs 2 crore more than the standard EV Claimed 0-100kph time of 4.1 seconds Gets interior and exterior changes, along with 44,000 colour options Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge price Black Badge priced Rs 1.88 crore higher than Spectre Rolls-Royce India revealed the price of the standard Spectre EV in January, which was set at Rs 7.62 crore. This means the Spectre EV costs Rs 1.88 crore less than the Black Badge version, priced at Rs 9.5 crore. It should be noted that both prices are ex-showroom India, before any customisation or personalisation. Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge power and performance 74hp and 175Nm more than the standard Spectre Compared to the standard Spectre’s total output of 585hp and 900Nm of torque, the Black Badge’s dual-motor setup has combined figures of 659hp and 1,075Nm, an increase of 74hp and 175Nm. The additional power helps the Spectre Black Badge shave 0.4 seconds off the standard EV’s claimed 0-100kph time of 4.5 seconds. However, the Spectre Black Badge has the same 102kWh battery, with the same WLTP range of up to 530km. The British marque has also tweaked the chassis, steering and roll stabilisation system to handle the Black Badge’s extra output while maintaining ride comfort. Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge exterior changes Gets blacked-out elements on the grille, door handles, badges and hood ornament As we reported when the Spectre Black Badge made its debut, the Black Badge gets different 23-inch forged aluminium wheels, along with a new Vapour Violet paint; Rolls-Royce offers a whopping 44,000 exterior colour options, though a bespoke colour can be opted for – via the Rolls-Royce Bespoke division – for a price. As is usually the case with the brand’s Black Badge models, the Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament, front grille, door handles and badges are among the blacked-out elements. The Spectre Black Badge can also be opted for with an illuminated front grille and door sills, which have four colours – Tailored Purple, Charles Blue, Chartreuse and Forge Yellow. Rolls-Royce Spectre Black Badge interior changes Driver’s display gets 5 colour themes Unique features of the Black Badge over the standard Spectre EV include what the brand calls an Illuminated Fascia, which comprises over 5,500 ‘stars’ of varying proportions and intensity, set in a piano black dashboard. Additionally, there are 5 colour themes for the driver’s display – Vivid Grellow, Neon Nights, Cyan Fire, Ultraviolet and Synth Wave – and plenty of cabin bits are finished in either carbon fibre or metal.
