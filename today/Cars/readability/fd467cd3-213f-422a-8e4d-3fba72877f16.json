  "description": "It’s not often that a long-termer is this hard to let go of. But the Hyundai Ioniq 5 isn’t just any car – it’s one of those rare machines that leaves a lasting impression. It was our 2024 Autocar Car of the Year, and over the six months I’ve had it, it’s reaffirmed exactly why. At a glance, it’s the design that turns heads. The pixelated lights, origami-like lines and retro-futuristic vibe make it look like it’s straight out of Blade Runner. But what truly won me over was the cabin. Step inside, and it’s like entering a concept car that actually made it to production. Absence of transmission tunnel frees up space in front. The flat floor afforded by the dedicated E-GMP skateboard platform opens up a generous sense of space, made even airier by a minimalist, lounge-like design. Clever packaging abounds – the central console isn’t fixed; it slides fore and aft, and that’s more than just a party trick. On one occasion, boxed in by another car on the driver’s side, I was able to slide across from the passenger side into the driver’s seat – try doing that in a conventional SUV! Hard buttons and touchscreen offer easy access to all functions. There’s a calming clarity to the way the cabin has been thought out. After spending time in some of the newer Indian EVs, where ergonomics feel like an afterthought, the Ioniq’s layout – with physical buttons where you want them and a crisp, easy-to-read touchscreen – is refreshingly intuitive. The graphics are elegant, the menus aren’t buried in complexity, and everything just works perfectly. Out on the road, the Ioniq 5 is every bit as polished as it looks. The ride quality is simply superb. Whether gliding over rutted urban roads or cruising the highway, it isolates you from the worst of our infrastructure. And yet, there’s no float. Body control is tight, the handling tidy, and it doesn’t wallow like some of the plusher EVs - in fact, I’ll stick my neck out and say the ride is better sorted than many of Mercedes’ electric SUVs, which tend to pitch and bounce more. Performance is brisk, too. The 217hp motor and instant torque mean overtakes are despatched with a flex of your right foot. But it’s not just fast – it’s smart about how it deploys that power. The regenerative braking is among the best-tuned I’ve experienced, with multiple levels and a one-pedal mode that feels natural and progressive. Crucially, the handover between regen and friction braking is seamless, with beautifully linear pedal feel – a benchmark that shows the difference between mature engineering and feature overload. Fantastic range makes Mumbai to Mahabaleshwar easy despite steep 40km climb up the Ambenali Ghat, which sucked 119km of range. Then there’s the range. Real-world usability, not brochure figures, is what matters. As with all long-termers in our fleet, the Ioniq 5 was put through the Mahabaleshwar test – a 230km drive with a 1,200m elevation gain. I started with a full charge and a range readout of nearly 400km. By the time I got to Poladpur 180km later, I still had 225km of range left and an SOC of 56 percent. Confident in the reserves, I drove up the Poladpur Ghat in range-sapping Sport mode. The steep 40km climb cost me 119km of range and a 27 percent hit in charge, but I arrived with 29 percent left – good for over 100km. That level of predictability and honesty in the range meter is rare and reassuring. Charging from a 15A plug is slow; it took 19 hours to top up the battery from 29 percent SOC. Charging, of course, depends on where you are. In Mahabaleshwar, with only a 15A plug and a 3kW charge rate, it took nearly 19 hours to juice up. But since it’s a place I go to hibernate, I didn’t flinch. On long weekends, the Ioniq 5 proved to be the perfect companion: enough boot space, excellent comfort, and the range to go the distance without anxiety. Long wheelbase and width make Ioniq 5 tricky in tight spaces. In the city, its width can be a bit of a handful in tight lanes, and the massive 3,000mm wheelbase and no rear-wheel steer mean low-speed manoeuvrability is tricky. Also, those pristine white seats – plush as they are – are hard to keep clean. And a minor niggle: the storage shelf below the central console is unlit, making it a black hole at night. But these are small compromises in what’s otherwise an incredibly well-rounded package. Light-coloured seats get stained easily and are hard to maintain. More than anything, the Ioniq 5 is a statement – not just of style or tech, but of Hyundai’s coming of age. Two decades ago, it would’ve been unthinkable to use Hyundai and “world-beating” in the same sentence. Today, it’s a reality. The Ioniq 5 is proof that the company now belongs on the global EV main stage. It’s not just a good Hyundai – it’s a damn good car, period. And one I’ll miss dearly.
