The twin-turbo V-8 packs 740 hp and the ability to hurl the 750S to 60 mph in just 2.3 seconds—it was the quickest rear-drive car Car and Driver had ever tested until the new Corvette ZR1 showed up. The hydraulic suspension will dance along a canyon road and the superbly precise steering is lovely to use. Better still, few supercars can provide a level of comfort this good when the road turns rough. And if a normal 750S isn’t enough, bespoke customizing is available with McLaren Special Operations (MSO). MSO offers plenty of unique paint and trim choices as well as 12 different preset packages to choose from.Hot Flashes: McLaren 750S Tested18Ford Mustang GTD: $327,960It might seem odd to include the Ford Mustang on a list of the world’s most expensive cars. But this is no ordinary Mustang. The Mustang GTD is a road-worthy version of Ford’s Mustang GT3 racer that’s been freed from sanctioning body restrictions. In other words, it’s completely mad. The GTD uses a supercharged 5.2-liter V-8 that sends 815 horsepower to the rear tires through an eight-speed dual-clutch transaxle. The bodywork has been designed expressly for aerodynamics and enhanced downforce. And just about every panel is carbon fiber. In fact, that giant rear wing produces more downforce at 150 mph than a Porsche 911 GT3 RS can. This is a very special car whose life does start on the Mustang assembly line. But the majority of what makes this car special ends up happening later at Multimatic’s facility in Canada. That includes the car’s exotic racing-level pushrod suspension components. Ford has proven that this car is no bench racer. The GTD lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife in 6:52, making it the fourth-fastest production car to ever lap the famed track.Video: Mustang GTD Returns to the 'Ring, Sets a Much Better TimeAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below17Cadillac Celestiq: $340,000 (est)Cadillac’s new flagship takes aim at the pointiest end of the luxury-car market—an exclusive domain once reserved for the most expensive European brands. This hyper-priced Cadillac is electric and rides on a massively long chassis wrapped in bodywork that exudes a presence on the road unlike anything Cadillac has produced in the last half-century. This is a hand-built car, and it seems likely that no two will be completely alike since buyers personalize their Celestiq when ordering. Inside, the massive Cadillac has a 55-inch screen that houses the digital gauge cluster and infotainment system. The materials here go far beyond anything offered in a conventional Caddy. Expect about 300 miles of driving range and a 60-mph time of just under 4.0 seconds.Driven: The Celestiq Raises the Bar into Low-Earth Orbit16Ferrari 296: $346,950It would be unkind to simply refer to the 296 as an “entry-level” Ferrari. Especially when it costs nearly $350,000, can shoot to 60 mph in under 2.5 seconds, and has a design that is arguably the most beautiful of all current Ferraris. The plug-in hybrid powertrain consists of a turbocharged V-6 with an 8500 rpm redline and generates a total of 819 hp. The 6.0-kWh battery sits underfloor and can provide about 7 miles of electric-only driving. And like all Ferraris, this one provides an exhilarating experience when the road bends. Opting for the droptop GTS requires an additional $33,000, but the aural experience of the GTS singing along on a great road with the top down is probably worth it.The New 296 Speciale Is Even Lighter and MightierAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below15Rolls-Royce Ghost: $357,750The Ghost is the perfect sedan for luxury buyers who want all the opulence of a Rolls-Royce but don’t need a car that’s as large as the Phantom. The Ghost is updated for 2025 with a fresh look, a new interior, and a beautiful screen that runs across the dash. There’s an upgraded rear-seat entertainment system, too, that allows each passenger to stream their own shows. The all-wheel-drive Ghost hits all the right notes when it comes to the greasy bits thanks to the 563-hp V-12 (shared with the Cullinan), but brings with it serious tech. There’s a four-wheel-steering system and a camera-based adaptive suspension that changes suspension settings before the car hits a pothole or speedbump. The result? One of the creamiest rides of any four-door.More Info on the Ghost14Rolls-Royce Spectre: $397,750The core attributes of Rolls Royce cars seem to match up perfectly with electric powertrains. EVs deliver loads of torque and are dead quiet, too—just as a proper Roller should be. But no Rolls-Royce ever been as quiet as the electric Spectre. It’s a virtual fortress of solitude. And this fortress is quick, with its dual electric motors with a total output of 577 hp getting it to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds. The electric powertrain allows for a range of 266 miles, too. The big four-place luxury coupe is as swanky on the inside as one might imagine, and it offers nearly endless personalization in terms of wood, leather, and metal trim. And when you select the flagship Black Badge model and tick a few options, it’s not hard to hit a sticker price around $500,000.Tested: The Spectre Is Both Absurd and SublimeAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below13Rolls-Royce Cullinan: $407,750The Cullinan is the most expensive SUV you can buy. And it’s also one of the most powerful, thanks to the silky-smooth, near-600-hp twin-turbo V-12. The three-ton beast comes standard with all-wheel drive, but off-roading certainly isn’t the focus. No, like most Rolls-Royce models, the Cullinan exists to pamper its occupants with fine furnishings. The updated interior has a full-width glass instrument panel on the dash to serve gauge-cluster and infotainment duties. The optional Viewing Suite—a pair of leather seats and a table fitted to the tailgate—is probably a great way to watch a fox hunt or polo match. You could even use it for tailgating at an NFL game, if that’s not too déclassé. More Info on the Updated 2025 Model12Aston Martin Vanquish: $432,700There was a time when every major manufacturer built grand-touring cars. In today’s world, they are rare. But the new Aston Martin Vanquish is one of the best of the breed. GT cars are machines designed to cover long distances in ultimate comfort and speed. And this Aston hits that second part hard. With its 823-hp V-12, the coupe can hit 60 mph in a claimed 3.0 seconds and reach 214 mph, according to Aston Martin. Probably of equal importance to this buyer is the Vanquish’s opulent cabin with dual 10.3-inch displays and fine materials. There’s an optional cashmere headliner and, of course, custom-fitted luggage to maximize space.Driven: The Aston Martin Vanquish Returns to the TopAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below11Ferrari Purosangue: $433,686Now that nearly every manufacturer has something resembling an SUV, the thought of a taller, four-door Ferrari doesn’t seem as off-brand. In fact, it makes total sense. The good news is that the Purosangue isn’t some wallowing trucklet with a Ferrari badge. Ferrari would never have allowed that. Instead, here is a precise machine with a wailing 715-hp V-12 engine up front and handling that feels very much like a true sports car thanks to its active suspension system. The potent V-12 gets the Ferrari to 60 mph in just over 3.0 seconds and on to a top speed of 193 mph. The all-wheel-drive Purosangue is muscular, stylish, and turns heads like few cars can. On the inside, the near-half-million-dollar SUV has room for four passengers and enough cargo space for their luggage. And that helps make this Ferrari one of the best grand-touring vehicles in the world.We Take a Spin in the Purosangue in California10Ferrari 12Cilindri: $470,950Until the 12Cilindri debuted, no other Ferrari had quite managed to capture the essence of the classic Daytona and modernize it. But the 12Cilindri does just that. From many angles, this is a very pretty car. Better still, the 12Cilindri is available as a coupe or convertible and comes with a glorious 819-hp V-12 that’s naturally aspirated and free from hybridization. It’s a safe bet to assume it will reach 60 mph in less than 3.0 seconds, all the while delivering a sound so delicious that you’ll want to hit that 9500 rpm redline any chance you get. But this supercar isn’t meant for track days, so it has a suspension tuned for a GT-like ride and a cabin trimmed for style and comfort.Driven: The 12Cilindri Belts Out a Classic TuneAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below9Rolls-Royce Phantom: $517,750The Rolls-Royce Phantom has the distinction of being the most expensive car on this list whose main purpose is comfort instead of speed. This is the biggest Roller in the automaker’s stable, and the one that makes riding in the back seat a real event. Deep, plush carpeting and massive expanses of soft leather and pricey wood make this interior space unlike any other in the car world. There’s even a long-wheelbase model for an extra 8.6 inches of space, and the rear doors are hinged at the back for maximum drama (and ease) when entering and exiting. Quick exits are entirely possible thanks to the 563-hp V-12 engine. But don’t expect to hear that big V-12 from inside the cabin, because the Phantom is an isolation chamber on wheels.Take a Closer Look at the Ultra-Exclusive Scintilla Model8Ferrari SF90: $593,950One look at the wild SF90 and it’s clear that this Ferrari hypercar is designed for serious track work. But what might not be clear is that this machine’s strong 769-hp 4.0-liter V-8 is boosted by three electric motors for a total of 989 hp and the ability to hit 60 mph in 2.0 seconds. The even more track-focused, near-million-dollar XX model has 1016 hp. Like all exclusive Ferraris, the SF90 is built in small numbers. It’s likely that nearly all of them have already been snapped up by some of Ferrari’s best customers. If you ever have the chance to slide behind the wheel of an SF90, it will be a ride you won’t soon forget.The Ferrari SF90 XX Brings the Track to the StreetAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below7Lamborghini Revuelto: $608,358If there’s one manufacturer that’s known for building poster-worthy exotic rides, it’s Lamborghini. The company practically invented the idea of the exotic sports car back in the ’70s with the Countach. And today’s new Revuelto is in many ways an evolution of that icon. The styling is just as wild as you’d want from a flagship Lambo. And under the engine cover sits a glorious, mid-mounted V-12. Of course, these days that 12-cylinder monster is augmented by electric motors to produce a mind-melting 1001 hp. That’s good for a 2.2 second sprint to 60 mph, with less than 10 seconds needed to hit 150 mph. This latest Lambo has tech including rear-wheel steering and torque vectoring at each corner to improve agility over the old Aventador. Need more exclusivity? Just wait. Lambo is certain to have even more special (and expensive) versions in the works. The Revuelto Takes On our Lightning Lap Test6Aston Martin Valhalla: $1,000,000 (est)Aston’s latest hypercar is a true racing machine for the road. And it should arrive in well-heeled Aston customer garages in the second half of this year. The Valhalla is fashioned from lightweight materials (like the carbon-fiber chassis) and uses active aero to press the seven-figure Aston to the road at higher speeds. That speed comes from a Mercedes-AMG 4.0-liter flat-plane-crank V-8 fitted to a dual-clutch transmission sending power to the rear wheels. There are two electric motors driving the front wheels (with a third one in the transmission). In total, Aston says the Valhalla develops 1064 hp and is estimated to reach 62 mph in just 2.5 seconds. But beyond all that power and speed (as well as its 9 or so miles of electric-only range), the Valhalla is one sexy beast.How We'd Spec the Valhalla for OurselvesAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below5McLaren W1: $2,100,000There’s been a hole in McLaren’s lineup since the P1 left the range around a decade ago. The new W1 promises to be a proper successor to that world-dominating hypercar. McLaren will make only 399 of them. Like more than a few cars on this list, it uses a carbon-fiber chassis as well as an absurdly powerful hybrid powertrain. In McLaren’s case, that means a 916-hp 4.0-liter V-8 (that can rev to 9200 rpm) paired to a 342-hp electric motor. Yep, the W1 has a total of 1258 hp on tap. McLaren says that this astonishingly quick machine can hit 186 mph in just 12.7 seconds. Inside, practically everything adjusts—from the instrument binnacle to the steering wheel and pedals—to help the driver find just the right seating position. Although the price starts at just over $2 million, the company says the customization options are nearly limitless. And that, of course, means more money.The W1 Is the Most Powerful McLaren Ever4Pagani Utopia: $2,190,000Many of the hypercars here are breaking new ground in terms of tech. But Pagani’s latest creation takes a step back and prioritizes simplicity, lightness, and driving fun. Like the very first Pagani more than 25 years ago, this new one uses a Mercedes-AMG–sourced V-12 engine. Now breathing through twin turbos with numerous bespoke components, the 6.0-liter, 852-hp beast can be paired to either a seven-speed manual (!) or an automated manual transmission. You know which one we’d pick. And while the Utopia is capable of stunning speeds on road or track, we've spent time with the car and found it to be quite civilized too. Either way, this is one very pretty car. And that carries on to the interior too, where the metallic elements are artistically crafted.Pagani Utopia Driven: Art in the MachineAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below3Ferrari Daytona SP3: $2,223,935The Daytona SP3 might be the most achingly beautiful hypercar in Ferrari’s recent history. It takes just enough inspiration from Ferrari’s glorious 1960s racing cars and melds that with modern aesthetics. We wouldn’t change a thing. Under that voluptuous bodywork is the Ferrari engine traditionalists want—a 6.5-liter V-12 that revs to 9500 rpm and packs 829 hp. Yes, the Daytona SP3 sounds just as good as it looks. Aside from the eye-watering price, only a few will ever see the road. Ferrari is making just 599 of them.Driven: The Daytona SP3 Basks in Reflected Glory2Ferrari F80: $3,100,000The new Ferrari F80 promises to be a proper successor to the range-topping Ferraris of the past such as the LaFerrari, the F50, and the F40. But don’t expect to find a V-12 driving the rear wheels here. The F80 is all-wheel drive and uses a twin-turbo V-6 plug-in hybrid powertrain. Ferrari says the F80’s insane total output of 1184 hp is enough to hurl it to 124 mph in just 5.8 seconds. The company has borrowed some tech from its racing teams. And there’s an active damping system for the suspension that uses 48-volt electrical motors and can adjust the car’s ride height. The active aero system means there’s a serious amount of downforce available—over a ton at 155 mph. Ferrari will build less than 1000 of these cars, so get your order in now if you have a spare few million dollars floating around.The F80 Is Twice the F40 and Then SomeAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below1Bugatti Tourbillon: $4,600,000 (est)The Bugatti Chiron was an epic machine. And it came with a base price of around $3 million. For those that had the opportunity to drive one, it delivered a dizzying experience, with the kind of thrust that could make you feel nauseous and giddy all at once. Well Bugatti is back with an all-new model, the hybridized Tourbillion. It packs a mad 1775 horsepower. Sixty mph is said to arrive in just 2.0 seconds. And yes, most of that power comes from a new 8.3-liter V-16. This is a PHEV, so the Tourbillion can travel around 30 miles on electric power, which isn’t bad for a hypercar. The muscular and handsome Tourbillion looks like no other car on the road—just like every Bugatti that has come before it.

Instead, here is a precise machine with a wailing 715-hp V-12 engine up front and handling that feels very much like a true sports car thanks to its active suspension system. The potent V-12 gets the Ferrari to 60 mph in just over 3.0 seconds and on to a top speed of 193 mph. The all-wheel-drive Purosangue is muscular, stylish, and turns heads like few cars can.

But beyond all that power and speed (as well as its 9 or so miles of electric-only range), the Valhalla is one sexy beast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63186135/how-wed-spec-it-2026-aston-martin-valhalla/\" target=\"_blank\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a63186135/how-wed-spec-it-2026-aston-martin-valhalla/\" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"How We\u0026#39;d Spec the Valhalla for Ourselves\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\"\u003eHow We\u0026#39;d Spec the Valhalla for Ourselves\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-unblur=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection data-ad-index=\"7\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-inner-container\" data-journey-content=\"true\" id=\"slide-15\" data-anchor-id=\"slide-15\" data-journey-listicle-slide=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-item-title\"\u003eMcLaren W1: $2,100,000\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-item-meta\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s been a hole in McLaren’s lineup since the P1 left the range around a decade ago. The new W1 promises to be a proper successor to that world-dominating hypercar. McLaren will make only 399 of them. Like more than a few cars on this list, it uses a carbon-fiber chassis as well as an absurdly powerful hybrid powertrain. In McLaren’s case, that means a 916-hp 4.0-liter V-8 (that can rev to 9200 rpm) paired to a 342-hp electric motor. Yep, the W1 has a total of 1258 hp on tap. McLaren says that this astonishingly quick machine can hit 186 mph in just 12.7 seconds. Inside, practically everything adjusts—from the instrument binnacle to the steering wheel and pedals—to help the driver find just the right seating position. Although the price starts at just over $2 million, the company says the customization options are nearly limitless. And that, of course, means more money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a62499628/2026-mclaren-w1-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a62499628/2026-mclaren-w1-revealed/\" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"The W1 Is the Most Powerful McLaren Ever\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\"\u003eThe W1 Is the Most Powerful McLaren Ever\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-inner-container\" data-journey-content=\"true\" id=\"slide-16\" data-anchor-id=\"slide-16\" data-journey-listicle-slide=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-item-title\"\u003ePagani Utopia: $2,190,000\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-item-meta\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of the hypercars here are breaking new ground in terms of tech. But Pagani’s latest creation takes a step back and prioritizes simplicity, lightness, and driving fun. Like the very first Pagani more than 25 years ago, this new one uses a Mercedes-AMG–sourced V-12 engine. Now breathing through twin turbos with numerous bespoke components, the 6.0-liter, 852-hp beast can be paired to either a seven-speed manual (!) or an automated manual transmission. You know which one we’d pick. And while the Utopia is capable of stunning speeds on road or track, we\u0026#39;ve spent time with the car and found it to be quite civilized too. Either way, this is one very pretty car. And that carries on to the interior too, where the metallic elements are artistically crafted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a63305211/2024-pagani-utopia-drive/\" target=\"_blank\" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a63305211/2024-pagani-utopia-drive/\" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=\"Pagani Utopia Driven: Art in the Machine\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-vars-ga-ux-element=\"Hyperlink\"\u003ePagani Utopia Driven: Art in the Machine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-unblur=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003csection data-ad-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-inner-container\" data-journey-content=\"true\" id=\"slide-17\" data-anchor-id=\"slide-17\" data-journey-listicle-slide=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-item-title\"\u003eFerrari Daytona SP3: $2,223,935\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cdiv data-theme-key=\"listicle-slide-item-meta\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Daytona SP3 might be the most achingly beautiful hypercar in Ferrari’s recent history. It takes just enough inspiration from Ferrari’s glorious 1960s racing cars and melds that with modern aesthetics. We wouldn’t change a thing. Under that voluptuous bodywork is the Ferrari engine traditionalists want—a 6.5-liter V-12 that revs to 9500 rpm and packs 829 hp. Yes, the Daytona SP3 sounds just as good as it looks. Aside from the eye-watering price, only a few will ever see the road.

But don’t expect to find a V-12 driving the rear wheels here. The F80 is all-wheel drive and uses a twin-turbo V-6 plug-in hybrid powertrain. Ferrari says the F80’s insane total output of 1184 hp is enough to hurl it to 124 mph in just 5.8 seconds. The company has borrowed some tech from its racing teams. And there’s an active damping system for the suspension that uses 48-volt electrical motors and can adjust the car’s ride height. The active aero system means there’s a serious amount of downforce available—over a ton at 155 mph.

This is a PHEV, so the Tourbillion can travel around 30 miles on electric power, which isn’t bad for a hypercar.
