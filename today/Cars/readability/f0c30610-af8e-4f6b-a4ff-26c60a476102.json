  "text": "A major change is in the works for BMW's mid-size sedan March 12, 2025 at 20:26 by Michael Gauthier BMW is working on a facelifted 5-Series that has Neue Klasse styling cues. The front end is all-new and we can also expect a revamped interior. The car could have an upgraded six-cylinder engine as well as improved PHEV and EV options. Spy photographers snapped the first photos of the facelifted BMW M5 last month and now we’re getting a glimpse at the mainstream sedan. It adopts an all-new front fascia as part of a radical Neue Klasse makeover, which marks a major shift for the automaker. The changes are immediately apparent as the twin kidney grille gives way to a new design that flows into restyled headlights. While the exact look is hard to describe, it should echo the Vision Neue Klasse. More: The 2027 BMW M5 And 5-Series Could Look Like This While the ‘grille’ draws attention, the car has also been equipped with a revised bumper featuring a new mid-mounted intake. The lower intake has also been revamped as it now features a prominent vertical bar in the center. The rest of the design is far more evolutionary and mirrors a traditional facelift. As a result, we can expect new taillights and an updated rear bumper. Baldauf Spy photographers haven’t gotten a good look inside yet, but the sedan will likely adopt Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X. Both were previewed at CES and will see future models equipped with a customizable pillar-to-pillar display that resides beneath the windshield. The display is broken up into multiple sections and it should be joined by a central infotainment system as well as a new multifunction steering wheel, which effectively replaces the hated iDrive controller. Under the hood, we can expect a mix of familiar and upgraded engines. The 2.0-liter TwinPower Turbo four-cylinder could continue to produce 255 hp (190 kW / 259 PS) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque, but the 3.0-liter TwinPower Turbo inline-six might be upgraded to develop 393 hp (293 kW / 398 PS) and 428 lb-ft (580 Nm) of torque. That would be an increase of 18 hp (13 kW / 18 PS) and 30 lb-ft (41 Nm). We also wouldn’t be surprised to see upgraded plug-in hybrid and electric variants, but less is known about them at this point. Speaking of which, we can expect a debut mid- to late next year.",
