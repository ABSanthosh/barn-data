  "text": "Jun 28, 2025 8:00 PM EDTThe EV four-door race has begun The competition in the world of high-performance electric sedans is heating up, and two of its hottest competitors cannot be any more different from each other.  In the blue corner is the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT. When it debuted, the Porsche’s hardcore 1,093 horsepower super electric sedan achieved a record-setting lap time around the Nürburgring. However, in the red corner is the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra, the first high-performance vehicle from an emerging Chinese consumer electronics giant-turned EV powerhouse. Despite being a fraction of the Porsche’s price, Xiaomi’s SU7 Ultra managed to pack more power and beat not only the Porsche on the Nordschleife, but also vehicles costing upwards of seven figures. Now, Mercedes-AMG has an answer to both. In the past, it shoehorned lots of horsepower under the hood of luxurious Mercedes-branded vehicles, but recently, it turned a heel toward electrification. The culmination of this is showcased in what it calls the Concept AMG GT XX. The EV from Affalterbach In an announcement on June 25, Mercedes-AMG virtually unveiled its latest creation, a fastback-styled high-performance electric sedan called the Concept AMG GT XX. According to the boffins at Affalterbach, the concept is meant to preview the first vehicle built on its dedicated, AMG-specific AMG Electric Architecture (AMG.EA) EV platform. Underneath its skin, the GT XX’s advanced electric platform features an 800-volt architecture capable of high performance even while charging. AMG says that the GT XX is powered by a bespoke NCMA battery pack that uses Formula 1 technology and features direct-cooled cylindrical battery cells for better heat management. Additionally, it can be charged up to add nearly 250 miles (400 km) of range in about five minutes at 850 kW.  Power goes to all four wheels through two electric drive units (EDUs), which together contain three axial-flux electric motors: two located at the rear and one at the front. All together, the trio of motors makes for a top speed of 223 miles per hour and a combined 1,340 horsepower, which is about 247 more than the Porsche’s output of 1,093 horsepower, but still short of the Xiaomi SU7 Ultra’s 1,548 horsepower. AMG says that these oil-cooled electric motors are efficiently integrated within the EDUs, and each is equipped with its own planetary gearset and water-cooled inverter.  Mercedes describes these EDUs working together as an all-wheel-drive system featuring torque vectoring and full-on disengagement that operates in accordance with driving conditions. The rear motors serve as the car’s primary power source, while the front EDU disengages during coasting and low-speed cruising to optimize efficiency.  A unique, but aerodynamic face From the pictures, the CONCEPT AMG GT XX is a striking sports car design that combines a few unique design languages to turn heads with its fastback shape, low hood, and sleek windshield, all highlighted by a vibrant sunset beam orange finish. From the front, the GT XX features a flat and wide profile signature and distinctive Mercedes design cues like its oversized grille with an integrated Mercedes star, as well as motorsport-inspired details, like air outlets in the hood to optimize airflow and a prominent front splitter that enhances aerodynamics. The side profile looks eerily similar to Xiaomi’s SU7 from certain angles, and the rear is defined by a triple set of circular taillamps, a wide carbon diffuser, and an active airbrake. The Concept AMG GT XX even has speakers in its headlights, which pump out ambient driving sounds to keep pedestrians aware of its presence and enhance the driving experience. Despite its funny looks, AMG says that the GT XX is very aerodynamic. It claims a drag coefficient of 0.198, which makes it more aerodynamic than the limited edition AMG ONE and Tesla Model S, and is close to other contemporary EVs like the Xiaomi SU7 and the Lucid Air. AMG claims that the secret to the magic number is aerodynamic retractable wheel covers. These covers consist of five carbon-fiber panels that form a star shape and move outward and retract electrically as needed for brake cooling or optimal airflow.  Inside, the AMG GT XX features carbon fiber bucket seats with racing harnesses and custom cushioning that can be made from a customer’s body scan for optimum bolstering. To keep with the theme of efficiency, the textiles used in the interior are made with worn GT3 race tires, while hints of orange add a pop of color to the otherwise dark cabin. Like with most EVs, a large dual-tablet display is the centrepiece in front of the driver, and an F1-style yoke steering wheel with twistable selectors and paddle shifters adds more racing flair.  Final thoughts Mercedes-AMG has not released any details on when a production version of the AMG GT XX will be released, but it is expected that many of the details will be incorporated into the final version for series production. In its statement about the car, Mercedes-AMG CEO Michael Schiebe defended that the car “is a true AMG with every fiber of its being,” adding that “the heart of an AMG was always the motor, and that will remain so with our in-house electric architecture.”  Though it may be a tough sell to AMG loyalists, the Concept GT XX shows that Affalterbach is primed and ready to play ball in any game it can get in on, even if it includes electrons.
