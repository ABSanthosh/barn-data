The car is finished in Crystal Antimony Grey Metallic over black semi-aniline leather and Alcantara upholstery and is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter M155 V8 paired with an AMG Speedshift R five-speed automatic transmission. Further equipment includes forged 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, side-exit exhaust pipes, and butterfly doors as well as a carbon-fiber front splitter, seats, and interior trim. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this SLR McLaren 722 has 15k miles and is now offered in California with manufacturer’s literature, a trickle charger, and a clean Montana title. The 722 Edition of the SLR McLaren was introduced in 2006, and its numerical designation is a nod to Sir Sterling Moss and Denis Jenkinson’s Mille Miglia–winning 300 SLR that bore the number. The cars featured red 722 fender badges as well as aerodynamic enhancements including a carbon-fiber front splitter, a revised rear diffuser, and an adjusted extension angle for the rear airbrake. This example is finished in Crystal Antimony Grey Metallic (701), a color that was available only on 722 models. The xenon headlights and LED taillights are accompanied by indicator modules painted in Palladium Grey, and further details include integrated fog lights and upward-opening butterfly doors as well as twin side-exit exhaust outlets behind each front wheel. The forged 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels feature centers painted in Palladium Grey as well as silver-finished rims. Continental Contisportcontact tires measuring 255/35 are paired with 295/30 Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber out back. The brake system utilizes carbon-ceramic rotors with a larger diameter than the standard SLR model along with eight-piston front calipers and four-piston rear calipers finished in red. The 722 Edition models came with a specially tuned suspension system featuring stiffer springs and shock absorbers as well as a ride height 10mm lower than standard variants. Black semi-aniline leather and Alcantara with red accent stitching covers the power-adjustable carbon-fiber seats along with the steering wheel, dash, center console, and door panels. The seats feature embossed  “722” insignias and are accompanied by red seatbelts, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. The starter button is located atop the shift knob, and additional appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control along with a Bose sound system linked with a cassette stereo and a trunk-mounted CD changer. The sport steering wheel features shift paddles and frames McLaren-branded instrumentation including a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 15k miles. The AMG-developed front-mid-mounted 5.4-liter M155 V8 features a Lysholm-type twin-screw supercharger, two intercoolers, and a dry-sump lubrication system. The engine was modified for 722 models to produce 641 horsepower and 605 lb-ft of torque, an increase from the standard SLR model’s 617 horsepower. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an AMG Speedshift R five-speed automatic transmission. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
