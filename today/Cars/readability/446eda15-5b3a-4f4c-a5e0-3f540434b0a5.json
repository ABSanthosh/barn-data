Optional equipment includes a carbon-fiber rear cargo floor and shift paddles as well as a One-77 steering wheel, and the car is further equipped with carbon-fiber exterior trim, swan doors, 20\" five-spoke alloy wheels, an active damping system, and front and rear parking sensors. Inside, the cabin features heated and ventilated seats, rear parcel shelves, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, and an infotainment system with a pop-up display. The car was previously sold on BaT in June 2024 and was acquired by the current owner in 2025. This Zagato Shooting brake now has 3,500 miles and is offered on dealer consignment in New Jersey with a window sticker, the owner's manual, an Aston Martin-branded umbrella, a glass Emotion Control Unit (ECU) key fob, a car cover, and a clean Montana title.",

Inside, the cabin features heated and ventilated seats, rear parcel shelves, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, and an infotainment system with a pop-up display. The car was previously sold on BaT in June 2024 and was acquired by the current owner in 2025. This Zagato Shooting brake now has 3,500 miles and is offered on dealer consignment in New Jersey with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, an Aston Martin-branded umbrella, a glass Emotion Control Unit (ECU) key fob, a car cover, and a clean Montana title. Aston announced a new collaboration with Zagato in 2016, resulting in four different body styles based on the contemporary Vanquish. The shooting brake was the last of the four body styles to be revealed and utilized a Rapide rear-end structure to provide an extended wheelbase and a lower-slung fuel tank position to allow for a flat load cargo area. The Zagato-styled shooting brake bodywork is finished in Scorching Black and incorporates a double-bubble carbon fiber roof, a Z-patterned front grille, Zagato badging, and taillight reflectors with blade-style LEDs. Additional exterior details include carbon-fiber exterior trim, swan doors, xenon headlights, a rear spoiler, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, and integrated exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the hood, fenders, rocker panels, mirror caps, and front bumper cover. The 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 255/35 front and 305/30 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. The car is equipped with a three-stage adaptive damping system, and braking is handled by black Aston Martin-branded calipers over ventilated carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The heated and ventilated seats are trimmed in two-tone Pure Black and Sahara Tan Bridge of Weir leather, and Z-pattern stitching extends to the seat backs, lower bolsters, and door panels. Additional interior appointments include a carbon-fiber rear cargo floor, rear parcel shelves, a Bang \u0026 Olufsen BeoSound sound system, and an infotainment system with a pop-up screen and navigation. Paint protection film and a carpeted mat cover the carbon-fiber cargo floor. The One-77-style steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted carbon-fiber shift paddles and frames a 240-mph speedometer, a reverse-sweep 8k-rpm tachometer, auxiliary gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature, and twin digital readouts. The digital odometer indicates 3,500 miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership. The 5.9-liter AM29 V12 was factory rated at 580 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a rear-mounted Touchtronic 3 eight-speed automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The battery was replaced in July 2024. A copy of the window sticker shows standard and optional equipment along with a total suggested retail price of $877,916. Accessories will also accompany the car.
