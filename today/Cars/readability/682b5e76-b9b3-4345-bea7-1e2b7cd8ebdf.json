  "text": "The new AUDI brand will make a splash in Shanghai with their first production model April 16, 2025 at 20:41 by Michael Gauthier Audi is looking to make a splash at the Shanghai Auto Show with five debuts. The star of the show is the E5 Sportback, which is AUDI’s first production model. Visitors can also check out the new A5L, A5L Sportback, Q5L, and A6L e-tron. Audi’s Chinese AUDI brand reeks of desperation, but they’re gearing up to introduce their first production model at the Shanghai Auto Show. It’s the AUDI E5 Sportback and it was previewed by a concept last year. Set to be launched this summer, the road-going model is a mid-sized EV with a “coupe design.” The company didn’t go into many specifics, but it appears to remain pretty faithful to the original as we can see a familiar front fascia, streamlined bodywork, and flush-mounted door handles. They’re joined by digital rearview mirrors and what appears to be a roof-mounted lidar sensor. More: Audi Launches New AUDI Brand Without Four-Ring Logo In China AUDI is staying tight-lipped, but claimed the “brand and car are tailored for a new generation of Chinese customers.” That’s not much to go on, but the model presumably measures 191.7 inches (4,870 mm) long, which would make it 4.8 inches (122 mm) shorter than the redesigned A6. The E5 Sportback is slated to ride on the Advanced Digitized Platform and could have a powertrain that mimics last year’s concept. It had a dual motor all-wheel drive system developing 764 hp (570 kW / 775 PS) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) of torque. This enabled the car to accelerate from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 3.6 seconds, while the 100 kWh battery pack provided a CLTC range of 435 miles (700 km). Besides the E5 Sportback, Audi will unveil an assortment of extended wheelbase models for China. These include the A5L, A5L Sportback, Q5L, and A6L e-tron.",
