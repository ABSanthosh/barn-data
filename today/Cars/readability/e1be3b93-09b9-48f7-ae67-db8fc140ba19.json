  "text": "This Bimmer shows how important carbon fiber and black accents on a car like this can be June 16, 2025 at 21:14 by Brad Anderson The BMW M3 in question has an unusual green wrap paired with white body parts. The front splitter, canards, and side skirts are painted white, making them stand out. When BMW launched the new M3 and M4 nearly five years ago, their massive kidney grilles became the center of a heated debate. At the time, we couldn’t decide if they were avant-garde design or just an exercise in automotive hubris. Fast forward to today, and those grilles aren’t exactly winning any design awards, but they’ve at least earned a place in the car world’s big, awkward family photo. This particular M3, however, is testing our limits in a whole new way. Or, perhaps, it’s proving that BMW’s designers really knew exactly what they were doing all along. Read: BMW Has Quietly Raised M3 Prices Nearly $10K Since 2021 Photos of this M3 recently made their way onto Reddit and other social media channels, and let’s just say the mods are, well, some of the strangest we’ve seen on a BMWWe give the owner props for making their car unique and overhauling it to ensure it stands out, but really? The first aspect of the car that stands out is the paint scheme, or the wrap. Most of the body is finished in a very subtle shade of green. This color, in isolation, isn’t too bad. However, it’s the rest of the bodywork that’s weird. The roof, part of the hood, the M3 CS-inspired grille, front splitter, canards, side skirts, and wheels, are all painted white. Ordinarily, parts like these would be finished in carbon fiber or gloss black, serving to contrast the green paint nicely. But, because they’re white, they make the entire car look rather cheap. The white parts also continue at the rear with the diffuser and the lip spoiler on the trunk lid. It almost looks as though some of the car’s aero appendages have just been primed and are waiting to be painted. If they were black or carbon, we suspect they might look much better. Some of the parts are a little too excessive, including the canards and that crazy front splitter. At the end of the day, we can appreciate the effort to make this M3 stand out, but we can’t help but wonder if it would have been better to keep things closer to stock. A little less white, a little more carbon, and maybe a bit more subtlety would have done wonders for this project. Do you agree, or do you think this M3’s modifications hit the mark?
