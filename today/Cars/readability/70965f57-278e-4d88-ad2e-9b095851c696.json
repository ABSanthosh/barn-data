  "text": "Published:  June 26th, 2025 Matthew had some fun with his Fast and Furious list today -- and now I want to hear from you.What was your favorite vehicle from the Fast and Furious series? This is where I admit, again, that I pretty much haven't seen any of the movies save for the first one -- and once, years ago, Tokyo Drift. I think I've seen parts of the second movie, as well.Since I've seen the first one multiple times, I will be predictable and go with either Brian's Supra or Dom's Charger. I suppose I have a soft spot for poor Jessie's Mk.3 Volkswagen Jetta, and I think it's cool that a Ford Lightning gets used as a work truck.Actually, scratch the above -- maybe it's the Chevelle SS that speaks to me, since my mom had a Chevelle (though not an SS) before I was born, and since I've always loved the looks of the Chevelle SS. OK, I am obviously being indecisive. Maybe you'll do better than me. What's your favorite vehicle from the flicks -- and to keep it manageable, let's restrict it to four-wheeled, non-military vehicles. I've heard the later movies get a bit insane with planes, military stuff, and whatever else.Anyway, you know what to do. Sound off below.[Image: Nicolas Vignot/Shutterstock.com]Become a TTAC insider.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.
