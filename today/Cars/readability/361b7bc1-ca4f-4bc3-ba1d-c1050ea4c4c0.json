  "description": "Volkswagen opened bookings for the Golf GTI in India on May 5, 2025, and all 150 units from the first batch are already booked. Although it was earlier reported that 250 Golf GTI units would be imported, VW could only secure 150 units for the first lot, and allotments were made based on an online quiz. To qualify, participants had to score at least 4 out of 5, after which they got a pre-booking link limited to one entry per mobile number. It should be noted that these are pre-launch bookings, and cancellations may happen after the price is announced, giving others a chance to get an allocation.  Golf GTI will pack a 265hp, 2-litre turbo-petrol engine It has a 12.9-inch touchscreen similar to the one in the Tiguan R-Line The VW hatchback will come in four colour options Volkswagen Golf GTI price estimate, delivery timeline Price announcement likely in May As per our dealer sources, the Golf GTI’s on-road price is expected to be around Rs 60 lakh, and the official announcement will likely happen later this month. Deliveries will commence in June from select dealerships across India.   Volkswagen Golf GTI engine and gearbox 265hp 2-litre turbo petrol engine paired with 7DCT  The India-spec Volkswagen Golf GTI will have a 2-litre TSI engine generating an impressive 265hp and 370Nm of peak torque and will be the most powerful Volkswagen car in India, surpassing even the recently launched 204hp Tiguan R-Line SUV. The hot hatch will feature a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox that sends power to the front wheels and an electronically controlled front-axle differential lock. Golf GTI has a claimed 0-100kph time of just 5.9 seconds, with top speed electronically limited to 250kph. The car will rival the Mini Cooper S, which, for reference, has a 204hp 2-litre turbo-petrol engine and a 0 to 100kph sprint time of 6.6 seconds. Volkswagen Golf GTI exterior and interior highlights Exterior An illuminated VW logo sits between the LED headlights, while the front bumper has a large honeycomb-patterned air dam flanked by X-shaped fog lights. The Golf GTI gets a red ‘GTI’ badge on the front doors, with a strip bridging the headlamps and the brake callipers finished in the same colour. It rides on 18-inch alloy wheels, and the rear boasts smoked LED tail-lights, a prominent roof spoiler and twin exhaust tips. Volkswagen will offer the Golf GTI in four colours: Grenadilla Black, Oryx White, Moonstone Grey Black and Kings Red. Interior The Golf GTI’s cabin has a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with a GTI badge, paddle shifters, a 12.9-inch touchscreen and a 10.25-inch driver’s display (Digital Cockpit Pro in VW speak). Other highlights include a 7-speaker sound system, wireless charging, ambient lights and a panoramic sunroof. Additionally, it will come with tartan seat upholstery, just like the international model, and will include red accents for a sporty touch.
