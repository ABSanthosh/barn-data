It is finished in Basalt Black Metallic over black full leather and is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six that drives all four wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip rear differential. The car has 19″ Turbo wheels and an Alpine head unit, and additional equipment includes a black soft top, the Sport Chrono and Carbon packages, bi-xenon headlights, heated front seats, a Bose sound system, and automatic climate control. The car was acquired by the current owner in 2023 and has 90k miles. This 997.1 Turbo cabriolet is now offered in Canada on dealer consignment with a set of aftermarket wheels, a clean Carfax report, and Alberta registration. The car is finished in Basalt Black Metallic (C9Z) and features a black convertible soft top as well as bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, side air intakes, a rear spoiler, and flared quarter panels. The selling dealer reports the soft top was replaced due to vandalism and 3M paint protection film has been applied to the body. Turbo 19″ wheels are currently mounted on the car and fitted with Pirelli tires. A set of black-finished multi-spoke wheels with Michelin and Pirelli rubber is also included in the sale and pictured on the car in the gallery below. Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded six- and four-piston front and rear calipers over 13.8″ cross-drilled rotors. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) as well as Porsche Stability Management (PSM) with an automatic brake differential (ABD). The heated power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in black leather that extends throughout the cabin, and carbon-fiber trim accents the interior. Amenities include driver-seat memory settings, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, cruise control, Guards Red seat belts, illuminated carbon-fiber door sills, a fire extinguisher, a wind deflector, and an Alpine head unit with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. A radar detector has been fitted. Cracks are noted on the carbon-fiber door armrest trim. The leather- and carbon-fiber-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer and a 225-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 90k miles, approximately 7k of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged and intercooled 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six was factory rated at 480 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The Sport Chrono Package allows the 997.1 Turbo to overboost for up to 10 seconds, increasing peak-rated torque to 505 lb-ft. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip rear differential. The selling dealer notes a sport exhaust system has been added. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
