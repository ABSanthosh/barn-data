  "text": "This 2005 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren is powered by a supercharged 5.4-liter M155 V8 paired with an AMG Speedshift R five-speed automatic transmission and is finished in Crystal Galaxite Black over black Semi-Aniline leather. Equipment includes asymmetrical 19″ turbine-spoke alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic disc brakes, butterfly doors, xenon headlights, side-exit exhaust pipes, carbon-fiber seats, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Purchased by the owner in 2016, this SLR McLaren is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean New Hampshire title. The SLR was built with a carbon-fiber monocoque and crash structures. This example is finished in Crystal Galaxite Black and has upward-opening butterfly doors, xenon headlights, integrated fog lights, heated side mirrors, twin side-exit exhaust outlets behind each front wheel, a rear diffuser, and an electronically deployed rear spoiler air brake. Scrapes are noted on the underside of the front spoiler. Asymmetrical turbine-spoke 19″ alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Stopping power is provided by silver Mercedes-Benz-branded calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners, and the car is equipped with a Sensotronic Brake Control system (SBC). Black Semi-Aniline leather covers the power-adjustable carbon-fiber seats along with the center console, dashboard, and door panel inserts, while aluminum trim accents the cabin. Additional equipment includes a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, a shift knob-mounted starter button, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames McLaren-branded instrumentation including a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer shows 2,700 miles. A mileage inconsistency is listed in a September 2013 entry of the Carfax report, which notes that it may be a result of a “clerical error.” The front-mid-mounted 5.4-liter M155 V8 was factory rated at 617 horsepower and 575 lb-ft of torque and features all-aluminum construction, 24 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and a Lysholm-type twin-screw supercharger. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an AMG Speedshift R five-speed automatic transmission. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned mileage inconsistency. Head over to our friends at Car and Driver to check out their January 2005 Road Test for the SLR McLaren.
