  "description": "It is almost impossible to get hold of our long-term Skoda Slavia’s key, which Shapur has been clinging onto ever since it arrived in the Autocar India fleet. It isn’t hard to see why, though – the combination of 150hp turbo petrol and dual-clutch transmission, along with the very European driving dynamics, make it a hoot to drive. Luckily for me, his packed schedule with back-to-back travel for all the special stories for our (previous) 300th issue and (this) anniversary issue resulted in the Slavia being left uncommissioned in one of the corners of our office parking lot. And with a full tank of fuel, too! Good: Excellent SUV-like 179mm ground clearance. Straight up, finding an ideal driving position is a breeze thanks to the electric driver’s seat controls and multiple steering adjustments. And I can’t applaud the 10-inch touchscreen’s seamless connectivity enough, especially with wireless Android Auto. Also, while the sound system isn’t branded, the quality is impressive, with clear vocals and strong bass.  Bad: Poor camera quality and low-res display need improvement. Enough has been said by Shapur about its strong 150hp 1.5 TSI turbo-petrol engine. So I won’t repeat it. It is quick, and the mid-range pull is strong, but because of its linear nature, I miss the drama of yesteryear’s turbo-petrol mills, wherein turbo lag was followed by manic boost; those had a charm of their own. Also, at high revs, the 1.5 TSI sounds quite boomy.  Good: Impressive sound quality with clear vocals and strong bass from the subwoofer that's mounted inside the spare tyre.  The seven-speed dual-clutch isn’t very smooth in stop-go traffic either. It makes the car lurch ahead while rolling off from a standstill. While decelerating, the downshifts occasionally feel jerky. The overenthusiastic auto stop-start system kicks in even before the car comes to a full halt, which gets very annoying at crawling speeds. Finally, enthusiasts who want to unlock more out of this engine will be disappointed as most tuners haven’t been able to crack its ECU. City fuel efficiency is usually in single digits. This, however, is the best I've managed One evening, I drove the Slavia at my docile best and tried to induce its cylinder deactivation technology as often as possible. It was a smooth-flowing 22-minute journey from office to home, with the usual traffic signals and auto stop-start feature doing its thing, and the best I managed to achieve was 13kpl as per the instrument cluster display, which is quite accurate. But bring in bumper-to-bumper traffic and high ambient temperatures into the mix, and after just a few minutes of idling, like any other turbo-petrol car, fuel efficiency nosedives to single digits – which is what we’ve been averaging to date. Bad: Stop-start feature turns off the engine even before the car halts. After spending a couple of weeks with the Slavia, I revisited our road test and can relate to every little detail mentioned, especially this statement, which summarises my experience perfectly: “The Slavia is so good, it is one of the most rounded offerings in the segment, and with its practical yet fun-to-drive nature, this sedan has got serious potential to sway SUV buyers in its direction.” Also see:  Skoda Slavia DSG long term review, 5,700km report 2022 Skoda Slavia review, road test",
