  "description": "This 1965 Chevrolet Corvette convertible was acquired by the seller in 2023 and subsequently modified by Tim Cossette of Plymouth, Minnesota. Work was completed in January 2024 and involved refinishing the body in metallic gray and mounting it to a Coffman chassis with a C7 four-link suspension, adjustable coilovers, and Wilwood disc brakes as well as installing a custom red leather interior, a 6.2-liter LS3 V8 crate engine, and a four-speed 4L60E automatic transmission. The car won first in class at the 2024 Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, California, and was voted the 2024 Restomod of the Year at Corvette Forum. Additional equipment includes Raceline 19 and 20\" billet aluminum wheels, a dark red Stayfast convertible soft top, a stinger-style hood, a side-exit exhaust system, Classic Instruments gauges, Vintage Air heating and air conditioning, and a period-look AM/FM/Bluetooth stereo. This modified C2 is now offered with service records, build photos, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

The car won first in class at the 2024 Grand National Roadster Show in Pomona, California, and was voted the 2024 Restomod of the Year at Corvette Forum. Additional equipment includes Raceline 19 and 20″ billet aluminum wheels, a dark red Stayfast convertible soft top, a stinger-style hood, a side-exit exhaust system, Classic Instruments gauges, Vintage Air heating and air conditioning, and a period-look AM/FM/Bluetooth stereo. This modified C2 is now offered with service records, build photos, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The fiberglass body is said to have received a two-stage repaint in Tobacco Smoke Metallic and is mounted over a Coffman chassis. Exterior features include a dark red Stayfast convertible soft top, a stinger-style power hood, flip-up headlights, chrome bumpers, fender vents, a driver-side mirror, and a custom side-exit exhaust system. Raceline billet aluminum 19×8″ front and 20×9″ rear wheels are wrapped in redline tires. The Coffman chassis is equipped with a C7 four-link suspension with adjustable coilovers. Braking is handled by Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes with C7 rotors and calipers. A Wilwood emergency brake is also fitted. The cabin features two bucket seats upholstered in red leather as well as matching door panels and dashboard trim. Charcoal carpeting has been installed, and amenities include Vintage Air heating and air conditioning, a period-look AM/FM/Bluetooth stereo, eight speakers, an analog clock, power windows, and lap belts. The Billet Specialties leather-wrapped steering wheel is mounted to a tilting column and frames brushed aluminum Classic Instruments instrumentation. The five-digit odometer shows 642 miles, approximately 605 of which were added under current ownership. The Chevrolet Performance 6.2-liter LS3 crate engine has polished components and sits within the smoothed engine bay. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission. The underside was smoothed and painted body color. Decoding the trim tag reveals: Style 19 467 – 1965 Corvette Convertible Body A-4917 – A.O. Smith body number Trim STD – Black vinyl upholstery Paint GG – Glen Green Photos of the build are shown in the gallery below. Filed under: c2 You are not connected to real-time updates.
