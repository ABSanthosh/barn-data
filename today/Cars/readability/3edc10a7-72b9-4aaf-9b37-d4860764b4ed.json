Showing 39k kilometers (~24k miles), it is powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Grigio Titanio over Bordeaux leather upholstery. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, fog lights, power-adjustable seats, a gated shifter, a Pioneer stereo, and automatic climate control. Work performed in 2022 included replacing the timing belts, drive belts, camshaft seals, battery, and radiator hoses. This 550 Maranello is offered on dealer consignment in California with manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a clean Montana title. The 550 Maranello was styled by Pininfarina, and this example is finished in Grigio Titanio. Equipment includes projector-style headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, a front spoiler, front fender vents, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Silver 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Braking is handled by red-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The cabin features power-adjustable seats upholstered in Bordeaux leather, and amenities include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, electric windows, a glovebox-mounted CD, stereo, a Pioneer head unit, and rear luggage straps. Sticky buttons were repaired in preparation for the sale. The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel fronts a Jaeger gauge cluster with a 340-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure, while an analog clock and gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are located atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 39k kilometers (~24k miles). The 5.5-liter quad-cam F133A V12 features 48 valves, dry-sump lubrication, and Bosch Motronic engine management for a factory-rated output of 478 horsepower and 419 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service was completed in March 2022, at which time the battery, drive belts, camshaft seals, and radiator hoses were replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Manufacturer’s literature and service records are included in the sale.
