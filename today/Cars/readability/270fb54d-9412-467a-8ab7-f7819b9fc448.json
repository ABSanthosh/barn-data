  "text": "The recall involves more than 80,000 cars, but does not impact models with electrically adjustable seats January 27, 2025 at 19:45 by Brad Anderson The brand has revealed a wiring assembly can be damaged if the passenger seat is moved. Kia is not aware of any accidents or injuries but has received four warranty claims for the issue. Owners will be alerted to the recall from March 14 and need to take their car to a dealer. More than 80,000 Kia Niro models are being recalled in the United States because of vulnerable wires that could be damaged, impacting how the airbags deploy and the operation of the seatbelt pretensioner. For a brand as well versed as Kia at making solid cars, the issue does seem like a bizarre oversight. According to the recall, the floor wiring assembly under the front passenger seat could be damaged if the seat is repeatedly slid backward and forward. If these wires are damaged, they could prevent the airbags or seatbelt pretensioner from working during a crash, lead to an inability to suppress the passenger front airbag if a child or small occupant is seated, or to the inadvertent deployment of the passenger side airbag even if the vehicle isn’t involved in a crash. Review: 2024 Kia Niro EV GT-Line Is Expensive But Extremely Efficient A total of 80,225 vehicles are impacted. These include 2023-2025 Kia Niro EV models assembled from August 10, 2022 to December 13, 2024, 2023-2025 Niro Hybrids built from June 21, 2022 to December 17, 2024, and 2023-2025 Niro Plug-In Hybrid models built from July 11, 2022, to December 16, 2024. Kia became aware of the issue in November 2024 after a field report describing damage to the passenger floor wiring assembly which had triggered an airbag warning light. The carmaker quickly discovered the wiring was vulnerable to damage due to variances in the routing of the wiring. Niro models with electronically adjustable seats are not impacted. Kia has not received any reports of accidents or injuries, but is aware of 4 warranty claims. Owners of impacted Kia Niro models will be alerted to the recall by first class mail from March 14. Dealers have been instructed to inspect the floor wiring assembly and replace it if necessary. They will also need to reroute the floor wiring assembly and install extra protective coverings to prevent any future damage.",
