  "text": "The Kia EV9 arrived for the 2024 model year to mostly positive reviews, but one glaring issue has always been its price. Top trims’ price tags far exceeded the numbers anyone expected to pay for a Kia, but some variants are becoming less expensive for 2026. While the EV9 lineup is mostly a carryover for 2026, Kia made changes to the electric SUV’s price tag in some trims, and the Land trim is now available with a Nightfall Edition upgrade. The base Light Standard Range’s price remains flat at $56,395, but the Light Long Range dropped $2,000 to $61,395. The Wind trim’s price is unchanged, while the Land is $1,000 cheaper, at $71,3395, and the top GT-Line costs $75,395, $2,000 less than before.Some trims also saw a driving range increase for the model year. The GT-Line gained ten miles per charge and is now rated at up to 270 miles, while the Wind and Land trims climbed from 280 to 283 miles. Kia is expected to introduce a new EV9 GT with strong performance and power output, but we don’t have specs or pricing for the new model yet. The Nightfall Edition is more than an appearance package and actually enhances the EV9’s performance. It’s available in six- and seven-passenger configurations and boosts torque in the trim with the 516 pound-foot electric motor configuration from the GT-Line. The combination is good for a 4.5-second 0-60 mph time.[Images: Kia]Become a TTAC insider.
