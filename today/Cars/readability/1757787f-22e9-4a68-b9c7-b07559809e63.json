  "description": "This 1952 Allard J2X is one of approximately 80 examples produced and was sold new in the US market before spending time early in its life under the ownership of Los Angeles radio host Joe Pyne. By the early 1960s chassis 3037 had joined the collection of a California citrus farmer who kept it stored in a shed on his orchard in the Sierra Nevada foothills for several years before giving the car to his son in the 1990s. The car was then sent to The Vintage Connection in Oklahoma City for a refurbishment that was performed between 1996 and 1998 and included the installation of a 331ci Cadillac V8 that was reportedly fitted with 390 cylinder heads along with quadruple two-barrel Holley carburetors and an updated lubrication system. After debuting at a Fabulous Fifties Association gala the Bothwell Ranch orchard in Southern California, the car was purchased from the orchard owner's son in 2011 by its current owner, who drove it in the 2016 California Mille. Finished in red over black upholstery, the car also features a Borg-Warner Super T-10 four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, alloy drum brakes with dual master cylinders, a De Dion rear axle, a front swing axle with forward-facing radius rods, chrome 16” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a custom brass radiator with an electric cooling fan, a 15-gallon fuel cell, and a machine-turned dash. This Allard J2X is now offered on dealer consignment with transferable New York registration.",

After debuting at a Fabulous Fifties Association gala the Bothwell Ranch orchard in Southern California, the car was purchased from the orchard owner’s son in 2011 by its current owner, who drove it in the 2016 California Mille. Finished in red over black upholstery, the car also features a Borg-Warner Super T-10 four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, alloy drum brakes with dual master cylinders, a De Dion rear axle, a front swing axle with forward-facing radius rods, chrome 16” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a custom brass radiator with an electric cooling fan, a 15-gallon fuel cell, and a machine-turned dash. This Allard J2X is now offered on dealer consignment with transferable New York registration. The J2 model was introduced around 1950 as a lightweight sports racer targeting the US market and was succeeded in late 1951 by the J2X, which featured revisions to the front suspension design and engine placement. The J2X’s steel ladder frame was 6” longer than that of its predecessor while sharing its 100” wheelbase. The model’s aluminum bodywork shared the J2’s styling, but with its nose extended forward of the wheels and a single chin vent instead of two. This example was refinished in its current shade of red during the refurbishment performed between 1996 and 1998. The car is not currently equipped with windscreens, although dual windscreen brackets are in place. Additional features include tubular front and rear bumpers, Lucas driving lights, a hood scoop, leather hood retention straps, a driver-side mirror, a Monza-style fuel-filler cap, and dual side-exit exhaust outlets. Chromed wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are wrapped in Dunlop tires measuring 6.00L-16. Dual matching spares are mounted on each side of the cowl. The hydraulic brake system utilizes finned alloy drums with inboard rear units, while modifications made during the 1990s refurbishment included the addition of dual master cylinders with a balance bar. Updated rear hubs and front spindles were also reportedly added during the project. The cockpit houses two seats upholstered in black leather with three-point lap belts in place for both occupants. Features include color-keyed door coaming and carpeting, a central cowl-mounted mirror, an electrical cutoff switch, and a fire extinguisher mounted in the passenger-side footwell. The Bluemels-style banjo-spoke steering wheel is situated at the left-hand side of the machine-turned dash panel, which hosts Smiths instrumentation including a 150-mph speedometer with an inset clock, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and ancillary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 37k miles, approximately 2k of which have been added under current ownership. The 331ci Cadillac V8 was installed during the 1990s project after it was reportedly rebuilt with modifications including 390 cylinder heads, Offenhauser valve covers, a mild camshaft, a custom oil pan, an oil cooler, a full-flow oil filter, and custom four-into-one exhaust headers. Induction is through quadruple two-barrel Holley carburetors atop an Edelbrock 4×2 intake manifold, while ignition is handled by a Vertex magneto. A custom brass radiator with a pusher electric cooling fan and a Fuel Safe 15-gallon fuel cell are also said to have been added during the refurbishment. An oil change was performed in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Borg-Warner Super T-10 four-speed manual transmission and a Jaguar rear end with a limited-slip differential that are said to have been added during the 1990s refurbishment along with an aluminum flywheel and a hydraulic clutch. Suspension incorporates a front swing axle and a De Dion rear end with coil springs and Koni telescopic shock absorbers at each corner. The J2X model featured radius rods attached ahead of the engine, allowing the powerplant’s positioning to be shifted forward compared to that of the J2. Number 55265663 is stamped under the right side of the dashboard and is utilized as the car’s identification number on its registration and previous title. The car does not currently have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for a vehicle of its age. It is being sold on its New York registration, which is expired.
