It is finished in Hypersonic Gray Metallic over Jet Black upholstery and is powered by a 5.5-liter LT6 V8 paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Equipment includes an electronic limited-slip differential, a removable roof panel, 20″ and 21″ forged aluminum wheels, a high-wing spoiler, heated and ventilated GT2 bucket seats, a Performance Data Recorder, a Bose sound system, and a touchscreen infotainment system. This C8 Z06 has 138 miles and is now offered with a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Hypersonic Gray Metallic and was optioned with the Carbon Fiber Aero Package, which added a carbon-fiber high-wing spoiler, ground effects, and front dive planes. Additional details include a removable roof panel, LED headlights, front and rear cameras, side air intakes, and rear parking sensors. The 20″ and 21″ forged aluminum wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires. Stopping power is provided by Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes with Bright Red-finished multi-piston calipers. The car is equipped with a Z07 suspension. The cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in Jet Black leather with Adrenaline Red stitching and Torch Red seatbelts. Amenities include heated and ventilated GT2 bucket seats, keyless entry, a Performance Data Recorder, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, a 14-speaker Bose sound system, carbon-fiber trim, and an 8″ touchscreen with Chevrolet Infotainment 3 and navigation. The heated carbon-fiber- and leather-trimmed steering wheel is fitted with carbon-fiber shift paddles and frames a configurable 12″ digital display that includes a central tachometer and auxiliary readouts for coolant temperature and fuel level. A head-up display is equipped as standard as are driver aids comprising lane-keep assist, rear cross-traffic alert, side blind-zone alert, and forward collision alert. The digital odometer indicates 138 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 5.5-liter LT6 V8 is equipped with a flat-plane crankshaft and was factory rated at 670 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The car came equipped from the factory with a performance exhaust system with driver-selectable modes. Power is sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle along with an electronic limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to George Moore Chevrolet in Jacksonville, Florida, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total vehicle price of $151,515. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Per General Motors, reselling the car to a subsequent owner within six months of the original purchase date of May 9, 2024, will render the vehicle warranty null and void for all future owners.
