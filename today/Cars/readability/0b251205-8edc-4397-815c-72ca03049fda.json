  "description": "The Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z has always delivered stupendous value. It sits in a price bracket where it rivals a sharp-handling 150cc and versatile 250cc — yet it offers proper 40hp. But that value came with its fair share of compromises. To hit the tantalising Rs 1.85 lakh price point, Bajaj dipped heavily into its parts bin. The chassis and engine came from the Dominar 400, while the body panels and several cycle parts were borrowed from the NS200. So what were the flaws? For starters, the NS400Z came shod with bias-ply tyres — the rear being a 140-section — which simply didn’t offer the grip or confidence needed for a bike of this calibre. Braking was another weak link, with the use of organic pads limiting bite and feedback. And while the spec sheet looked solid on paper, the Sport mode never quite delivered the urgency those numbers suggested. Now though, Bajaj has gone back to the drawing board and reworked each of these key areas. The question prevails: have these changes made this affordable 400cc streetfighter a better all-rounder? 2025 Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z: Design and Features - 8/10 The NS400Z borrows some of its cycle parts from the NS200 At first glance, it’s hard to tell whether this is the upgraded NS400Z or the outgoing model. As before, the front end looks aggressive, with the signature ‘Z’-shaped DRL and the mono projector headlamp gives the 400 its own identity, setting it apart from the NS200 and NS160. The side profile, too, is sharp and purposeful, thanks to the relatively short wheelbase and tight rake angle. The rear, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The box section swingarm looks basic, the tail light seems to have been lifted straight off the NS200, and you’d be hard-pressed to tell the two apart from behind. It’s not a bad design by any yardstick, but it’s starting to feel a bit long in the tooth. The signature 'Z' DRL and mono projector headlamp give the 400 its own identity. The NS400Z continues to offer a solid feature set — it continues to get a ride-by-wire throttle that enables traction control and four ride modes: Road, Rain, Off-road, and Sport. Sport mode is now sharper and exclusively activates a new software-based bi-directional quickshifter, which Bajaj calls ‘Sport-Shift’.  Instead of using a traditional sensor-based quickshifter, Bajaj has cleverly paired the gear-position sensor with the gear drum. This setup detects minute movements to interpret shift intent — essentially delivering clutchless shifts via software, helping keep costs down. The taillight design feels a little long in the tooth. I was a bit skeptical, but the system works impressively well — upshifts are timely, and downshifts are clean, with proper rev-matching. That said, at lower revs, the shifts can feel jerky and forced. I had queried Bajaj about this, and they explained that the system is tuned for higher revs, which is why it’s restricted to Sport mode. I also asked why it couldn’t be integrated into Road mode for daily riding. They said riders often rest their foot on the gear lever, which can confuse the software and lead to mis-shifts — whereas in Sport mode, rider inputs are more deliberate.

The front suspension is well-calibrated to absorb bumps and stays composed, but the rear can feel a bit harsh over a series of undulations, often tossing the rider slightly. A re-tune would help get it spot on. The front also suffers from noticeable nose dive under hard braking. That said, the bike feels planted in corners with no vague feedback. This is where the new radial Apollo H1 tyres shine. They offer excellent grip even in wet conditions, I never found a reason to second-guess them. The rear tyre has also gone up a size, from a 140-section to a 150-section, improving both grip and visual appeal, which is essential for a 40+ hp motorcycle. Grippier radial tyres have made a clear difference in both handling and confidence. The ABS and traction control systems work seamlessly. During my time with the NS400Z, I only managed to trigger traction control once—deliberately—in a mucky patch. The tail stepped out briefly, but the system kicked in instantly, pulling the bike back in line.  Despite the additions, the Pulsar retains its 174kg kerb weight and existing owners can upgrade to the radial tyres and wider rear tyre without requiring a wheel swap. The move to sintered pads has paid dividends. The NS400Z now features sintered front brake pads instead of organic ones. With the tyre grip sorted, Bajaj has now switched to sintered brake pads, drastically improving both feel and stopping power. The synergy between the improved brakes and grippy tyres means the electronics can now take a backseat—something that wasn’t true before.

The earlier model also featured a Sport riding mode, among others. However, one of our main gripes was that it didn’t feel as aggressive as its horsepower figure suggested. It built up pace quickly– no two ways about it—but not with the aggression we’ve come to expect from this 373cc engine. That changes with the updated NS400Z. Bajaj has bumped the power in Sport mode from 40hp to 43hp, sharpened the throttle response, and raised the redline by 1,000rpm—from 9,700rpm to 10,700rpm. As a result, the claimed top speed has increased from 150kph to 157kph, and the 0–100kph time has dropped from 7.5 seconds to 6.4 seconds. However, don’t expect KTM levels of hyper-aggression, and that’s not a bad thing because this is still a Pulsar. Peak power in Sport mode is up from 40hp to 43hp. To achieve these gains, Bajaj has reworked the engine internals. Key updates include revised valve timing, new cam profiles, a redesigned intake duct, and a forged piston for better thermal stability. The result is a powertrain that finally delivers the performance this platform has always promised. That said, the other riding modes continue to offer the same, quick progress with a non-aggressive approach and are limited to 40hp, which can be great fun for city commuting or even frugal highway touring. The dash does the job, but the dot-matrix display feels like a throwback. Despite the added performance, the ARAI-claimed efficiency remains unchanged at 28kmpl. For reference, the previous model returned 27.52kmpl in the city and 29.62kmpl on the highway in our tests. We’ll be putting this updated, more powerful Pulsar through our instrumented fuel-efficiency tests soon.  2025 Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z: Price and verdict: 9/10 The 2025 Pulsar NS400Z gets several upgrades, yet it's only Rs 7,000 dearer. The Pulsar brand has always represented exceptional value. The NS400Z marked the second coming of a 40hp motorcycle from Bajaj, offered at a remarkably affordable price, given the performance on tap—the first being the original KTM 390 Duke, launched back in 2013. Naturally, it drew plenty of attention for all the right reasons. However, to hit that aggressive price point, Bajaj had to make several cost-saving compromises, which unfortunately became the bike’s Achilles’ heel.   The Pulsar brand has always offered stupendous value Now, with this update, Bajaj has addressed many of those shortcomings. And in true Bajaj fashion, all of this comes for just Rs 7,000 more. In our view, that not only maintains the Pulsar’s reputation for delivering stupendous value—it makes it an even better proposition than the outgoing model, price hike notwithstanding. At Rs 1.92 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Pulsar NS400Z is easily the best price to performance ratio you can get today— and really, this could be your entry into the 400cc space, at the price of a 250.

However, one of our main gripes was that it didn’t feel as aggressive as its horsepower figure suggested. It built up pace quickly– no two ways about it—but not with the aggression we’ve come to expect from this 373cc engine. That changes with the updated NS400Z. Bajaj has bumped the power in Sport mode from 40hp to 43hp, sharpened the throttle response, and raised the redline by 1,000rpm—from 9,700rpm to 10,700rpm. As a result, the claimed top speed has increased from 150kph to 157kph, and the 0–100kph time has dropped from 7.5 seconds to 6.4 seconds. However, don’t expect KTM levels of hyper-aggression, and that’s not a bad thing because this is still a Pulsar.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Pulsar NS400Z engine\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/9 (3).jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"2025 Pulsar NS400Z engine\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeak power in Sport mode is up from 40hp to 43hp.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-7e19ef4d-7fff-345d-8adf-63e689b25a3f\"\u003eTo achieve these gains, Bajaj has reworked the engine internals. Key updates include revised valve timing, new cam profiles, a redesigned intake duct, and a forged piston for better thermal stability. The result is a powertrain that finally delivers the performance this platform has always promised. That said, the other riding modes continue to offer the same, quick progress with a non-aggressive approach and are limited to 40hp, which can be great fun for city commuting or even frugal highway touring.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"2025 Pulsar NS400Z engine\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250711045344_7 (10).jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"2025 Pulsar NS400Z engine\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dash does the job, but the dot-matrix display feels like a throwback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-7e19ef4d-7fff-345d-8adf-63e689b25a3f\"\u003eDespite the added performance, the ARAI-claimed efficiency remains unchanged at 28kmpl.
