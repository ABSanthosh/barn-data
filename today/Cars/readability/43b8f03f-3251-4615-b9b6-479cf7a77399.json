And while there are plans to sell in Europe, South America and Japan the lack of electric infrastructure hinders its sales elsewhere in the world. So it’s pretty different from the original.  Verdict Slightly bigger, slightly more practical and slightly more expensive Renault 5 is - shock - still brilliant. GoodA more practical Renault 5Fantastic value for moneySimple to understand - one power option, three trim levelsBadLooks aren’t as distinctive as Renault 5Slight ergonomic oddities irritateUnproven efficiency in real-world conditions DESIGN \u0026 STYLING Pros Retro styling without being pastiche Cons Out of context, slightly hard to call it an R4 But you can see the lineage. It’s square and boxy, although a touch more SUV looking today, whereas the original is more van-like. The new car gets a low boot sill like the original that is of course practical, but also helps with those odd proportions. The rear lights ape the old car, but bring it into 2025 with LEDs. And the trapezoid rear window above the rear wheel is present and as awkward as ever. The front too, is similar, but brought up to 2025 standards with what Renault claims to be the world’s first one-piece illuminated grille. Lit up at night it looks great, somehow without looking as try-hard as the Skoda Enyaq’s. INTERIOR Pros Boot bigger than most rivalsQuality up there with best in class Cons Poor parking cameraSome ergonomic weirdness Inside it’s largely the same as the 5. Which makes for a really pleasant space to spend time. The materials are a touch above what you might expect from a Renault and everything is pretty logical. It has physical controls for the heating and there are dual infotainment screens, one behind the steering wheel and one above the heating controls. Mid and top spec cars get Google integration, complete with Google Maps, Google Assistant and a few apps, such as YouTube and Amazon Music. The rear-view camera looks like it’s been nicked out of a Gen 1 Nissan Leaf, to the point where I had to test multiple cars to see if one had just gotten out of focus somehow.The drive selector is on the tree, much like you’d find in a yank pick-up truck. But the Americans see fit to install a big Park gear you can ram up or down into securely. Whereas Renault makes you awkwardly park by stopping the car with the footbrake then flicking up the electronic handbrake button. There’s also a wiper stalk just beneath it. You’d get used to the two being one above the other. But initially it’s annoying and I found myself sticking the wipers on instead of selecting reverse. ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE Pros Fast enough for what it isOne pedal mode The 5 gets two power options in the UK; 148bhp and 121bhp. The 4 will only receive the most powerful option. As much as 85% of the demand for the 5 in the UK is for the 148bhp version, and Renault is banking on the same for the R4.Like with most EVs, power isn’t a problem. The 0-62mph time of 8.2secs proves there’s a good bit of grunt off the line, and you can get the traction control to kick in at low speed under full throttle in the dry at low speeds. Accelerative pace slows down once you’re past motorway speeds but you’d be hard pressed to find any Renault 4 driver who would be bothered by that. There’s a good deal of wind noise off the wing mirrors at these speeds too, acting as a slight deterrent.The R4 is the first Renault to feature one pedal driving. It has paddles behind the steering wheel that change the brake regen. There are four different levels, the strongest offering a Nissan-like one-pedal solution. There are the usual array of drive modes that affect throttle response. So far so normal. But in the R4 there’s a quirk. In Eco to get past 115kph (71mph) you need to push past the little ‘golf ball’ often found at the bottom of a throttle pedal. And you need to push past it hard. If you keep even 75% throttle it won’t accelerate. Cruise control won’t go past 115kph in Eco either.So if you’re in a 100kph zone, then it changes to 120kph, you’ll need to switch out of Eco in order to increase your speed. RIDE \u0026 HANDLING Pros A good fun steer at low speedsPredictable and linear steering and brakes Cons Good bit of wind noise at speed The steering isn’t particularly quick, but like with the R5 it’s been tuned to be a bit dartier around the straight-ahead and a bit less so with some lock dialled in. Feedback is good enough for a car in this segment and you can really hustle it along. It feels natural and composed.There’s a good amount of roll, even at low speeds. But I’m not complaining. The R4 has a bespoke suspension setup from the R5 and it feels that bit squidgier, better suited to its slightly more practical bias.Broadly the ride is soft and the added ground clearance was appreciated on our test route where we went a bit off-road to park near a cobbled beach. MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS Pros Good range, theoretically On my mixed test route we achieved 3.6mpkwh. Which is very healthy and not far from the WLTP. Admittedly this was on a warm day with little traffic. But considering range tests of the R5 have proved promising, I have good hopes for the R4 too.At the car’s WLTP 3.9 mpkwh the 52kWh battery is capable of up to 247 miles on a charge. It has 11kW AC (not 22kW but few cars in this class do) and 100kW DC rapid charging, allowing a 0-80% charge in 30 minutes. VERDICT Verdict Slightly bigger, slightly more practical and slightly more expensive Renault 5 is - shock - still brilliant. GoodA more practical Renault 5Fantastic value for moneySimple to understand - one power option, three trim levelsBadLooks aren’t as distinctive as Renault 5Slight ergonomic oddities irritateUnproven efficiency in real-world conditions In some respects the R4 makes a good deal more sense than an R5. It’s more practical and realistically when you get down to the monthly PCPs, not that much more expensive. It has a bigger boot than its rivals, is cheaper than most of its competitors (when taking into account that it doesn't do a small battery model) and dare we say, it’s a lot more charming than most other crossover EVs too. Is it an R4 though? It’s hugely different in scope. And during its 30-year hiatus a lot has changed in the world. It’s revolution, not evolution. And the French are good at that.

But in the R4 there’s a quirk. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Eco to get past 115kph (71mph) you need to push past the little ‘golf ball’ often found at the bottom of a throttle pedal. And you need to push past it hard. If you keep even 75% throttle it won’t accelerate. Cruise control won’t go past 115kph in Eco either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you’re in a 100kph zone, then it changes to 120kph, you’ll need to switch out of Eco in order to increase your speed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n                                                      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n\n        \n\u003cdiv data-id=\"ride\" id=\"chapter-ride\"\u003e\n                                      \u003cdiv\u003e\n  \n      \n  \n  \u003cp id=\"price_rating\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRIDE \u0026amp; HANDLING\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n  \n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePros\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eA good fun steer at low speeds\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePredictable and linear steering and brakes\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCons\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eGood bit of wind noise at speed\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe steering isn’t particularly quick, but like with the R5 it’s been tuned to be a bit dartier around the straight-ahead and a bit less so with some lock dialled in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeedback is good enough for a car in this segment and you can really hustle it along.
