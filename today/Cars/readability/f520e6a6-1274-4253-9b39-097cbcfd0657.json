  "text": "Who could imagine that the design of the Crown Sedan would work well in a three-row SUV riding on a ladder-frame chassis May 12, 2025 at 20:30 by Thanos Pappas Independent digital artist Theottle has envisioned the next generation of the Toyota Fortuner. The Hilux-based three-row SUV adopts a redesigned exterior inspired by the Toyota Crown Sedan. A new Fortuner would probably ride on an upgraded version of the existing ladder-frame chassis. Toyota has a broad portfolio of SUVs across global markets, many of which are built on tough ladder-frame platforms. In the States, the 4Runner and Land Cruiser hold the fort, but in other parts of the world, the rugged Fortuner takes center stage. Think of it as a three-row version of the Hilux pickup, a vehicle Toyota clearly has a lot of love for. More: Can’t Wait for The New Toyota Hilux? Give Your Old One A $2K Fortuner Face Though Toyota has been mum on the future of the Fortuner, digital artist Theophilus Chin (aka Theottle) has given us a speculative peek at what a new generation might look like. With the Hilux set to receive a successor later this year, it’s not far-fetched to imagine the Fortuner will follow suit with its own refresh. A Fresh Take on Toyota’s Rugged SUV Rather than pulling inspiration from other Toyota SUVs, Theottle decided to look to the Crown Sedan for styling cues. Despite the obvious differences between the two vehicles, the result is surprisingly cohesive. That said, the Fortuner could certainly use a few more rugged details, like skid plates and fender flares, to bolster its off-road image. The design features Toyota’s signature hammerhead-style headlights, with a large front bumper intake that lends a more modern feel to the SUV. The sleek side profile, while relatively simple, offers a neat look, and the greenhouse remains unchanged, staying true to the current model. However, the rear end might be the most intriguing part of the design, sporting full-width LED taillights and a sharp tailgate with the Fortuner’s name displayed. Illustrations: Theottle While Theottle’s renderings focus on the exterior, the interior of the Fortuner is in dire need of an update. It’s starting to feel dated, especially the dashboard and digital displays. A refresh here, perhaps with a new digital cockpit, could bring it up to par with more recent Toyota models. Additionally, the three-row seating could benefit from updated upholstery to better match the overall modernized design. More: Toyota Fortuner GR Sport Turned Into An Off-Road Monster In The Philippines As Theottle points out, Toyota tends to make major updates to its popular models instead of completely redesigning them. So, his renderings stick to the current Fortuner’s structure, keeping the same greenhouse, roofline, and key points intact. After all, this SUV will likely share its platform with the upcoming Hilux, which is expected to ride on a revamped version of the existing IMV ladder-frame chassis for a more comfortable ride. Engines and Competition As for powertrains, the Fortuner is currently available with diesel and gasoline powertrains depending on the market. The most popular option is the 2.8-liter turbodiesel that produces up to 221 hp (165 kW / 224 PS) and 550 Nm (406 lb-ft) of torque in the flagship GR Sport trim. In South Africa, the SUV has already received the mild-hybrid version of the turbodiesel, which is also found in the Hilux. This version delivers 203 hp (150 kW) and 500 Nm (369 lb-ft) of torque, with the added benefit of improved efficiency. The second generation of the Toyota Fortuner was introduced in 2015, and received a facelift in 2020. . That puts the SUV at the perfect point for a third-generation upgrade, which could help solidify its position against competitors. Rival SUVs include the recently refreshed Isuzu MU-X, the Ford Everest, and the soon-to-arrive Mitsubishi Pajero Sport. Toyota",
