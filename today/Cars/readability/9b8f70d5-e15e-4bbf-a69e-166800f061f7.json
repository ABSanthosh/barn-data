  "description": "Royal Enfield has opened online rider registrations for the 2025 edition of its Continental GT Cup. This year the hunt for budding racers has been extended to eight cities, up from four last year. Zonal selection rounds will be held in Chennai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Guwahati, Delhi-NCR, Pune and Bengaluru.  Two distinct series– Pro-Am and Twin Power Trophy A valid driving license is the only eligibility criteria 2025 Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup dates Selected riders will be using race-specced RE Continental GT650 Through the eight zonal rounds, Royal Enfield will select 64 amateur and 50 pro riders who will make it to the final selection round. This will be held at Coimbatore’s Kari Motor Speedway from July 3–6, 2025. 24 of the fastest riders from each category (amateur and pro) will earn a place on the final grid. This year’s series will also run as part of the JK Tyre National Racing Championship from August to november 2025. Royal Enfield started the Continental GT Cup in 2021 to make track racing more accessible to both newcomers and experienced riders. Those who make it to the grid will race on GT-R650 motorcycles, built to identical specifications to put rider skill at the forefront. 2025 Royal Enfield Continental GT Cup registrations Selection to be held at eight venues The Royal Enfield GT Cup provides an opportunity to Royal Enfield owners to race on track as well. The only criteria is a valid driving license. The participants can register in either professional or amateur category based on their skill-set and eligibility.  At each location, the short-listed riders will get access to a track for two days. Day 1 will consist of training with expert riders from the Royal Enfield Track School and the Day 2 will be reserved for selections based on lap times of each rider.  Royal Enfield will continue with its Pro-Am format that essentially gives the amateur riders a chance to compete with the professional ones. Also returning is the Twin-Power Trophy. In this series, each pro rider will be paired with an amateur rider to form a team, giving rookies an opportunity to learn from the professional racers. 2025 RE Continental GT Cup selection roundsCityVenueDateGuwahatiWarisa Estate, SonapurMay 10 to May 11NoidaFormula 11 TrackMay 17 to May 18AhmedabadIndikartingMay 24 to May 25MumbaiFortune Karting Raceway HakoneMay 31 to June 1PuneKartdrome June 7 to June 8HyderabadChicane Circuit June 14 to June 15BangaloreMeco KartopiaJune 21 to June 22ChennaiECR Speedway Race TrackJune 28 to June 29 Also see: 2025 Spanish MotoGP: Alex Marquez takes maiden win as Marc crashes out",
