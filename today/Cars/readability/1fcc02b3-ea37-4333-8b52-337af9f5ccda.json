  "text": "Marc Urbano|Car and DriverThe Honda Pilot and Type S versions of the Acura MDX SUV and TLX sedan are being recalled due to engines that may stall.The issue is caused by improper settings for the fuel-injection system's electronic control unit, which may interrupt torque delivery. The recall affects roughly 295,000 models, including the 2021–2025 TLX Type S, 2022–2025 MDX Type S, and 2023–2025 Pilot.The Honda Pilot as well as the Acura MDX Type S and TLX Type S are at risk for engines that may stall, according to a recall issued by Honda. Almost 295,000 vehicles are involved in the recall that was reported last week to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In its recall report to NHTSA, Honda states the issue stems from improper settings for the vehicles' electronically controlled fuel-injection system, which can lead to an interruption in torque delivery that can cause a loss of drive power, hesitation, or the engine to stall. This can happen on the 2021–2025 Acura TLX Type S, 2022–2025 Acura MDX Type S, or 2023–2025 Honda Pilot.AcuraMarc Urbano|Car and DriverThe fix requires owners to bring their vehicles to their local Acura or Honda dealer who will reprogram the fuel-injection system's electronic control system with improved software. While dealers have already been notified, Honda says owners will be notified by mail by March 17, 2025.Eric Stafford’s automobile addiction began before he could walk, and it has fueled his passion to write news, reviews, and more for Car and Driver since 2016. His aspiration growing up was to become a millionaire with a Jay Leno–like car collection. Apparently, getting rich is harder than social-media influencers make it seem, so he avoided financial success entirely to become an automotive journalist and drive new cars for a living. After earning a journalism degree at Central Michigan University and working at a daily newspaper, the years of basically burning money on failed project cars and lemon-flavored jalopies finally paid off when Car and Driver hired him. His garage currently includes a 2010 Acura RDX, a manual '97 Chevy Camaro Z/28, and a '90 Honda CRX Si.",
