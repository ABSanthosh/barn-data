  "description": "PV5 is targeting a relatively low starting price of €35k (equivalent to £29k) First in a line of 'Platform Beyond Vehicles' gets futuristic looks and MPV variant; more derivatives to come The Kia PV5 has been unveiled as the brand’s first van, conceived as a futuristic rival to the Volkswagen ID Buzz. The first in a new line of models dubbed Platform Beyond Vehicles (PBVs), it will be followed by a larger PV7 due in two years, aimed squarely at the venerable Ford Transit and Geely-owned brand Farizon's SV. It has been developed from the ground-up as an electric van rather than using an adapted combustion-engine platform, as is the case with the Ford E-Transit Custom. Technical details have yet to be confirmed, but the PV5 concept shown in 2024 used a modified version of the E-GMP platform that underpins a number of the brand’s electric SUVs. It mirrors the entry-level Kia EV3 in featuring a single front-mounted electric motor and electricals running at 400V, rather than the higher 800V used by the upmarket EV6 and EV9. It’s therefore expected to offer the same 201bhp and 209lb ft motor as the EV3, which allows the crossover to dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in 7.6sec. Performance will undoubtedly differ in the van, however, especially once fully laden. The EV3 is also offered with batteries measuring 58.3kWh and 81.4kWh, yielding 270 or 375 miles of range, respectively; this, also, would be limited in a larger and heavier van. Although the PV5 has been unveiled in passenger and cargo van forms, Kia said that it will show yet more variants at its upcoming EV Day (on 27 February) event. The nature of the van’s skateboard-style EV platform means that it can effectively wear any ‘hat’ that Kia desires, and the concept was previously shown in both pick-up and rugged Volkswagen California-style camper van forms. What should remain consistent between each variant is the front end, which remains true to the concept. Angular LED daytime running lights are positioned high on its rakish nose, while the main-beam headlights are set into the lower bumper. The interior’s design has yet to be shown in full, but the exterior images released by Kia reveal split instrument and infotainment display screens – a key difference from the brand’s cars, which typically use a combined fascia. The cargo area, meanwhile, is set to feature a novel rail system on its floor and ceiling to allow for items such as cabinets and seats to be added or removed with greater ease.  Kia has yet to announce how many people the PV5 will seat, but the similarly proportioned ID Buzz is offered in five-, six- and seven-seat configurations. Such accessories will be offered as part of a wider PBV ecosystem, which will also comprise software solutions for jobs such as fleet management. Kia previously said the PV5 would target a starting price of just €35,000 (£29,000) in Europe, suggesting it will open in the low-to-mid £30,000s in the UK. The production van will make its debut here at the Commercial Vehicle show in Birmingham, which opens on 29 April. Deliveries are expected to begin around October.",
