  "description": "This 1989 Porsche 911 Carrera is a right-hand-drive coupe that underwent a backdate build by Rennsport in the UK, which was completed in 2018. Work involved a longhood conversion and the installation of backdated steel bodywork, composite bumpers, and 16\" Fuchs-style wheels along with a repaint in Slate Grey, a rebuild of the 3.2-liter flat-six, and a refresh of the G50 five-speed manual transaxle. The interior was reupholstered and features sport seats trimmed in black leather and houndtooth cloth along with lightweight door panels, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a PCCM stereo, and a 917-style shift knob. EZ Electric power steering was added following completion of the build, and the car was imported to the US under prior ownership. This backdated Carrera coupe was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve in Newport Beach, California with a clean Montana title.",

EZ Electric power steering was added following completion of the build, and the car was imported to the US under prior ownership. This backdated Carrera coupe was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered at no reserve in Newport Beach, California with a clean Montana title. The car was fitted with backdated steel bodywork by Rennsport, including a longhood, front fenders, rear decklid, and sills along with an early-style chrome grille and composite front and rear bumpers. It was repainted in Slate Grey and fitted with light grey Porsche side stripe graphics, H4 headlights, Euro-style taillights, and a Durant-style mirror. Staggered-width 16″ Fuchs-style wheels were mounted with 225/50 and 245/45 Pirelli tires since the photos were taken in 2025. The four-wheel disc brakes were overhauled during the build, including refurbishing the calipers and replacing the rotors and pads as well as replacing the wheel bearings and seals. The ride height was lowered, and the shocks, bushings, and bearings were replaced. An EZ Electric power steering system was installed following completion of the build. The brake fluid was changed and hoses replaced in preparation for the sale. The right-hand-drive cabin features sport seats that were reupholstered in black leather and houndstooth cloth, and the rear seats were trimmed to match. Lightweight door panels and replacement carpets were also installed along with a Porsche Classic Communication Management head unit with navigation and a 917-style shift knob,. The power sunroof is shown in the open position in the gallery. The aftermarket wood-rimmed steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation with polished trim rings,  including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The speedometer was repaired in April 2025, and the six-digit odometer shows 12k miles, which is not considered to be accurate. Total mileage is unknown. The 3.2-liter M930/25 flat-six features Bosch Motronic engine management and was factory rated at 231 horsepower and 209 lb-ft of torque for RoW examples. The engine was rebuilt during the backdate process, at which time a lightweight flywheel and upgraded clutch were added. Work in 2025 consisted of a valve adjustment, an oil change, and replacement of a hood shock and the spark plugs, valve cover gaskets, and fuel filter. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle, which was refreshed during the build. A free-flow exhaust system and SSI heat exchangers were also installed. One rear axle was replaced in 2025. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists a single entry in Montana in 2024. The car has not completed a California emissions test.
