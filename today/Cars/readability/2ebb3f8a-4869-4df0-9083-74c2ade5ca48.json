  "text": "One massive parking garage was found filled with Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and other exotics December 9, 2024 at 19:55 by Stephen Rivers Deposed Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad left behind a fleet of luxury cars in Syria. Exotic vehicles like a Ferrari F50 and Lamborghini Diablo were discovered in his garage. The fate of Bashar Al-Assad’s abandoned car collection remains uncertain at this time. As rebel forces seized control of Syria over the weekend, reports emerged that Bashar Al-Assad has fled to Russia and is no longer the nation’s president. With the despot gone, rebel fighters and curious citizens alike are uncovering what the former ruler left behind—and one of the most striking discoveries is an extravagant fleet of exotic cars hidden in his palace’s garage. Al-Assad’s sprawling palace in Damascus is nothing short of massive. Both rebels and everyday citizens of the nation took the opportunity to investigate the site, and they found a lot. A video allegedly taken by one person in Al-Assad’s parking garage shows dozens of high-end cars. More: Take A Rare Look Inside Sultan Of Brunei’s Mythical Car Collection Hidden For Decades From the start of that video, we clearly see a red Lamborghini LM 002 sitting as if it’s normal amongst a Lexus LX and a Toyota pickup truck. Then we see a pair of Toyota FJ trucks, a Mercedes S-Class, and an Aston Martin Rapide. This is where it gets good though. Next in line is a Ferrari F50 with its big V12 under the hood. Then, a Ferrari F430 with its V8 rests next to a gorgeous red Lamborghini Diablo with, again, a big V12. On the right side of the camera car, we see a Cadillac Escalade and several more S-Class sedans. Video Reddit At the end of the row is a white Audi R8 supercar. Beside it is a BMW and a Mercedes SL-Class. Al-Assad also had a Mercedes SLS and a Bentley Continental GT down there too. Then, as the camera turns the corner, we see a Rolls Royce Ghost, an Audi S8, and a Land Rover Defender. Unquestionably, these cars are all upper-echelon items that are rare in Syria. On top of all of them are countless others of various values. The Ferrari F50 itself is likely worth seven figures. Those in the palace found several other high-value items like purses, jewelry, and other trinkets. At this stage, there’s no telling what’ll happen with the cars next. While it’s clear from the videos that some were unlocked, none of them seem to be running. Beyond finding the keys, we imagine a few will need a battery jump. What’s certain is that this fleet of exotic vehicles represents both an extraordinary find and a striking reminder of the stark inequalities in the region Bashar Al-Assad once ruled.
