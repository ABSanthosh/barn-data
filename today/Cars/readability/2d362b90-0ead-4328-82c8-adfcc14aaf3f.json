  "description": "This 1932 Indian Four was purchased new in 1933 at Al Crocker's Freed Indian of Los Angeles, California, by the seller's father who used it to transport stocks and bonds for the LA stock exchange. Crocker, a motorcycle racer and engineer, installed an oil cooler, modified the exhaust for more leg clearance, and relocated the carburetor at the time of purchase, and he later added a skirted rear fender. The seller's father parked the bike shortly thereafter due to the Great Depression, and then World War II, and it remained stored in his garage until the 1990s when he and his two sons began displaying it at car and motorcycle events. It was inherited by them upon their father's passing. Power is from a 77ci F-head inline-four paired with a hand-shifted three-speed transmission, and the bike is finished in red and black with gold graphics. Features include a leaf-spring fork, 18″ wire-spoke wheels, a hinged rear fender, and drum brakes as well as a double-sprung saddle, a headlight, a taillight, dual spotlights, an engine guard, and a headdress horn. Recommissioning work in 2024 included cleaning the fuel system, lubricating the rockers, greasing the chassis, and replacing the tires and carburetor float. This Model 403 is now offered at no reserve with a tool kit, an adjustable windshield frame, a leather skullcap, keys, and a clean California title in the seller's name.",

Recommissioning work in 2024 included cleaning the fuel system, lubricating the rockers, greasing the chassis, and replacing the tires and carburetor float. This Model 403 is now offered at no reserve with a tool kit, an adjustable windshield frame, a leather skullcap, keys, and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The 4.6-gallon fuel tank is finished in red with gold headdress graphics and stripes, the valanced fenders are blue, and the frame, fork, engine guard, and toolbox are painted black. Features include a front-hinged black vinyl solo saddle with dual coil springs and rubber bumpers as well as a headlight, a taillight, a headdress horn, a hinged rear fender, footboards, and both side and rear-wheel stands. Black-painted 18″ wire-spoke wheels are laced to drum-brake hubs and were mounted with Firestone front and Continental Conti Blitz rear tires in 2024. The bike’s sole suspension consists of a leaf-spring trailing-link fork. A black-finished pullback inline handlebar equipped with dual spotlights and a left-side mirror features through-the-bar cable routing for the a twist-grip throttle on the left and a twist-grip timing advance on the right. An Indian-branded ammeter, a keyed ignition switch, and a domed dash light are housed in a tank-top dashboard, and an oil-pressure gauge is mounted on the engine adjacent to the foot-brake pedal. A 100-mph Corbin speedometer flanked by dual fuel filler caps is driven by a gear on the rear sprocket. The five-digit odometer shows 45k miles. The 77ci F-head inline-four features an inlet-over-exhaust valve design, a pressurized oiling system, and a kick starter, and it was fitted in-period with a coil-type oil cooler and a modified four-into-one exhaust system. Ignition duties are handled by a Splitdorf magneto while electric current for the lights and horn is provided by a separate Splitdorf generator and a battery. The oil was changed, the fuel filters were cleaned, the rockers were lubricated, and the carburetor float was replaced in preparation for the sale. The bike is titled by the number DOC225 which is stamped on the transfer case and corresponds with a 1932 Model 403. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a helical bevel-gear-driven primary, a wet clutch, and a three-speed transmission with a right-side hand shifter and a left-side clutch pedal. A tool kit, an adjustable windshield frame, a black leather skullcap, and keys—including those for the fork lock—accompany the bike. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
