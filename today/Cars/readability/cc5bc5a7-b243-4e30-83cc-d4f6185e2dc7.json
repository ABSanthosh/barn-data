  "description": "The Jaguar XJR-15 LM was a marvel of engineering that embodies the spirit of Jaguar's racing heritage. Its exclusivity, performance capabilities, and unique design made it a legendary vehicle among automotive aficionados and a true icon of its era. But it was (and still is) so rare than it's almost impossible to find documentation or even photos about this supercar. To tell the story of the Jaguar XJR-15 LM, we need to travel back to the 1980s, a decade when car design was radically taking off. While Japan was innovating with sports car, or in the US which was perfecting boring economy cars, let's focus in on Great Britain. Where the story starts: the 80s and Le Mans The 1980s Le Mans races were a full-on war. Porsche was dominating with the 1985, 1986, and 1987 Le Mans wins under their belt. But slowly, under the surface, you could see Porsche slipping, desperate to stay at the top. In ‘85, Porsche finished first through fifth, all winners running the legendary 962C. Just two short years later, at the 1987 Le Mans, Porsche had lost two spots out of the top five to Cougar and their C20, and Jaguar with their XJR-8. The pivotal moment came in the 1988 race. Jaguar stunned everyone by snatching first place from the infamous king Porsche, with their XJR-9 LM. Tom Walkinshaw racing (TWR) was the team that ran Jaguar’s cars in motorsport, and the road cars under the Jaguar Sport brand, a joint venture between TWR and Jaguar. They were the ones running the XJR-9 LM and so, with the newly gained fame from toppling the Germans from their throne, TWR set out to create a supercar that the XJ220 dreamed of being. Here comes the XJR-15 This led to the development of the XJR-15. The story goes that wealthy enthusiasts approached TWR wanting a road legal XJR-9, which certainly wasn’t a thing. So TWR reused the old engine the XJ220 was supposed to use, a 6.0 liter V12, and stuffed it into the chassis that the XJR-9 used, creating a 490 HP beast. They brought Peter Stevens on board to help design the outside of this raging beast, the same Peter Stevens who designed the holy McLaren F1 later on, and he was given a blank slate to use his magic on.

Interestingly, it came with a communication system with headsets and a microphone which both the driver and passenger wear to communicate, as that massive screaming V12 behind you isn't the conducive to small talk. Now, let's talk XJR-15 LM. Information regarding this car is scarce online, which is personally makes it so interesting. This is, I feel, the most complete record of the car on the internet, creating a definitive guide. Continue...",
