  "text": "The sixth-generation V8 will go into production in New York in 2027 May 27, 2025 at 20:33 by Michael Gauthier General Motors is investing nearly $900 million to build its next-gen V8 in New York. Production is expected to begin in 2027 and it will power full-size trucks and SUVs. The new V8 promises to be more powerful, efficient, and cleaner than today’s unit. General Motors is in the midst of a massive 6.2-liter V8 engine recall, but they’re already looking to the future. That’s clear today as the company is investing $888 (£657 / €783) million to build next-generation V8 engines at its Tonawanda Propulsion plant in New York. The sixth-generation V8 will be used in full-size trucks and SUVs including the Chevrolet Silverado, Tahoe, and Suburban as well as the GMC Sierra, Yukon, and Yukon XL. However, it remains to be seen if there will be another ICE-powered Cadillac Escalade as the company recently launched the Escalade IQ. That being said, Cadillac officials have previously walked back their electric-only plans. More: GM’s Small Block V8 Turns 70, Isn’t Going Anywhere Putting models aside, GM said the “new generation of engines is expected to deliver stronger performance,” better fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions. The company also teased “new combustion and thermal management innovations” that aid in these improvements. There’s no word on specifics, but the current 5.3-liter V8 develops 355 hp (265 kW / 360 PS) and 383 lb-ft (519 Nm) of torque. Customers can also get the aforementioned 6.2-liter V8 with 420 hp (313 kW / 426 PS) and 460 lb-ft (623 Nm). Production of sixth-generation V8 engines is slated to start in 2027 and the massive investment paves the way for new machinery, equipment, and tools. There will also be factory renovations, which isn’t surprising considering the Buffalo plant has been in operation for 87 years. CEO Mary Barra said, “Our significant investments in GM’s Tonawanda Propulsion plant show our commitment to strengthening American manufacturing and supporting jobs in the U.S.” She added, they’re “continuing to innovate the engines we build there to make them more fuel efficient and higher performing, which will help us deliver world-class trucks and SUVs to our customers for years to come.” Tonawanda won’t be the only plant building the new V8 as GM originally announced production in Flint, Michigan in 2023. However, the automaker noted today’s announcement was the “largest single investment the company has ever made in an engine plant.” Michael Gauthier / Carscoops",
