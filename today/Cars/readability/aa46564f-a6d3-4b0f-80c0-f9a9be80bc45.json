  "description": "Tata Motors has dropped the first teaser of the upcoming Altroz facelift ahead of its price announcement on May 22. The premium hatchback has been periodically updated with new powertrain options and new features, but it hasn’t received a cosmetic makeover since it went on sale in January 2020. An updated design aside, there will also be new features on the inside, but the Altroz is expected to remain mechanically unchanged. Altroz facelift gets new bumpers and lighting signatures Will have a larger touchscreen, 360-degree camera Expected to remain mechanically unchanged Tata Altroz facelift: what to expect? New fascia, larger touchscreen on the inside  The teaser video hints at a significantly revised fascia for the facelift – the split arrangement has been retained for the headlamps, but these are now full LED units and it comes with a new brow-like LED daytime running lamp signature as well. The bumper has been updated with new vertical recesses for the fog lamp housing, and there's a new design for the grille as well. At the rear, the Altroz gets new LED tail lamps with a T motif, and it is connected by an LED light bar. The rear bumper looks much sportier with a dual-tone finish, and it also gets new flush-fitting door handles that are illuminated. There's also a new EV-esque design for the alloy wheels, and new colour options are expected, too.  Tata hasn’t given us a glimpse of the interior yet, but we expect a revised dashboard with new soft-touch materials along with new colour options for the upholstery. The larger 10.25-inch touchscreen will be made available across more variants; currently it is only available with the Racer variant. It will also get a new digital instrument cluster and 360-degree camera. Tata Altroz facelift powertrain options Five powertrain options expected to be carried forward  The Altroz is currently on sale with as many as five powertrain options – the range starts with an 88hp, 1.2-litre petrol that’s offered with a 5-speed manual and 6-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox; a 73.5hp factory-fit CNG version, and a 90hp, 1.5-litre diesel engine option are also available. The CNG and diesel-powered Altroz come with a 5-speed manual only. Meanwhile, the top-spec Altroz Racer shares its 120hp, 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and 6-speed manual transmission with the Tata Nexon. All five powertrain options are expected to be retained. Crucially, the Altroz will continue to be the sole hatchback in the country to be sold with a diesel engine. Altroz update arriving amidst dwindling sales for hatchbacks  Upon launch, the updated Altroz will continue to rival the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Toyota Glanza and the Hyundai i20. The premium hatchback segment has been steadily losing ground to compact SUVs, with Altroz currently averaging monthly sales of about 2,000 units – down from its peak of about 5,000 units in FY2021-22. The upcoming facelift could be an impetus to sales. Also See: Volkswagen Golf GTi bookings open on May 5 Mahindra Thar Convertible Top variants discontinued",
