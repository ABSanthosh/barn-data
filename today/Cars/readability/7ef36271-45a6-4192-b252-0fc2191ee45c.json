  "description": "This 1950 Allard J2 is one of a reported 89 examples produced between August 1949 and 1951. Chassis 1733 was ordered new via Washington D.C.-based dealer Jack Pry with K2-style wing fenders, and it was delivered on September 13, 1950. It was campaigned by its second owner in SCCA events before it was sold to the Battelle Memorial Institute of Columbus, Ohio, in November 1951. The car was subsequently used as an evaluation vehicle for the development of a sports car project that was underwritten by the Murray Corporation of America before it was sold again in November 1953. It spent approximately 20 years stored in an open garage before it was purchased out of Peoria, Illinois, in June 1986 and underwent a multi-year refurbishment that included a conversion to right-hand drive before it won an award in the Limited Production and Special Bodied class at the 2008 Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance. The car is finished in silver gray over red leather upholstery, and power comes from a 342ci Cadillac V8 paired with a Muncie four-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes dual Carter WCD carburetors, Hildebrandt valve covers, a De Dion rear axle, a Halibrand quick-change rear end with a limited-slip differential, finned aluminum drum brakes with inboard rear units, 16” Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels, and a Bluemel's Brooklands steering wheel. This J2 was purchased by the current owner in 1997, and it is now offered on dealer consignment in Saint Louis, Missouri, with spare parts, a S.Co.T supercharger, copies of factory documentation, photographs taken between the 1950s and 1990s, service records, a scale model of the car, and a clean Montana title.",

The car is finished in silver gray over red leather upholstery, and power comes from a 342ci Cadillac V8 paired with a Muncie four-speed manual transmission.

This J2 was purchased by the current owner in 1997, and it is now offered on dealer consignment in Saint Louis, Missouri, with spare parts, a S.Co.T supercharger, copies of factory documentation, photographs taken between the 1950s and 1990s, service records, a scale model of the car, and a clean Montana title. Introduced in 1950, the J2 model was developed by Allard as a lightweight sports racer targeting the US market and featured a steel ladder frame wearing aluminum bodywork with standard front cycle fenders. US-bound examples were typically sent overseas without engines, and the export sales file presented below notes that chassis 1733 was built with provisions for the installation of a Cadillac engine as well as optional K2 wings and special bumpers. Delivered from the factory in metallic blue, the body on chassis 1733 was removed from the frame during the refurbishment and received bodywork that included the installation of replacement doors before it was repainted in its current silver gray. Equipment includes turn signals, a louvered hood panel with a clearance bulge, a leather hood strap, triple portholes along each side of the engine compartment, a windscreen, and dual exhaust outlets. Gray-painted Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-off hubs, and they are mounted with 185VR16 Blockley radial tires. A matching spare wheel with a Dunlop Racing tire is included in the sale. Suspension comprises a front swing axle, a De Dion rear end, and coil springs at each corner. Stopping power is provided by hydraulically assisted finned aluminum drums with inboard rear units. The hand brake does not work. Delivered from the factory in left-hand-drive configuration with blue leather upholstery, the cockpit was converted to right-hand drive during the refurbishment, and the two-place seating was retrimmed in red leather. Matching upholstery extends to the dash and door panels, and additional features include a padded armrest over a console storage box, black rubber floor mats, and a cowl-mounted rearview mirror. A compartment behind the seatback houses brake fluid reservoirs, an Optima Red Top battery, and an electric fuel pump. The Bluemel’s Brooklands steering wheel fronts an Allard-branded Cooper-Stewart 6k-rpm tachometer and 140-mph speedometer, Lucas fuel level and amperage gauges, and a Smiths combination gauge with readouts for oil pressure and water temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 1,600 miles, approximately 15 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The Cadillac V8 was rebuilt and bored over from 331ci to 342ci by Boyd’s Racing Engines of Norman, Oklahoma, in 2002. The engine features a Hildebrandt finned valley cover, valve covers, and an oil filter housing as well as a Detroit Racing Equipment intake manifold, twin Carter WCD carburetors, and JE pistons. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Muncie four-speed manual transmission. A Halibrand quick-change rear end with a limited-slip differential was installed during the refurbishment. The serial number plate is a reproduction. A copy of the export sales file is provided above, and it lists the car’s early chain of ownership as well as factory equipment. A collection of photos from the 1950s through the car’s 1990s refurbishment is presented in the gallery. A custom intake system that incorporates triple 2” SU carburetors, a custom manifold, and a S.Co.T supercharger is included in the sale along with a custom bonnet. Additional spare parts that accompany the car, including a grille, plexiglass wind wings, a steel dash panel, and a pair of doors retaining areas of blue paint, can be seen in the gallery.
