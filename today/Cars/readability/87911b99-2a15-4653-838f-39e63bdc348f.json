  "description": "Hyundai has revamped the line-up of its smallest SUV, the Exter, for 2025, introducing a new trim, adding more features to existing trims and rejigging the CNG options. The Exter’s price continues to start from Rs 6 lakh for the base EX variant but now goes up to Rs 9.53 lakh for the new top-spec SX Tech dual-cylinder CNG variant. Hyundai Exter SX Tech gets features like keyless entry and go, auto AC Updated Exter S and S+ variants get 8-inch touchscreen, rear camera Exter CNG now available in S Executive, S+ Executive and SX Tech trims   Hyundai Exter SX Tech trim and features explained The new Exter SX Tech trim slots below the top-spec SX(O) and SX(O) Connect trims and is available in petrol-manual, petrol-AMT and CNG-manual forms. Its feature highlights include keyless entry and go, a dashcam with front and rear cameras, a sunroof, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, an automatic climate control system and projector headlamps. However, it misses out on features such as ambient lighting, a wireless smartphone charger, leatherette upholstery, a cooled glove box and a rear wiper, which are present in the SX(O) trim. The SX Tech costs about Rs 44,000 less than the SX(O). Hyundai Exter S and S+ trims and feature updates explained The mid-spec Exter S trim, whose prices have increased by about Rs 15,000, now gets more safety features, such as a rear camera, electronic stability control, vehicle stability management and hill-start assist. Other additions include 15-inch dual-tone wheel covers and an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which have also been introduced in the S+ trim.   Like the S trim, the S+ also gets a rear camera now, besides a sunroof, rear AC vents and power adjust for the outside rearview mirrors. The Exter S+ variants now cost up to Rs 13,000 more than before.   2025 Hyundai Exter CNG variants The Exter CNG range starts with the single-cylinder S Executive variant; a dual-cylinder version is available at a Rs 8,000 premium. The prices are higher than the variants they replace (S CNG and S Duo CNG) by Rs 4,000. The top-spec Exter CNG variant is now the SX Tech, which costs Rs 5,000 more than the previous range-topper, the Exter CNG SX Dual Knight. It should be noted that other than S, all Exter CNG variants get the dual-cylinder setup that was introduced in July last year.
