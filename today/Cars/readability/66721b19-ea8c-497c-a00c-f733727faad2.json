  "text": "Screenshot: Red BullEnergy drinks company and F1 chassis manufacturer Red Bull really likes to make its drivers do some pretty absurd stunts while they are visiting the U.S. for the three Formula 1 rounds held here. This year, ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas, The Visa Cash App RB duo of Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson were blindfolded, slammed in the back of a windowless van, and taken against their will (I imagine) to a small dirt track outside of Austin for a head-to-head showdown. The VCARB 01 chassis that these two drive on Grand Prix weekends is pretty different from a 500-horsepower American V8 ministock racer with its offset alignment, three-corner braking system, and roof. That said, racers are racers, and feeling out the grip that is available in a given corner comes with the territory. The principles of going fast in an F1 car, at their basest, are similar to going fast in any other car on any other surface. It’s all about balancing grip with power delivery. With some light coaching from NASCAR Trackhouse drivers Shane Van Gisbergen and Connor Zilisch. Suggested ReadingIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | JalopinionsOffEnglishSuggested ReadingFrom the outset it seems Tsunoda has a better handle on his race car. He’s pushing the limits a bit more and exploring the racing line. Lawson isn’t far behind him, though, and that shows in their near-identical qualifying lap times. During the 5-lap race, however, Yuki was always playing captain. Aside from a single too-hot attempt at passing, which was swatted down pretty easily, Tsunoda held the lead and kept his cool. What I really would have loved to see is Van Gisbergen and Zilisch jump into those cars afterward and absolutely destroy the F1 boys’ times. I actually think Yuki and Liam did a pretty great job for their first time on a dirt oval, but Shane and Connor would clean their clocks. I will always wonder, however, if Daniel Ricciardo hadn’t been kicked off the team, might he have been able to beat Yuki?Maybe it’s time for Red Bull to start a NASCAR team again.",
