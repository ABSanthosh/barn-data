Equipment includes 17″ wheels, a sunroof, xenon headlights, power-adjustable front sport seats, a Harman Kardon sound system, and automatic climate control. The seller acquired the car in 2023, and work under current ownership included replacing the headliner, leak detection pump, battery, and instrument cluster. This E46 coupe is offered at no reserve with an owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Titanium Silver Metallic (354) and features a sunroof, xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, power-adjustable side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. Exterior imperfections are shown in the photo and video galleries below. The 17″ Style 68M wheels are mounted with 225/45 front and 245/40 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The car is equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and All Season Traction (AST), and braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The rear shock rubber stops are broken. The cabin features power-adjustable front sport seats upholstered in Natural Brown Montana leather. Amenities include a six-disc CD changer, a Harman Kardon sound system, an alarm system, an auto-dimming mirror, Myrtle wood trim, automatic climate control, and cruise control. Bluetooth connectivity has been added to the stereo and the headliner was replaced under current ownership according to the seller. Covers are missing from the trunk, the plastic on the back of the driver’s seat is loose, and other interior flaws are shown in the video and photo galleries. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 155-mph speedometer, a tachometer with an inset fuel economy gauge, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The instrument cluster was replaced in May 2024 at approximately 89k miles, and the replacement digital odometer indicates 70k miles. The 3.0-liter M54B30 inline-six was factory rated at 225 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in December 2023 and the leak detection pump was replaced in June 2024. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
