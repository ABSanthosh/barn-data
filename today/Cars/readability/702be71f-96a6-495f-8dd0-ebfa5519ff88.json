  "description": "This 1969 Kawasaki H1R is said to have been purchased new by motorcycle racer, engineer, and designer Erik Buell, founder of the Buell Motorcycle Company, in 1973 and subsequently sold to its second owner as a rolling chassis and equipped with a race-tuned H1 498cc two-stroke triple. Shifting is via a five-speed transmission, and the bodywork is finished in green and white racing livery. The bike rides on 18\" wire-spoke wheels and is further equipped with a twin leading-shoe front drum brake, a full fairing, a clear windshield, a solo seat with a rear cowl, triple Mikuni carburetors, a three-into-three expansion-chamber exhaust system, and a kick starter. This H1R was purchased by the seller in 2025 and is now offered in California for off-road use only with a spare fuel tank, a parts catalog, a paddock stand, a service manual, and a bill of sale.",

Shifting is via a five-speed transmission, and the bodywork is finished in green and white racing livery. The bike rides on 18″ wire-spoke wheels and is further equipped with a twin leading-shoe front drum brake, a full fairing, a clear windshield, a solo seat with a rear cowl, triple Mikuni carburetors, a three-into-three expansion-chamber exhaust system, and a kick starter. This H1R was purchased by the seller in 2025 and is now offered in California for off-road use only with a spare fuel tank, a parts catalog, a paddock stand, a service manual, and a bill of sale. The bodywork is finished in green with white number plates, and features include a full fairing, a solo seat with a rear cowl, and rear-set foot controls. The bike is not equipped with mirrors or lighting. Wire-spoke 18″ wheels with gold-finished rims are mounted with Bridgestone Battlax BT46 tires. Suspension consists of a Race Tech-built fork as well as dual preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by drums at both ends, the front of which features a twin leading-shoe design. Clip-on handlebars are mounted below the top triple clamp and positioned aft of a clear windscreen and instrumentation consisting of a tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline and an engine temperature gauge. The bike is not equipped with an odometer, therefore total mileage is unknown. Power is from a race-tuned H1 498cc two-stroke triple that is said to have been rebuilt in 2010. Equipment includes three Mikuni carburetors, a three-into-three expansion-chamber exhaust system, a kick starter, and a crankshaft oil injection system, though the bike runs on 40:1 premix. The bike was serviced in January 2024 by its prior owner, after which the fuel tank and carburetors were drained and flushed. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission. The bike does not have a title or registration and is being offered on a bill of sale only. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
