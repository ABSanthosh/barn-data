  "description": "With the festive season out of the way, new car dealers are gearing up to clear their unsold MY2024 inventories before the year ends. Maruti’s Arena line-up, comprising a range of body styles from budget hatchbacks like Alto and Celerio to SUVs like Brezza, is being offered at attractive discounts on most variants. Here’s what you need to know. Maruti Wagon R discounts in November 2024 The Wagon R is available with a discount of around Rs 45,000 for the 1.0 petrol version and Rs 49,700 for the more potent 1.2-litre version. The discount on the Wagon R CNG, which is the most popular of the lot, is around Rs 40,000. Maruti Swift discounts in November 2024 The current-gen Swift gets discounts of around 50,000, depending on the variant. It comes with the new Z-Series 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine, which will also power the soon-to-be-launched next-gen Dzire. The discount on the Swift CNG is around Rs 25,000 at most locations. Maruti Dzire discounts in November 2024 Almost all dealers have some unsold stock of the outgoing third-gen Dzire. The compact sedan still offers a competitive proposition and comes with a decent features list. The discount is around Rs 35,000 on the automatic variants and slightly less on Dzires with a manual gearbox. There are, however, no offers on the third-gen Dzire CNG. Maruti Brezza discounts in November 2024 Discounts on the Brezza have gone up from Rs 15,000 to Rs 22,000 at all locations. In some cities, benefits are even higher. The Nexon-rivalling compact SUV comes with a tried and tested 1.5-litre petrol engine or a 1.5-litre petrol-CNG powertrain. The CNG-powered Brezza doesn’t have discounts at all locations. Maruti Alto K10 discounts in November 2024 The discounts on the Alto K10 have increased marginally by around Rs 1,000 on the petrol variants, and is now up to a total of Rs 51,000 on most variants. The benefits offered with the Alto K10 CNG are around Rs 40,000-45,000, depending on the location.  Maruti S-Presso discounts in November 2024 Just like the Alto K10, the S-Presso has also seen a marginal hike in benefits. The petrol range gets benefits of around 55,000 now; the CNG-powered line-up has slightly lesser benefits of around 45,000. The S-Presso comes with the same 1.0-litre petrol engine as the Alto K10, paired with a 5-speed MT or a 5-speed AMT gearbox. Maruti Suzuki Celerio discounts in November 2024 The Celerio sits on the same platform as the Alto and S-Presso but is a larger hatchback overall. It has the same 1.0-litre petrol as many other Maruti models. The discounts and benefits on the Celerio range from Rs 40,000 to Rs 54,000, depending on the variant and the location.
