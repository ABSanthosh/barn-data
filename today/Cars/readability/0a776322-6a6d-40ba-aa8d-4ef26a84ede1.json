It is finished in metallic blue over blue leather and powered by a 4.2-liter inline-six with twin SU HD8 carburetors mated to a three-speed automatic transmission. Features include power windows, a Kenwood cassette player, and a Sanyo graphic equalizer. This XJ is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, repair manuals, service records, a Passport to Service booklet, historical registration documents, spare parts, and a clean California title in the current owner’s name. The car has been refinished in metallic blue and the finish is oxidized. Close-up photos of the paintwork are provided in the gallery. The 15″ chrome wheels are mounted with Pirelli P77 tires that were installed in 1987. The front dampers were replaced in 2021. The cabin is upholstered in blue leather and features a Kenwood cassette player, a Sanyo graphic equalizer, and power windows. The air conditioning compressor and the center dashboard vent air actuator were removed. The pillar trim is sun-damaged and torn, the carpet is missing from the front driver’s side floor, and the window seals are cracked. Replacement seals are included in the sale. Photos of wear and tears across the interior surfaces are provided in the gallery. The speedometer and tachometer are mounted ahead of the driver, while a clock and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level are mounted in the center of the dash. The five-digit odometer shows around 4,500 miles and has rolled over. The owner has driven the car approximately 31k miles. The instrument panel voltage stabilizer and left fuel level sending unit were replaced in 2024, but the current owner states that the fuel gauge is inaccurate. The 4.2-liter inline-six was rebuilt in 1986 and the Zenith Stromberg carburetors were swapped with a twin SU HD8 setup. Service in 2024 involved rebuilding the cylinder head and changing the oil in addition to replacing the coolant expansion tank, battery, and fuel filter.  Spare parts include the removed factory set of Zenith Stromberg carburetors, the airbox, and the AC compressor along with a replacement brake service unit. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
