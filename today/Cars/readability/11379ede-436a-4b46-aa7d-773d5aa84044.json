This 991.2 is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in GT Silver Metallic and has a black convertible soft top in addition to Aerokit Turbo body components, which include a distinctive front spoiler with side fins, a body-color rear fascia and side skirts, and a revised rear spoiler. Additional details include LED headlights with the Porsche Dynamic Light System Plus (PDLS+), quarter panel air intakes, carbon-fiber trim, and quad exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, and a replacement windshield was installed in April 2021. The 20″ Turbo S center-lock alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) featuring yellow-painted Porsche-branded calipers at all four corners. The car is equipped with Power Steering Plus, a front-axle lift system, rear-axle steering, and Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). A brake fluid flush was performed in April 2024. The power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in Espresso Natural leather that extends to the center armrest, dashboard, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Bordeaux Red seatbelts, a back-up camera, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, a Burmester sound system, adaptive cruise control, a radar detector, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The heated carbon-fiber- and leather-trimmed steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as a 225-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 10k miles, approximately 9k of which were added under current ownership. The twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six features aluminum construction and direct fuel injection. Factory-rated output was 580 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and the Sport Chrono Package adds an over-boost function that temporarily raises peak torque to 553 lb-ft. An oil change was performed in April 2024. Power is sent to all four wheels via a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche West Palm Beach in Florida, along with factory colors, options, and a total price of $232,780.
