  "text": "Shelby offers its Baja Raptor upgrade for both EcoBoost and V8-powered F-150 Raptor models 12 hours ago by Brad Anderson Prices for the V6-based model upgrades start at $61,995, while the V8 version is $64,995. Shelby has fitted a suspension lift kit and 18-inch flow forged wheels. All models come with a 3-year / 36,000-mile warranty. We here at Carscoops love the Ford F-150 Raptor R. Ford didn’t have to build such an insane pickup truck, especially when the industry is geared towards EVs and hybrids, but it did, and we’re forever grateful for it. However, Shelby American may have just one-upped Ford with its latest F-150 Baja Raptor. The company has been selling modified versions of the F-150 Raptor since 2013 and has grown its fleet with V6 and V8-powered examples of the new Baja Raptor model. Both lift the standard F-150 Raptor and Raptor-R to new heights with several performance upgrades and styling changes, although neither is cheap. The Baja package for a ‘regular’ F-150 Raptor costs $61,995, while it’ll set back Raptor R owners a cool $64,995 for the upgrades. Watch: Shelby’s 1,300 HP GT500 Code Red Runs 1/4 Mile In Insane 8.59 Seconds To make the pickup even more capable, Shelby has installed a suspension lift kit and added 18-inch flow forged wheels with 37-inch mud terrain tires. It then crafted a bespoke hood with new intakes and extraction vents, custom running boards, a new grille, and revised front and rear steel bumpers. Perhaps the coolest exterior upgrade made is the custom steel chase rack in the bed, which includes a power-actuated 50-inch LED light bar and full-size spare wheel mounts. Shelby has then worked its magic on the powertrains of the standard Raptor and the Raptor R. Models equipped with the regular 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 receive a new heat shield, high-performance intake, and an aluminum intercooler, resulting in a cool 550 hp. Owners of the Raptor R, complete with its 5.2-liter supercharged V8, can have a new 3.8-liter Whipple supercharger fitted, resulting in an impressive 900 hp. Inside, the seats have been re-trimmed in a combination of black and red leather with special embroidery on the headrests. Shelby also installs billet racing pedals and a serialized dash plaque. All of Shelby’s Baja Raptor packages include a 3-year/36,000-mile limited warranty.",
