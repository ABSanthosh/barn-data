The Rosso Fiorano exterior finish was selected from Ferrari’s Historical Colors range, and other highlights include full electric seats, 20″ forged diamond wheels, a suspension-lift system, adaptive LED headlights, parking and driving cameras, and more than $20k in optional carbon-fiber trim for the Tortora leather-upholstered cabin. Power is from a 6.5-liter F140 V12 mated to a seven-speed F1 dual-clutch automatic transaxle and Ferrari’s E-Diff limited-slip differential, and additional details include an electronically operated hardtop, four-wheel steering, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, navigation, a JBL sound system, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This 812 GTS has 2,400 miles and is now offered with a window sticker, two sets of keys, a car cover, an owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a California title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The 812 GTS was designed under the direction of Flavio Manzoni at the Ferrari Styling Centre. This example is finished in Rosso Fiorano (321), a $12,487 selection from Ferrari’s Historical Colors palette, and it features an electronically operated hardtop, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, adaptive LED headlights, rear fog lights, parking sensors, and quad exhaust outlets. Forged Diamond 20″ wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 275/35 up front and 315/35 at the rear. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded yellow calipers over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors. The car is equipped with a suspension-lift system, a Virtual Short Wheelbase four-wheel-steering system, and a magnetorheological suspension. The brake fluid was flushed in 2023. The cabin is trimmed in Tortora leather with black leather accents and Bordeaux carpeting, and it was specified with more than $20k in optional carbon-fiber accents. Further interior details include power-adjustable full bucket seats, a front driving camera, a parking camera, a JBL sound system, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The leather-wrapped flat-bottomed steering wheel fronts paddle shifters and features a manettino drive-mode selector, an ignition button, and additional controls. Instrumentation includes a center-mounted tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline and dual multi-function configurable TFT LCD screens. The digital odometer indicates 2,400 miles. The 6.5-liter F140 V12 is mounted aft of the front axle and was factory rated at 785 horsepower and 530 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed in 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a paddle-shifted seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and Ferrari’s E-Diff limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Ferrari Silicon Valley in Redwood, California, and lists factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $464,690. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. There is currently a lien out on the title to the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be repaid before the title can be transferred to a new owner.
