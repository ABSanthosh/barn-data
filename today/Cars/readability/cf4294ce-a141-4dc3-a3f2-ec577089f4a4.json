  "description": "Kia has announced that its upcoming compact SUV will be called the Syros. Internally codenamed the AY, the Kia Syros is expected to debut globally in the coming weeks with a launch likely slated for early next year. Kia Syros will have a design inspired by EV9 and Carnival Will have a more premium positioning than the Sonet Will likely be offered with both ICE and electric powertrains Kia compact SUV named Syros and not Clavis: here’s why Sources tell us that Kia had initially considered the name Clavis for the compact SUV, but dropped it later as the Carens and Carnival MPVs start with a 'C'. Since the Syros is being marketed as a 'compact SUV', the brand chose to stick to its current nomenclature of naming its SUVs with an 'S' like the Seltos and Sonet. Kia Syros to focus on rear seat comfort As we've reported earlier, the new Syros will differentiate itself from other compact SUVs by having a greater focus on rear-seat space and comfort. It features a boxy design with a flat roof and upright rear, in order to liberate maximum cabin space. There are talks of the Syros having more interior room than the Sonet, and in a league similar to the Seltos. Kia Syros powertrain options  There are no details on the powertrain front yet, but sources have previously said it will get both ICE and electric powertrain options. Kia will likely launch it with the internal combustion engines first, and the EV version will arrive later. Both versions will be based on the same platform and will be offered in front wheel drive guise. The upcoming compact SUV will be positioned above the existing crop of the sub-4m SUVs, like the Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, Maruti Brezza, and also the recently launched Skoda Kylaq.    Also See: 2024 Kia Carnival review: Manners make the van New Kia Carnival sold out for nearly a year in India",
