Finally, we have Mario Christou to reflect of his year of Speedhunting. MC: Phew, we’ve made it to the end. What a year 2024 was, eh? This may have been my favourite year of hunting speed so far, and it’s been a true pleasure to document car culture for you all. From the looks of our social media engagement, I’d say you’ve enjoyed the ride just as much as I have. Looking ahead, I’m excited to see what 2025 brings – because, honestly, I have no idea what to expect. One thing I do know is that I want to take my own car to more events next year, although it could certainly use a mild refresh to get back to 100%. I’m also keen to dive deeper into motorsport events, whether that’s endurance racing on a global scale or historic races a little closer to home. I already have some trips lined up for locations both snowy and sandy, so expect a wider variety of content from me in the coming 12 months. But before we race into 2025, with my personal favourite three stories from 2024… I was torn on this one. I almost included my full Goodwood Revival coverage in my top three, but the truth is, I got tired of running around the track perimeter in both rain and blazing sun all day. It was at night, though, as I was leaving, that I truly woke up. The sight of historic race cars bathed in the soft glow of fairy lights was straight out of a dream – and something I’ll never forget. Check out the feature here: Lucid Dreams: Goodwood Revival After Hours You’re probably getting tired of me waxing lyrical about my favourite brands and models, but a day spent with Paul McLean and his one-of-a-kind Porsche 993 RSR genuinely had me reconsidering my list of favourite cars. Picture this: a crisp, frosty morning in the British countryside, the sun rising over the dewy fields – a picture-perfect backdrop for a pretty, pastel Porsche. The thunderous 3.8-litre soundtrack only made it better. Check out the feature here: Porsche Perfection: The World’s Only Pastel Yellow 993 Cup 3.8 RSR Okay, I do feel a little guilty, including an article from last week, but in my defence, I didn’t expect December to be so packed with epic car adventures. And really, how could I not include this? Meeting one of my childhood hero cars in person – almost all to myself – was a moment that will be hard to top. Check out the feature here: Always Meet Your Hero Car: My Day With The Need for Speed BMW M3 GTR Bonus: N24 would have made the list this year if it hadn’t been cut short to just seven hours and if I’d had the usual media access. Still, it gets an honourable mention for being an incredibly fun weekend and a chance to show you how to experience the event as a spectator. Check out the feature here: Wrong Side Of The Fence: A Spectator’s Guide To The N24 This was meant to be a short recap, so I’ll wrap it up here. But before I go, I want to wish all of you a very happy New Year and 2025 packed with more awesome car culture.
