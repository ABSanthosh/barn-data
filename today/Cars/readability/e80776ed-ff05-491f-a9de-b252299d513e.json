  "description": "This 2007 Porsche 911 997.1 GT3 RS is one of 410 examples built for the US market during a two-year production run. It is finished in black with orange accents over black upholstery, and power is provided by a 3.6-liter flat-six that was rebuilt in 2024 with a replacement crankshaft, rod bearings, drive belt, and pinned coolant lines. Shifting is through a six-speed manual transaxle, and the clutch and flywheel were replaced at the time of the engine rebuild. The car features a limited-slip differential, 19” wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, an adjustable rear wing, a removable roll cage, a center muffler delete, and hard-back sport seats. It was previously listed on BaT in November 2020 before it was acquired by the current owner in 2021 and listed again on BaT in August 2022. This 997.1 GT3 RS has 6k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment in Oregon with a window sticker, an owner's manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title.",

It was previously listed on BaT in November 2020 before it was acquired by the current owner in 2021 and listed again on BaT in August 2022. This 997.1 GT3 RS has 6k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment in Oregon with a window sticker, an owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title. The track-focused RS model features a carbon-fiber rear wing and wider quarter panels as well as model-specific badging when compared to the standard 997 GT3. This example is finished in Black and was fitted with orange vinyl accents and GT3 RS side graphics in 2022, at which time the wheels, side mirrors, and rear wing end plates were repainted. Exterior features include bi-xenon headlights, headlight washers, fog lights, clear side markers, LED taillights, and dual center-mounted exhaust outlets. The hood struts were replaced in preparation for the sale. Paint protection film has been applied to parts of the car, and two scuff marks on the front bumper cover are shown up close in the gallery below. The 19″ alloy wheels are mounted with 235/35 front and 305/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The GT3 RS was factory equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) featuring adjustable coilovers. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over ceramic-composite rotors. The cabin features hard-back sport seats upholstered in Black leather and Alcantara along with a removable roll cage that was bolted in place under previous ownership. Interior amenities include a CD stereo, automatic climate control, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) infotainment with navigation. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer with an 8,400-rpm redline, a 225-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 5,800 miles, approximately 700 of which were added under current ownership. The 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six was factory rated at 415 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. It was rebuilt in July 2024 at Porsche of Beaverton, Oregon, with a replacement crankshaft, rod bearings, drive belt, and pinned coolant lines. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and the clutch and flywheel were also replaced at the time of the engine rebuild. The rear muffler has been removed. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Porsche Santa Barbara in California along with factory colors, standard and optional equipment, and a total price of $132,045. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
