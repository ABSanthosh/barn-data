Four variants are available – Chieftain Dark Horse, Chieftain Limited, Chieftain Powerplus Limited and Chieftain Powerplus Dark Horse.

Indian Motorcycle showrooms are present in only six cities across our country – Chandigarh, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kochi. It bears mentioning that you reach out to your nearest dealer for exact pricing, availability and waiting periods for the specific model you are interested in.  All prices, ex-showroom, India.
