  "text": "Tesla's electric sedan will receive another facelift to bring it up to date and help reverse its declining sales March 2, 2025 at 19:20 by Thanos Pappas Tesla’s VP of Engineering has all but confirmed that an upgraded Model S will arrive later this year. These independently made illustrations envision an extensive facelift inspired by the latest Model Y. The large electric sedan debuted in 2012 and underwent facelifts for the 2017 and 2022 model years. The Model S has been a cornerstone of Tesla’s lineup for well over a decade, debuting in 2012 as the brand’s first fully in-house-developed EV after the Lotus-based Roadster. Over the years, it has evolved through numerous updates, mostly to keep up with the advancements in technology. But at this point, calling it “dated” feels almost cliché. While most other automakers would have already mapped out a successor by now, Tesla appears to be content with rolling out yet another refresh later this year. However, don’t expect a full redesign; this will likely be another facelift at best, rather than an all-new generation. More: We Compare The 2026 Tesla Model Y Side-By-Side With Its Predecessor Tesla’s VP of Engineering, Lars Moravy, all but confirmed the news recently, hinting at an upcoming upgrade for both the Model S and Model X. Speaking on Ryan McCaffrey’s Ride the Lightning podcast, Moravy said: “Just give it a minute. We’ll get there. The upgrade a few years ago was bigger than most people thought in terms of architecture and structure. We’ll give it some love later this year; we’ll make sure it gets some of the stuff we’ve been putting in 3 and Y. Everyone here has a little place in their heart for S/X. They are not going anywhere anytime soon.” Sharper Looks and Efficiency Tweaks? The Model S originally launched in 2012, three years after its concept debut. It has since undergone two significant revisions, one for the 2017 model year and a more extensive refresh in 2022. While it has maintained a familiar silhouette over the years, the 2026 update could bring more noticeable changes, particularly in exterior design. Though no official details have been confirmed yet, these updates could bring it more in line with the smaller and significantly more popular Model 3 Highland and Model Y Juniper, both in terms of styling and technology. Illustrations: Nikita Chuicko for Kolesa Independent digital artist Nikita Chuicko (a.k.a. Kelsonik) has created speculative renderings of the 2026 Model S for Kolesa, drawing inspiration from the 2026 Model Y. The illustrations depict the sedan with a redesigned front end featuring split LED headlights and sharper bumper intakes. At the rear, it sports a full-width taillight cluster with the “indirect lighting” introduced earlier this year on the Model Y, along with a prominent diffuser. More: Should Tesla Give The Model 3 A Juniper Update? Besides giving the EV a fresh look, the redesigned elements could also improve aerodynamics, potentially extending its range. Based on comments from Tesla’s VP of Engineering, the company seems to believe the 2022 Model S already brought significant structural updates, ones that could carry over into the 2026 version. However, Tesla engineers may still find ways to boost efficiency with smaller tweaks, such as updated wheels and brakes. Interior Refinements Could Be Subtle but Impactful The last major Model S update delivered a complete interior overhaul, but even minor refinements can enhance quality and usability. If Tesla follows its approach with the Model Y Juniper, the revamped Model S could introduce subtle but welcome additions, such as ambient lighting or a front-facing bumper-mounted camera. 2024 TESLA MODEL S What About the Powertrain? Unless Tesla surprises us, we don’t expect any meaningful changes to the powertrain options. Currently in North America, the lineup includes the All-Wheel Drive trim, offering a 410-mile (660 km) range, a 130 mph (209 km/h) top speed, and a 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) time of 3.1 seconds with rollout. The high-performance Plaid variant features a tri-motor setup producing 1,020 hp, a 348-mile (560 km) range, a 200 mph (322 km/h) top speed, and a blistering 1.99-second 0-60 mph (96 km/h) sprint with rollout. More details about the 2026 Model S should emerge in the coming months. Still, the big question remains: will this be another mild update, or will Tesla implement a comprehensive redesign to help reverse declining sales?",
