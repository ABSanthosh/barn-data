  "description": "Hyundai showcased the Staria premium EV at Auto Expo 2025 on Friday (January 17). Do note that the company has no immediate plans to launch it in India, but it is using the event to gauge customer interest. The Staria is a large, almost van-like premium MPV that has been available in international markets since 2021. It has various seating configurations, even featuring four rows for up to 11 people. The model showcased at the Auto Expo, however, was a more premium 7-seater version. The Staria was showcased at the Auto Expo with a 3.5-litre V6 engine Gets a 7-seater configuration with second-row captain chairs The Staria shares its underpinnings with the Kia Carnival MPV The Staria stretches the tape at over 5.2 metres and is shaped like a typical people mover, although a low beltline with a large glasshouse gives it a distinctive look. The face has a swooping design, with a black contrasting finish on the bumper, which houses a large mesh grille and rectangular pixel headlamps. In typical MPV fashion, the profile is slab-sided, while at the rear, it gets large vertical tail-lamps, again with pixel detailing like the front. Inside, the Staria features a vertically oriented central touchscreen with plenty of physical buttons on a panel below. The cabin also boasts a free-standing instrument cluster, a four-spoke steering wheel, and a flat floor, which aids free movement within the cabin despite being an ICE-powered vehicle. The real highlight, however, is the second-row captain’s chairs, which are powered and come with a ventilation function. The third-row seats get a bench configuration. The Staria shares its underpinning with the Kia Carnival, which is already on sale in India. Internationally, it’s available with a range of petrol and diesel engines, but the one showcased at the Auto Expo comes with a 3.5-litre V6 engine that produces 272hp and 331Nm of torque. The engine comes mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox, driving the front wheels. Hyundai has also launched the Creta Electric at the Auto Expo with prices starting from Rs 17.99 lakh (ex-showroom).
