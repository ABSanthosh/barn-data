  "text": "Limited edition Soarer Aerocabin looks like a regular coupe but its roof and rear window disappear into the rear deck June 29, 2025 at 21:01 by Chris Chilton A Japanese-market Toyota with a hard-to-spot special feature is up for sale in the US. The 1989 Soarer coupe is just one of 500 made with the Aerocabin retractable roof. Power comes from a 237 hp turbocharged, 3.0-liter inline six that predates the JZ. If you’re a fan of obscure Japanese classics, especially those that never officially left the country’s shore, this one will grab your attention. A 1989 Soarer 3.0 GT Aerocabin has surfaced on an internet auction site giving US Toyota geeks a rare chance to own one of the brand’s most exclusive 1980s creations. To the untrained eye, this might just look like another squared-off, luxury coupe from Japan’s bubble era. But the Aerocabin was anything but ordinary. Built as a limited-run special, only 500 examples were ever produced – all destined for the Japanese domestic market. Related: Toyota’s New JDM Crown Estate Gets A Pull-Out Deck Chair And 302 HP Its standout feature is a fully power-retractable hardtop roof and rear window, transforming the car into a BMW Bauer-style pseudo-convertible at the push of a button. Retractable hardtops were still a few years from their heyday at this point, and though you could reasonably argue that it’s a poor convertible since it has fully-framed door glass, what really impresses is how neat the whole installation is. The roof and rear window stow in a compartment on the rear deck when not needed, but when they’re in place, protecting the driver and passenger from the elements, the Aerocabin looks almost indistinguishable from a stock Soarer GT-Limited. Toyota experts, though, would notice the two-seat-only layout, the rear seats having been sacrificed to make room for the trick roof’s mechanism, and the Crystal Pearl over metallic beige paint, a mandatory combo for Aerocabins. Under the hood, all Aerocabins came equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter 7M-GTE inline-six engine, which was the top-spec motor for Soarers. The M-series was the forerunner to the legendary JZ used in cars like the MkIV Supra, and while it didn’t punch as hard, it still developed up to 237 hp (240 PS), which was a solid showing for the day. The Soarer wasn’t a hardcore sports car anyway, it was a refined GT, making the four-speed auto a natural fit. BaT In keeping with the luxury GT theme and the late 1980s build date, the interior is loaded with a digital dashboard, automatic climate control and wall-to-wall leather thats ruched on the doors and seen better days on the driver’s chair. Anyone wanting to return this Aerocabin to tip-top shape will want to treat the seats to some fresh cow, and sticklers for originality might want to replace the aftermarket coilovers and Blitz exhaust. But whoever buys it might be equally happy to enjoy this rare slice of JDM history just as it is, and ignore the curious mention of flood damage reference on the title. Because with fewer than 500 ever made, and only a handful imported to North America under the 25-year import rule at most, this Soarer Aerocabin is sure to ignite conversations and make friends wherever it goes.
