Refurbishment work under previous ownership is said to have included rebuilding the 3.6-liter flat-six and four-speed Tiptronic transaxle as well as refreshing the suspension with Bilstein shocks. The car is finished in Glacier White over gray partial leather, and equipment includes 17″ Cup II wheels, a power-operated sunroof, power-adjustable front seats, cruise control, a Becker Porsche CR-210 stereo, a remote six-disc CD changer, and air conditioning. This 993 Carrera coupe shows 149k miles and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in California with the service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title in the owner’s name. The car is finished in Glacier White (L3AU) and features headlight washers, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors with black-finished caps, a power-operated sunroof, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. The door handle seals have disintegrated, the rock guards have been removed, and detailed photos of imperfections on the front bumper cover are shown in detail in the gallery. The 17″ Cup II wheels wear a chrome finish and are mounted with Riken Raptor tires installed in June 2021. The car rides on Bilstein shocks and braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in gray partial leather, and amenities include cruise control, a Becker Porsche CR-210 stereo, a remote six-disc CD changer, and air conditioning. One of the cassette storage boxes is missing. The leather-wrapped steering wheel features Tiptronic S shift buttons and frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 149k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The air-cooled 3.6L M64 flat-six features a VarioRam intake system and was factory-rated at 282 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. There is a leak originating from the oil pan. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed automatic transaxle with Tiptronic S manual shift mode. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. The Washington title is listed as a duplicate. The car last passed a California emissions test in February 2020.
