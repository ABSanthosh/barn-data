Finished in Ultraviolet over black leather and Alcantara upholstery, the car has the Sport Chrono Package, 20″ and 21″ center-lock alloy wheels, a front-axle lift system, LED headlights with PDLS, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, a rear spoiler, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus. This 991.1 GT3 RS was purchased by the seller in 2022 and is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a car cover, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title. Developed as a track-focused variant of the GT3, the RS is equipped with a magnesium roof panel, aluminum doors, a rear wing, and a carbon-fiber trunk lid, engine cover, and front fenders. This example is finished in Ultraviolet and has LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS), dual exhaust outlets, and clear LED taillights. The 20″ front and 21″ rear center-lock alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by yellow Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated carbon-ceramic discs, and the car is equipped with a front-axle lift system. Standard GT3 RS equipment included rear-axle steering, Porsche Active Suspension Management, and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Alcantara inserts, “GT3 RS” embroidery on the headrests, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include automatic climate control, PCM with navigation, cruise control, and carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a central GT3 RS-branded tachometer as well as a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 354 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 338 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus. The Carfax report lists at least one open recall. There is currently a lien out on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner. You are not connected to real-time updates.
