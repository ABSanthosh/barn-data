  "text": "Could pickup owners' Republican leanings explain why tariffs on cars from Mexico and Canada were paused? 4 hours ago by Sam D. Smith The rise in pickup truck prices may have influenced the decision to pause tariffs. Pickup owners are twice as likely to identify as Republicans over Democrats. Analysts say vehicles made in Mexico or Canada could cost $7,000 more on average. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that auto-related tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports would be postponed until April. This is the second time the US president has moved the goalposts, and the latest change came only a day after touting how America’s big three automakers were “excited” about the incoming 25 percent levies. Read: These 47 Cars Made In Canada And Mexico Could See Major Price Hikes The official explanation as to why the automotive tariff can was being kicked down the road is that the same automakers, namely Ford, Stellantis and GM, had requested the extension. “We spoke with the big three auto dealers. We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement,” said White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. Why the Delay? While it’s really no surprise that US automakers aren’t exactly thrilled with the idea, considering many of their models are made across the border, one of the biggest reasons why Trump caved in may be down to one particular type of vehicle: pickups. So says a report from Reuters, suggesting the decision to pause the tariffs may be down to trucks being popular with Republican voters. According to a study by Edmunds, pickup owners are twice as likely to say they’re Republicans than Democrats. The Pickup Factor As it stands, a 25 percent tariff on vehicle imports would potentially see price hikes for some of America’s most popular trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and Silverado HD, GMC Sierra, Ford Maverick, and Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500, all of which are manufactured in either Canada or Mexico. It’s not just domestic-branded pickups that would be on the receiving end, either, as Toyota makes the Tacoma in Mexico. While the impact of the proposed tariffs will largely vary from one manufacturer to another, data suggests that immediate impact to consumers would be an average price hike of $3,000, while vehicles made in Mexico or Canada would see around $7,000 added on top. The Bigger Picture: Tariffs Aren’t Just About Cars It’s not just cars and trucks made over the border that would be impacted either, as virtually no vehicle in the US is made entirely of locally sourced parts. Components such as engines, transmissions, and various other crucial elements for US-made cars are often produced in neighboring countries. “A tariff over Mexico, in this particular case, or over Canada, is going to mean hundreds of millions of dollars as an impact” on the industry overall, said transmission maker ZF’s North America President Ramiro Gutierrez.",
