  "description": "After sighting the bike on test, Bajaj has finally launched the Pulsar N125 at Rs 94,707 for the base variant and Rs 98,707 for the Bluetooth variant. Bluetooth variant gets more features 198mm ground clearance available Available in seven colours The Pulsar N125 is Bajaj’s fifth motorcycle in this displacement range and it's powered by an all-new air-cooled, 124.58cc, single-cylinder motor. This new mill is rated for 12hp at 8,500rpm and 11Nm of torque at 6,000rpm. As is par for the course, this engine is mated to a 5-speed gearbox. Underpinnings are also commensurate for this class with a simple, single-cradle frame that's suspended by a telescopic fork and monoshock. A 240mm front disc brake and a 130mm rear drum brake handle stopping duties, aided by CBS (Hero’s Xtreme 125R is the only one to offer ABS in this class).  Tyre sizes differ based on the variant you decide upon. The front hoop is sized 80/100-17 on both but at the rear, you get a thinner 100/90-17 tyre on the base, while on the Bluetooth variant you get a 110/80-17 tyre. Like the popular TVS Raider and Hero Xtreme 125R, the Bajaj Pulsar N125 has a sharp and striking design language, and the bright paint options accentuate it. The base N125 variant can be had in four colours – white, black, red and blue – while the Bluetooth variant comes in three dual-tone options – black/red, black/yellow and black/purple. Just like the other two, the N125 also has a split seat configuration, although its setup is more like the Raider than the Xtreme; its pillion seat isn’t much higher than the rider’s perch.  Where Bajaj has gone down its own path with the Pulsar N125 compared to the Hero Xtreme 125R and the TVS Raider is by giving it plastic fork shrouds to beef up the front end. With its 9.5-litre tank fully fuelled, the Pulsar N125 weighs 125kg and has a seat height of 795mm. What stands out though is the ADV-esque 198mm of ground clearance, despite the underbelly exhaust. Coming to the features, there is a new LED headlight, flanked by colour-coded plastic pieces. Depending on the variant you choose, you get basic Bluetooth baked into the LCD display. The Bluetooth variant also has a larger dash, a silent starter as well as the aforementioned fatter rear tyre. With its N125, Bajaj is squarely aiming at the TVS Raider and the Hero Xtreme 125R, and we hope to bring you a comparison between these three sporty Indian commuters soon.
