  "description": "Skoda has confirmed the India launch of the Octavia RS for this year. Speaking to Autocar India, Ashish Gupta, the newly appointed brand director for Skoda India, said, “The Octavia RS is something that we will definitely bring to India this year.” Although Gupta didn’t commit to a specific timeline, we understand the new Octavia RS will be here in India by the festive season. Octavia RS will be brought to India as a CBU Powered by a 265hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine Other CBU models, including diesels, put on hold for now Skoda Octavia RS to be brought as a CBU Expected to have a price tag of north of Rs 50 lakh Having made an appearance at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in January, the Octavia RS will finally go on sale as a full import this year, although allocations are likely to be limited. The Octavia already has a loyal fan following in India, especially in RS guise, so this will indeed be a much-awaited launch for enthusiasts. The 200 units of the previous-gen Octavia RS 245 brought to India, despite the steep price tag, were a quick sell for the brand. The fourth-generation Octavia RS is powered by a 265hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine, the same unit that does duty on the recently launched Volkswagen Golf GTI. We’ve already driven the new Octavia RS in Croatia, both on road and on track, more about which you can read here.    However, being a CBU, pricing will be on the steeper side, and we expect it to be north of Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom). The positioning, therefore, will be quite similar to the VW Golf GTI. Skoda Kodiaq RS, Superb India launch put on hold Launch of Skoda diesels also unlikely in the near future While the launch confirmation of the Octavia RS is certainly good news, Skoda was also considering bringing the Kodiaq RS, the Superb and even the regular Octavia to India. In fact, the brand had also hinted at bringing back diesel with the Superb and considered locally assembling the Octavia. However, these models have been put on hold for now, and Gupta says that’s due to the uncertainty around the FTA agreements and other geopolitical scenarios. Superb diesel was showcased at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo earlier this year. “With talks of the FTA agreement, new policies and tariffs, the market is very uncertain. Even if I want to bring about a structure for my upcoming product portfolio, the variables are so many that every strategy is currently fraught with risks. Although we do have a plan in mind about what cars can make it to India and should make it to India, all these uncertainties do not allow us to take decisions,” says Gupta. So, while the Octavia RS will serve as a halo model and a brand builder, Skoda will focus on its locally produced models, especially the Kylaq. The compact SUV has turned around the brand’s fortune in India with average sales of 5,000 units a month; plus, there are lifecycle updates for the Kushaq and Slavia in the pipeline. Skoda is also actively expanding its dealer network and customer touchpoints to reach out to a wider market. Skoda Kylaq is averaging sales of 5,000 units a month.  “We definitely want to focus on models from our global line-up, but I want to do it in a structured manner. I do not want to carpet-bomb the market and ourselves. I want to focus on what matters at this point, and that is the Kylaq and the current portfolio that we have. Our objective is to have a portfolio that is consistent and always present. I’d rather have less and be consistent with it than have more and not be consistent with it,” Gupta explained.   Following the Kylaq’s launch, Skoda has jumped to the seventh position in India and even managed its highest-ever monthly sales of 7,422 units in March 2025.   With inputs from Saptarshi Mondal  Also See: Jeep Grand Cherokee Signature Edition launched at Rs 69.04 lakh Renault Duster, Bigster hybrid launch within 12 months of petrol model",
