  "text": "Tesla is only viewed slightly more favorably than its outspoken CEO 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier A new study suggests many Americans don’t have a favorable view of Tesla or Musk. 55% have an unfavorable view of Musk, with 49% feeling the same about Tesla. A vast majority won’t consider buying or leasing a Tesla, at least partly because of Musk. It turns out Germans aren’t the only ones waving a firm “nein” to Tesla. A new survey has shown that a whopping 67% of Americans wouldn’t consider owning or leasing one of the company’s electric vehicles. Unsurprisingly, Elon Musk is partly to blame. Of the respondents, 20% cited Musk as the “whole reason” they wouldn’t consider getting a Tesla, while 17% said he was “part of the reason.” This means Elon Musk alone is turning off 37% of Americans. That’s far greater than the 27% who said the outspoken executive had no part in the decision not to consider a Tesla. More: Huge Survey Finds 94% Of Germans Won’t Buy A Tesla After Musk’s Political Antics While Musk used to enjoy cult-like status among his fans, this appears to have faded. When asked “Is Elon Musk the reason why you own or lease a Tesla or would consider owning or leasing a Tesla in the future?” Only 1% of respondents said yes to being the “whole reason” or “part of the reason.” The survey – which was conducted by Yahoo News and YouGov – interviewed 1,677 U.S. adults online from March 20 to 24, 2025 with a margin of error of around 2.6%, and found a majority of people have an unfavorable opinion of Musk. 45% have a very unfavorable opinion, while another 10% see him somewhat unfavorably. That contrasts to a mere 21% that have a very favorable opinion. Tesla’s favorability closely echoed Musk’s as 49% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of the automaker. On the flip side, just 37% have a favorable opinion. 48% of people disapproved of how Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is handling things, despite 49% favoring cutting federal spending. 52% of people also believe Musk is trying to help himself more than he’s trying to help the country. All of this suggests Musk and Tesla are in for a bumpy ride. Of course, when people are so angry they’re shooting up your dealerships and firebombing your vehicles, that’s to be expected.",
