  "description": "This 2000 Acura NSX-T was acquired by the seller's late father in 2006, and over the next several years, they spent several weekends caring for and modifying the car, which was inherited by the seller in 2024. Work had involved rebuilding the six-speed manual transaxle, fitting a Science of Speed clutch and lightweight flywheel, and mounting 17\" and 18\" Fikse multi-spoke wheels in addition to installing aftermarket exhaust, suspension, and brake components. The interior has been outfitted with an aftermarket sound system, a Hella horn, a radar detector, and carbon-fiber trim. The car is powered by a 3.2-liter DOHC V6 and further equipped with a limited-slip differential, a removable body-color roof panel, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable seats, automatic climate control, and cruise control. This New Formula Red NSX-T shows 76k miles and is now offered with 2017 and 2022 service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Mississippi title in the seller's name.",

Work had involved rebuilding the six-speed manual transaxle, fitting a Science of Speed clutch and lightweight flywheel, and mounting 17″ and 18″ Fikse multi-spoke wheels in addition to installing aftermarket exhaust, suspension, and brake components. The interior has been outfitted with an aftermarket sound system, a Hella horn, a radar detector, and carbon-fiber trim. The car is powered by a 3.2-liter DOHC V6 and further equipped with a limited-slip differential, a removable body-color roof panel, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable seats, automatic climate control, and cruise control. This New Formula Red NSX-T shows 76k miles and is now offered with 2017 and 2022 service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Mississippi title in the seller’s name. The NSX featured aluminum bodywork, and this example is finished in New Formula Red with a body-color removable roof panel. Features include pop-up headlights, an integrated rear wing, side air intakes, power-adjustable side mirrors, a Hella horn, and dual exhaust outlets. An April 2007 entry of the Carfax report states a right fender was “requested for repair.” The 17″ and 18″ Fikse multi-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Falkin Azenis tires. The car features a four-wheel double-wishbone suspension with Dali Racing front and rear sway bars, and braking is handled by NSX-branded calipers over vented rotors at each corner. Steel-braided clutch and brake lines have been fitted. The cabin features power-adjustable sport seats upholstered in tan leather, while NSX-branded floor mats line the footwells. Interior appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, a Kicker amplifier, a radar detector, a Kenwood stereo, carbon-fiber trim, and a subwoofer. The stainless-steel door sill plates are stamped with the car’s serial number. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline, a 188-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 76k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.2-liter C32B V6 features dual overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank and utilizes VTEC variable valve timing. Factory-rated output was 290 horsepower and 224 lb-ft of torque. The engine was removed for service in 2017, which involved head gasket replacement, block repairs, and more as detailed on the invoice provided in the gallery. The alternator was rebuilt in 2022. The catalytic converters have been removed, per the seller. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and limited-slip differential. Additional work in 2017 involved overhauling the transaxle, replacing the second gear and synchro hub, and installing a Science of Speed clutch and lightweight flywheel. An aftermarket exhaust system was fitted, which included a Comptech muffler assembly and additional Science of Speed components. A Dali Racing stone shield was added in September 2022. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned repair. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
