  "description": "This 1995 Ferrari F512 M was originally specified in Rosso Corsa over Beige Connolly leather and delivered new in Spain. It was imported to the US by the current owner in 2021, and it now shows 8,600 kilometers (~5,300 miles). ~$31,000 of work at Continental Auto Sports in Hinsdale, Illinois in November 2021 included a belt service, replacing engine seals and filters, mounting Pirelli P Zero tires, and polishing the fixed headlights. It is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it is equipped with 18\" multi-piece Speedline alloy wheels, air conditioning, power windows, a CD stereo, and a gated shifter. This F512 M is now offered at no reserve in South Carolina on dealer consignment with a Ferrari Classiche red book, the owner's manual, service records, spare parts, and a clean Illinois title.",

It was imported to the US by the current owner in 2021, and it now shows 8,600 kilometers (~5,300 miles). ~$31,000 of work at Continental Auto Sports in Hinsdale, Illinois in November 2021 included a belt service, replacing engine seals and filters, mounting Pirelli P Zero tires, and polishing the fixed headlights. It is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it is equipped with 18″ multi-piece Speedline alloy wheels, air conditioning, power windows, a CD stereo, and a gated shifter. This F512 M is now offered at no reserve in South Carolina on dealer consignment with a Ferrari Classiche red book, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and a clean Illinois title. The Pininfarina-designed F512 M was the final installment of the Testarossa with NACA hood ducts as well as revised fixed headlights, quad taillights, and bumper covers when compared to the outgoing 512 TR. Approximately 500 were produced, and this example was ordered in Rosso Corsa and also has fog lights, side intake strakes, body-color rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. The headlights were removed and polished in 2022. Silver multi-piece Speedline 18″ alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 235/40 front and 295/35 rear that were installed in 2021. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner, and the master cylinder was rebuilt in December 2021. The cockpit is trimmed in Beige Connolly leather upholstery over the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Interior amenities include a CD stereo and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,200-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 8,600 kilometers (~5,300 miles), approximately 12 of which were added under current ownership. The sending units for the speedometer and oil pressure gauge were replaced in December 2021. The 4.9-liter DOHC flat-12 received a revised crankshaft and titanium connecting rods over the version used in the 512 TR. Output was rated at 432 horsepower and 367 lb-ft of torque when new. A belt service was performed at Continental Auto Sports in Hinsdale, Illinois in November 2021, at which time the camshaft seals and gaskets, hoses, purge valves, fuel filters, and fluids were replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The included Ferrari Classiche red book lists colors, specifications, and production information. Owner’s manuals, service records, spare parts, a tool kit, seat covers, and a car cover are also included. The Carfax report lists history beginning in 2021.
