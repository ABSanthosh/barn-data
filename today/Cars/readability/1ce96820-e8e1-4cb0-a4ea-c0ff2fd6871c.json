Equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, power-adjustable seats, a Blaupunkt cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This 930 Turbo cabriolet is offered with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arkansas title. The car is finished in black and front and rear spoilers were standard on the Turbo. Features include a black convertible soft top and fog lights. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Forged 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs, and Turbo models received front and rear sway bars as standard. The power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in black leather. Turbo-branded floor mats line the footwells, and amenities include air conditioning, an analog clock, power windows, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. The three-spoke MOMO steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation, including a central tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, fuel level, and boost pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 37k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to University Porsche of Seattle, Washington, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $80,186.
