  "description": "1967: it was the summer of love. And a busy time for the Ferrari 330 P4, arguably the sexiest race car ever designed. The world of motorsport is filled with legendary vehicles, but few can match the allure and mystique of the 1967 Ferrari 330 P4. And more specifically chassis 0856, the only one (among the three built) that never got any damage or modification. In short, the current chassis 0856 is pretty much the same that it was in 1967. One Sexy Beast \"One Sexy Beast\", as we claimed when we created our film about chassis 0856, a few years ago at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Canada. Revered as one of the greatest racing cars ever built, this specific P4 not only represents a pinnacle of engineering excellence but also carries a rich history that includes an array of noteworthy owners. Its story is a testament to Ferrari's ingenuity, competitive spirit, and timeless appeal. But what has happened to this specific unit? In this feature story, we are trying to keep up with Miss Universe 1967. [embed]https://youtu.be/awArTC8iQ3Q?si=XEFCOD6_X6OvFw9j[/embed] Origins of the Ferrari 330 P4 But first, some context. The mid-1960s marked a period of intense rivalry in the world of endurance racing. Ferrari, with its illustrious history and competitive edge, was locked in a fierce battle with Ford, whose GT40 had been making significant strides on the racing circuit. To reclaim its dominance, Ferrari developed the 330 P4, a car designed to be the ultimate racing machine. This vehicle would become one of the most iconic sports prototypes ever created. A Design Masterpiece The Ferrari 330 P4 was an evolution of the 330 P3, with substantial improvements aimed at enhancing performance, handling, and aerodynamics. The body was designed by Pininfarina, featuring an elegant yet aggressive profile. With its sleek lines, low-slung stance, and distinctively wide rear, the P4 exuded an aura of speed even when standing still. Underneath its stunning exterior, the 330 P4 housed a 4.0-liter V12 engine. This engine was a marvel of engineering, producing around 450 horsepower. It incorporated advanced features such as a double overhead camshaft (DOHC), Lucas fuel injection, and a 12:1 compression ratio. Paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, this powertrain enabled the P4 to achieve blistering speeds and impressive agility on the track. Cutting-Edge Aerodynamics and Engineering The chassis of the 330 P4 was crafted from tubular steel, with fiberglass body panels providing a lightweight yet robust frame. The car's suspension system featured independent suspension with wishbones and coil springs, ensuring optimal handling and responsiveness. Ventilated disc brakes offered superior stopping power, a crucial factor in the demanding world of endurance racing. Aerodynamics played a pivotal role in the P4's design. Every curve and contour was meticulously shaped to minimize drag and maximize downforce. The car's streamlined nose, curved windshield, and strategically placed air intakes contributed to its exceptional aerodynamic efficiency, allowing it to glide through the air with minimal resistance. The Glory of Chassis 0856 Among the three Ferrari 330 P4s produced (plus the P3 converted to P4 specs), chassis 0856 is the most celebrated, having played a crucial role in Ferrari's racing triumphs during the 1967 season. Like we mentioned above, its current condition is pristine and to its original specifications. The 1967 season was a critical year for Ferrari. The team aimed to reclaim their status as the undisputed leaders in endurance racing, and the 330 P4 was at the forefront of this mission. Chassis 0856 was a key player in this endeavor, contributing significantly to Ferrari's success. Continue...",
