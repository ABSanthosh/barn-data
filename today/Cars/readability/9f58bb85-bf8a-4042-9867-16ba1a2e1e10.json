  "description": "The ninth-generation Toyota Camry has been launched in India, priced at Rs 48 lakh (ex-showroom). This latest iteration of Toyota’s premium sedan debuted in international markets over a year ago and continues with a frugal petrol-hybrid powertrain, which is among its highlights. Toyota says deliveries of the new Camry will commence immediately.  New Camry is Rs 1.83 lakh pricier than the outgoing model It is equipped with an ADAS suite for the Indian market It also gets a new 230hp fifth-generation hybrid engine New Toyota Camry price and rivals The new Camry is priced Rs 1.83 lakh higher than its predecessor, which carried a price tag of Rs 46.17 lakh. Still, the luxury sedan costs Rs 6 lakh less than its main rival in India, the Rs 54 lakh Skoda Superb. Going by price, the new Camry can also be seen as an alternative to the likes of the Audi A4, Mercedes C-Class and BMW 3 Series Gran Limousine, which are priced from Rs 46.02 lakh, Rs 54.40 lakh and Rs 60.60 lakh, respectively. New Toyota Camry exterior and platform The ninth-generation Toyota Camry is built on the TNGA-K platform. Its face gets Toyota’s “hammerhead” styling, which features a sharp nose, slim LED headlamps and daytime running lights. A narrow grille almost connects the headlights, the ‘T’ logo has moved up compared to its predecessor, and the bumpers sport an almost Lexus-like anvil shape. A bold new character line along the side, redesigned 18-inch alloys and new C-shaped LED tail-lamps round off the design highlights. New Toyota Camry colour options Toyota offers the nionth-gen Camry in the following exterior colours: Precious Metal, Dark Blue, Cement Grey, Emotional Red, Attitude Black and Platinum White Pearl.  New Toyota Camry interior and features Inside, the new Camry has a revamped dashboard design with a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster next to a 12.3-inch touchscreen for infotainment duties, offering both wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It also packs a nine-speaker JBL sound system, a 10-inch head-up display and digital key functionality. The rear seats have reclining function, with controls in a rear centre console. For added comfort, Toyota offers ventilated 10-way powered front seats, three-zone auto climate control and a sunroof with a retractable sunshade. Toyota’s Safety Sense 3.0 suite, which is what the brand calls its autonomous driving assistance system (ADAS), comes as standard. The system features pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection, radar-based cruise control, lane-tracing assist and road-sign assist, along with automatic high beam for better night visibility. Other features include nine airbags, parking sensors front and back and a 360-degree camera. New Toyota Camry engine The new Camry is powered by a 2.5-litre petrol engine paired with Toyota’s fifth-generation Hybrid System (THS 5). This updated setup has a total output of 230hp, which is about 12hp more than the outgoing model. Fuel efficiency has also imp[orved compared to the outgoing model and is now an ARAI-rated 25.49kpl. Like other hybrids in the family, the Camry uses an eCVT gearbox. The brand offers a 8-year/1.6 lakh km warranty on the Camry's battery pack. Toyota has been bringing the Camry to India via the CKD route since it launched the seventh generation here in 2013, and the new model will also be assembled at the brand’s Bidadi plant in Karnataka.
