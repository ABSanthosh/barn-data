  "text": "May 10, 2025 9:00 AM EDTTesla owners confirm they are being targeted, most often in the south Tesla vehicles have become lightning rods for people’s disdain for CEO Elon Musk, with many simply mocking or ridiculing drivers. A new report suggests some are taking it a step further; almost half of the respondents say their vehicles have been “intentionally damaged,” with a bulk of the reports coming from the south. Further, almost three-quarters of Tesla drivers feel they’re at risk of being targeted in the future. Guardian Service also reports that over half of Tesla owners say their insurance premiums have risen, whether their vehicle was damaged or not. Though many remain happy with their Teslas, 19 percent are now rethinking their decision to buy a Tesla instead of the myriad other electrified options from other automakers. Tesla damage, by the numbers Though Tesla stock has continued to climb steadily over the past few months, this study suggests onlookers are still displeased with Elon Musk and are taking it out on Tesla owners. Forty-four percent of Tesla owners report their vehicles have been intentionally damaged, with 46 percent of those reports coming from the south. 22 percent of Tesla owners in the northeast report their Teslas have seen purposeful harm done, while 21 percent out west report the same. The Midwest remains the “safest” place to own a Tesla, with only 11 percent of owners there reporting damage. A full 72 percent of Tesla owners say they “believe they’re more likely to be targeted for vandalism than other drivers.” Fifty-four percent of owners say they have installed or enabled video surveillance on their vehicles out of fear, with 21 percent reporting they already had surveillance enabled. Twenty-five percent of respondents to the survey say they have caught someone purposefully damaging their vehicle. According to those who say their cars were damaged, the average repair bill is $1,900. Gen Z Tesla drivers seem to face the most hostility, as sixty-one percent of Tesla owners in this age bracket say their cars were damaged intentionally, with an average repair bill for this age range being $2,113. Millennials and older drivers paid closer to $1,730. Sixty-one percent of Tesla drivers say their insurance premiums have risen, with the average annual increase at $340. Over half – 53 percent – say they expect their insurance premiums to rise this year, too. Beyond the actual damage, 43 percent of Tesla owners report people gesturing rudely toward them or giving them dirty looks as they drove by. As a result of the damage, gestures, and looks, 66 percent of Tesla drivers feel anxiety leaving their cars unattended, and 60 percent say concerns over vandalism have led them to avoid driving as much or avoid certain areas altogether. Final thoughts It’s impossible to truly know another person’s mindset, but causation and correlation are strong here. If Elon’s actions truly are spurring this spate of crime. In that case, it’s regrettable that people’s feelings about him are manifested as damaging another person’s property.",
