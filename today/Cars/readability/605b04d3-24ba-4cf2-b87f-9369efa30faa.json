  "description": "A three-row derivative of the Renault Duster was recently spied testing in India. Likely to be called 'Boreal', as teased by Renault in April this year, this upcoming C-segment SUV is due for a global unveiling on July 10. As per Sylvia dos Santos from Renault's marketing department, the name Boreal comes from Boreas, the God of wind in Greek mythology, and it also means north wind in Latin. The SUV may share its powertrains with the Duster Gets B-pillar mounted door handles, a prominent roof spoiler with raised ends Though unconfirmed, it could be a rebadged version of the Dacia Bigster, which is currently sold in international markets. For those not in the know, Romania-headquartered Dacia is owned by the Renault Group. Renault Duster three row SUV: spy shot details Thick body cladding all around Both the front and rear bumpers have a chunky design, and thick cladding is present all around. Also notable are the LED DRLs, pull-type handles for the front doors and B-pillar-mounted handles for the rear doors, thick roof rails and a prominent spoiler with raised ends. The Renault SUV will most likely match the Dacia Bigster’s dimensions – 4,570mm in length, 1,810mm in width, and 1,710mm in height – and sit on a 2,700mm wheelbase. The upcoming Renault SUV's LED DRL is hidden by heavy camo. As for the interior, not a lot could be seen apart from a central touchscreen unit in landscape orientation, possibly 10.1 inches. The Duster and its larger sibling will be manufactured at Renault’s Chennai plant for both domestic and export markets. Renault Duster three row SUV: powertrain May share engine options with the Duster SUV UK-spec Duster's engine. (Used for representation only) It might share its powertrains with the Duster, which is going to have a 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine and a strong hybrid option as well; a naturally-aspirated petrol motor may also be offered. Further, manual and automatic transmissions are anticipated. CNG may also be on the cards for the three-row vehicle, but an all-wheel drive system is unlikely, as it may not be cost-effective. Renault Duster three row SUV: India launch, rivals Likely in 2026 Renault may introduce the three-row SUV a few months after launching the Duster SUV in early 2026. While the Dacia Bigster has been revealed as a 5-seater with a very large boot in markets abroad, the Renault equivalent is expected to be sold as a 7-seater in India. It will slot above the Duster and rival the Hyundai Alcazar, Tata Safari, Mahindra XUV700 and MG Hector Plus.  IMAGE CREDIT: TURBOSTART-L7X VIA YOUTUBE.
