  "text": "The Cayenne-based mule hints at Bentley's electric future July 21, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier A mule for Bentley’s upcoming electric crossover has been spied on the Nürburgring. It’s based on the Porsche Cayenne Electric, but the production model will have a unique design. The Luxury Urban SUV will debut next year and go into production in 2027. Bentley introduced their first electric vehicle earlier this month and it provoked strong reactions. While initial response to the EXP 15 concept was far from positive, the company used it to explore the idea of a crossover-ified ultra-luxury sedan. Despite hinting at the brand’s new styling language, the concept isn’t going into production. Quite the opposite as Bentley’s first production EV will be a “Luxury Urban SUV.” More: Bentley’s First EV Caught Hiding Under Porsche Cayenne Disguise The mysterious crossover has now traded Northern Europe for the Nürburgring as development progresses. Unfortunately, the model is still a mule based on the upcoming Porsche Cayenne Electric. This doesn’t reveal much about the Bentley, although the British license plates are hard to miss. Last year, Bentley introduced their Beyond100+ strategic plan and announced they’re now aiming to go fully electric in 2035. The electric crossover will lead the way and it will have a lot in common with the Cayenne. SHproshots Porsche has been heavily promoting the upcoming model and recently said the electric crossover will “combine performance, everyday usability, long-distance comfort and off-road suitability in compelling fashion.” It will ride on the PPE platform and have a maximum towing capacity of up to 7,716 lbs (3,500 kg). The performance brand has also confirmed the model will offer an Active Ride system, which “keeps the body level at all times, even during dynamic braking, steering and acceleration.” One of the biggest unanswered questions is performance specifications, but the Macan Electric gives us some hints. It has outputs ranging from 355 hp (265 kW / 360 PS) to 630 hp (470 kW / 639 PS). Buyers will also find a 100 kWh battery pack, which delivers EPA-estimated ranges of between 288 and 315 miles (463 and 507 km). The crossover is scheduled to debut next year, before going into production in 2027. Bentley has trademarked the Barnato and Mayon names, indicating possible monikers for the model. Applications for both indicated they could be used for electric vehicles and other automotive-related equipment.",
