  "text": "This special model was built in 2008 and offered in Hertz's 'Fun Collection' 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson Chevrolet built just 500 Corvette ZHZ models exclusively for Hertz’s Fun Collection. The Velocity Yellow paint and chrome wheels make this C6 Corvette hard to miss. This particular ‘Vette has 116,500 miles under its belt and is being auctioned off. If you’re going to drive a Chevrolet C6 Corvette, you might as well do it in a color that grabs attention before the engine even turns over. This 2008 Corvette ZHZ does exactly that, finished in Velocity Yellow Tintcoat and equipped with bright chrome wheels. It’s a special edition made for Hertz, and with just 500 examples built, it’s far from your average rental-car survivor. Chevrolet and Hertz have partnered on several unique models over the years, but the Corvette ZHZ remains one of the more memorable. Built for Hertz’s so-called “Fun Collection” in 2008, these cars spent their early lives in the rental fleet before making their way into private ownership. Despite the badge, this one’s far more than just a former airport lot special. Read: Hertz Slashes Prices On Shelby Mustang Mach-E, Some With Just 3K Miles In creating a Corvette that would appeal to Hertz customers, Chevrolet painted the car in Velocity Yellow Tintcoat and fitted it with both the 2LT Equipment Group and GCA Ultimate Appearance Package. The ZHZ also rocks a dual-mode performance exhaust, Magnetic Selective Ride Control suspension, and Xenon headlights. Cars \u0026 Bids is selling the car and mentions that the current owner has made some subtle alterations to it. It now rocks black vinyls on the front fenders, Stingray emblems on the quarter panels, red brake calipers, tinted windows, and a new Sony head unit supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Photos Cars \u0026 Bids The Fine Print Interested buyers should be aware that this car was involved in an accident back in March 2010, which required repairs to the rear bumper and passenger-side quarter panel. It also rides on older tires from 2019 and 2020 – something to factor into your budget if you’re planning to drive it hard. Otherwise, the listing doesn’t note any mechanical issues, and the 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 should still have plenty of life left in it. The current seller picked it up in January, and it has 116,500 miles (~187,488 km) under its belt. Really, the only letdown here might be the six-speed automatic transmission. A manual would’ve made this bright yellow Corvette even more compelling, but if you’re just in it for the cruise, it’s still a strong package. If this Hertz-spec Corvette sounds like your kind of weekend toy or daily driver with some attitude, you can check out the full listing over here. You never know what a few bids might land you.
