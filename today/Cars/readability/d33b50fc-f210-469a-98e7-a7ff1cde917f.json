  "text": "Tesla continues to lead EV sales charts in the US, but its sales dropped 10% in February March 26, 2025 at 20:32 by Brad Anderson The R1 SUV trails behind Tesla Model Y, Model S, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Prologue. A total of 95,692 new electric vehicles were sold across the country last month. Sales of used EVs have also jumped year-over-year, with 24,875 units sold in February. With the Rivian R1S starting at $75,900 in the United States, it’s safe to say no one expected it to rival the volume of more affordable, everyday EVs. But in January, the R1S managed to secure a surprisingly impressive spot as the fifth-best-selling new EV in the country, placing it alongside some pretty elite company. Rivian itself does not release monthly sales figures, but according to data from Cox Automotive, the only EVs to outsell the R1S were the Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Honda Prologue. While exact sales figures for these models weren’t revealed, the data shows that Rivian moved more than 4,000 vehicles in February. Review: The 2025 Rivian R1S Is An Imperfect But Promising Look At The Future It comes as no shock that Tesla continues to dominate the EV market, but its grip is loosening ever so slightly. In February, overall Tesla sales fell by 10%, largely due to a steep 32.5% drop in Cybertruck deliveries and 17.5% fewer Model 3s sold. Even the best-selling Model Y saw a modest dip of 3.1%. It’s clear that the company’s previous growth spurt may be slowing down, but they’re still in the driver’s seat. Looking at the US market more broadly, new EV sales declined slightly in February with 95,692 total sales. This was a 5.9% fall from January 2025 but up 10.5% from February last year. Similarly, used EV sales dropped 4.7% from January, but soared 34.2% from February 2024 to 24,875 units, representing 1.7% of all used cars sold. The market share of new EVs sold fell slightly to 7.7%. When it comes to the used EV market, Tesla continues to reign supreme, accounting for a dominant 39.9% of all used EV sales last month, although its sales dipped by 9.2% compared to January. On average, new and used EVs continue to sell for more than their internal combustion engine counterparts. However, this is mainly due to the wider price range of ICE vehicles, which pulls their average transaction price down. EVs, by contrast, tend to be more expensive from the start, leading to a higher average. More: These Are The Cars With The Highest And Lowest Depreciation After 5 Years In February, the average transaction price (ATP) for a new EV was $55,273, reflecting a 3.7% increase from the previous year and notably higher than the ATP of a new ICE vehicle, which sat at $47,555. Used EVs aren’t much of a bargain either, with the average ATP for a used EV at $38,057, significantly more than the $33,134 ATP for a used ICE vehicle.",

However, this is mainly due to the wider price range of ICE vehicles, which pulls their average transaction price down. EVs, by contrast, tend to be more expensive from the start, leading to a higher average.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore: \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/this-car-loses-72-2-of-its-value-after-just-five-years/\"\u003eThese Are \u003cstrong\u003eThe Cars With The Highest And Lowest Depreciation After 5 Years\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn February, the average transaction price (ATP) for a new EV was $55,273, reflecting a 3.7% increase from the previous year and notably higher than the ATP of a new ICE vehicle, which sat at $47,555. Used EVs aren’t much of a bargain either, with the average ATP for a used EV at $38,057, significantly more than the $33,134 ATP for a used ICE vehicle. \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n        \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-scaled.webp\" data-type=\"inarticle-image-block\"\u003e \n            \u003cfigure\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\n                    \u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-400x152.webp 400w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-1024x388.webp 1024w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-768x291.webp 768w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-1536x583.webp 1536w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-2048x777.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, (max-width: 1535px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 1000px, (max-width: 300px) 600px, (max-width: 200px) 200px\"/\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-1024x388.webp\" srcset=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-400x152.webp 400w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-1024x388.webp 1024w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-768x291.webp 768w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-1536x583.webp 1536w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-2048x777.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, (max-width: 1535px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 1000px, (max-width: 300px) 600px, (max-width: 200px) 200px\" alt=\" Rivian R1S Breaks Into The Top 5 Best Selling EVs\" width=\"2560\" height=\"971\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-1-1024x388.webp\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\n                \u003c/picture\u003e\n            \u003c/figure\u003e\n        \u003c/a\u003e  \n        \n\n\n\n        \u003ca href=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-scaled.webp\" data-type=\"inarticle-image-block\"\u003e \n            \u003cfigure\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\n                    \u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-400x155.webp 400w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-1024x396.webp 1024w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-768x297.webp 768w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-1536x593.webp 1536w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/webp/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-2048x791.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, (max-width: 1535px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 1000px, (max-width: 300px) 600px, (max-width: 200px) 200px\"/\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-1024x396.webp\" srcset=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-400x155.webp 400w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-1024x396.webp 1024w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-768x297.webp 768w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-1536x593.webp 1536w, https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-2048x791.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, (max-width: 1535px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 1000px, (max-width: 300px) 600px, (max-width: 200px) 200px\" alt=\" Rivian R1S Breaks Into The Top 5 Best Selling EVs\" width=\"2560\" height=\"989\" data-src=\"https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EV-Sales-2-1024x396.webp\" data-type=\"inarticle-image\"/\u003e\n                \u003c/picture\u003e\n            \u003c/figure\u003e\n        \u003c/a\u003e  \n        \n                        \n                    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                \u003c/div\u003e\n                                \n                                \n                \n            \u003c/article\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
