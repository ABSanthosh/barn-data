The car rides on a Detroit Speed suspension kit with a hydroformed front subframe, sway bars, and a Quadralink rear setup, and the Forgeline 18″ wheels are mounted over C6 Z06-specification brakes. The body is finished in dark green with white side stripes and features front and rear spoilers and a cowl induction hood, while the cabin is outfitted with a roll bar, digital climate control, a Kenwood head unit, Hertz audio, cruise control, and black leather Recaro front seats with Schroth harnesses. This modified Camaro coupe was acquired by the current owner in 2021 and is now offered on dealer consignment with a dyno sheet and a clean Missouri title. The body was refinished in dark green with a white hockey stick-style stripe along the bodysides approximately 10 years ago. Details include a cowl induction hood, aftermarket headlights, front and rear spoilers, chrome bumpers, and SS-style badging. A Detroit Speed mini-tub kit was installed to accommodate the larger rear wheels and tires. Rock chips were touched up, according to the selling dealer. The Detroit Speed and Engineering suspension system is comprised of a hydroformed front subframe with tubular control arms and rack-and-pinion steering, while a Quadralink setup with adjustable coilovers is found out back. Sway bars are installed front and rear. Forgeline 18″ wheels feature bronze centers and polished lips, and they are mounted with 275-series front and 335-series rear BFGoodrich g-Force Rival tires. The selling dealer notes the C6 Z06-specification braking system features a C5-style master cylinder and booster along with an E-Stopp electric parking brake. Black leather covers the adjustable Recaro front seats and contoured rear bench, and Schroth harnesses are attached to the roll bar. A custom console, door panels, and parcel shelf were fitted during the build, and appointments include digital climate control, cruise control, a billet shifter and door handles, and a Kenwood head unit linked to Hertz audio components. The MOMO Tuner steering wheel features red stitching, and Dakota Digital instrumentation sits in a custom billet gauge cluster. The odometer shows 3,300 miles, which is said to represent the mileage accumulated since the completion of the build. Total mileage is unknown. The selling dealer tells us the 6.2-liter LT4 crate V8 was installed in 2022 by Classic Car Studio of Brentwood, Missouri, and it was subsequently sent to the Katech facilities in Michigan, where it was fitted with a ported supercharger and tuned. The engine compartment and firewall were tucked and a Speartech wiring harness was utilized during the build. Cooling is handled by a black-anodized aluminum radiator and dual fans. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec T56 six-speed manual transmission, and the selling dealer notes the 9″ rear end is equipped with a limited-slip differential. The underbody was stripped and refinished and weld-in subframe connectors were installed during the build. Long-tube headers flow to an X-pipe midsection and Hooker mufflers. A February 2024 dyno sheet from Katech shows peak output of 600 horsepower and 626 lb-ft of torque. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
