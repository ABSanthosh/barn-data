  "text": "Zero-miles base coupes are being advertized as low as $37,900 or you can get into a Nismo for $55k 3 hours ago by Chris Chilton Nissan dealers are offering big discounts on box-fresh examples of the Z coupe. We’ve seen cars advertised for $37,906 – less than Mazda wants for an MX-5 RF. The deals are on the 2024 model years because the MY25s haven’t been released. Nissan’s Z looked like great value when it debuted back in 2022 with a $40k list price that undercut its six-cylinder Toyota Supra rival by $10k, but dealers’ attempts to add markups undermined the value proposition. Those days are gone: now many dealerships are offering discounts so big that a new Z costs less than a Mazda Miata RF with half the power. Considering sales of the Z climbed a whopping 79 percent in 2024, you might expect the asking prices for new cars to at least come close to MSRP based on demand. But browsing vehicles for sale on Cars.com we found dealers advertising brand new, delivery-miles coupes for as little as $37,906. Related: Don’t Get Duped, You Can Snag A Nissan Z For Less Than MSRP That was for base model in black with an automatic transmission that Kerry Nissan in Kentucky dealer claims has an MSRP of $44,900 (Nissan’s with-shipping price for a base Z is $44,100). And it’s no unicorn. At the time of writing, we found 35 other Zs in entry level Sport trim and a choice of colors and transmissions priced below $40k on Cars.com. For reference a 181 hp (184 PS) 2025 Mazda MX-5 RF Grand Touring is $38,535 including destination charges. Though the Sport lacks goodies like the LSD, forged Rays alloys and Bose hifi fitted to the more expensive Z Performance, it gets the exact same 400 hp (406 PS) 3.0-liter bi-turbo V6. But say you do want the Performance, then you’ll be pumped to know there are savings to be had there, too. Performance models have an MSRP including destination of $54,110 regardless of whether you specify an automatic or manual transmission, but dealers say they’ll get you into one from $43,295. Sure, you’ll be looking at some delivery cost unless you happen to live next to Clay Cooley Nissan of Lewisville, TX, whose deal looks the best, but there are plenty of other retailers around the country offering Zs almost as cheap. More: These Are The Best-Selling Sports Cars of 2024 Even the Nismo model that only launched 18 months ago has fallen victim to discounting. Delivering 20 hp (20 PS) more than the other Zeds and an improved chassis, but lacking a manual option, the Nismo stickers at $66,890 including destination, which kind of moves the Z away from affordable territory. But the discounts push the needle back the other way way, promising Z ownership at $57,995, after an $11,310 discount from the $69,305 MSRP at Nissan of Westbury in New York. These deals are all on 2024 cars, but that doesn’t make them yesterday’s news, because Nissan still hasn’t revealed the MY25 cars. Source: cars.com",
