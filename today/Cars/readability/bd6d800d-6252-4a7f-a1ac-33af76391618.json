  "text": "The redesigned Tiguan promises to be a huge improvement thanks to sportier styling and modern tech November 14, 2024 at 19:09 by Michael Gauthier VW of America will introduce the redesigned Tiguan on November 20, ahead of its debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The company released a single teaser image, showing a taillight that is virtually identical to the one found on the Tayron. The two models will have a lot in common, but VW has previously said the Tiguan will have unique styling and powertrains. The Los Angeles Auto Show kicks off next week and Volkswagen has announced plans to get ahead of the festivities by unveiling the 2025 Tiguan on November 20 at 5 pm PT (8 pm ET). Besides revealing a time and date, the automaker released a teaser image of the crossover’s taillight. If the light looks familiar, it should, as it’s virtually identical to the one found on the European Tayron. Both have similar graphics, although the Tiguan’s taillight has an extra splash of red on the sides. More: 2025 VW Tayron Debuts In Europe, Previews America’s Tiguan Volkswagen isn’t saying much, but previously confirmed the Tiguan will be based on a long-wheelbase version of the Tayron. The automaker also said the American crossover will have unique styling, powertrain options, and equipment. We’ll learn full details next week, but the Tayron rides on the MQB evo platform and features a more rugged design than the outgoing Tiguan. The front end sports an illuminated Volkswagen emblem that is flanked by slender LED headlights. They reside above a wide intake as well as vertical air curtains. The minimalist interior offers seating for up to seven and comes equipped with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster as well as a 12.9-inch infotainment system. Other highlights include ambient lighting, a tri-zone climate control system, a panoramic sunroof, and authentic open-pore wood trim on high-end variants. The Tayron offers a host of driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection. Customers will also find road sign assist, exit warning, and an assortment of camera views. It remains to be seen how much the Tiguan and Tayron will have in common, but we’ll find out relatively soon. VW Tayron",
