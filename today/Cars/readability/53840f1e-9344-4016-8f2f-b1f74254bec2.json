  "description": "This 1996 BMW M3 coupe is a right-hand drive Evolution example that remained registered in the United Kingdom until the seller's acquisition in 2023 and subsequent importation to the US. Powered by a S50B32 3.2-liter inline-six paired with a six-speed manual transmission, the car has 80k miles and is finished in Boston Green Metallic over light gray Nappa leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a sunroof, fog lights, 17\" Style 24 wheels, a CD stereo, an onboard computer, and dual-zone climate control. Service under current ownership reportedly included replacing the shift knob, stereo system, headliner, air conditioning condenser, and tires along with fluid changes. This E36 M3 coupe was listed on BaT in November 2023 and is now offered at no reserve with an additional set of wheels, manufacturer's literature, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a Kansas title in the seller's name.",

Powered by a S50B32 3.2-liter inline-six paired with a six-speed manual transmission, the car has 80k miles and is finished in Boston Green Metallic over light gray Nappa leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a sunroof, fog lights, 17″ Style 24 wheels, a CD stereo, an onboard computer, and dual-zone climate control. Service under current ownership reportedly included replacing the shift knob, stereo system, headliner, air conditioning condenser, and tires along with fluid changes. This E36 M3 coupe was listed on BaT in November 2023 and is now offered at no reserve with an additional set of wheels, manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a Kansas title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Boston Green Metallic (275) and equipped with fog lights, glass headlights with washers, a sunroof, a front lip spoiler, a rear spoiler with an integrated third brake light, twin exhaust outlets, and factory aerodynamic bumpers, side sills, and mirrors. Bubbling paint is noted above the right corner of the rear license plate and a dent is visible in the left fender. The seller notes a two-stage paint correction was performed and the exterior received a protective ceramic coating. Staggered-width 17″ Style 24 wheels are mounted with 225/45 front and 245/40 rear Bridgestone RE71-RS tires that show 2022 production codes. The car is equipped with a sport-tuned suspension, and stopping power is provided by AP Racing front brake calipers and ventilated discs up front along with stock hardware at the rear. Hartge front and rear sway bars are fitted, and the brake fluid was flushed in July 2024. A set of five 17″ BBS wheels wearing Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires are included in the sale. The right-hand-drive cabin features manually adjustable Vader front sport seats upholstered in light gray Nappa leather along with matching door panel inserts. Additional appointments include an onboard computer, a CD stereo with Bluetooth connectivity, folding rear seats, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The headliner, stereo system, and shift knob were replaced in 2023, according to the seller. The air conditioning condenser was replaced and the system was recharged using R134a refrigerant in October 2023. There is a tear in the driver-side door seal. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 80k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. The S50B32 inline-six is equipped with individual throttle bodies and was factory rated at 321 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in July 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The seller reports that the fluids in the transmission and differential were changed in 2023. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage. A Carcheck report is also provided in the gallery showing the ownership, registration, and MOT history. The Kansas title carries a “Replacement Title” notation.
