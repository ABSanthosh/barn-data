  "description": "This 1994 Porsche 911 Carrera is a German-market coupe that was optioned without a sunroof. It spent time under the care of an Austrian collector prior to the seller's purchase and subsequent importation to the US. The car shows 67k kilometers (~41k miles) and is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a G50/21 six-speed manual transaxle, the latter of which was only available in rest-of-the-world examples. It was specified in Riviera Blue over Classic Grey full leather, and it is equipped with the Motor Sound Package, M030 sport suspension, a limited-slip differential, 18\" Turbo Twist wheels, heated sport seats, a Hi-Fi sound system, a Blaupunkt Bremen RCM 43 cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This 993 coupe is now offered in Texas with the owner's manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller's LLC.",

It spent time under the care of an Austrian collector prior to the seller’s purchase and subsequent importation to the US. The car shows 67k kilometers (~41k miles) and is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a G50/21 six-speed manual transaxle, the latter of which was only available in rest-of-the-world examples. It was specified in Riviera Blue over Classic Grey full leather, and it is equipped with the Motor Sound Package, M030 sport suspension, a limited-slip differential, 18″ Turbo Twist wheels, heated sport seats, a Hi-Fi sound system, a Blaupunkt Bremen RCM 43 cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This 993 coupe is now offered in Texas with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The car is finished in Riviera Blue (39E) and was optioned without a sunroof. Additional features include a top-tinted windshield, a speed-activated rear spoiler, integrated fog lights, headlight washers, and power-adjustable side mirrors. The hood has been refinished. The 18″ Turbo Twist wheels are wrapped in Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires. The car was optioned with a sport suspension as well as an Automatic Brake Differential (ABD), and the 993 was the first 911 to feature multi-link rear suspension. Braking is handled by black-finished Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in Classic Grey leather, which extends to the dashboard and the door panels. Additional amenities include heated sport seats, a Hi-Fi sound system, a Blaupunkt Bremen RCM 43 cassette stereo, and air conditioning. The leather-wrapped four-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as a 300-km/h speedometer, a Quarz analog clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 67k kilometers (~41k miles), approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The air-cooled 3.6L flat-six features the Motor Sound Package, which added a revised intake and mufflers. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a short-ratio G50/21 six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: L39E – Riviera Blue TF – Classic Grey leather C00 – Version for Germany 030 – Sports suspension 139 – Seat heating, left 220 – Limited-slip differential 224 – Automatic Braking Differential (ABD) 233 – Internal production code related to tires 334 – Cassette-radio Blaupunkt Bremen RCM 43 340 – Seat heating, right 383 – Sports seat, left, electrical height adjustment 387 – Sports seat, right, electrical height adjustment 398 – 17″ wheels 490 – Hi-Fi sound system 567 – Top-tinted windscreen 573 – Air conditioner The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and lists an initial entry in September 2024.
