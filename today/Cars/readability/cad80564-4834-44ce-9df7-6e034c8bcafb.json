It is finished in Nero Carbonio over Nero leather upholstery and is equipped with 20″ Astro Anthracite alloy wheels, Skyhook adaptive suspension, a power-operated black canvas soft top, bi-xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable front seats, navigation, a Bose sound system, parking sensors, and dual-zone automatic climate control. This GranTurismo convertible is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Nero Carbonio and features a power-operated black convertible soft top, adaptive bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, fender porthole vents, front and rear parking sensors, LED taillights, and dual exhaust outlets. Touch-up paint has been applied to the exterior. The 20″ Astro Anthracite alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 245/35 up front and 285/35 at the rear. Braking is handled by red-finished calipers over cross-drilled and vented rotors at each corner. A Skyhook adaptive suspension was standard. A brake fluid flush was carried out in March 2023. The cabin features heated power-adjustable front seats upholstered in Nero leather with red stitching as well as a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, door panels, and carpets. Interior amenities include an infotainment system with navigation in addition to an 11-speaker Bose surround-sound system, cruise control, and dual-zone automatic climate control. An automatically deploying rollbar system was standard. The right rear window regulator assembly was replaced in 2019 per the seller, who also notes that the trunk liner does not stay secure. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles, approximately 9k of which were added under current ownership. Designed in collaboration with Ferrari, the 4.7-liter F136 V8 featured dual overhead camshafts per cylinder bank, four valves per cylinder, and variable valve timing for a factory rating of 444 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. In 2023 an oil change was performed, the battery was replaced, and the engine wiring harness was repaired. The knock sensor wiring was repaired in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF six-speed automatic gearbox. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
