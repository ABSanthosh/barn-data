  "description": "The Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX has been unveiled overseas. It is a limited-production motorcycle, of which only 1,200 units will be produced worldwide. The bike features a striking yellow paint scheme and a more committed rider’s triangle. The Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX is limited to 1,200 units worldwide The bike features a neon-yellow paint job with ‘RX’ graphics It has a more aggressive riding position with new clip-ons Triumph Speed Triple 1200 RX unveiled The RX continues to use the Brembo Stylema Calipers with Ohlins EC 3.0 suspension Like its name suggests, the RX is based on the 2025 Speed Triple 1200 RS. To earn the RX suffix, the Speed Triple 1200 has undergone several revisions to its rider’s triangle. It now features sportier ergonomics, with the clip-ons set lower and farther from the rider. Additionally, the foot pegs are more rear-set and positioned slightly higher. Braking duties are handled by twin, radially mounted Brembo Stylema calipers. The bike runs on 17-inch wheels wrapped in Pirelli Supercorsa V3 tyres. The RX retains the latest Ohlins EC 3.0 semi-active suspension, paired with an Ohlins SD EC steering damper. Powering the RX is the same 1,163cc inline-three liquid-cooled engine, producing 183hp at 10,750rpm and 128Nm at 8,750rpm, mated to a 6-speed gearbox. The RX also features a special Akrapovic end can. Although this exhaust is made from carbon fibre and titanium, it hasn’t resulted in any weight savings. At 199kg (kerb), the Speed Triple 1200 RX remains one of the lightest litre-class streetfighters. With only 1,200 units slated for production, the RX is priced at GBP 19,000 (Rs 21.62 lakh approximately), an increase of GBP 1,500 (Rs 1.70 lakh) over the standard Speed Triple 1200 RS. It remains to be seen whether Triumph allocates any units of this exclusive RX model for India. Also see: Ducati Diavel V4 RS leaked, launch expected in 2026",
