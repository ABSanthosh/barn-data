The interior features TMI Products seating trimmed in brown along with Dakota Digital instrumentation, power windows, a center storage console, and a retro-style head unit. The truck rides on 20″ Riddler 605 wheels and has Wilwood brakes, tubular control arms, and coilovers. This modified C10 is now offered with a California title in the seller’s name. The seller notes that the revised bodywork was constructed of replacement sheet metal except for the cab and doors and was finished in Harvest Gold. Details include a rolled rear pan, concealed tailgate hinges, a fiberglass lift-off hood, and outlets for the exhaust cutouts integrated behind the front wheels. The side windows are one-piece glass and do not retract flush with the door. The raised bed floor is made from hickory with black walnut inserts and has cutouts to integrate the twin electric fans and the dual outlets for the 3″ exhaust system. The bed floor can be raised electrically to access the aluminum fuel cell, which is equipped with an Aeromotive A1000 in-tank fuel pump. Riddler 605 20″ wheels are mounted with mixed tires. Braking is handled by Wilwood multi-piston calipers, and an electric parking brake is activated via a switch located on the dash. Suspension includes tubular rear trailing arms and a Classic Performance Products front coilover conversion kit. The power steering system utilizes a Volvo-sourced electric pump. The refreshed cabin features TMI Products components, and the bucket seats are trimmed in brown vinyl with central grommets. Color-coordinated carpets line the floors. Equipment includes power windows, push-button start, a center storage console, a Holley Sniper module, and a retro-style head unit. The Impala-style steering wheel sits ahead of a Dakota Digital instrument cluster with a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary readouts. The digital odometer shows 1,600 miles. The seller notes that the 540ci big block V8 was installed under current ownership and assembled with twin turbochargers, Dart 345 aluminum cylinder heads, a COMP Cams camshaft, and a Holley Sniper fuel injection system. Two air cleaner assemblies have been utilized under current ownership and are pictured in the gallery below. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a TH400 three-speed automatic transmission equipped with a Gear Vendors overdrive unit and a 3,000-stall torque converter. A Ford 9″ 31-spline rear end with a 3.50:1 gear ratio is also fitted. The current California title carries a “Title Only” notation. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
