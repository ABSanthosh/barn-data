  "description": "I generally look for interesting cars for this feature, and a 15-year-old Subaru sedan is probably a bit more bland than you're used to. On the other hand, sometimes we need a break from the weird and the sporty and the off-roaders -- sometimes you just want to see some cheap wheels. We all need basic transport.

Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com.
