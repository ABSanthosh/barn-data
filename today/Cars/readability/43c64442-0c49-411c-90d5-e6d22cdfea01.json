  "description": "The Bajaj-made Triumph Scrambler 400 X has been around for a couple of years, and while its sibling – the Speed 400 range – has seen some updates as well as the addition of the new T4 model, there hasn’t been much for the Scrambler, until now. Bajaj’s solution to spice things up for 2025 is the new Scrambler XC. In the big Scrambler 1200, the XC moniker meant more off-road capability, but that isn’t the case here. The XC is very similiar to the X in most fundamental ways. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC design and features - 8/10  Excel cross-spoke wheels look cool, replace the 400 X's alloys. Instead, the new Triumph Scrambler 400 XC gets a number of additional components, but none of it change the way it performs. The biggest upgrade, from both a visual and functional standpoint, would be the new cross-spoked wheels. Unlike the Akront wheels on the Himalayan 450, these are Excel rims, which is no bad thing considering that Excel is widely considered as one of the best in the business.  The 400 XC's tubeless cross-spoke wheels come from Excel. There is a significant change in the weight (it's up by five kilos to 190kg), which is because there are a number of other additions made to the bike. All of these are available as accessories on the Scrambler 400 X, which includes a colour-matched flyscreen, headlamp grille, a colour-matched tall front fender, a radiator guard, sump guard and lower engine crash guard. The collective effect is handsome and more purposeful looking, at least to my eyes. Weight and dimensionsKerb weight190kgGround clearance195mmSeat height 835mmFuel tank capacity13 litresWheelbase1418mm The lower engine guard is standard fitment on the 400 XC. Aside from these changes and a couple of unique colour schemes, the Scrambler 400 XC is pretty much the same when it comes to the riding experience. Theoretically, the lighter wheels should make some improvement in the agility, but it’s not a huge change; you’d have to ride both the X and XC back to back to tell if it’s really noticeable. The same goes for the extra 5kg the XC is carrying.  The 400 XC is the heaviest of all the Bajaj-made Triumph 400s. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC engine and performance - 8/10 Engine is smooth in the city but a little buzzy on the highway. As before, this bike’s liquid-cooled 40hp/37.5Nm 300cc engine feels smooth and punchy at lower revs, and a little buzzy post the triple-digit mark. Performance is strong and it’ll go past the indicated 160kph mark, but high-speed cruising isn’t what this bike is about. Short gearing means it’s smooth and tractable in the city but a little buzzy at fast highway speeds. Throttle response is smooth and predictable and the Scrambler is pleasant to ride within the city. Riding the Scrambler 400 XC is a pleasant affair in the city. EngineEngine399cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooledPower40hp at 8,000rpmTorque37.5Nm at 6,500rpmGearbox6-speed This city-friendly character is boosted by its 835mm seat height, which isn’t great for short riders but provides a very nice view of the road ahead. It also gives the slim Scrambler more of a comprehensive feeling compared to the compact Speed 400, which is otherwise the same size body-wise. The higher seat and more forward-set footpeg holders also result in a more relaxed knee position than on the Speed 400, and comfort is definitely a strong point here. The Scrambler continues to cut a handsome silhouette. Triumph is giving you all of this for Rs 26,000 more than the standard Scrambler, which is great value when you consider that buying just the wheels alone will set you back by Rs 70,000 at a Triumph service centre. As for existing Scrambler owners, yes, you can equip your bike with these if you don’t mind the huge price, but unfortunately, Bajaj says that doing so will void the warranty. The cross-spoke wheels can be equipped on the 400 X for a hefty sum of Rs 70,000. Triumph Scrambler 400 XC price and verdict - 8/10 Scrambler 400 XC is good VFM, but some areas could still be improved. While the value here is without doubt, there are some other areas that could have improved. For starters, the suspension is decently good for normal riding, but feels a little harsh when you ask too much of it either off road or at high corner speeds. However, what we really missed are better tyres and brakes. The MRF tyres used here are average at best and this bike deserves better. The same goes for the organic brake pads that result in dull brake bite and have widely been reported to have a very short life. PricePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 2.94 lakh The front brake is quite dull and the MRF tyres are average. The reason these things stand out is because for just Rs 20,000 more, the updated KTM 390 Adventure X is far better equipped and offers a superior riding experience in terms of performance and capability. Then again, the KTM can’t match the Triumph’s classy appeal and if you’ve been swayed by the Scrambler’s handsome looks and all-round competence, we’d say the XC is worth the extra money.

The same goes for the organic brake pads that result in dull brake bite and have widely been reported to have a very short life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv oncopy=\"return false\" onpaste=\"return false\" oncut=\"return false\"\u003e\u003ctable\u003e\u003cthead\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003cth colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"\u003ePrice\u003c/th\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/thead\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003ePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd data-label=\"\"\u003eRs 2.94 lakh\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Triumph Scrambler 400 XC front wheel\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/Triumph Scrambler 400 XC front wheel.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\" title=\"Triumph Scrambler 400 XC front wheel\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe front brake is quite dull and the MRF tyres are average.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan id=\"docs-internal-guid-f98aaf41-7fff-52ce-e84b-f61e964a29ff\"\u003eThe reason these things stand out is because for just Rs 20,000 more, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/ktm-390-adventure-x-with-cruise-control-launched-at-rs-303-lakh-436104\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eupdated KTM 390 Adventure X\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is far better equipped and offers a superior riding experience in terms of performance and capability.
