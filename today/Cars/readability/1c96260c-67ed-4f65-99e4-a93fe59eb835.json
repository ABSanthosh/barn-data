  "description": "Super-SUV is offered in either 'standard' SV form or more hardcore - and quicker - SV Black edition The Range Rover Sport SV has been made a permanent member of JLR's model line-up. The super-SUV arrived in 2024 and was sold in limited numbers as part of Edition One and Edition Two batches. JLR has now added two variants to the Range Rover Sport line-up: a standard SV and a more hardcore SV Black edition. Both are powered by a BMW-derived 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged petrol V8, putting out 626bhp and 553 lb ft of torque. In the standard SV, this is good for a 0-60mph time of just 3.8sec and all the way to a limited top speed of 165mph.  The Black cuts the sprint time by 0.2sec and can continue to 180mph. That extra acceleration is down to the Black's use of carbonfibre throughout, such as the bonnet. Underneath, both versions get the same 6D Dynamics suspension technology that made its debut on the limited-run model and is now featured on the Land Rover Defender Octa. It works to improve handling and performance by effectively eliminating body roll. Both SV variants wear 23in alloy wheels and, unlike previously, can now be kitted with an array of optional extras. As per its name, the Black is painted in Narvik Black and all elements, from the brake calipers to the SV badges, are finished in Narvik Gloss Black. Inside, Ebony Windsor leather is joined by more black detailing. The SV is available to buy now, priced from £139,995. The £154,975 Black will be made available to order later this year.",
