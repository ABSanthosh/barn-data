  "text": "The gasoline engine in the Hyper Hybrid system can also charge the battery five times faster than typical consumption November 21, 2024 at 19:55 by Michael Gauthier Lotus has announced plans for a Hyper Hybrid EV powertrain that integrates a gasoline engine. Unlike traditional range-extenders, it has the ability to run solely on gas when needed. The Hyper Hybrid system offers an impressive combined driving range exceeding 690 miles. Lotus has used their third quarter earnings call to confirm they’re altering their Vision 80 electrification strategy to include 900V Hyper Hybrid EV Technology. These upcoming products aim to combine the benefits of electric vehicles with the range of gas-powered models. Speaking through a translator, Lotus CEO Feng Qingfeng said the upcoming hybrids won’t simply be range-extended EVs. That certainly appears to be the case as they can be powered exclusively by a gasoline engine in certain scenarios. The executive was coy on specifics, but mentioned highway travel as using an engine is more efficient at high speeds. More: Lotus Reportedly Becomes Latest Brand To Ditch EV-Only Plans Qingfeng went on to say that, unlike traditional range-extended vehicles, their hybrids will deliver Lotus-worthy performance at all times. In order to ensure this, there’s dual hyper charging technology that enables ultra-fast charging when plugged-in as well as when the car is being driven. In the latter scenario, the gasoline engine will apparently act as a generator and charge the battery at a rate that is “5 times the power consumption of typical driving.” This promises to provide “uninterrupted electric performance in any situation, including acceleration at high speeds and in extreme cold weather.” Thanks to the combination of an electric powertrain and a gasoline engine, Lotus vehicles equipped with a Hyper Hybrid powertrain will have a combined driving range in excess of 690 miles (1,110 km). That’s a huge improvement over the Eletre, which has a WLTP range of between 254 and 373 miles (409 – 600 km) in the UK. While the gasoline engine is the big draw, it appears the company hasn’t forgotten about the EV side of the equation. Quite the opposite as the battery will be able to go from a 10-80% charge in as little as 10 minutes when plugged into an ultra-fast charger.",
