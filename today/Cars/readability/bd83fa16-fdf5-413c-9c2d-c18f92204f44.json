  "text": "This classic International Harvester Scout II may be old but it has an appeal the new models can't match October 25, 2024 at 19:55 by Brad Anderson The restored Scout II offers a classic alternative for off-road enthusiasts who don’t want to wait until 2027. The 1979 model retains its original 345 cubic-inch V8 and has undergone a comprehensive restoration. Featuring a factory color Mint Green respray, this low-mileage example is a rare and collectible SUV. The new Scout Terra and Traveler SUVs are the talk of the town this week, but there’s a catch: they won’t hit the production line until sometime in 2027. That’s nearly three years from now—assuming everything goes smoothly, which, in the world of automotive launches, is never a guarantee. So, if you’re itching to get your hands on a Scout but aren’t willing to wait until the latter half of the decade, you could do worse than snagging an original 1979 International Harvester Scout II. Built between 1961 and 1980, the original Scout was brought to life by a company with a long history of building agricultural vehicles and trucks. While it’s been over forty years since production ceased, the boxy SUV still holds a special place in the hearts of many enthusiasts. This particular example has been listed up for sale in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and has only ever been driven ~32,000 miles (~51,500 km). More: These Are The New Scout Terra Truck And Traveler SUV As you may have guessed, this Scout II didn’t roll out the factory in 1979 looking exactly like it does now. It underwent a thorough refurbishment in 2020 and, at the time, was resprayed in a bolder shade of Mint Green, which was actually a factory color. It also sports black Rallye graphics stretching along the sides and has several chrome pieces that look brand new, including the front bumper bar and the wing mirrors. The Jeep rival sits on a set of 15-inch steel wheels clad in 31×10.5-inch Nankang Conquerer A/T tires. Hidden behind these wheels are disc brakes up front and drum brakes at the rear. Found beneath the hood is the original 345 cubic-inch V8, although it was fitted with a new Holley carburetor and an aluminum radiator in 2020. Coupled with the V8 is a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Ensuring the Scout II is right at home on difficult terrain is a permanent four-wheel drive system. Read: Scout Motors Returns To Baja For The First Time Since 1982 Inside, the setup is basic but effective: brown vinyl front seats and a matching rear bench give it a rugged, retro charm. There’s an aftermarket air conditioning system as well—although, fair warning, it’s not blowing cold at the moment, so a bit of tinkering is in order if you plan on using it during the dog days of summer. So if you’re serious about owning a Scout and don’t feel like waiting until 2027 for the shiny new models, head over to Bring a Trailer and place your bid. Just don’t be surprised if this Scout II’s classic charisma steals your heart before the new models even leave the factory floor.",
