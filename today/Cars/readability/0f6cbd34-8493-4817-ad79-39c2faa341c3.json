  "text": "The third model in the Ioniq range may share components with the related Kia EV9 October 29, 2024 at 20:25 by Brad Anderson Hyundai has teased the production version of the SEVEN concept from 2021. The three-row electric SUV is set to make its world premiere at the LA Auto Show. Underpinning Hyundai’s latest EV is the familiar E-GMP platform shared with Kia’s EV9. Hyundai has been on a relentless EV offensive in recent years, pushing hard to expand its all-electric Ioniq lineup and establish itself as a major player in the zero-emissions space. The latest chapter in this saga is the Ioniq 9—the brand’s biggest and boldest EV yet—designed to tap into the growing demand for larger, three-row electric SUVs. Teased today with just enough detail to stir up interest, the production Ioniq 9 is set for its full global unveiling in November. The Ioniq 9’s arrival was first hinted at with the launch of the compelling SEVEN Concept at the LA Auto Show in November 2021 and will serve as Hyundai’s alternative to the Kia EV9. While these teasers don’t provide us with a detailed look at the new SUV, it’s clear that it will look very similar to that concept. Read: Hyundai Ioniq 9 EV Looks Ready For Production In Latest Spy Shots Found at the front of the Ioniq 9 will be a full-width LED light bar with Hyundai’s eye-catching ‘Parametric Pixels’ design as seen on the smaller Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6. As with the concept, the new model will feature additional pixel LEDs running vertically down the front fascia. The side profile is also quite familiar. It has a very similar shape to the SEVEN Concept and includes particularly thick D-pillars with squared-off wheel arches. The concept stunned with its rear suicide doors, but it seems unlikely these will be retained for the production model. No teaser has been provided of the EV’s rear end, but the side shot does show prominent pixel LEDs, which form a T-shape. Hyundai claims the diagonal lines that cut across the body are inspired by Hanbok, a traditional Korean garment, while the overall design supposedly draws influence from the sleek hulls and open, airy cabins of luxury boats. Hyundai SEVEN Concept Underpinning the new SUV will be the Hyundai Motor Group’s ever-present E-GMP platform. There’s no word on what battery packs the Ioniq 9 will be available with nor what motor configurations customers will be able to choose from. However, it’s likely Hyundai will borrow from the Kia EV9’s playbook, potentially offering the same 76.1 kWh and 99.8 kWh battery packs. If so, power output could range anywhere from a sensible 215 hp to a far more exhilarating 576 hp, catering to a broad spectrum of buyers. Expect Hyundai to drip-feed more teasers of the Ioniq 9 in the lead-up to its November unveiling, which will take place at next month’s LA Auto Show.",
