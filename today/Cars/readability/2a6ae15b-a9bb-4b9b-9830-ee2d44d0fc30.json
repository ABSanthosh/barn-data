  "description": "This 1969 Alfa Romeo 1750 Spider Veloce is said to have been purchased new by the original owner while they were deployed in Germany. It was subsequently imported to Texas, where it remained registered with the first owner until the current owner's acquisition in 1997. Powered by a 1,779cc inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transmission, the car is finished in red over black vinyl and equipped with SPICA mechanical fuel injection, a replacement black soft top, 15\" steel wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, and bucket seats. This S1 Spider is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment in Massachusetts with service records and New Hampshire registration.",

It was subsequently imported to Texas, where it remained registered with the first owner until the current owner’s acquisition in 1997. Powered by a 1,779cc inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transmission, the car is finished in red over black vinyl and equipped with SPICA mechanical fuel injection, a replacement black soft top, 15″ steel wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, and bucket seats. This S1 Spider is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment in Massachusetts with service records and New Hampshire registration. Previously finished in red, the car was repainted in the current shade circa 2004, per the selling dealer. Exterior details include a replacement black soft top, a driver-side mirror, and polished stainless-steel bumpers. A stain is noted below the left-rear corner of the trunk lid, the trim around the left taillight is chipped, and paint cracks are visible at the right-rear corner of the soft top. The 15″ steel wheels are mounted with 175/70 Grand Prix Tour RS tires, and braking is handled by power-assisted discs at each corner. The front brake calipers, pads, and rotors were replaced in 2023. The bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl, and interior appointments include a cabin heater, a locking glove compartment, and Alfa Romeo-branded rubber floor coverings. There are blemishes on the bright door panel accents. Instrumentation consists of a 140-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and supplementary gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 74k miles, approximately 18k of which were added under current ownership. The 1,779cc inline-four is equipped with SPICA mechanical fuel injection, and it was fitted with a replacement water/oil temperature sensor in 2021. The alternator and spark plugs were replaced in September 2023, and the fuel pump was repaired at that time. The oil was most recently changed in January 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. The clutch slave cylinder and hose were replaced in 2020, sections of the exhaust system were replaced in September 2023, and the clutch throwout bearing was replaced in January 2025.
