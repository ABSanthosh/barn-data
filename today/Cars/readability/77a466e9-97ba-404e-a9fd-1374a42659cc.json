Refinished in green over brown leather upholstery with Pasha velour inserts, the car is powered by a 4.7-liter V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Features include 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, pop-up headlights, power windows, a cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This 928S is offered in Idaho with the service records and a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name. The car left the factory in Linden Green Metallic and was refinished prior to being imported to the US. Exterior features include front and rear spoilers, a rear window wiper, fog lights, and pop-up headlights with washers. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. The 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs at each corner. The front bucket and folding rear seats are trimmed in brown leather with Pasha velour inserts, and interior appointments include a cassette stereo, an analog clock, power windows, and air conditioning, the latter of which was recharged under current ownership. The rear dome light does not work. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 270-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage. The six-digit odometer shows 132k kilometers (~82k miles), approximately 250 of which were added under current ownership. The temperature gauge was repaired by North Hollywood Speedometer in Los Angeles, California, under current ownership. The 4.7-liter V8 was factory rated at 296 horsepower and 263 lb-ft of torque. The oil and coolant were changed and the thermostat was replaced under current ownership. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The seller notes difficulty shifting when cold.
