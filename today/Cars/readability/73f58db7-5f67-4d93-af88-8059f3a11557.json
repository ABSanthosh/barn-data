  "description": "Trophy Edition drops historic tobacco reference but gains a host of off-road kit; priced from £89,810 Land Rover has revealed a new special-edition Defender that harks back to its classic Camel Trophy cars, gaining off-road accessories and retro paint colours. Based on the mid-sized Defender 110, it gains 20in alloy wheels, a choice of Deep Sandglow Yellow or Keswick Green paint – contrasted against a black bonnet, wheel arches and roof – and a black leather interior. The dashboard panel is also painted to match the car’s exterior colour. The optional Trophy Edition accessory pack (£4995) adds a roof rack, exterior panniers, an air-intake snorkel, a roof ladder and mud flaps. Matt-finish paint protection film can also be had as an optional extra. Although the new Defender isn't officially referred to as a Camel Trophy car (almost certainly due to the taboo that has enveloped tobacco firms since the sponsored off-road competition ended in 2000), it embraces the look and spirit of the cars that competed in the annual rally. Indeed, Land Rover said the Trophy Edition is a celebration of its “rich history of adventure challenges” and that its yellow shade is “synonymous with Defenders used on international Trophy-style events”. The Trophy Edition will make its public debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, which takes place from 10-13 July. Prices start at £89,810. This comes after Land Rover Classic built 25 examples of the original Defender inspired by the Camel Trophy, with graphics and modifications closely referencing the expeditions. Revealed in 2021, that model sold out in just three days, despite its sizeable £195,000 price tag. A second run of 25 such models came a year later.",
