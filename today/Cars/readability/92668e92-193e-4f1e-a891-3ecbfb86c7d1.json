Work between 2023-2024 included overhauling the front brakes and replacing the windshield, engine-accessory belts, fuel-injector seals, and the water and fuel pumps. This S3 Spider Quadrifoglio is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, owner’s manuals, parts and service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller's name.",

Repainted in silver over black leather upholstery, it is powered by a 2.0L twin-cam inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transmission. Features include a limited-slip differential, 15″ 12-hole alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a black convertible soft top, and a top boot as well as a rear spoiler, air conditioning, and power windows. Work between 2023-2024 included overhauling the front brakes and replacing the windshield, engine-accessory belts, fuel-injector seals, and the water and fuel pumps. This S3 Spider Quadrifoglio is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, owner’s manuals, parts and service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. The Pininfarina-designed bodywork was factory-finished in Silver Metallic (AR767) and was repainted in July 2023. Exterior details include a black convertible soft top and matching top boot in addition to a front air dam, body-color ground effects, power-operated side mirrors, and a rear spoiler. The rear license-plate light holder, headlight trim, and windshield were replaced under previous ownership. The car does not come with a hardtop. Silver-finished 15″ 12-hole alloy wheels are mounted with 185/65 Futura 2000 Radial LTE tires that have 2013 production-date codes, and a spare on a matching wheel is secured in the trunk. Braking is handled by four-wheel power-assisted discs, and the fronts were overhauled in August 2023. Rear-axle limit straps were installed the following October. The bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with red inserts and stitching, and red carpeting covers the floor and center tunnel. Additional appointments include air conditioning, power windows, vent windows, and a digital clock. A dashboard cover was fitted in 2024, and there is wear on the left door seal. The three-spoke steering wheel frames Jaeger instrumentation consisting of a 140-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, voltage, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The inoperative six-digit odometer shows 39k miles, and total mileage is unknown. The speedometer reading is erratic. The 2.0-liter DOHC inline-four features Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection for a factory rating of 115 horsepower and 110 lb-ft of torque. The fuel-injector seals, engine-accessory belts, and water and fuel pumps were replaced under previous ownership between 2023-2024. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Gorin’s Sports Car Center in Vernon, Connecticut, factory colors and equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $21,260.
