  "text": "The new Ace and Ace Bristol roadsters are set to launch next summer, featuring a Ford engine and carbon fiber bodywork 8 hours ago by Michael Gauthier AC Cars has introduced the new Ace and Ace Bristol, ahead of their launch next year. The models feature retro-inspired carbon fiber bodywork and a 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine with over 300 hp. The company is currently accepting reservations and pricing starts at the equivalent of $228,440. AC Cars is enhancing their retro-inspired lineup with the new Ace and Ace Bristol. They’re set to arrive next summer with an intoxicating blend of style and performance. The company didn’t have much to say about the cars, but noted the Ace Bristol will have an “instantly recognizable and charming aesthetic” due to its distinctive ‘smiling face.’ The standard Ace, on the other hand, draws inspiration from the 1963 model and features a streamlined front end that is similar to the one found on the first-generation AC Cobra. More: AC Cobra GT Coupe Is The First Ever Production Snake With A Fixed Roof While the cars are inspired by the past, they’re decidedly modern as they wear carbon fiber bodywork on top of a tubular steel frame. The design has also been updated as there are “graceful rolling flanks and wheel arches, in contrast to the flat-sided original design.” Other highlights include 15-inch wire wheels and a specially tuned exhaust system. AC Cars didn’t release interior pictures, but the Ace Bristol appears to have low-back seats and a wood rim steering wheel. The Ace is similar, but sports different seats and a high-mounted rearview mirror. Power comes from a Ford-sourced 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine producing over 300 hp (224 kW / 304 PS) and around 277 lb-ft (375 Nm) of torque. It’s connected to a six-speed manual, which should enable the roughly 2,425 lb (1,100 kg) roadsters to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) in around 4.6 seconds. The company is currently accepting reservations and pricing starts at £175,000 ($228,440) including VAT.",
