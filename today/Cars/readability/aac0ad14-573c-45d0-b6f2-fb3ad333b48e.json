  "description": "This Maserati GTi Sebring was manufactured in April 1967 as one of 247 Series II examples produced, 134 of which were powered by a 3,694cc DOHC inline-six. Chassis 571 was initially delivered in Milan, Italy, and remained in the country under the care of several owners through the mid-2010s, when it was relocated to Belgium. The current owner purchased the car as a project in 2016, and subsequent refurbishment work included stripping the body, placing it on a rotisserie, performing metal repairs, and refinishing it in silver. The replacement engine and the five-speed gearbox were also overhauled, as were the brake and suspension systems. A refresh of the interior in black leather was carried out, and upon conclusion of the project, the car was the recipient of an award at the 2018 Concours d'Elegance Paleis Het Loo held in the Netherlands and appeared at the Antwerp Concours d’Elegance later that year. It achieved Maserati Classiche certification before being displayed as part of the 110 Years of Maserati exhibition at Autoworld in Brussels, Belgium, between late 2024 and early 2025. This Series II Sebring is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in Brussels, Belgium, with a tool kit, refurbishment photos, copies of factory records, Maserati Classiche certification documents, and Belgian registration.",

It achieved Maserati Classiche certification before being displayed as part of the 110 Years of Maserati exhibition at Autoworld in Brussels, Belgium, between late 2024 and early 2025. This Series II Sebring is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in Brussels, Belgium, with a tool kit, refurbishment photos, copies of factory records, Maserati Classiche certification documents, and Belgian registration. The 3500 GTiS, which was given the Sebring name as an homage to Maserati’s 1957 triumph in the 12-hour race, was first introduced as a prototype in 1962 before appearing in production form at the 1963 Turin Motor Show. Designed to compete in the American market, the Vignale-bodied coupe featured Giovanni Michelotti-styled 2+2 coachwork over the chassis and running gear from the 3500 GT. The Series II (Tipo AM 101/10) version was introduced in 1965 with a redesigned front end featuring twin chrome surrounds for the quadruple headlamps as well as a revised hood scoop, cowl intakes, raised fender vents, and horizontal taillights. Delivered from the factory in Argento Auteuil, the car was mounted to a rotisserie and stripped prior to receiving rust repairs with replacement sheet metal and a repaint as part of the aforementioned refurbishment. Exterior details include dual door-mounted side mirrors, fog lamps, Vignale badging, and dual exhaust outlets. Borrani 16″ wire-spoke wheels are secured via knock-off spinners and mounted with 6.00″ Michelin tires, while a matching spare wheel is stored in the trunk compartment. Suspension comprises a coil-sprung double-wishbone independent front setup and a leaf-sprung solid rear axle with telescopic shock absorbers all around. Braking is via four-wheel discs. The cabin was reupholstered during the refurbishment with black leather over 2+2 seating. Color-coordinated trim adorns the center console and dash, while the ceiling wears a beige headliner. Additional amenities include lap belts for the front occupants, power windows, a console-mounted ashtray, and an analog clock. The air conditioning system and push-button radio are inoperative. The wood-rimmed Malvino steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges monitoring water temperature, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. A Lucas ammeter is also among the cluster. The five-digit odometer shows 67k kilometers (~42k miles), approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The Series II carried over the 3.5-liter AM101 inline-six from the Series I cars, which was offered alongside 3.7-liter and 4.0-liter variants. This 3.7-liter example is said to have received a replacement engine from the factory following failure of the original unit shortly after delivery. It was rebuilt during the refurbishment and features Lucas mechanical fuel injection. Output was rated at 245 horsepower when new. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF five-speed manual transmission that was overhauled as part of the project. The Maserati Certificate of Origin is presented above, and copies of factory documentation can be seen in the gallery along with service records. Photos documenting various stages of the refurbishment process are also shown in the gallery. The car is being sold on its Belgian registration, which serves as an ownership document in Belgium.
