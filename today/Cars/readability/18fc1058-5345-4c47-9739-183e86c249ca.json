  "description": "This ex-works 1993 Alfa Romeo SZ is #1,004 of 1,036 examples produced over a three-year model run, and just one of approximately 20 Trofeo cars built for the single-make Zagato Trophy series. The car was assembled for use in a support race held during the 1993 Formula One Monaco Grand Prix weekend and later driven as part of various Italian Supercar GT series races. Following its use as a factory-owned race car, the car was acquired by former Formula One driver Andrea de Adamich, who retained stewardship until 2007. It was purchased by the current owner from a Dutch collector in 2014. Finished in a red and white livery, the car is powered by a 3.0-liter Busso V6 mated to a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. It rides on 16\" OZ wheels and is further equipped with adjustable coilover suspension, a rear spoiler, a CSC muffler, and an auxiliary oil cooler. Inside, a pair of AP Sport fixed-back bucket seats is accompanied by multi-point harnesses, a roll cage, and a two-spoke MOMO steering wheel. Now showing 23k kilometers (~14k miles), this SZ Trofeo is offered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a specification sheet from Centro Documentazione Alfa Romeo, service records, and German registration in the owner's name.",

Finished in a red and white livery, the car is powered by a 3.0-liter Busso V6 mated to a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. It rides on 16″ OZ wheels and is further equipped with adjustable coilover suspension, a rear spoiler, a CSC muffler, and an auxiliary oil cooler. Inside, a pair of AP Sport fixed-back bucket seats is accompanied by multi-point harnesses, a roll cage, and a two-spoke MOMO steering wheel. Now showing 23k kilometers (~14k miles), this SZ Trofeo is offered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a specification sheet from Centro Documentazione Alfa Romeo, service records, and German registration in the owner’s name. Debuting at the 1989 Geneva Motor Show, the SZ was a result of Alfa Romeo’s Experimental Sportcar 3.0 litre (ES30) project and recalled the Sprint and Sport Zagato competition cars of the 1950s. While designed in-house with computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems, the car was assembled by Zagato using injection-molded composite bodywork over a chassis based on the Alfa Romeo 75 IMSA. Given the moniker Il Mostro, or The Monster, all SZ examples were finished in Rosso Alfa with a contrasting gray roof and featured a pronounced wedge shape with low ground clearance, a high beltline, and a tail end abruptly cut behind the rear wheels. This example features white Alfa Romeo graphics and stripes along with various various manufacturer decals. Further details include six square headlights, side marker lights, hood pins, Zagato fender badges, tow hooks, a power-adjustable left mirror, and a rear spoiler. Chips in the paint are shown in the gallery below. The OZ Racing 16” multi-piece alloy wheels feature white-finished centers and are mounted with 205/55 Toyo Proxes R1R tires. The suspension was carried over from the 75 1.8 Turbo Evolution competition car and featured driver-adjustable dampers. Ducts have been added up front to cool the ventilated front disc brakes, which are paired with inboard-mounted rear units. A temporary spare wheel and tire are stored behind the drop-down tail panel out back. The track-prepped cockpit houses a pair of fixed-back AP Sport bucket seats trimmed in red fabric and equipped with multi-point harnesses. A partially-padded roll cage has been added, and the center console has been fitted with an electrical cutoff switch as well as various additional vehicle controls. A fire extinguisher is mounted in the passenger-side footwell, and further appointments include aluminum brake and accelerator pedals, red window nets, and power windows. The two-spoke MOMO steering wheel is wrapped in Alcantara and wears a yellow centering stripe. The wheel fronts white-letter Veglia instrumentation consisting of a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline accompanied by a 280-km/h speedometer, a quartz clock, and centrally mounted auxiliary gauges. The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 23k kilometers (~14k miles), a handful of which were added under current ownership. An identification plate aft of the white shift knob denotes this car as number 1004. The 3.0-liter Busso V6 features an aluminum block, a single overhead camshaft for each cylinder bank, and Bosch fuel injection. An auxiliary oil cooler is installed underneath the car. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. The car is equipped with an Imasaf exhaust system and a CSC muffler. The underside was recently cleaned with dry ice. A specification sheet from Centro Documentazione Alfa Romeo noted production and delivery dates along with the engine number. Additional included documents, records, and historical photos of the car are presented in the gallery. The vehicle is being sold on its German registration, which serves as an ownership document in Germany. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
