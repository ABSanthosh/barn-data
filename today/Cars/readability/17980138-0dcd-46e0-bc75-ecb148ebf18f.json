Finished in Jet Black Metallic over black leather and cloth upholstery, the car has 3,700 kilometers (~2,300 miles) and is further equipped with a mechanical limited-slip differential, the Chrono package, a carbon-fiber roof, a front-axle lift system, ceramic-composite brakes, LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, a speed-activated rear spoiler, carbon-fiber exterior and interior accents, rear-axle steering, 20″ and 21″ center-locking wheels, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, Porsche Communication Management, and a Bose sound system. This 992 GT3 Touring was purchased new by the seller and is now offered with the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, a battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and Alberta registration. The car is finished in Jet Black Metallic and was optioned with the Touring Package in Black, which added black window trim and rear Porsche lettering as well as a revised decklid with a mesh grille and a retractable rear spoiler in place of the raised wing found on the standard GT3. Additional features include LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS, a rear fog light, a carbon-fiber roof, dual center-exit exhaust outlets, puddle light projectors, and carbon-fiber mirror caps and window triangles. Paint protection film has been applied to the body, which has also received a ceramic coating, per the seller. Satin Black-finished 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and rear-axle steering. A ceramic coating has been applied to the wheels. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with cloth inserts, Porsche crests on the headrests, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, steering column, center console, knee pads, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include Porsche Communication Management infotainment with navigation, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, ambient lighting, rear parking sensors, automatically dimming mirrors, aluminum pedals, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a vehicle configuration dial and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual adjustable TFT screens. A dash-mounted chronograph is included as part of the Chrono package. The digital odometer indicates 3,700 kilometers (~2,300 miles), all of which were added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was rated at 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. An oil change was performed and the oil filler neck was replaced in May 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a mechanical limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. You are not connected to real-time updates.
