The timing belt and water pump were replaced in March 2024. This C70 has 54k miles and is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve in Georgia with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean South Carolina title. The car is finished in Passion Red (612) and features a power-retractable hardtop. Additional exterior details include fog lights, rear parking sensors, heated power-adjustable side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. The selling dealer notes rock chips and scratches. The Sadira alloy wheels are mounted with Continental tires. The car is equipped with Dynamic Stability and Traction Control (DSTC), and braking is provided by anti-lock discs at each corner with Emergency Brake Assistance (EBA) and Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD). The Premium Package provided Offblack leather seating surfaces, and interior appointments include power-adjustable front seats, a CD stereo, a Dynaudio audio system, a rollover-protection system, cruise control, and automatic climate control. Imperfections in the headliner include peeling in the rear cabin, cuts, and spots near the sun visors. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 54k miles. The turbocharged 2.5-liter DOHC inline-five was factory rated at 218 horsepower and 236 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in December 2024, and the timing belt and water pump were replaced in March 0f that year. Power is routed to the front wheels through a five-speed Geartronic automatic transaxle. Additional photographs of the underside are shown in the gallery below. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Volvo of Dallas in Carrollton, Texas, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $46,285.
