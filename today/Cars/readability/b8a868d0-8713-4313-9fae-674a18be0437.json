  "description": "Picking up the M4 Competition from BMW’s press centre storage facility on the outskirts of Munich initially feels a bit like going through passport control – licence and ID check before we are finally handed the keys. Once inside, walking through the massive parking tower feels surreal; every single BMW you can imagine is here. And probably every Mini and every Rolls, too. Even better, as we walk through, there are M cars in all shapes and sizes. What a place! Finally, we get to our car. Yeah, that nose. The flared nostrils are clearly OTT and shouty, but it doesn’t look quite as odd as it did when it was first revealed. And I like those vents on the bonnet. But can this M4 Competition deliver as characterful a driving experience? Chop-chop, we’re headed to the Austrian border and then into the Alps. Good driving roads beckon. 2024 BMW M4 Competition ride and practicality I open the surprisingly light doors, squeeze in past the big seats, and settle down. BMW has brought the curved display to the M4, and this Competition version gets plenty of other driver-oriented stuff; more on that later. My first priority is getting out of this building, and while most of the drive down resembles a normal parking lot, the last bit is unique. We drive down a steel chute and then straight out into the sunshine. Voilà! Big grille is still a big talking point of the M4. The first few kilometres of city trudge are pretty uneventful. The engine doesn’t feel overeager or spiky, the 8-speed ZF torque converter gearbox is creamy-smooth, and only when I manually intervene do I get a rude burst of power. So the M4 Competition can do the office, school and outstation runs. It has a proper boot, usable back seats and isn’t too difficult to get in and out of either. In fact, driving it in the city feels so undramatic and one-dimensional that it feels bland. No sensations come through to my palms at low speed, no nice elasticity of repose from the accelerator, and certainly no beautifully balanced and confident agility in low-speed corners. It just feels rooted and relaxed. The ride over Munich roads also feels firm; it can be brittle over bad patches, and there is a fair amount of road noise over open-pore surfaces. However, with the adaptive dampers set to Comfort, there’s enough pliancy to make the M4 Competition a very competent long-distance cruiser. Seats are large and very supportive in corners; inner thigh support is not as much of an issue as it is made out to be.   2024 BMW M4 Competition powertrain So, at normal driving speeds, the M4 Competition feels very laid back. I guess I’ll have to stir the pot a bit to get to the good stuff. This should be pretty easy once we turn off to the Autobahn, where on this route, there are plenty of derestricted stretches. But first, it’s time to do a bit of a spec check. Under the hood, the twin-turbo S58 straight-six has been wound up to 530hp – check. Then there’s 650Nm from 2,750rpm to a high 5,730rpm; plenty of torque – check. Forged crank, iron coating sprayed on the internals and two mono-scroll turbos for more boost – check. Near 50:50 front-rear weight distribution – check. And although this is a four-wheel-drive car, there is a rear-wheel-drive mode for those wet, empty parking lots and drift pads. You also get a 10-stage adjustable traction control and an ‘M drift analyser’ that awards points and stars for good drifts. I have to say I like BMW’s on-screen games better than Tesla’s. The M4 Competition, however, is heavy at 1,850kg – the four-wheel-drive hardware contributing to a lot. And yes, you get staggered wheels for greater stability, 19s and 20s at the front and rear, respectively. Stonking twin-turbo engine makes a strong 530hp. Getting to the 120kph speed limit on the restricted parts of the Autobahn brings the M4 Competition somewhat out of its shell. Past 3,000rpm, it begins shedding its Clark Kent suit and flexing its muscles. Often, 120kph comes up so quickly that I get taken by surprise. And hey, BMW, can we at least have fake analogue dials? When it comes to character, BMW’s twin-turbo straight six responds more like a naturally aspirated unit than a turbocharged one. Progression up the rev band is as linear as some atmo sixes, responses are quick, and then, because it has all the extra torque, it just hauls, even from low in the powerband. A delicious combo. 2024 BMW M4 Competition performance When we finally see the grey and white cricket ball-like de-restriction sign, my right foot goes down automatically. The M4 Competition lunges at the horizon – no delay in power delivery, no slack, no lag. And that’s even though the gearbox is in a high gear in manual mode. Even more impressive, the engine keeps pulling harder and harder as the revs climb, and at around 6,000rpm, I realise we are really shifting – the scenery flying past in a blur. Wow, this thing has some real muscle, some real grunt! And like any good BMW unit, it’s thrilled to rev and spin hard. It isn’t explosive or peaky in the mid-range, and sometimes you miss that, but it is smooth, crisp and seriously potent. 200kph is almost a casual stroll up the ’box. And when I really plant my foot, the linear lunge delivers a sledgehammer blow. The claimed 0-100kph is super quick at just 3.5 seconds, which, incidentally, is faster than a Porsche 911 Carrera. Quad exhaust and low-slung roof make it look purposeful. Niggles? It doesn’t sound great, but I like that this is the honest voice of the engine with no synth added. And when you are in a hurry, you do expect a bit more urgency from the gearbox.  2024 BMW M4 Competition handling The real test of an M car, however, comes in the twisties, and here, initially, there’s a bit of disappointment. The steering, tasked with ironing out the push-pull of the four-wheel-drive system, is light and inert, and going to a sportier setting only adds weight. Lean on the M4 Competition, however, and it seems to wake up from its slumber and come alive, the relative four-wheel-drive stodginess and not-inconsiderable weight seemingly melting away. Now, the stiff chassis and aluminium suspension seem to finally limber up, stretch and attack corners with an incredible amount of verve, grip and gymnast-like balance. The harder I turn into corners, the more agile the M4 Competition feels, with the precision from the steering sharpening up superbly. It may not be the most feelsome unit, but it is super sharp, even when all four wheels are loaded up and complaining loudly. Even small movements on the wheel change your line, and that’s exactly what you want. The steering is light and not very M car-like at all. But our drive is too brief, and to really enjoy this car to the fullest, I need more time, better roads, faster corners and more opportunities. That, or a track. Sure, it is heavy; 200kg less would have made it incredible. But the weight is placed down low, and that helps. Also, I must say, the driving position is excellent, especially if you like to sit low. 2024 BMW M4 Competition price and verdict Rs 1.53 crore will buy you an M4 Competition in India. Look at this as just a much more powerful 3 Series Coupé with some go-faster hardware, and it will seem even more expensive, especially if you consider the excellent M340i xDrive at Rs 74.9 lakh. But that’s not quite right. The M4 Competition is a whole category or two up. A serious performance car that delivers a combination of supercar pace and sedan-like practicality, the M4 is the one to go for if you want many disparate cars in one. Let’s not forget it gets a back seat and boot, comes with a stonking 530hp engine, more performance than some supercars, and on the right road, delivers a driving experience that’s agile, accurate and as adjustable as some of the best sports cars around. And that makes it stand out. Also see: BMW car prices to increase from January 2025 2024 BMW M2 launched at Rs 1.03 crore, gets more power Next-gen BMW M3 to get both ICE and EV powertrains",

That, or a track. Sure, it is heavy; 200kg less would have made it incredible. But the weight is placed down low, and that helps. Also, I must say, the driving position is excellent, especially if you like to sit low.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2024 BMW M4 Competition price and verdict\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/bmw-m4-competition-facelift-launched-at-rs-153-crore-431453\" title=\"BMW M4 Competition facelift launched at Rs 1.53 crore\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRs 1.53 crore will buy you an M4 Competition\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e in India.
