This Caterham Seven is now offered with order sheets, a manufacturer’s statement of origin, factory literature, a tonneau cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Georgia title in the seller’s name. The car features a composite nose cone and aluminum body panels finished in Caribbean Blue Metallic with a Polar White noseband. Equipment includes a polished exhaust system, a louvered hood, a full windscreen, an electrical cutoff switch, a roll bar, a black vinyl boot cover, and a silver-finished fuel filler cap. A black tonneau cover is included in the sale. The 15″ Orcus alloy wheels wear Caterham center caps and are mounted with Avon ZZS tires. The car was optioned from the factory with lowered floors on Caterham’s large-sized chassis, and the 360S features Caterham’s Sport suspension package with a rear anti-roll bar. Stopping power is provided by two-piston calipers over solid discs at all four corners. The right-hand drive cockpit features twin bucket seats trimmed in black leather with embossed seatbacks and four-point racing harnesses. Black carpeting is fitted on the sides of the center console, and color-matched Caterham Seven-branded mats line the floors. The Alcantara-wrapped MOMO steering wheel is mounted on a quick-release hub ahead of a 160-mph speedometer, a 9k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer shows 1,500 miles. The fuel-injected Ford Duratec 2.0-liter inline-four features a Caterham-branded valve cover. An oil change was performed in December 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
