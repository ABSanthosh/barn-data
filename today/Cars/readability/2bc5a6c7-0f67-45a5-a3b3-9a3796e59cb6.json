  "description": "Mahindra recently announced that it has delivered over 6,300 units of the BE 6 and XEV 9e electric SUVs since deliveries began in March this year. The company also revealed that more than 75 percent of all bookings so far have been for the top-spec Pack Three variant, which exclusively gets the larger 79kWh battery pack. However, going forward, Mahindra is planning to introduce the larger battery pack on lower trims for a more rationalised variant line-up. 6,300 units of Mahindra BE 6, XEV 9e delivered so far Over 75 percent of bookings have been for the top-spec Pack Three variant Mahindra targeting greater volumes from lower trims Inquires not converting into bookings for lower trims Production and deliveries prioritised for Pack Three variants Mahindra has a staggered delivery schedule for the BE 6 and XEV 9e. Deliveries began with the top-spec Pack Three variant in March. Pack Three Select variants will start arriving in June, followed by Pack Two in July. The base ‘Pack 1 Above’ and Pack 1 variants will only start arriving in August. Speaking to our sister publication, Autocar Professional, the company’s executive director and CEO (Auto and Farm Sector), Rajesh Jejurikar, revealed that despite healthy inquiries for the lower-spec variants, consumers are hesitant to commit without seeing the vehicle in person. “They do not get converted into bookings right now because people want to see the vehicles before they book.” Jejurikar said that the current bookings mix is still very skewed to the top end – more than 75 percent of bookings are for Pack Three. “We believe that the mix will start changing when we put out the display and test drive vehicles of Pack Two and Pack One,” he added.  Greater preference for range from larger battery 79kWh battery needed on lower trims for sustained volumes What’s interesting is that Jejurikar revealed consumers are showing a preference for extended driving range over features. Therefore, Mahindra is now rethinking its variant line-up to offer the 79kWh battery on lower trims. “There is a very large segment of people who will want 79kWh in lower packs. This has been very different from our assumption that 79kWh will be only in the top end and everything else will be 59kWh. There is a segment of people for whom range is really important over many of the other features that we are offering,” said Jejurikar. To address this, Mahindra may introduce new versions of the BE 6 and the XEV 9e that offer the 79kWh battery but fewer features to make them more affordable. The company believes this could unlock a broader customer base and drive higher volumes. “To start growing volumes, we will need to have a reasonable mix in Pack One and Pack Two. We will saturate at a price point where it will be difficult to sustain high volumes. We will have to start getting at least 25-30 percent of our volumes from Pack 2 and Pack 1,” he said.
