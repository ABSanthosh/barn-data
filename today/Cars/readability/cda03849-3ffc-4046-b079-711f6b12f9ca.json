  "text": "Kia is taking the whole blackout trend a little too seriously 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Kia is recalling nearly 75,000 Sorentos because their headlights and taillights may go out. The issue has been traced to a software problem, but no U.S. cases have been reported. Dealers will update the vehicle’s software and owner notifications will go out next month. Blackout packages are all the rage, but Kia appears to have taken things a little too literally. That’s sparking a recall as 74,469 Sorentos could lose their head- and taillights. That’s a serious safety issue, which can increase the risk of a crash. The government also noted the models fail to comply with federal safety standard requirements involving lighting. Driven: Kia’s Common-Sense Sorento Gets Some EV9 Pizzazz The safety recall report says the vehicles are equipped with a Body Domain Control Unit that has a “software logic error.” This can, under certain circumstances, result in the momentary loss of headlights and taillights. Kia North America was tipped off about the issue from their colleagues in South Korea, where the company decided to conduct a recall for the same problem. In their home market, Sorento crossovers could lose certain exterior and interior lights while being driven. Kia North America examined their records and didn’t find any reported cases here. Despite this, the company decided to conduct a recall. It impacts the 2024 and 2025 Sorento as well as the 2025 Sorento Hybrid and 2025 Sorento Plug-In Hybrid. Owner notifications are slated to be sent out next month and dealers will update the Body Domain Control Unit software free of charge.",
