It is additionally equipped with a cassette-style six-speed transmission, adjustable Öhlins suspension, an Öhlins steering damper, a single-sided aluminum swingarm, BST 17″ carbon-fiber wheels, and triple disc brakes with dual Brembo Stylema monobloc front calipers. This F4 Claudio Edition is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment in Missouri with a bike cover, a rear-wheel stand, a race kit with storage box, and a clean Oklahoma title. The fully faired bodywork is finished in two-tone silver and black with black carbon-fiber, gold electroplated copper ribbons, and black stripes. Features include a tinted windscreen and a black Alcantara seat with a contrasting top-stitched design, an embroidered Claudio logo, and a rear bumper pad. BST 17″ exposed carbon-fiber wheels feature a gloss finish and are mounted with 120/70 front and 200/55 rear Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa SP tires showing 2019 production codes. Adjustable Öhlins suspension consists of a NIX 30 inverted fork with TiN-coated stanchions as well as a TTX piggyback monoshock mounted to the single-sided aluminum swingarm via a linkage. Bosch 9 ABS braking with race mode and rear-wheel lift-up mitigation is provided by a Brembo T-drive system with a pair of radially mounted four-piston Stylema monobloc calipers over dual 320mm rotors up front and a Nissin four-piston caliper over a single 210mm rotor at the rear. Clip-on handlebars equipped with bar-end weights, racing-type push-button controls, and Brembo radial clutch pump and master cylinder brake lever assemblies are secured below an upper triple clamp that anchors an adjustable Öhlins steering damper. An AiM MXS dash logger and GPS module with a 5″ color TFT screen and custom software displays various operational readouts including a digital tachometer and speedometer, ABS and traction control settings, and both coolant and ambient temperatures. The digital odometer shows five miles, four of which were ridden by the selling dealer. A gold-tone plate affixed to the upper triple clamp identifies the bike as #003 of 100 F4 Claudio Edition examples produced. The 998cc Corsa Corta inline-four features dual overhead camshafts with DLC-treated followers as well as hand-worked Reparto Corse intake and exhaust ports, titanium connecting rods, low-friction Asso Werke piston rings, a specifically lightened and balance crankshaft, a balanced central timing chain, and four radially set valves per cylinder. The engine is additionally equipped with an Eldor EM2.0 ECU, a Mikuni ride-by-wire throttle body, and two banks of four injectors each, with high-flow Magneti Marellis on top and Mitsubishis below. Factory-rated output was 205 horsepower at 13,450 rpm in non-race trim. Output rises to 212 horsepower with the dual-exit titanium SC-Project racing exhaust and dedicated control unit installed. The rev limiter is set to 14,200 rpm. Power is transferred to the rear wheel through a hydraulically actuated STM slipper clutch and a cassette-style six-speed gearbox with DLC-coated shift forks and an electronic up-and-down quick shifter as well as a D.I.D Gold chain. The bike is accompanied by an edition-specific bike cover, a rear-axle stand, a battery charger, two keys, and a wooden race kit storage box, additional contents of which can be viewed in the gallery.
