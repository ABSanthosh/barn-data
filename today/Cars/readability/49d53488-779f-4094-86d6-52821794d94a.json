  "description": "This 2024 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was optioned from the factory with the Weissach Package, which reduced weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. It is finished in black over black leather and Race-Tex upholstery and is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential. Now with 45 miles, the car is further equipped with LED-Matrix headlights, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, center-locking wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, a front-axle lift system, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, a Bose sound system, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, and cruise control. Acquired new by the seller, this 992 GT3 RS is now offered with a window sticker, two fob keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title in the seller's name.",

It is finished in black over black leather and Race-Tex upholstery and is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking differential. Now with 45 miles, the car is further equipped with LED-Matrix headlights, a rear wing, rear-axle steering, center-locking wheels, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, a front-axle lift system, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, a Bose sound system, Porsche Communication Management, automatic climate control, and cruise control. Acquired new by the seller, this 992 GT3 RS is now offered with a window sticker, two fob keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title in the seller’s name. The GT3 RS features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid, roof panel, and rear swan-neck-hinged wing with drag-reduction (DRS) functionality. The CFRP panels are finished in exposed carbon-fiber weave on Weissach Package-equipped cars. This example is finished in black and has LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+ along with a rear fog light, puddle light projectors, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. The lightweight magnesium 20″ front and 21″ rear GT3 center-lock wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with rear-axle steering, a front-axle lift system, and the Weissach Package, which added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Race-Tex inserts and Weissach RS embroidery on the headrests. Carbon fiber trim accents the cabin, and amenities include carbon fiber floor mats, aluminum pedals, Porsche Communication Management, a Bose sound system, ambient lighting, a fire extinguisher, carbon fiber illuminated door sill guards, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The GT3 sports steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and a drive-mode selector dial, and it frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and dual configurable TFT screens. The digital odometer indicates 45 miles. The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was factory rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque, which is delivered to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV) Plus. The car is fitted with the optional extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Porsche Beaverton in Oregon, and lists factory colors, options, and a total price of $307,090.
