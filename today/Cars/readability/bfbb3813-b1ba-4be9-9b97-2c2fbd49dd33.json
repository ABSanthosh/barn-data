Suzuki Avenis’ Standard Variant now complies with OBD-2B Priced at Rs 91,400, it's the most affordable Avenis Suzuki Avenis Standard Variant updated The Standard variant is Rs 1,800 more affordable than the next variant Suzuki has updated the Avenis Standard variant’s engine to comply with the stringent OBD-2B norms. Barring this update, its mechanical components remain unchanged. The Avenis continues to be powered by the same 124cc engine that produces 8.7hp and 10Nm. Suzuki had already updated the Avenis and its Special Edition earlier, but this compliance-related update had not been extended to the Standard variant—until now. Priced at Rs 91,400, the Standard variant is the most affordable in the Avenis lineup, costing Rs 1,800 less than the next variant. It features an LED headlight and taillight, coupled with a digital instrument cluster, but misses out on Bluetooth compatibility. The variant is available in four colour options: black with white, black with red, yellow with black, and glossy black. Also see:  Suzuki Avenis review: more than skin deep?",
