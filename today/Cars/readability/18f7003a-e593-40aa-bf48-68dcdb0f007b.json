  "text": "The Maextro S800 costs less than the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class and feels inspired by it April 25, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Huawei has given us a peek inside the ultra-luxurious Maextro S800 sedan. The upscale interior looks nice, but cribs from BMW, Mercedes and Rolls-Royce. The luxury sedan will be offered with electric and range-extended powertrains. Huawei unveiled the Maextro S800 last year, and now the company is giving us a peek inside its ultra-luxurious cabin. Unsurprisingly, the is heavily inspired by Mercedes-Maybach and Rolls-Royce models. Drivers sit behind an elegant two-tone steering wheel and find themselves looking at a ‘floating’ display that closely echoes the MBUX Hyperscreen. There’s no word on dimensions, but the EQS has a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 17.7-inch infotainment system, and a 12.3-inch front passenger display. More: Huawei’s Maextro S800 Looks Like Someone Put A Maybach, A Rolls And A Porsche In The Blender The Mercedes-like styling cues continue elsewhere as there are stylish metal speaker grilles that mimic Burmester units. They’re joined by familiar door-mounted seat controls. Elsewhere, there are digital side mirror displays, a dual wireless smartphone charger, and a splash of wood trim on the center console. Designers also gave the car a stylish rotary knob as well as metallic accents. Buyers will also find a luxurious mix of leather and suede-like upholstery. While the cockpit is nice, the rear passenger compartment is the star of the show. It features two individual rear seats with power adjustment as well as a foot rest. The front passenger seat also slides out of the way, so you can sit back and enjoy the ride. The seats are separated by an elegant leather and wood console, which features deployable tray tables. It also sports an elegant champagne flute holder and a retractable drawer. We can also expect a refrigerated compartment as well as a rear seat entertainment system. Above, there’s a starry headliner inspired by the Rolls-Royce playbook. They’re joined by door-mounted screens that echo those found on the BMW 7-Series. The luxury barge will be launched later this year and measure 215.7 inches (5,480  mm) long with a wheelbase spanning 132.7 inches (3,370  mm). This makes the model 0.4 inches (10 mm) longer than the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, although it has a 1 inch (25 mm) shorter wheelbase. CarNewsChina reports the model is expected to be offered with an electric powertrain that features a 94.4 kWh battery pack. This should provide CLTC ranges of 416 miles (670 km) and 436 miles (702 km). An extended-range variant is also said to be in the works with a smaller 63.3 kWh battery. It will reportedly offer electric-only ranges between 160 miles (258 km) and 193 miles (311 km). Pricing reportedly starts at ¥1 million, which is the equivalent of $137,230. That’s not too shabby considering the Mercedes-Maybach S480 starts at ¥1.48 million ($203,100) in China.",
