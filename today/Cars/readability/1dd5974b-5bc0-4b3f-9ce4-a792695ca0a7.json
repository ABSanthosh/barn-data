It is finished in black over black leather upholstery and it is powered by a 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car was optioned with 18″ GT3 wheels, a fixed rear wing, xenon headlights, ceramic-composite brakes, power-adjustable seats, a CD stereo, and automatic climate control. This 996.2 GT3 was purchased by the seller in 2023 and is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, two keys, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in black and its fixed rear wing has been fitted with shims. Additional exterior details include revised aerodynamic lower bodywork, power-adjustable mirrors, xenon headlights, clear side markers, and dual exhaust outlets. A February 2024 invoice states the spoiler securing clips are damaged. The 18″ GT3 wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is from yellow Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled ceramic-composite rotors at each corner. The GT3 features a lower sport-tuned suspension compared to the standard Carrera model. The power-adjustable seats are upholstered in black leather, while carpeted floor mats line the footwells. A black-finished roll cage has been fitted, and additional appointments include a CD stereo, power windows and locks, and automatic climate control. The three-spoke steering wheel frames a central tachometer with an 8,200-rpm redline as well as a 200-mph speedometer and gauges for voltage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 33k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The 3.6-liter M96/79 Mezger flat-six was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 285 lb-ft of torque. The drive belt and water pump were replaced in June 2023, an oil change was performed in February 2024, and a replacement battery was fitted in May 2024. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. A Fabspeed exhaust system has been installed. Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information: L041 – Black paint C02 – Version for USA 288 – Headlamp washers 450 – Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) 571 – Activated charcoal filter 573 – Automatic air conditioning 601 – Litronic (xenon) headlights The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
