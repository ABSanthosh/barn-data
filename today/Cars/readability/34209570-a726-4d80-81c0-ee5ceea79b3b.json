It is powered by a 2.8-liter M130 inline-six paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, and is finished in Medium Blue over blue MB-Tex upholstery. The car is equipped with a body-color removable hardtop, a blue convertible top, 14″ steel wheels, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, and air conditioning. The fuel pump was rebuilt and the tires were replaced in 2025. This Pagoda is now offered in Santa Rosa, California, with maintenance records and a clean California title. The car is finished in Medium Blue (350), and additional features include US-specification headlights, a driver-side mirror, and bumper guards. The seller notes that the car may have been refinished under previous ownership prior to 1997, but has not been able to confirm. They state that damage incurred to the driver-side front fender from a “fender-bender” incident in 2003 was subsequently repaired. The 14″ steel wheels wear painted covers and were mounted with 185-series Michelin whitewall tires in May 2025. The car is equipped with power steering and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin features bucket seats upholstered in Blue MB-Tex with matching door panels. Appointments include a Becker Europa AM/FM radio and a heated rear hardtop window. The clock does not work. The seller notes the following: the heater controls require replacement, the air conditioning does not blow cold, and one of the turn signals needs to be held in order to stay engaged. The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and frames VDO instrumentation including a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 77k miles, less than 5k of which are said to have been added under current ownership. The seller tells us that the odometer was recently repaired after having been inoperative since 1994, and estimates that total mileage is less than 90k. True mileage is unknown. The 2.8-liter M130 inline-six features Bosch mechanical fuel injection and was factory-rated at 180 horsepower and 193 lb-ft of torque. Service in March 2025 included rebuilding the fuel pump and replacing the filters and fluids. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The California title lists the VIN as 280SL019842. The car’s chassis number, 11304412019842, is shown in the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
