This STO coupe is now offered in California by the selling dealer at no reserve with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title. The STO wore trim-specific bodywork as well as a front “Cofango,” which incorporates the vented front fenders and hood into a single unit. The car is also equipped with a roof-mounted air intake and a three-position manually adjustable rear wing, and is finished in Arancio Argos (0117) with a gloss black contrast pack. Further exterior details include LED lighting, power-folding side mirrors, a rearview camera, a vented engine cover, and twin exhaust outlets. The center-locking 20″ HEK wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza tires. The CCM‑R carbon-ceramic disc brakes feature orange Lamborghini-branded calipers, and the car is equipped with Lamborghini dynamic steering, Tecnica-calibrated LDVI integrated vehicle systems, a magnetorheological suspension, a front-end lift system, and electronic traction control. The carbon-fiber-backed sport seats are trimmed in Nero Cosmus leather and Alcantara with orange accents and stitching, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the dashboard and center console. Arancio Leonis seatbelts were optioned, and the door panels feature fabric door pulls and exposed carbon fiber. The Travel Package added a cup holder and utility net, and additional amenities include carbon-fiber interior trim, cruise control, automatic climate control, and an infotainment system. An engine start button is located in the center console beneath a hinged cover. The Alcantara-wrapped flat-bottom steering wheel features an orange center stripe and stitching, and it is equipped with column-mounted shift paddles and a drive-mode selector that includes three separate ANIMA dynamic driving modes. Instrumentation includes a configurable digital gauge panel with a 10k-rpm tachometer, a speedometer, and readouts for g-forces and other ancillary data. The digital odometer indicates 219 miles. The 5.2-liter V10 features dry-sump lubrication and was factory rated at 631 horsepower and 443 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Gold Coast Exotic Imports of Chicago, Illinois, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $378,758. A battery tender is included in the sale along with a car cover, an air compressor, tools, driving gloves, and other accessories. The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage.
