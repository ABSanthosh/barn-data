  "description": "A leaked design patent has revealed that Tata Motors is working on introducing terrain modes for its SUVs. The patent shows a rotary knob with seven different modes, likely to include Snow, Sand and Gravel, or even a Custom mode. The leak suggests that future Tata SUVs, starting with the upcoming Harrier EV, will get an all-wheel-drive (AWD) or even a 4x4 configuration. Future Tata SUVs to get AWD/4x4 Terrain modes include Snow, Gravel, Sand, and more Tata Motors currently retails four front-wheel-drive internal combustion engine (ICE) SUVs: the Nexon, Harrier, Safari and Curvv. At the launch of the Curvv, the company revealed that its new ATLAS (Adaptive Tech Forward Lifestyle Architecture) platform, which underpins the coupe-SUV, can accommodate 4x4, albeit with some changes. While the next-gen Nexon will also be based on ATLAS, the limited demand for 4X4 or AWD SUVs in this segment means that the new terrain modes will likely be omitted in the compact SUV. Another SUV based on the same architecture, the upcoming Sierra, and the Harrier EV will be offered with AWD. It is yet to be seen if an AWD system will make its way to Tata’s ICE SUVs. Do note that terrain modes are different from drive modes (Eco, City, Sport) offered in the Nexon, Curvv, Harrier and Safari. The Harrier and Safari also have traction modes, such as Normal, Rough and Wet. Meanwhile, rivals to the Harrier and Safari, including the Mahindra XUV700, Scorpio N and Jeep Compass, are the only ones in the segment to offer either an AWD or a 4x4 configuration, at least as an option.
