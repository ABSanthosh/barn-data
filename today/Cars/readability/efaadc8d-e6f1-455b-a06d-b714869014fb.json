  "description": "Explosive performance at an accessible price – these words instantly bring a certain orange machine to mind. Since 2013, the KTM 390 Duke has dominated its class, and every single rival that has gone up against the Duke has retreated with its tail tucked between its legs. But today, the Duke will have to deal with its toughest challenge yet posed by the Aprilia Tuono 457. KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 design and ergonomics Both have sharp designs and can feel tight for taller folks With some bikes, just a glance is enough to tell you what they are meant to do, and the designs of these two machines are true to their function. Neither is classically good-looking, and both are aggressively styled, although in its latest avatar, the 390 might be too aggressive for some.  The rider’s triangle is the first difference you’ll notice, and while both are reasonably comfortable, on the Aprilia, there is a bit of a forward reach to the handlebar, whereas you’re almost bolt upright on the KTM. Over bad roads, this will be felt in the lower back. With their 800mm perches, these bikes will be welcoming for shorter riders but feel cramped for taller ones.  Both bikes are a little tight for larger and heavier riders. At 5’11”, I just about fit on both these machines, but taller riders should look elsewhere. The Duke can be had with an accessory tall seat, raising its perch to 820mm, which will liberate some knee room for taller riders. The optional comfort seat on the Tuono keeps the same height as the stock unit. Neither is geared toward all-out comfort, and that’s par for the course.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 quality and features Duke has larger number of useful features and better quality all across Modern-day KTMs have made huge strides when it comes to the quality front, and that is clearly visible here. The Tuono 457, with its aluminium chassis, looks great, but crucial areas, such as the cheap-feeling key, the more basic levers and an ugly misaligned panel on the headlight surround, just feel like a step down from the KTM. Fun fact: the adjustable brake lever on the Tuono is a Rs 5,500 accessory (!) and appears to be the exact same unit as the one on the Gen 2 390 Duke that sells for under Rs 1,000. The 390 Duke now also gets cruise control. Another facet where the Duke is ahead of the Tuono is the features (and bragging rights) department. Its suspension has damping adjustability, the bidirectional quickshifter is standard, it comes with a cornering anti-lock braking system (ABS) and traction control (TC), and the latest model even has cruise control. The Tuono, with its three riding modes, switchable ABS and TC and preload-adjustable front suspension, has a good level of kit, unlike the contender from the tuning fork brand. As for the Aprilia’s bidirectional quickshifter? A cool Rs 20,000 for that.  KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 handling Both are superb handlers and will put a big smile on your face However, you don’t ride a bike’s build quality or features, so I’ll stop rambling about that and start raving about how these things behave on the road. Both take very different approaches to their chassis – the KTM uses a steel trellis, while the Aprilia has an aluminium perimeter frame (the only one in this class to do so). Predictably, their behaviour on the side of the tyre is markedly different, but both are almost equally fast in the real world.  Both machines are fast, but they go about their business quite differently. It might sound cliché, but the Duke feels a lot like a supermoto, and the Tuono feels a lot like a sportbike with a taller handlebar in the corners. They handle with a different feeling: the Duke prioritises lightness and reactivity, while the Aprilia feels agile but also beautifully composed. That said, both handle very well, and you’ll have a great time on either machine, whether on road or track.  Key specificationsAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeKerb Weight175kg168.3kgSeat height800mm800mmGround clearance 150mm170mmFuel tank capacity12.7 litres15 litresWheelbase1360mm1357mm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 ride comfort Duke's suspension more pliant; Tuono's brake fade issue an annoyance While chasing twisty ribbons of tarmac is what owners will dream of doing with these bikes, the reality is they will be used for commuting more often. Mumbai’s lumpy roads are a proper test of a bike’s suspension, and here, the Duke’s sophisticated setup will be worth its weight in gold. The bike feels a lot more absorptive while going over bumps, without sacrificing poise when you turn up the wick.   Both have taut suspension setups but KTM feels much more pliant than the Aprilia. In comparison, the Tuono’s suspension system, carried over unchanged from the RS 457, feels much stiffer, and you will feel more of the bumps. The brake-fade issue under repeated hard use on the 457s is another sore point, and while it isn’t a very difficult fix, Aprilia should’ve ironed it out by now. Especially since customers have shared that certain dealerships say warranties will be cancelled when brake master cylinders are upgraded.  EngineAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeEngine457cc, twin-cyl, liquid-cooled399cc, single-cyl, liquid-cooledPower47.6hp at 9,400rpm46hp at 8,500rpmPower-to-weight ratio272hp/tonne273.33hp/tonneTorque43.5Nm at 6,400rpm39Nm at 6,400rpm KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 engine and performance Aprilia's engine is the star of the show, KTM is quick but not as characterful So far, it’s neck and neck, but one area where the Tuono scores a massive victory is the engine. The twin-cylinder mill is smooth, brimming with character, and makes all the right sounds. Its strong low-end and mid-range also mean you needn’t frantically work the gearbox, and it also pops nice power wheelies. In outright performance, the Tuono is quicker in the 0-100kph sprint by just 0.3 seconds, but its engine’s effortless grunt is more apparent in the roll-on acceleration tests.  The Tuono’s engine is a peach. Hopping onto the KTM after the Aprilia will make you realise you need to work the gearbox more and give the engine revs to make quick progress. You’ll also feel a more pronounced buzz, especially in the handlebar. However, the Duke’s refinement levels are respectable for a single-cylinder engine of this size with this level of performance. That said, the excitable hooligan nature of the KTM is great fun, if that’s the riding experience you’re after.  PerformanceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukeAcceleration 0-60kph2.17s2.21s0-100kph4.88s5.21sRoll-on acceleration20-50kph1.73s1.87s30-70kph2.83s3.19s50-80kph2.68s3.22sBraking60-0kph (in metres)16.3516.52 KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 price and verdict Tuono is an impressive machine let down by pressing issues PriceAprilia Tuono 457KTM 390 DukePrice (ex-showroom, Delhi)Rs 3.95 lakhRs 2.97 lakh All that back and forth now means I need to tell you which bike is the winner. The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke. There are buyers out there for whom the extra Rs 1.5 lakh will be justified because the Tuono feels like a scaled-down big bike, which is a very special feeling.  Brake-fade issue continues on Aprilia 457s. However, in the last couple of months, several customers have reported varied and significant engine reliability issues. Aprilia India recently attributed these issues to unauthorised modifications and/or irregular service and says that it has addressed the few genuine cases. Whether the issues are fully addressed is something only time can tell.  Beyond that, there is no escaping the fact that the 390 Duke has a much more accessible price, more features and better ride comfort, and it can be nearly as fast as the Tuono. There were some isolated engine incidents at the beginning, but Bajaj swiftly addressed them, and the bike has been around for long enough that there are no significant reliability concerns. All this is why the KTM 390 Duke will continue to reign in this segment. Also See: KTM 390 Duke vs Aprilia Tuono 457 comparison video",

The Tuono 457 feels very special to ride, but it’s nearly Rs 1.50 lakh more (on-road, Mumbai) with the accessory quickshifter installed. The engine and sublime handling are two very big factors to get one, and this motorcycle won’t be as common a sight on our roads as the Duke.
