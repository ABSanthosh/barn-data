  "text": "Underground Racing is also working on upgrading the Revuelto's V12 internals to ensure they can cope with the extra power 10 hours ago by Brad Anderson This insane Revuelto should be able to keep pace with the planet’s most powerful electric hypercars. Underground Racing has been offering 1,600 hp upgrades for the Aventador for several years. If you own a Lamborghini and want to make it even faster, Underground Racing has long been the place to go. The firm in North Carolina has been producing twin-turbo packages for the finest Raging Bulls for more than a decade, and for its latest project, has turned its attention to the Revuelto and created the world’s first example with a pair of turbos bolted to the mighty 6.5-liter V12. Work on the heavily upgraded model is still ongoing, but the firm has released a handful of photos and a video previewing this insane creation. It rocks a pair of billet wheel turbochargers from Precision and will also benefit from a fully built-engine. While we don’t yet have a full list of the engine upgrades that are in the works, they’ll be required to ensure the V12 can safely and consistently handle more than double the horsepower it was designed to. Read: Underground Racing Gives Lambo Aventador SV Roadster Twin Turbos, 1,500 WHP Complementing the two new turbochargers and the engine’s internal upgrades will be a bespoke exhaust system while all of the software will be controlled with the JRR M1 engine management system. Underground Racing says the car is going to pump out an extraordinary 2,000 hp when it’s complete, a full 999 hp more than the standard Revuelto. There’s no word on how much torque the V12 will produce, but it will certainly deliver much more than the 535 lb-ft (725 Nm) of the stock engine. The two turbochargers, in addition to the three electric motors the Revuelto leaves the factory with, should make this thing an absolute monster and likely capable of matching some of the planet’s near 2,000-hp electric hypercars in a straight line. This isn’t the first time Underground Racing has worked on a Lamborghini V12. It offers twin-turbo packages for the Murcielago and Aventador, the latter of which was available with up to 1,600 hp at the wheels while running on race fuel.",
