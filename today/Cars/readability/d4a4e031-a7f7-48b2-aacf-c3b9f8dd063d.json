  "description": "Mahindra will take the wraps off the production-spec BE 6e and XEV 9e electric SUVs on November 26. The brand has now previewed the interior of both models via some teasers. Both SUVs will have a 5-seater configuration  Will be introduced at different price points XEV 9e shares some interior bits with the XUV700 Mahindra BE 6e to get twin-screen layout The new teaser pretty much confirms what was seen in previous spy shots – the interior layout of the BE 6e seems quite futuristic and techy. It comes with dual 12.3-inch screens and a ‘halo’ or a floating wraparound element that extends from the dashboard to the centre console creating a cockpit-like, driver-centric environment. It also gets a twin-spoke steering wheel with an illuminated Mahindra BE logo. The teaser also shows a large glass roof, an electronic parking brake, drive modes and a few other features. Mahindra XEV 9e triple-screen setup confirmed The XEV 9e will be bigger than the BE 6e SUV and have a completely unique dashboard design. The electric coupe-SUV goes a step ahead of the BE 6e in terms of the number of screens with a unique triple-screen setup. We can confirm that it gets three individual 12.3-inch units with a 1920x720 resoluton running Mahindra’s Adrenox software. The electric SUV will also come with a two-spoke flat-bottom steering wheel with an illuminated logo. Apart from this, the XEV 9e is expected to carry over some switchgear from the XUV700, such as the HVAC and the centre console controls. The SUV will get an electric parking brake and drive modes, among other bits. Upcoming Mahindra electric SUVs: what will they rival? While the BE 6e electric SUV will have a unique styling inside and out, it will be aimed squarely at the the BYD Atto 3 and the MG ZS EV, and the upcoming Creta EV and Maruti e Vitara. On the other hand, the larger XEV 9e will be pitted against the more practical Tata Harrier EV that is expected to go on sale sometime next year.
