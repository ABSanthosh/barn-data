  "text": "Toyota says its latest electric SUV is catered towards signles and couples March 11, 2025 at 20:54 by Brad Anderson European versions of the C-HR+ will be offered with 57.7 kWh and 77 kWh battery packs. The design of the new electric SUV bears a resemblance to the existing C-HR. A dual-motor version of the Toyota C-HR+ delivers an impressive 338 hp. Toyota has added a new EV to its range, and it’s one that no one really saw coming. Dubbed the C-HR+, it’s similar in name to the existing C-HR sold in international markets, but it is bigger and is expected to be sold in the United States next year. So far, it’s only been announced in European specification and slots below the larger bZ4X in the Toyota family. Despite what the name of the C-HR+ might have you believe, it is not based on the gas-powered C-HR, and, instead, has the same e-TNGA 2.0 platform as the bZ4X. Unlike that model that’s often panned for its weird looks, the C-HR+ is much sleeker and more refined. Whether or not that helps it sell better than the bZ4X remains to be seen, but it’s a good start. Read: 2025 Toyota bZ4X Gets $6,000 Price Cut, New Nightshade Edition The new Toyota C-HR+ sits on a 108.2-inch (2,750 mm) wheelbase, exactly four inches shorter than the wheelbase of the bZ4X. The brand says the C-HR+ is more catered towards singles and couples, whereas the bZ4X is a family car. As developing and building new EVs from scratch is very costly, Toyota is using similar powertrain options to the bZ4X. Base models in Europe will feature a 57.7 kWh battery pack and a single electric motor driving the front wheels, delivering 165 hp (123 kW). Toyota says this model will be good for 283 miles (455 km) of range on the WLTP cycle and can hit 62 mph (100 km/h) in a respectable 8.6 seconds. A more powerful FWD version with a 77 kWh pack has also been announced, kicking out 221 hp (165 kW) and boasting 373 miles (600 km) of range while dropping its 0-62 mph sprint time to 7.4 seconds. Sitting at the top of the C-HR+ family will be a twin-motor, all-wheel drive model with 338 hp (252 kW), a 77 kWh battery pack, and a 0-62 mph time of 5.2 seconds. This model has a claimed range of 326 miles (525 km). The Electric Toyota Americans Have Been Waiting For? Toyota has not confirmed if the C-HR+ will be sold in the US, and in a statement issued to Carscoops, simply said, “We have no U.S. product announcements at this time.” However, offering the C-HR+ locally will help the brand meet the Advanced Clean Car II sales regulations in six states that’ll go into effect for the 2026MY.",
