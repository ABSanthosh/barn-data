  "text": "Porsche might use the redesigned Q5 as the basis for a new gas-powered Macan 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Porsche appears to be testing the new Audi Q5, which debuted last fall. The SUV might serve as the foundation for Porsche’s next-generation ICE Macan. The current Macan shares its roots with the original Q5, with significant changes. Audi introduced the redesigned Q5 last fall, so it’s a bit surprising that spy photographers recently caught a prototype undergoing cold weather testing. However, there appears to be more to the situation than meets the eye. As you can see, the Q5 is the odd man out as it was part of a larger Porsche testing group that included the Cayenne EV and a 911. Spy photographers also said the entourage included a Boxster and a Macan. More: Gas-Powered Macan Back On The Table As Porsche Rethinks EVs Given this, it’s pretty clear the Q5 is being tested by Porsche and not Audi. This is where things get a little murky as spy photographers claim the Q5 will form the basis for the next-generation Macan. This would make a lot of sense as the first-generation model is over a decade old and was closely related to the original Q5. While Porsche recently introduced the Macan Electric, the company has realized electric vehicle adoption is occurring slower than expected and many customers want petrol power. This recently pushed them to announce an “expansion of the product portfolio to include additional vehicle models with combustion engines or plug-in hybrids.” SHProshots / Carscoops The company didn’t elaborate, but it was initially believed EV variants – such as the upcoming Boxer – would be modified to accommodate additional powertrains. However, that might not be the case as this would be an entirely separate vehicle. Things are still pretty hazy at this point, but the Q5 appears stock. However, if this is indeed a Macan mule, we can expect to see changes in the future as well as full prototypes in the months and years ahead. This suggests the model is quite a ways off, but basing the crossover on an existing vehicle could speed development and reduce costs. We’re taking things with a grain of salt, but the redesigned Q5 rides on the new Premium Platform Combustion and benefits from mild-hybrid technology. In Europe, there’s 2.0-liter TFSI and TDI engines with 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS) as well as a 3.0-liter TFSI V6 pumping out 362 hp (270 kW /  367 PS). All three are paired to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and a mild-hybrid system that can contribute an additional 24 hp (18 kW / 24 PS) for short periods of time.",
