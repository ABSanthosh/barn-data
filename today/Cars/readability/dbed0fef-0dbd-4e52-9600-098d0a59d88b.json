  "description": "BMW has unveiled an all-new generation of its sports tourer, the R 1300 RS. This model is essentially a faired version of the previously introduced R 1300 R, sharing many of its core components. It’s powered by the same boxer engine found in the R 1300 GS. BMW R 1300 RS features the same boxer engine as the R 1300 GS Runs on 17-inch wheels that are 1.4kg lighter At 245kg, the R 1300 RS is 8kg heavier compared to R 1300 GS BMW R 1300 RS revealed ahead of India launch A faired sports tourer from BMW with the same 1300cc boxer twin BMW has revealed the R 1300 RS, a sport tourer that replaces the R 1250 RS in its lineup. To simplify its position in the brand's lineup, the R 1300 RS plays a similar role to what the Ninja 1100SX does in Kawasaki’s range. It uses the same 1,300cc boxer engine found in the R 1300 GS. Here too, this mill produces the same 145hp at 7,750rpm and 149Nm at 6,500rpm. This horizontally opposed engine comes mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a bi-directional quickshifter as standard.  BMW R 1300 RS brakes and suspension  World's second series production bike to get adjustable spring rate in its USD fork This engine comes nestled within the same main-frame as the R 1300 GS, but borrows its rear subframe from the R 1300 R. Suspending this frame is a USD fork and a paralever EVO unit with preload and damping adjustment as standard.The R 1300 RS offers an adjustable spring rate in its USD fork, making it the second series production bike after the R 1300 R to feature this. Electronic suspension is available as an optional accessory. Braking is managed by twin discs at the front, paired with radially mounted 4-piston calipers, and a single disc at the rear. The R 1300 RS runs on 17-inch wheels at both ends but these new cast aluminium wheels reduce unsprung weight by 1.4kg. The rider’s perch is set at 790mm which can be further raised to 815mm.  The R 1300 RS features the same 17-liter fuel tank as the R 1300 R. However, at 245kg, it is 6kg heavier than its roadster sibling and 8kg heavier compared to the R 1300 GS. BMW R 1300 RS electronics suite Gets active cruise control with forward collision warning The BMW R 1300 RS comes equipped with a comprehensive set of electronic rider aids, including traction control, engine braking control, active cruise control with forward collision warning, and three standard riding modes: Eco, Rain, and Road. The optional Riding Package Pro unlocks additional Dynamic and Dynamic Pro modes. The R 1300 RS is available in four variants, each offering distinct color options– Basic version, Triple Black, Performance and Option 719 Cuyamaca. We expect BMW to launch the R 1300 RS in India in the coming months, and it will slot in between the R 1300 R (once it launches) and the R 1300 GS (Rs 21.20 lakh).
