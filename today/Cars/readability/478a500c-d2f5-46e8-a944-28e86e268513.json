This Mono was purchased new by the current owner, and it has 4,200 miles. It is now offered on dealer consignment in Newbury Park, California, with a build book, spare parts, and a Montana title. The carbon-fiber composite bodywork is wrapped around a TIG-welded seamless tube steel chassis and finished in blue with black lower body panels. Equipment includes front and rear towing eyes, carbon-fiber mirror caps, a central-exit exhaust outlet, and a rear spoiler and diffuser. A spare LED brake light is included in the sale. Black-finished 17″ OZ Racing wheels are mounted with Kumho Ecsta V700 tires measuring 205/40 up front and 245/40 out back. The cantilever suspension utilizes Sachs Racing adjustable coilovers with Eibach springs, and stopping power is provided by AP Racing calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The single-seat cockpit is trimmed in black microsuede and leather upholstery with white contrast stitching. Equipment includes an electrical cutoff switch, a brake bias adjuster, and a Willans safety harness. A spare Sabelt harness is included in the sale. The multifunction steering wheel features hand controls as well as an LCD display screen, and it is mounted on a quick-release hub. The digital odometer shows 4,200 miles. The Mountune Racing-built 2,488cc inline-four acts as a semi-structural component and features dry-sump lubrication, a gas-flowed cylinder head, forged connecting rods and pistons, a carbon-fiber airbox, and a stainless-steel 4-into-2 into-1 exhaust manifold. Output was factory rated at 305 horsepower. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed Hewland FTR sequential gearbox and a Powerflow limited-slip differential. The car is equipped with plywood underbody panels. The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries. The car has not had a California emissions test.
