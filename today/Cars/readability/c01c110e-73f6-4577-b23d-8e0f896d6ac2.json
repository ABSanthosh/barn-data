  "text": "Genesis’s incoming EV will bring back the coolest way to open rear doors.Genesis is known for drawing inspiration from high-end automakers when developing their models, and it’s clearly not slowing down. The highly anticipated Genesis GV90 may take the cake, however, as Genesis has just revealed that it will bring back coach doors.The automaker previously showed the world coach doors on its GV90 concept vehicle, but we’re always hesitant to buy into concepts. Most automakers remove details from final production vehicles for various reasons, but we're glad Genesis kept the coach doors.The GV90 with coach doors was spotted in testingShortsCar spotted the new-look GV90 during testing, which was shrouded in black cloth to hide its details from onlookers. Draping cloth over vehicles is de rigueur in the auto industry, and we can’t tell too much about what the nearly final build of the GV90 has in store for us, but Genesis can’t hide its coach doors.As you can see below, the shrouds over each door have cutouts for door handles, and Genesis’s front and rear door handles are inches apart. Coach doors incoming!More details about the GV90Genesis hasn’t officially revealed any of the GV90's details yet, but plenty of them have been leaked.The Genesis GV90 is expected to start at around $80,000, with an “Exclusive” variant doubling that price, costing $160,000. The Exclusive version will be limited-run, and we haven’t heard how many will be produced, but we’d venture a guess it’ll be between 1,000-5,000 units.The GV90 will be the first to utilize Hyundai’s new “eM” platform for its EVs, which cuts production costs by implementing a modular production process. The current E-GMP platform underpins all existing Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis EVs.The GV90 was spotted on the back of a truck under a tarp. Onlookers speculate that its wheelbase is slightly longer than a Mercedes-Benz GLS, a premium full-size SUV starting at around $90,000.We first saw the GV90 as the “Neolun” concept vehicle, with simple lines and a two-tone paint scheme. Inside, the concept vehicle had swiveling front seats, creating a welcoming environment paired with coach doors.A brief history of coach doorsCoach doors—or “suicide doors,” as some refer to them—put the hinge on the rear door at the back of the vehicle rather than the center pillar. We’ve seen them in the Honda Element, Faraday Future FF91, Rolls Royce Phantom, and smaller vehicles like the BMW i3 and Mini Cooper Clubman, which offered half-doors behind the driver and front passenger doors.Coach doors, as the name suggests, were originally used on horse-drawn carriages. The design was later made iconic by the 1961 Lincoln Continental, a feature the automaker revived on a special edition 2019 Lincoln Continental.Genesis Neolun conceptGenesisFinal thoughtsThe Genesis GV90 is probably the largest vehicle to ever have coach doors, and we think they belong there. Its spacious interior deserves a welcoming entry, and we’re hoping Genesis found a way to have swiveling front seats, too.We also hope it’s a well-received design and more automakers add it to future builds.Love reading Autoblog?
