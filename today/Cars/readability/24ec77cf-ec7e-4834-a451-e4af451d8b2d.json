  "description": "This Riley \u0026 Scott Mk III is one of approximately 21 examples built and was initially constructed for the 1999 season as chassis number 019 before competing for Yojiro Terada’s AutoExe Motorsport. The car was campaigned under the AutoExe LMP99 name through 1999, including a start at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where it retired from the race early due to engine failure. After a crash at Fuji Speedway at the end of the season, the car was rebuilt using portions of chassis 021 with redesigned bodywork in anticipation of a return to Le Mans in 2000. The project was not completed in time for acceptance into the Le Mans field, and the car, then called the LMP-X, was instead retired from racing but remained with Terada until 2009. It was then purchased by an owner who had it refurbished and moved it to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where it remained until being sold to its current owner in 2022. Finished in a red \"ampm\" livery over carbon Kevlar body panels, the car is powered by a 6.0-liter Ford OHV V8 that is paired with a Hewland six-speed sequential transaxle. Additional features include ventilated disc brakes, pushrod suspension, staggered-width 18” wheels, and a single racing seat equipped with a six-point harness. This AutoExe-built Riley \u0026 Scott Mk III is now offered by the seller on behalf of its owner in Union Dale, Pennsylvania, with a spare parts collection and a bill of sale.",

Additional features include ventilated disc brakes, pushrod suspension, staggered-width 18” wheels, and a single racing seat equipped with a six-point harness. This AutoExe-built Riley \u0026 Scott Mk III is now offered by the seller on behalf of its owner in Union Dale, Pennsylvania, with a spare parts collection and a bill of sale. Founded in 1990, Riley \u0026 Scott Cars Inc. began development of the Mk III in 1993 to contest the World Sports Car category of the IMSA GT Championship. After numerous successes between 1995 and 1998, the Mk III was revised for the 1999 season to meet European LMP regulations. This Mk III Series 2 was campaigned by AutoExe through five races in 1999 before being rebuilt for 2000 using portions of another chassis along with custom bodywork designed by a Japanese team including Mooncraft’s Takuya Yura. The carbon Kevlar bodywork is finished in a red “ampm” livery, and a spare set of body panels finished in red is included in the sale. Design features include trapezoidal headlights, a front splitter, fender louvers, NACA ducts on the nose and side pods, side ducts behind each front wheel, pedestal-mounted side mirrors, an intake snorkel, a rear diffuser, and a rear wing. Center-lock wheels are finished in black and wear Avon racing slicks measuring 335/645R18 up front and 365/720R18 at the rear. Stopping is handled by ventilated disc brakes with adjustable bias. The cockpit houses a single racing seat upholstered in black and equipped with a Schroth Racing six-point racing harness. Additional features include a right-hand shifter with a drilled knob, a padded headrest, a roll bar, and a fire-suppression system. The three-spoke steering wheel sits on a quick-release hub ahead of a MoTeC digital display surrounded by toggle switchgear and aircraft-style fuses. The car is not equipped with an odometer, and total mileage is unknown. The mid-mounted 6.0-liter OHV Ford V8 is said to have been overhauled by Lozano Brothers Porting under previous ownership and has reportedly since seen 14 hours of use. Features include dry-sump lubrication, electronic fuel injection, a carbon intake plenum, side-mounted oil coolers, and a nose-mounted radiator. The Hewland LSGS six-speed sequential transaxle is said to have been rebuilt in 2019. A collection of spare parts that was reportedly purchased from Riley \u0026 Scott after the company’s dissolution is included in the sale along with several spare wheels and various body panels. According to the seller, the included spare body is complete with the exception of the cockpit surround. An AutoExe chassis plate inside the cockpit identifies the car using serial number LMP-021, and an additional identification decal can be viewed in the photo gallery below. The race car does not have a title, as it is not legal for street use. It is being offered for off-road use on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
