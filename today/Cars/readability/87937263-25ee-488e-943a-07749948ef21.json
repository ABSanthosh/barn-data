This XK convertible is now offered in New York by the selling dealer with a clean Carfax report and a clean New Jersey title. The car is finished in Zircon, and exterior equipment includes a power-operated blue soft top, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, rear parking sensors, a rear spoiler, and polished exhaust outlets. The 18″ seven-spoke wheels show curb marks and are mounted with Continental ContiSportContact 3E SSR tires. The car is equipped with an enhanced Computer Active Technology Suspension (eCATS) with adaptive damping. Stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at all four corners. The heated power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in gray leather, and amenities include front-seat position memory, navigation, push-button ignition, cruise control, a CD stereo, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as a central digital display. The digital odometer indicates 20k miles. The 4.2-liter AJ V8 was factory rated at 300 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale.
