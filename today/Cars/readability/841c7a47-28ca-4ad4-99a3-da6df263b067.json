  "text": "The custom Blazer EV sports an aggressive new aerodynamic package, including a huge rear wing February 13, 2025 at 19:35 by Brad Anderson The EV.R is based on the NASCAR Next Gen chassis with a 78 kWh liquid-cooled battery. GM’s wild prototype racer also has an advanced programmable all-wheel drive system. Chevrolet will pace this weekend’s Daytona 500 race with the road-legal Blazer EV SS. Chevrolet seems to have taken a page out of Ford’s playbook and wants the world to take notice of its EVs, creating a high-powered, track-only prototype based on the Blazer EV. Ford has taken similar steps in recent years, debuting one-offs launching one-offs like the Mustang Mach-E 1400 Prototype, F-150 Lighting SuperTruck, SuperVan 4.2, and most recently, the Mach-E NASCAR. Chevy’s special prototype, known as the Blazer EV.R NASCAR, has been shown ahead of this weekend’s Daytona 500, and is very similar to Ford’s electrified creations. While the Blazer EV.R NASCAR shares a name with the road-going Blazer EV, it’s a whole different beast. Indeed, it’s built around NASCAR’s Next Gen chassis and features a 78 kWh liquid-cooled battery that feeds juice to three six-phase electric motors. All up, the prototype churns out a raucous 1,300 hp, sent to the pavement through a programmable all-wheel drive system. Read: Chevrolet Blazer EV SS Launching Soon, Will Be A Lyriq-V For The Masses The prototype’s design closely mirrors the standard Blazer EV SS, but with a much sharper focus on performance. It’s decked out with dramatic aerodynamic enhancements, all aimed at keeping it glued to the pavement at high speeds. While the front end maintains the familiar Blazer EV look, it gets a more aggressive splitter for added downforce. Chevrolet’s designers and engineers have also crafted new center-lock wheels for the prototype, clad in Goodyear Racing Eagle tires. The one-off has also been transformed from a four-door into a two-door and does without side windows because who needs windows in a race car, right? Standout features at the rear of the Blazer EV.R NASCAR prototype include the massive wing and the diffuser. There’s no word on how much downforce the car delivers, but it’s bound to be a hefty amount. “NASCAR and its manufacturer partners are passionate about emerging technologies, and working to remain on the forefront of innovation,” NASCAR vice president of vehicle design Brandon Thomas said. “With the Blazer EV.R NASCAR prototype, Chevrolet and its engineers meshed new technologies with the NASCAR Next Gen platform – and the result is a powerful, exciting vehicle that we believe fans will love when they see it at Daytona International Speedway.” While the EV.R NASCAR prototype is pure racing fantasy, Chevrolet isn’t forgetting about the consumer side of things. The Blazer EV SS, the flagship model, is set to hit dealerships soon, offering up to 615 horsepower and a zero-to-60-mph time of just 3.4 seconds. Range? You’re looking at a solid 303 miles on a full charge, all for $62,490, including destination fees.",
