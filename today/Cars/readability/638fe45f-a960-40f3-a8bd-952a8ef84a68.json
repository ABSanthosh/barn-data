These days, many opt for the former, as race shops bring a wealth of experience to the table – and motorsport can be prohibitively expensive. Yet, there’s a dedicated group who burn the midnight oil in their garages, sacrificing time and money to chase their racing dreams. Josh Lawton is one of them. I’ve been following Josh on social media for a few years now, and over this time, his dual talent as a driver and car builder has been evident. A ballsy lap of the Nürburgring in his other car – a turbocharged EK Honda Civic – was a particular highlight. Eventually, Josh found that track days weren’t enough to satisfy his competitive spirit. So, with his father’s help, they decided to build a proper race car. The Civic – an EG hatchback – now competes in the Classic Touring Car Racing Championship series, specifically in the Thunder Saloons. The basic requirements for this category are that the car must have been produced before 2011 and originally seat four. This results in varied competitors – from supercharged E46 BMW M3s to ex-Australian V8 Supercars. Against factory-built sports cars, you might think a home-built Civic would be out of its depth, but that’s not the case. Given Josh’s long-standing love for Hondas – fueled by his father gifting him an EG Civic shell to work on together at 14 – the Honda choice was a no-brainer. By 16, Josh knew his career would be in the automotive world. He initially qualified as a pipe welder, which equipped him with crucial fabrication skills. Everything else has been passed down from his father. The EG Civic underwent a significant weight reduction before receiving a comprehensive weld-in roll cage, tube-frame front end (which included relocating the OEM shock towers), and FRP doors with polycarbonate windows. To keep pace with the competition, Josh made some strategic adjustments. One was upgrading to 18-inch wheels – 11 inches wide up front and 10.5 inches in the rear – wrapped in slicks. By running Michelin medium compounds on the front and Yokohama soft compounds out back, Josh says the car is much more manageable than running medium compounds all around. In order to accommodate the wide wheels and tyres, the Civic features a full carbon fibre front end and added bolt-on rear fenders. Over three years of racing and development, the car’s aero package has evolved significantly, drawing inspiration from two Australian EGs – JDMyard’s time attack car and Jordan Cox’s Improved Production class Civic – as well as employing fundamental aerodynamic principles. The aggressive carbon front splitter, flat floor, and vortex-generating side skirts – crafted in-house – lead to a large rear diffuser and gooseneck wing. While none of these aero additions have been wind tunnel tested, Josh’s application of their basic principles and continuous on-track testing have resulted in a cohesive, well-balanced package. The adage ‘if it looks right, it probably is right’ rings true here. Stopping power comes from 340mm 2-piece rotors, clamped by Brembo callipers sourced from a Renault Megane and paired with Pagid RST5 pads up front. At the rear, OEM callipers are deemed sufficient. Yellowspeed coilovers with 20kg/mm front and 16kg/mm rear springs may seem stiff, but after experimenting with various setups, Josh has found this combination to be the sweet spot for circuit racing. Under the hood, the Civic boasts a 2.4L Honda K-series engine – with some added boost. Sourced from a Honda Accord, the K24A3 engine features forged rods, a K20 oil pump, an upgraded intake cam, and stronger valve springs. The Rotrex C38-91 supercharger forces compressed air through a sizeable Treadstone Performance intercooler and 70mm throttle body, while a 4-2-1 exhaust manifold and full 3-inch exhaust system manage the exhaust flow. To withstand the rigours of racing, the K20 5-speed gearbox has been fitted with Gear-X semi-helical gears, a KAAZ 1.5-way plate limited-slip differential, and a Hybrid Racing shifter and cables. Inside, the Civic is stripped down to its bare bones, with little more than a race seat and driver controls within the roll cage. The electronics package includes a Hondata KPro4 that Josh tuned himself, which connects to an ECUMaster ADU7 display and a PMU16 power management unit. In crafting the motorsport-spec loom, Josh received invaluable assistance from a friend at Fulcrum Motorsport. By this point, you may have realised that this is a genuine privateer effort, with Josh and his family undertaking almost every aspect of the build themselves. While discussing the build, Josh shared, “Part of the thrill is the car development as much as the racing. It brings an extra sense of achievement.” During the Brands Hatch Supertourer event this year, the Thunder Saloon races stood out as a highlight. After a convincing win in an earlier race, Josh revealed his Civic was experiencing engine issues. Adopting a ‘checkers or wreckers’ mindset, he pushed on after a brief off to fight back through the field and claim third place. It was a stunning drive. So far, Josh has competed in 10 Thunder Saloons races, securing seven podiums, including five wins. He’s also set lap records for Thunder Saloons at every track he’s visited, suggesting his trophy cabinet may soon need an upgrade. The next time you’re at a race event featuring support races, don’t overlook them. Take a stroll through the pits, find the drivers like Josh who pour their hearts into their own cars, and keep an eye out for them on track – they just might be the highlight of your day.
