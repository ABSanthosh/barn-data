It was subsequently purchased by the current owner on BaT in November 2023 and now has 100 miles. Featuring carbon-fiber-composite bodywork wrapped in the historic Interscope Racing livery, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle. Additional equipment includes a racing-optimized limited-slip differential, Brembo slotted and ventilated disc brakes with adjustable bias, three-way adjustable dampers, Porsche Stability Management with adjustable parameters, staggered-width 18” center-lock alloy wheels, a rear wing with lights integrated into its end plates, a roof escape hatch, cookie-cutter dual exhaust outlets, a 115-liter FT3 fuel cell, a welded-in roll cage, a single FIA-compliant Recaro carbon-fiber racing seat, a laminated wood shift knob, a carbon-fiber multifunction steering wheel, air conditioning, and a Cosworth digital dash.

Featuring carbon-fiber-composite bodywork wrapped in the historic Interscope Racing livery, the car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle. Additional equipment includes a racing-optimized limited-slip differential, Brembo slotted and ventilated disc brakes with adjustable bias, three-way adjustable dampers, Porsche Stability Management with adjustable parameters, staggered-width 18” center-lock alloy wheels, a rear wing with lights integrated into its end plates, a roof escape hatch, cookie-cutter dual exhaust outlets, a 115-liter FT3 fuel cell, a welded-in roll cage, a single FIA-compliant Recaro carbon-fiber racing seat, a laminated wood shift knob, a carbon-fiber multifunction steering wheel, air conditioning, and a Cosworth digital dash. This Type 991 935 is now offered on dealer consignment in Atlanta, Georgia, with a factory spare parts package and a bill of sale. Unveiled in September 2018 at Rennsport Reunion IV at Laguna Seca in California, the 2019 reprise of the 935 shared its underpinnings with the 911 GT2 RS while featuring distinct bodywork evoking that of the original 935/78 Le Mans-winning race car. Construction incorporates a steel and aluminum composite shell wrapped in carbon-fiber-composite body panels with flared fenders and a longtail rear profile inspired by the original “Moby Dick” race car. In addition to the standard Agate Grey finish, the 935 could be ordered with a choice of one of eight wraps incorporating classic racing liveries. This example was ordered in a black, red, orange, and pink livery re-creating that carried by an original 935 to victory for Interscope Racing in the 1979 24 Hours of Daytona. Exterior features include an escape hatch in the carbon-fiber-composite roof, an adjustable exposed carbon-fiber rear wing with LED lights integrated into its end plates, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, fixed side windows, side mirrors shared with the 911 RSR, exposed carbon-fiber front fender louvers, LED headlights housed within front air inlets, number 70 roundels, and dual cookie cutter exhaust outlets inspired by Porsche’s 908 race car. BBS forged alloy wheels measuring 18×11.5” up front and 18×13” at the rear are finished in matte black and secured by color-coded center-lock nuts. Michelin Pilot Sport GT transport tires measuring 30/65 and 31/71 are mounted at front and rear, respectively. The braking system incorporates Brembo aluminum monobloc calipers with six pistons acting upon 380mm-diameter slotted and ventilated rotors up front and four pistons acting on 355mm rotors at the rear. Front-rear bias can be adjusted via a balance bar, while electronic controls allow adjustment or disabling of ABS, traction control, and electronic stability input. The cockpit houses a single Recaro wraparound racing seat with a carbon-fiber shell, black upholstery, longitudinal adjustment, and a Schroth six-point harness. Additional features include a roll cage, a side net with push-button release, black Alcantara dash trim, red door pulls, power side-mirror adjustment, air conditioning, a fire-suppression system, fuel and electrical cutoff switches, and a titanium shifter with a laminated wood knob, the latter serving as a nod to the Porsche 917. The quick-release carbon-fiber-composite steering wheel hosts shift paddles and button controls for the Cosworth ICD digital dash, which is flanked by a Sport Chrono timer and a boost gauge. The digital odometer shows 159 kilometers (~99 miles), 13 of which have been added under current ownership. A badge affixed on the right side of the dash identifies the car as the 49th of 77 examples of the 935 built. The water-cooled 3.8-liter Type MA173 flat-six features VarioCam Plus variable valve timing, twin turbochargers, and air-to-air intercoolers, the latter of which receive further cooling via external spraying of distilled water. Output was factory rated at 700 horsepower at 7k rpm and 553 lb-ft of torque at 2,500 to 4,500 rpm. An oil change was performed in 2022. Additional equipment includes a lithium-ion battery mounted on the passenger side of the cockpit and a 115-liter FT3 fuel cell in the front compartment. The rear wheels are driven via a rigid-mounted seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronically adjustable racing-optimized limited-slip differential. Suspension incorporates forged links, spherical bearings, and three-way adjustable dampers, while steering is handled with electromechanical assistance. The car is also equipped with an air-jack system. A factory spare parts package is included in the sale. The car does not have a title, as it is intended for track use only.
