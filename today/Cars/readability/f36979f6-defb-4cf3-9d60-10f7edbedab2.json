  "text": "This 1982 Porsche 911SC coupe has spent time with several owners on the East coast, and it was purchased by the previous owner in April 2024. The car is powered by a 3.0-liter flat-six paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in red over black leather. Equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a sunroof, fog lights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and power windows. This 911SC coupe is now offered in Maryland by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Delaware title. The car is said to have left the factory finished in Guards Red and was refinished under prior ownership, and additional work has included replacing the rubber seals around the windshield, rear window, and rear quarter windows. Features include a sunroof, fog lights, dual side mirrors, and rear bumperettes. The 16″ Fuchs wheels with black centers are mounted with General G-Max tires. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes with ventilated rotors. The cabin features bucket seats trimmed in black leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Amenities include a center console and power windows. The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as an 150-mph speedometer, a clock, and gauges for oil level, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 147k miles. The Carfax report shows a reading higher than the odometer in a June 2006 entry, and the trip odometer shows all zeros. Total mileage is unknown. The 3.0-liter flat-six features Bosch fuel injection and was factory rated at 172 horsepower and 189 lb-ft of torque. An oil return tube was replaced within the last year, per the selling dealer. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 915 five-speed manual transaxle. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage, and shows multiple gaps in entries. The Delaware title classifies the vehicle for “Antique” use. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
