  "text": "The brand’s second standalone electric model will feature an 800-volt electrical system and go against the likes of the Lotus Eletre R and Porsche K1 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson Mercedes-AMG’s electric SUV draws design inspiration from the Vision AMG concept. Built on the AMG-EA platform, it will offer up to 1,000 hp from three axial-flux motors. Expected to debut in 2026, it will directly compete with the upcoming Porsche K1. Last month, Mercedes-AMG previewed the all-electric super SUV it’s currently working on. This new model is being developed alongside AMG’s first in-house electric sedan, and much like that car, is bound to court controversy. After all, many enthusiasts are accustomed to AMG models with thumping V8 engines, and this is partly why the four-cylinder hybrid C 63 has been a flop. However, the German brand believes electric is the future, and it’s cooking up something rather special. Prototypes spotted by our spy photographers, along with official images released by Mercedes, were heavily covered in body cladding and camouflage, obscuring most of the design details. However, there’s a chance the EV, which is rumored to receive the GT SUV moniker, will have many similarities to its sedan counterpart that’s tipped to draw inspiration from the 2022 Mercedes Vision AMG Concept. Read: First Look At Mercedes-AMG’s 1,000 HP Electric SUV Flagship With this in mind, artist Nikita Chuyko created illustrations for Kolesa based on the test mules and recent renderings of AMG’s Taycan fighter, offering a preview of what the new SUV might look like. If it ends up resembling these images, it will certainly stand out in the Mercedes lineup, though we’re not entirely convinced it’ll be for all the right reasons. The front of the SUV showcased here is dominated by a faux grille, which is to be expected in an EV, while the headlights are connected by a light bar. They also sport the Three-Pointed Star DRLs coming to a slew of new Mercedes models. Illustrations Kolesa / Nikita Chuyko For as interesting as the front of this rendering is, the rear end is even more so. Taking cues from the Vision AMG Concept’s styling, it sports a wraparound LED taillight design, which brings to mind the Kia EV6 – an interesting choice, though one that works better on the Mercedes. Power, Performance, and Ambition Moving away from the design, the GT SUV is expected to mirror the size of the 2022 Vision AMG concept, stretching about 5.1 meters (200 inches) in length, with a wheelbase pushing over 3 meters (118 inches). That’s a bigger footprint than the gas-guzzling AMG GLE 63, putting it in the same league as the fully electric EQS SUV flagship. Under the skin, the new AMG electric SUV will be built on the brand’s proprietary AMG.EA platform, featuring an 800-volt electrical system for faster charging and greater efficiency. It will also sport newly developed axial-flux electric motors from the British company Yasa, potentially delivering more than 1,000 hp. That kind of power will make it a serious contender against other electric crossovers like the Lotus Eletre R, which puts out 905 hp. A release date hasn’t been announced yet, however it’s likely that the production version will debut in 2026, with sales kicking off later that year or early 2027, depending on the market, just ahead of its Porsche K1 rival. In theory, it’s a serious competitor for any luxury electric crossover, but its commercial success depends largely not just on its tech or power figures, but its design as well.
