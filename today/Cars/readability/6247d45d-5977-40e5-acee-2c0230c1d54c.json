  "text": "Following a delay, Rockstar has dropped a new teaser for Grand Theft Auto VI May 6, 2025 at 20:30 by Michael Gauthier Days after announcing GTA VI was delayed, Rockstar has released a new teaser video. The clip shows Jason and Lucia reunite, before embarking on a crime spree across Leonida. The game is now set to come out on May 26, 2026 and it seems destined to break records. Earlier this month, Rockstar Games revealed Grand Theft Auto VI would be delayed until May 26, 2026. That’s nearly 13 years after the last installment, which currently stands as the second best-selling video game of all-time. When the delay was announced, Rockstar said the “goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception.” They added the extra time was needed to deliver the “level of quality you expect and deserve.” More: We Waited 12 Years For GTA 6 And Rockstar Just Hit Us With Another Delay The company went on to thank fans for their patience and support, before hinting at “sharing more information with you soon.” They weren’t joking about the latter as they’ve now dropped the second trailer, which, amazingly, has already racked up nearly 38 million views in just 10 hours at the time of publishing, along with over 380,000 comments on YouTube alone. Rockstar didn’t say much about the clip, but teased Jason and Lucia were looking for an easy score. However, things went wrong and they quickly found themselves on the “darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida – forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.” That’s not a lot to go on, but the teaser shows Jason working as a collector and enjoying the beach life. He then picks up Lucia as she’s being released from jail. The two then get ‘reacquainted’ before things go sideways. It’s not entirely clear what happens, but we can see a hold up, apparent drug deals, and some sketchy cops. This leads to explosions, some midair action, and the heist of a sports car.",
