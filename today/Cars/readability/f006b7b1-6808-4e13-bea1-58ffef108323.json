Then this list is for you. We’ve put together the best starter cars that are cheap to insure, reliable and abundantly easy to find on the second-hand market, yet still manage to have bags of personality and good looks. After years of driving, testing, scanning classifieds, and clicking through insurance quotes, we rate the VW Up as the best first car.

Design9Interior6Performance6Ride \u0026 Handling6Costs8 Pros Strong real-world economyUpmarket interior consider price pointGood interior space considering size Cons Gearshift is a bit baggyNot the quickestEngine need working hard Best for: overallThe Up is both cheap both to buy and insure, and there are hundreds available for your picking and choosing.But that doesn't mean it isn't interesting. It has charm. Character. Kudos, even. It has one of the longest wheelbases in its class and the wheels are pushed right out to the far corners, which means it handles with verve and is spacious inside. You can easily fit four adults in it and still get a spare wheel under the boot.It's not just cleverly packaged either: its 1.0-litre engine sounds fantastic, despite being comedically slow. It was offered in two states of tune: 59bhp and 74bhp.But that leisurely pace can be a fun factor in its own right, and you get the by-product of cheap running costs. Either engines should achieve more than 50mpg and spare parts are available like iron on Mars.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior8Performance6Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs7 Pros Simple to driveResponsive enginesSharp, modern design Cons Low spec cars don't have big kit levelsSteering feedback isn't stellarLooks a touch cheap inside Best for: flair The genius of the Seat Ibiza is that it blends a youthful fit and feel with complete ubiquity. People can drive something that isn’t too staid, all good in the knowledge that there are thousands of models on the used market to choose from. This makes it cheap to buy and among the cheapest cars to insure in the UK.The exterior looks pretty sporty, but up front you will find low-powered engines that provide low running costs. Do a lot of motorway miles? We recommend going for the 1.4-litre diesel. It struggles less at speed than the low bhp petrols and will offer better MPG in this real-world application. Officially, it can get up to 80.7mpg.Inside, it’s pure Volkswagen Group, in that it’s pretty bland but largely well put together. Plus, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto may be available, depending on which model you go for, giving you simple and instant access to apps such as Google Maps.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior6Performance9Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs7 Pros Keen handlingAccessible performance and drivabilityQuiet and refined Cons Short on cabin spaceBetter quality interiors for the moneyFuel economy average for this class Best for: driving funThe Ford Fiesta was always going to make this list. It doesn't matter which spec, which year or which price you get one for: it’s usually good.We would go for the latest model though, which went off sale in 2024. There are thousands of cars on the used market at any given moment and prices continue to drop.For a run-of-the-mill supermini the Ford really shines in the driving department. Its balance of grip, body control and agility make it really fun to drive most of the time. And by far and away the sweetest car to pilot on this list.There are a few engines on offer for this model. We’d recommend the mild hybrid Ecoboost. It’s still economical (you should see 50mpg in real-world) and insurance friendly, but a 30-70mph time of 8.4secs proves it's no slouch.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior8Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs9 Pros Hugely economicalInterior as good as anything in its classBig boot Cons Ride could be more supple Rear seats very cramped for adultsHybrid is noisy Best for: interior qualityModern design, a huge boot and economical engines are chief of the reasons to buy Renault’s evergreen supermini.It’s plusher than you might imagine a French hatchback to be too, with everything feeling well put together. The infotainment is bang up-to-date and has the usual Apple CarPlay/Android Auto and it even gets niceties such as cruise control.There are two engines on offer. The three-cylinder 1.0-litre jobby is quiet, smooth and very economical as long as you make the most out of the six-speed manual ‘box. There’s also a 1.6-litre hybrid, which is both more economical (60mpg versus 50mpg) and quicker. Naturally, the hybrid is more money. But both are great options. Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior8Performance8Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs5 Pros Unmistakably Mini designEntertaining handlingCan be had as a convertible Cons No manual gearbox optionCentral touchscreen has too much to doRide is too firm Best for: styleCould a first car list ever be complete without a Mini? Generations of Brits have grown up with them and this latest version might just be the best yet.It’s certainly easy to drive. The steering is accurate and intuitive, really giving you confidence to place the car correctly in tight squeezes. It’s a hoot as well, with the firm suspension making it quite Tiggerish on UK roads - bouncing with boundless energy down the road.The 1.5-litre three-cylinder Cooper C is the one to go for here. It only comes with an automatic gearbox, which might come as a bit of a shock to some, but it’s the cheapest to insure and run. Over the course of a week we averaged 43.4mpg in one.Interior-wise it’s the most minimal and modern on this list. Mini has removed all unnecessary trimmings and buttons and it feels spartan - in a good way. The huge circular infotainment screen is great for tech lovers but quick word of warning - Apple CarPlay is displayed as a square inside the circle, meaning you can’t take full advantage of the screen while using it.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design8Interior7Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs8 Pros Easy to driveHigh quality interiorFresh and charming design Cons Seating position won't be for everyoneSuspension a bit too firmTemperature controls on touchscreen Best for: bargain pricesA truly compelling first car choice. It has been the bestselling supermini throughout various countries in Europe, it has a genuinely posh interior and best of all it is great value.Equipment levels are hard to fault - all models come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto - and the quality of materials are a cut above other cars of this price point. Admittedly there are a few rogue bits of cheap plastic if you really look, though.Like with the Renault Clio, the 208 offers a petrol and hybrid option. The hybrid comes with an automatic gearbox and is more economical and powerful than the regular petrol, but is also more expensive.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign8Interior6Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs7 Pros Robust cabinStrong refinement and drivabilityFlexible boot Cons Priciest on this listMore stylish rivals out thereNo frugal hybrid option Best for: practicalityNot everyone seeking their first car is some worry-free 17-year old. And the T-Cross is perfect if you require that extra bit of space.It sits on the same platform as the VW Polo, which means it inherits that car’s frugal engines that are economical and cheap to insure, but teams it with a larger, taller body that’s a bit more practical.Passenger space, for both front and rear occupants, is impressive and much more generous than you’d find in a supermini. The seating position is higher and more upright too, giving drivers a clearer view of the road ahead. The back-seat bench slides to boost boot space or rear leg room and there’s a boot floor you can lower or take out - perfect for tall items such as plants.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design9Interior7Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling8Costs7 Pros Superb design and attention to detailBrilliant value for moneySpacious interior Cons Not that fun to driveIntrusive speed limit warningVery firm seats Best for: zero-emission motoringA slew of EVs could have graced this list. The Citroen Ami is a wonderful choice if you restrict yourself to cities, as it can only do 30mph. While cars such as the Leapmotor T03 offer great value for money, but perhaps not the design ethos (nor proven reliability) offered by European marques.Which brings us to the Fiat Grande Panda Electric. It strikes a fine balance between retro and modernism with its design aping the OG Panda, while maintaining an air of modernity to it with features such as a retractable charging cable.Officially the Panda will travel 199 miles on a charge. Broadly these figures are unachievable but we were seeing around 185 miles on a mild January day when we tested it in Turin.If you can charge from home, an EV is a really canny way to save pennies too. If set up with a charging-specific energy provider you could be looking at prices of less than 5.0p per mile, which is about half the price of a petrol-powered equivalent.Finance this car with DrivenfiDesign7Interior6Performance5Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs8 Pros Mature road mannersLots of standard safety techErgonomic interior Cons Very slowLess practical than cars of the same priceMost basic car is the one that makes the most sense due to price Best for: parkingThe Aygo X might be the most pragmatic car on this list. It’s a city car, rather than a supermini, which means it’s small, light and can afford to run a tiddly 1.0-litre engine. This means 60mpg and extremely low running costs and insurance groups.Its reliability record is stellar too. It comes with a 10-year warranty and is made by Toyota, a company that is practically synonymous with dependability. It looks great too. It apes hallmarks of crossover design - slightly increased ride height and large alloy wheels - that make it look grown up. But its tiddly dimensions ensure it’s easy to park.Downsides? The engine is frugal, but not fast. We clocked 0-62mph in 16.7secs. Which is glacial, even when compared with city cars such as the Hyundai i10.Finance this car with Drivenfi Design7Interior7Performance7Ride \u0026 Handling7Costs8 Pros Torquey and economical enginesSimple to use interiorFunctional and clean design Cons Unengaging handlingRide can be a touch wooden-feelingCramped rear seats Best for: ease of useA simple car, well executed, with a variety of different trim levels and engine choices. Oh, and it’s so easy to drive it’s among the most popular driving school cars too.Standard equipment includes alloy wheels, LED lights and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto. Ergonomically it’s a delight as well. The infotainment is simple and easy to use, and there are physical controls for the heating and cooling too.You can choose petrol or hybrid engines (or a fully electric model called the Vauxhall Corsa Electric). Like with others on this list, the petrol is cheaper, but slower, while the hybrid is quicker and likely capable of better mpg (depending on how you drive it).Finance this car with DrivenfiHOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST FIRST CAR First cars are tricky to buy because of insurance costs, so you will first want to select a car that’s cheap to insure for you. There are many criteria that determine your insurance costs. So it's best to get quotes rather than rely on insurance groups, which tend to be somewhat inaccurate in this day and age.People buying their first cars are broadly young and won’t need too much space – which is lucky, because broadly smaller cars are both cheaper to buy and insure.The engine is also important: first-time drivers won’t need anything too powerful.One consideration we have also made with our list is how good they are to drive. Just because it’s your first car, doesn’t mean it needs to be a shopping trolley.This list comprises new and used cars and these come with the usual caveats. If buying new, and on finance, watch out for the APR figures.And if buying used, look out for modified cars. First cars and perhaps more likely to have been modified, and poorly done work tends to be more expensive to fix in the long run. HOW WE TESTED AND SELECTED All the cars on this list start are relatively easy and inexpensive to insure, small enough to fit easily into standard UK parking bays and are abundantly easy to find on the new, and used, market.A huge variety of cars make it past that judging remit, which is where our journalists become involved. Collectively we have driven every car of the past 20 years or so.So we whittled the list down to a select 10 by choosing the cars that we think are modern and design led enough to be considered interesting. All 10 are also easy, and rewarding, to drive. FAQs Do first cars need to be slow? They don't strictly need to be slow. But it helps. Cars with less bhp are broadly easier and cheaper to insure. How important is insurance? It is broadly the most important factor when buying a first car. Insurance costs have huge numbers of variables attached to them, but broadly, small, cheap-ish cars are the easiest for young people buying their first car. Do first cars need to be bad to drive? Absolutely not. There is often a confusion among people that cars need to be powerful to be fun. The cars on this list prove you don't need hundreds of horsepower in order to enjoy yourself on the road.
