The cabin is protected by a roll cage and features a Recaro carbon-fiber racing seat, a Schroth harness, and a fire suppression system along with an LCD display and a multifunction steering wheel with paddle shifters. The car was acquired by the seller in 2024 and has since campaigned in the Sebring Classic 12 Hour as well as competed in a track day and performance driving event. Work in 2025 consisted of rebuilding the rear axle assemblies and replacing the battery, front brake rotors, and fluids. This 991.2 GT3 Cup is now offered in Florida with a bill of sale. The GT3 Cup features aluminum-steel composite bodywork, and this example is finished in white. Equipment includes a carbon fiber rear wing, a front splitter, polycarbonate side and rear windows, a rescue hatch, xenon headlights, and LED taillights. Silver 18” center-lock wheels are mounted with Yokohama racing slicks, and the car is equipped with an air jack system. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over slotted rotors cooled by front air deflectors and rear ducts. Service in February 2025 included replacing the front brake rotors and rebuilding the rear axle assemblies. The cabin houses a single fixed-back Recaro carbon-fiber bucket seat with head restraints and a Schroth Racing multi-point harness. Safety equipment includes a roll cage with door bars, a window net, and a fire suppression system. A label on the seat shows an expiration date of 2024. The Alcantara-wrapped multifunction steering wheel is mounted to a quick-release hub and features a yellow centering stripe, carbon-fiber inserts, and paddle shifters. A Robic lap timer is secured to the center of the steering wheel, while the dash-mounted Porsche-Cosworth LCD panel displays integrated shift lights and fault diagnostics. The digital odometer indicates 18k kilometers (~11k miles). The naturally aspirated 4.0-liter 9A1.5 flat-six features direct fuel injection and variable cam phasing. Factory-rated output was 485 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque in GT3 Cup specification. An oil change was performed in February 2025. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential gearbox with a limited-slip differential, and the gear oil was changed in February 2025. A skid plate is mounted beneath the engine. The car is not legal for road use and does not have a title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
