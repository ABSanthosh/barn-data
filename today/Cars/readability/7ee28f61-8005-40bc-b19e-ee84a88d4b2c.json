  "text": "If you’re ready to make the leap into the deep end of the simulation racing pool, you’re in the right place.Driving and racing cars in video games may sound juvenile to some, but for most enthusiasts, it’s the closest they’ll ever come to getting behind the wheel of a WRC rally car or a Formula 1 car. Making the move from a controller to even an entry-level wheel already elevates the immersion tenfold, but if you’re serious about improving your racing skills—and have some splurging cash lying around—buying a more advanced wheel and pedal setup is well worth it.So, if you’re ready to take the next step from entry and intermediate-level wheels, we collected a couple of the best options on the market right now.Logitech’s flagship Pro wheel and pedalsExciting things are happening at Logitech. The company has made entry-level wheels like the G923 for years but made the jump to the upper leagues in 2022 with the release of its Pro series wheel and pedals. Since then, the company has released more accessories for the Pro that help build out the Logitech ecosystem.Logitech Pro setupLogitechThe baseThe direct-drive base, which Logitech refers to as the DD11, offers a wrist-spraining 11 newton meters of force feedback—over five times more powerful than the G923—complete with Logitech’s proprietary Trueforce system, which enhances the sensation of small elements on the track like rumble strips and bumps. The wheelConnected to the base through a quick detach mount is the RS Wheel Hub, a modular controller onto which you can mount different kinds of round and formula-inspired steering wheels. Logitech x MOMO Round WheelLogitechLogitech recently launched multiple new wheels for the hub, including a beefy 12-inch round wheel constructed from aluminum and synthetic leather, and an open-top, square-shaped track wheel. The company will also be launching MOMO-constructed and branded wheels soon through a partnership with the Italian wheelmaker.The pedalsLogitech’s Pro pedals offer some major upgrades over their entry-level G923. Out of the box, you get spring-loaded throttle and clutch pedals and a load-cell equipped brake pedal. In the world of advanced sim racing, load cells are considered the pinnacle of pedal tech—and for good reason. They offer a better feel, realism, and adjustability than their spring-loaded counterparts.Logitech Pro PedalsLogitechThat said, even the more common design for the throttle and clutch pedal has room for customization in the Pro pedals, with swappable spring and rubber components that let you adjust the pedal feel to your liking. The pedals are a joy to drive with, but it is slightly disappointing that you still don’t get full-metal construction even in Logitech’s most premium pedal set.The accessoriesLogitech RS Shifter and HandbrakeLogitechFinishing off Logitech’s flagship offering is the addition of their new RS shifter, which can be switched from a sequential shifter to a handbrake. It’s hard to beat yanking on a medal-handled handbrake while approaching a hairpin turn in a rally car, but you still miss out on the full immersion of some cars without a nicer H-pattern shifter from Logitech. While the company sells an older model shifter, most enthusiasts agree that its quality doesn’t match up with the rest of their newer products.The full packageIt’s hard to think of any real shortcomings from Logitech’s Pro series wheel and pedals. Together, they offer an incredibly powerful, precise, and immersive experience—as they should, given the breathtaking price tag. For the base, hub, wheel, and pedals, you can expect to spend between $1,100 and $1,300 depending on whether you’re playing on PC, Xbox, or Playstation. Each separate wheel style costs $70, while the RS shifter costs an additional $150. All that to say, the Pro isn’t a budget-friendly option, but it is a hell of a setup if you can swing the bill. Plus, the Logitech Pro bundle offers better console compatibility than most other high-end sim racing manufacturers, making it hard to beat if you’re an Xbox and Playstation user.Fanatec: the old guard of sim racingIn the world of sim racing, Fanatec is a legendary company. They’ve been around for years making some of the best sim racing kits in the industry, but can often fly under the radar for people just getting into sim racing since they only really make intermediate and advanced wheels.Fanatec Gran Turismo DD Pro BundleFanatecCompared to Logitech, understanding what Fanatec product is right for you can feel like navigating through a jungle. Their product line is not only huge, but hyper-swappable, making it possible for you to pick the exact style base, wheel, pedal, and accessories that you want together. That said, Fanatec’s Gran Turismo DD Pro bundle is a great alternative to the Logitech offering.The baseThe GT DD Pro base offers eight newton meters of direct-drive force feedback with the optional 180W power supply. While it lacks Trueforce-equivalent tech, it still offers standard and advanced tuning menus that let you fine-tune the power and mechanical feel of the force feedback.The wheelAs the name suggests, the wheel is designed by Polyphony Digital specifically for Gran Turismo. The wheel includes both a white OLED display which can be used to tune the force feedback and a diffused LED strip that displays engine RPM.Fanatec Gran Turismo DD Pro WheelFanatecThat said, we aren’t in love with the style of the wheel, which feels decidedly more arcadey than Logitech’s offering. But, the plus side to Fanatec is that any particular component you don’t like can be easily swapped out. The company offers dozens of other wheel options for just about any style of racing you can imagine, although certain wheels can drastically inflate the overall price of the kit.The pedalsThe standard pedal set that comes with the GT DD Pro bundle only includes two spring-loaded pedals, but what most people do is buy the optional CSL load cell pedal kit, which provides you a third pedal with a load cell, just like you get with the Logitech Pro pedal set.Fanatec Gran Turismo DD Pro PedalsFanatecCompared to the Logitech set, the Fanatec pedals are constructed almost entirely from steel, with the exception of the pedal faces which are made of plastic. If you want a full-metal setup, Fanatec sells an optional $35 metal pedal face set.The accessoriesWhere Fanatec really shines are its accessories. The company sells multiple different paddle shift upgrades and handbrakes, as well as a premium dual-use H-pattern/sequential shifter. That said, just about all of them are much more expensive than the Logitech alternative.Clubsport Shifter SQ V1.5FanatecThe full packageFor the GT DD Pro bundle, including the base (with the 180W power supply), wheel, and pedal set (with the load-cell third pedal), you can expect to spend about $950. That’s a tempting price compared to the Logitech, but the discount isn’t for free. With the Fanatec bundle you get a less premium wheel, significantly less force feedback, and less plug-and-play ability across devices and games, particularly on the Xbox.Final thoughtsWhether you go with Logitech, Fanatec, or other brands like Moza and Simagic, you’ll probably be satisfied with most of the higher-end offerings from these different companies. What it really comes down to is compatibility—first with your own preferences and then with the specific games and system you use.If you want to buy a top-tier setup and just drive, the Logitech Pro bundle is probably your best bet. If you’re the type to geek out on sim racing setups though, then the Fanatec, with all of its swappable wheels, pedals, and accessories, is probably the better pathway for you.Regardless of which brand you choose, be ready to open your heart, and your wallet, to the magic of simulation racing.",
