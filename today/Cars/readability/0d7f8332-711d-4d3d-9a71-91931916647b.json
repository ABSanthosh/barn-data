  "text": "The 25% Chicken Tax will prevent Kia from importing and selling the Tasman locally January 30, 2025 at 19:33 by Brad Anderson Don’t get too excited, Kia still has no plans of selling the Tasman in the States. This example of the truck may have landed locally for a promotional photoshoot. Kia says buyers are coming around to the Tasman’s looks, but we’re not convinced. Americans love pickup trucks—always have, always will. After all, the U.S. is practically the birthplace of the modern pickup. Yet, despite its obvious appeal to truck buyers, the Kia Tasman won’t be making its way to American dealerships. Still, at least one example has landed on US soil, and fresh photos of it have surfaced online. This particular Tasman was allegedly spotted at one of Hyundai-Kia’s storage facilities by Reddit user /mmuulin, parked alongside a Hyundai Ioniq 5 and a Kia EV9. It appears to be a well-equipped model, featuring a few extras like a sports bar at the rear, a retractable tonneau cover, and a pair of side steps. Which begs the question; why ship one all the way over here if there’s no plan to sell it? Read: Kia Says Buyers Are Warming Up To Tasman’s Looks We reached out to Kia, but we’ve yet to hear back from them. According to one commentator, the Tasman was recently spotted in the deserts of California for a promotional photoshoot. It’s also possible Kia is taking the opportunity to do some final durability testing for the vehicle before customer deliveries begin in overseas markets this year. The Tasman’s exterior design continues to spark plenty of debate. Some people find it downright ugly, while others argue it’s the kind of ugly that grows on you. “Holy moly the headlights are so ugly, why are the headlights so far apart?” one user wrote. “This is the ugliest truck I’ve ever seen, and I own a Ridgeline,” another said. Kia is well aware that the Tasman’s design has triggered controversy. However, during a recent interview with Australian media, the brand’s local general manager said customers are coming around to the unconventional looks, particularly after seeing the truck in the flesh and spending time with it. Kia Tasman: 5 Things You Need To Know About The Polarizing Pickup As for why the Tasman won’t be sold stateside? You can thank the infamous Chicken Tax, a 25% tariff on imported trucks. If Kia wanted to offer the Tasman in the States, it would need to build it domestically, a move that would require significant investment. For now, at least, American truck buyers will have to admire (or mock) it from afar. Lead image Reddit u/mmuulin",
