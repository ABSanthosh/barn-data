  "description": "Mumbai’s outskirts transformed into a high-octane playground as Venomotorsportz hosted Dirt Blazers 2025. The latest edition of the autocross event, held at Venom Moto Park, featured everything from rally-bred sedans to hardcore SUVs. Driving a Volkswagen Polo GT TSI, Kartik Konchady set the fastest time of the day, along with taking victory in the 1651 to 2000cc class. Also in attendance as a special guest was Sanjay Takale, who made history earlier this year as the first Indian driver to complete the Dakar Rally. Jhanvi Bhavsar wins in Ladies Open class Fahad Kutty wins in SUV Open class Dirt Blazers 2025 results Rather than an outright race to the chequered flag, the autocross format requires participants to navigate through a predetermined obstacle course and complete it in the fastest possible time. Events like these play a crucial role in increasing accessibility to motorsport, and Dirt Blazers is a testament to India’s growing off-road racing culture. The competition featured eight classes, each designed to test different calibres of cars and drivers. Ladies Open winner: Jhanvi Bhavsar The Ladies Open class took centre stage first. Jhanvi Bhavsar (also driving a Polo GT TSI) lit up the track with a rapid run of 2 minutes and 36.281 seconds, setting the fastest time in the class. Close on her heels were Ashrafi Gaikwad and Natasha Duggal, all with clean, penalty-free laps. SUV Open winner: Fahad Kutty One of the most talked-about sights of the day was the wave of modified Maruti Jimnys – lifted and trail-tuned, they dominated the SUV Open class with flair. Fahad Kutty topped in this category with a blistering time of 2 minutes and 36.143 seconds, outpacing veterans like Shanawaz Khader and Mihir Dharkar in a hotly contested session. 800 to 1100cc winner: Nitish Chaudhari The 800cc to 1100cc class saw Nitish Chaudhari steal the show with a flying lap time of 2 minutes and 27.256 seconds. Kaustubh Pitale was second, followed by Devang Kenia. 1101 to 1400cc winner: Kushal Chaudhari The 1101 to 1400cc class was a playground for precision. Kushal Chaudhari was the undisputed maestro here, carving out a winning time of 2 minutes and 20.815 seconds behind the wheel of a Maruti Suzuki Swift. He was followed closely by Fahad Kutty, who proved his versatility across categories. 1401 to 1650cc winner: Devang Kenia Only two participants competed in this class. Devang Kenia won with a clean run of 3 minutes and 11.372 seconds, followed by Amit Chavan. 1651 to 2000 cc winner: Kartik Konchady Konchady was the man to beat in the 1651 to 2000cc class, clocking a time of 2 minutes and 18.401 seconds – not just the fastest in his class but across all classes. Pitale was second, followed by Chavan. Amateur Open winner: Raj Kadam In the Amateur Open class, the spirit of grassroots racing burned bright. Raj Kadam delivered a composed lap of 2 minutes and 27.342 seconds to take victory ahead of Virendra Mestry and Priyesh Jaiswal. Unrestricted Open winners: Mihir Dharkar, Kushal Chaudhari Unrestricted Open class, Mihir Dharkar stormed to the top in the 4-wheeler segment with a time of 2 minutes and 35.464 seconds. Adding to his victory tally, Chaudhari was fastest in the 2-wheeler class as well, with a blistering run of 2 minutes and 23.551 seconds. He just about edged out Konchady (2 minutes and 23.980 seconds) and Kutty (2 minutes and 25.354 seconds) in a nail-biting finish. Also see: J A Motorsport builds India’s first cross car",
