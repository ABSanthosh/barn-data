  "description": "The Renault Triber facelift has been spied testing with substantial styling changes on the front end. Renault India MD and CEO Venkatram Mamillapalle confirmed earlier this year that the Kiger and Triber would receive facelifts later in 2025, and a newly-spotted test mule of the updated sub-4-metre MPV suggests that it may sport a bevy of design tweaks.

Inside, the Triber facelift’s dashboard is expected to receive mild design tweaks, lighter shades, more soft-touch materials and an expanded features list, much like the refreshed Nissan Magnite that went on sale last year. 2025 Renault Triber facelift engine and gearbox No major mechanical changes anticipated On the powertrain front, we expect the Triber facelift to carry on with the current model’s 1.0-litre naturally aspirated three-cylinder petrol unit that generates 72hp and 96Nm. Gearbox options will most likely be the same as well, comprising a 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT.
