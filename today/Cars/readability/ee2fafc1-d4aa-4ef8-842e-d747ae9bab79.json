While I invest the majority of my disposable income in one type of riding, I keep an older machine or two around for when I feel like cosplaying as a canyon carver or a bagger guy. I think it’s the attainable version of the different bike for every day of the week sort of dream, but you’d go broke keeping enough gear on the shelf to look the part every time. Or would you? SMK Helmets sent us over one of their Retro full-face helmets a few months back, and based on the MSRP of this throwback lid, just $149.99, I knew we were looking at an intriguing proposition. What’s in a Name Stateside, the SMK name can get lost in the sea of three-letter helmet manufacturers, and while their products have only been available here since 2023, you should probably get used to hearing it. SMK claims to be the largest helmet manufacturer in the world, and its parent company, STUDDS, traces its roots all the way back to a small garage in India in 1972. SMK has a lineup of 12 models available for the U.S., all of which go easy on the pocketbook. I spec’d out the Retro full-face in the solid-white colorway, but was surprised to find it’s actually a frosty pearlescent when I removed it from the velvety drawstring. My XL weighed in at 3.5 lbs [1,588 g], placing it right in the middle of the road, and the fit and finish on the helmet is good other than a few minor niggles. The chrome accents and tan and chocolate color of the hypoallergenic liner are stellar touches for the price, and mesh, circular vents give it unique character in the throwback scene. How’s the Fit In reading up on the SMK Retro, I expected the fit to be an area of contention. It’s been said that the company uses just two shells to accommodate sizes from XS to XL for the Retro model, and you should expect it to run small. To the 2X, guys, I offer my condolences. My head measures 24 inches [61 cm], which puts me at the top end of the XL range. If there was a problem with the shell size, I would have found it. The intermediate oval fit is quite good, roomy in fact, especially in the crown of my head. There was also great coverage in the chinbar area, which is surprising, given that throwback helmets often leave your chin out in the breeze. The interior of the Retro looks nice and feels even nicer. The hypoallergenic liner feels premium, and the chocolaty faux leather trimmings feel like they were pulled from a helmet three times the price. The washable, three-piece liner is easily removed, exposing the multi-density EPS absorption material, and the exterior is made from impact-resistant thermoplastic. The model carries both DOT and ECE 22.05 certifications. Other Features Getting into the nuts and bolts of this thing, we have to talk about the shield. The pivot and detent features of the SMK Retro take place within the big bullseye on the sides of the helmet, and you can customize the colored inserts or ditch the shield entirely with supplied inserts if riding in glasses is your thing. The shield has two open detent positions, and while it lacks a positive latch in the shut position, engagement of the spring-loaded detents has good feel. The shield opening has a chrome strip within its rubber edging that complements the trim along the helmet’s opening, and while I expected some serious draft around the shield, that simply wasn’t the case. It’s also Pinlock 70 compatible, and SMK supplied a clear anti-fog insert with helped alleviate the fogging I experienced on hot, humid days. Finally, SMK relies on the tried-and-true double-D ring system to affix this thing to your noggin, and while it’s arguably the most secure system, I’d love to see the Retro graduate to something quick-release in its next iteration. The strap was also on the thin side in my opinion, which led to some fumbling with the D rings the first time I pulled it on, but I did appreciate the inclusion of a magnet for retaining the tail of the strap when you’re locked in. On the Open Road At 79°F and 62% humidity, I knew my first ride in the Retro would be the most telling, especially since the helmet lacks exhaust ventilation like many of its throwback counterparts. The porthole vents were more or less up to the task, but I did notice less airflow in the chinbar, which led to fogging without the Pinlock lens installed. The forehead vents, however, performed admirably, and, overall, the helmet didn’t feel hot compared to a black riding jacket. Visibility through the shield was great, and the wind intrusion wasn’t excessive at highway speeds and beyond, even when pointing my head perpendicular to my direction of travel. The center tab on the shield was easy to operate after I stopped looking for it on the left-hand side, and I found the two open detent positions to be more than adequate. I mentioned the Pinlock 70 anti-fog lens SMK included with the Retro helmet, and installing it makes a world of difference. You can watch fog develop in the area around the Pinlock, but your field of vision remains unobscured, even with all the heavy breathing I could muster. However, while installing the Pinlock, I encountered an issue with the shield’s design. You remove the shield by unthreading the center of the bullseyes with a supplied tool, and then the shield pops out. At this point, you can see two small ball bearings that make the detent positions work, and they’re spring-loaded behind the black inserts. The issue is that the ball bearings aren’t really retained in the insert, and when I took the lens off, one shot off onto the shop floor, never to be seen again. The other three ball bearings stayed in place, and the detents still worked more or less as intended, but I was curious why this happened. I took the helmet apart once more to install the shield-delete inserts (you’d use these for riding with glasses instead of the shield) and found the other ball bearing popped out as well. This system needs some revising, because you stand a good chance of losing these ball bearings anytime you want to remove your shield, or change the colored inserts in the helmet—which SMK encourages you to customize. So if you own the Retro and plan on taking any of this apart, I’d encourage you to work on a clear table with a drop cloth. Conclusions I was looking for the catch throughout all my time with the SMK Retro helmet. It works quite well on the open road, carries DOT and ECE certs and has some really nice features—all for $150. That’s exactly half of what you’d pay for the most affordable helmets in the retro scene, and something like 3/10s of what the flagship models are getting. While the ball bearing detent system needs work, my helmet still functions as intended, and I bet they’d warranty the insert if I asked. While there are things that could be improved, the SMK Retro is a great-looking, comfortable option for budget-minded riders looking for a stylish throwback lid. It gets way more compliments than you’d ever expect from a budget helmet, and I’m sure it’ll remain in my rotation for many miles to come. Price $149.99 | Sizes XS to XL | Certification ECE22.05 and DOT | More",

The porthole vents were more or less up to the task, but I did notice less airflow in the chinbar, which led to fogging without the Pinlock lens installed.

It works quite well on the open road, carries DOT and ECE certs and has some really nice features—all for $150. That’s exactly half of what you’d pay for the most affordable helmets in the retro scene, and something like 3/10s of what the flagship models are getting.
