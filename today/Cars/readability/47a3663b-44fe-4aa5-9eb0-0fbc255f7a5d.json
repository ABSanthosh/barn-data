  "description": "This 1934 Packard Super Eight was delivered new with five-passenger Club Sedan coachwork and is said to have been re-bodied in the 1940s in a pickup-style configuration. After a period of long-term storage, the car was purchased in 2003 by its current owner, who commissioned a multi-year refurbishment that included the fabrication of bodywork incorporating styling cues from Packard boattail speedster designs of 1932 and 1934. Finished in two-tone green, the car is powered by a 385ci L-head inline-eight that was overhauled during the project and is paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Additional features include mechanically actuated four-wheel drum brakes with adjustable vacuum assistance, adjustable ride-control suspension, green-painted 17” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a tan convertible top, and tan leather upholstery over two-place seating. This boattail-bodied 11th-series Super Eight is now offered on dealer consignment in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with photos from its refurbishment, a pair of spare tire covers, and a clean Maryland title.",

After a period of long-term storage, the car was purchased in 2003 by its current owner, who commissioned a multi-year refurbishment that included the fabrication of bodywork incorporating styling cues from Packard boattail speedster designs of 1932 and 1934. Finished in two-tone green, the car is powered by a 385ci L-head inline-eight that was overhauled during the project and is paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Additional features include mechanically actuated four-wheel drum brakes with adjustable vacuum assistance, adjustable ride-control suspension, green-painted 17” wire wheels, dual side-mount spares, a tan convertible top, and tan leather upholstery over two-place seating. This boattail-bodied 11th-series Super Eight is now offered on dealer consignment in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with photos from its refurbishment, a pair of spare tire covers, and a clean Maryland title. A boattail rear profile first appeared in Packard styling on the 1930 Speedster Runabout and was later incorporated into an experimental design penned by then-newly appointed Head of Design Ed Macauley between 1932 and 1933. For the 11th-series lineup of 1934, LeBaron’s custom Packard offerings added style 275, a boattailed Speedster Runabout available on the 135”-wheelbase Twelve platform with a list price topping all Packard selections at $7,746. Four examples of the original LeBaron Speedster Runabout were built. This example’s bodywork incorporates styling cues from both Macauley’s design and the LeBaron Speedster Runabout, while also adding custom design choices. Wearing a custom pickup body when purchased by its current owner, this series 1104 Super Eight’s 142″-wheelbase chassis was refurbished between 2003 and 2006 before its current coachwork was fabricated between 2006 and 2015. Built by Jim Hery of Chalfont Motor Car Company in Belfast, Tennessee, the body consists of seasoned ash wood framework wrapped in hand-formed metal panels that are finished in dark green with pale green accents. Mahogony running boards were also fabricated during the build, while additional features include chrome bumpers, a low-cut V-shaped windshield with wind wings, body-color thermostatically controlled grille shutters, a Goddess of Speed radiator mascot, rear wheel spats, and a tan convertible top that can be stowed under a metal tonneau panel. Green-painted wire wheels wear bright hubcaps and beauty rings and are wrapped in 7.00-17 Lester tires, as are matching dual side-mount spares. Braking is handled mechanically by drums painted in pale green at all four wheels with servo assistance that can be adjusted in intensity via a switch on the dashboard. The cockpit was trimmed between 2023 and 2024 and houses a split bench seat for two wrapped in tan tufted leather with color-matched upholstery over the door panels. Features include tan carpeting, wood trim lining the top of the seatback, dual gloveboxes, and a locking golf club door on the left quarter panel. The three-spoke steering wheel sits to the left of an instrument panel housing a Waltham drum-style speedometer, a clock, and gauges monitoring oil pressure, fuel level, coolant temperature, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 34k miles, approximately 25 of which have been added under current ownership. The fuel-level gauge and clock do not work. The 385ci L-head straight-eight breathes through a single Stromberg downdraft carburetor, while spark is provided by dual coils. Output was factory rated at 145 horsepower at 3,200 rpm. During a 2006 engine overhaul, the block was bored, honed, and resurfaced, the crankshaft was polished, the connecting rods were reconditioned with replacement babbitt bearings, and the pistons were replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission. Suspension at each end incorporates leaf-sprung solid axles with double-acting hydraulic lever-arm shock absorbers that can be adjusted for firmness via the Ride Control knob under the dash. The car also features a Bjiur automatic lubrication system. Engine number 753149 is shown stamped on the block above and is listed as the car’s identification number on the title. Chassis number 766199 is stamped on the reproduction chassis tag, which also notes Chalfont Motor Car Company in the “delivered by” field.
