The car was acquired by the current owner in 2022 and now has 7k miles. This 765LT Spider is now offered on dealer consignment in Canada with Quebec registration. The 765LT “Longtail” is a track-focused variant of the 720S and utilizes a carbon-fiber Monocage II monocoque with an extruded aluminum subframe, revised aerodynamics, and thinner-gauge glass. This example is finished in MSO Gloss Sherwood Black and outfitted with the Exterior Carbon Fiber Pack 1, Stealth Pack, and Black Pack. Additional features include an electrochromic glass roof, a double-glazed engine window, LED lighting, soft-close dihedral doors, and an active rear spoiler with an air brake and an automatic Drag Reduction System. The 19″ and 20″ LT 10-spoke Super-Lightweight forged wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 305/30 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. The double-wishbone independent suspension features McLaren active damping, while the 765LT was equipped with a stiffened steering torsion bar and a quicker rack compared to the 720S. Stopping power is provided by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers that are finished in McLaren Orange with black script and fitted over carbon-ceramic rotors. The car is equipped with a vehicle-lift system. The cockpit features super-lightweight carbon-fiber racing seats and is trimmed in bespoke Carbon Black and Natural Tan Alcantara. Amenities include McLaren Track Telemetry with a lap timer and three cameras as well as a rearview camera, a Bowers \u0026 Wilkins sound system, carbon-fiber trim, and an 8″ touchscreen infotainment system. The Alcantara-wrapped carbon-fiber steering wheel frames a configurable digital display that folds flat to expose simplified instrumentation including a digital tachometer, gear indicator, and speedometer. The odometer indicates 7k miles. A plaque affixed to the driver-side door jamb identifies the car as #635 of 765 examples produced. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 4.0L M840T V8 features a titanium quad-outlet exhaust system as well as a higher-capacity fuel pump, forged aluminum pistons, and a three-layer head gasket shared with the Senna. Factory-rated output was 755 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque, a 45-horsepower increase over the 720S. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch SSG automatic transaxle. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Quebec registration, which serves as the ownership document in Quebec, Canada.
