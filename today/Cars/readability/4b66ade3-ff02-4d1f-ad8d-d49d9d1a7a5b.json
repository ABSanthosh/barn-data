  "description": "Plans for the Indian Superbike League have been announced and organisers aiming for the new series to debut in October 2025. The series will feature a grid of all-Indian riders, with an aim to give racers a platform where they can gain the necessary experience before stepping up to international racing. 1.    Five classes for pros and amateurs 2.    Races to be held at permanent tracks 3.    Ducati confirmed as one of the bike suppliers Indian Superbike League format The inaugural season of the Indian Superbike League will feature seven franchise-based teams. Each team will have five riders across different classes – Pro, Amateur, Female Riders and Rookie. Ducati has been confirmed as one of the bike suppliers for the league, which has been sanctioned by the FMSCI (Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India). Indian Superbike League Director Sirish Vissa revealed to Autocar India that the series is also looking at Indian manufacturers for some of the classes. Rider registrations are open online and the league says 400 riders have already signed up. The League will be working with existing riding academies in the country to select and sort the riders for the various classes. “They are used to working with riders, spotting talent, and so on. So, we are going to leverage their expertise to do some of this,” said Vissa. For the initial years, the series will feature a grid of only Indian riders. However, international riders and experts will be brought in to train not just riders, but also technicians and crew members. “There is palpable interest in two-wheelers across the country, especially in tier-II, tier-III cities. The Indian Superbike League will be a sustainable career path not just for racers, but for the whole ecosystem of motorcycle racing,” Vissa added. “We wish to create a framework that can take their interest, professionalise their ambitions, and lay out a pathway for them to move up the ladder and compete both nationally and internationally. We intend to promote not just local, but also marginalised talent in all aspects of racing. Our vision is to cultivate a cultural change in the ecosystem by supporting riders, improving technical knowhow, and elevating standards of Indian motorsports.” Indian Superbike League calendar Plans are in place for the league to make its debut in October 2025. For now, three rounds are planned in Chennai, Bengaluru and Pune. Further details regarding the exact venues will be announced in the future. But at least for the initial seasons, the league will only race on permanent tracks. So it is very likely that the debut round will be held at the Madras International Circuit.
