  "description": "New VLE can travel from Stuttgart to Rome with two rapid-charging stops Mercedes-Benz is putting the finishing touches to the VLE, the first in a new wave of electric vans that will arrive next year as part of a new-look V-Class range. It is based on Mercedes’ new Van Electric Architecture (VAN.EA) and will be a more focused proposition than the existing V-Class, which is based on the Vito van. Essentially a van equivalent to the E-Class saloon, it will be positioned under the more opulent VLS that Mercedes refers to as a ‘grand limousine’, and instead target large families and taxi firms. The VLE is currently being tested ahead of its launch, which is expected to take place next year. Much of the work has focused on validating the van’s efficiency and performance, with the most recent test – a run from Stuttgart in Germany to Rome in Italy, crossing the Alps – investigating its endurance. Mercedes said its test engineers drove according to “normal operation” on the road and the cabin was air conditioned to 22deg C for the entire route. The vehicle completed the drive in 13 hours, stopping twice – for 15min at a time – to recharge. Given the total route is 683 miles long, that points to a real-world range of around 250 to 300 miles, although Mercedes has yet to disclose an official figure. “Our future MPVs have once again impressively demonstrated their suitability for everyday use,” said Andreas Zygan, head of development for Mercedes-Benz Vans. In addition to eight-seat MPVs, the VLE is also expected to spawn various specialised versions, such as an electric counterpart to the Marco Polo camper.",
