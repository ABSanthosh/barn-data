  "description": "This 1994 Porsche 911 Speedster is one of 936 examples produced between 1992 and 1994, just 427 of which were built for the US market. The car was sold new to seven-time National League MVP winner and Major League Baseball home-run record holder Barry Bonds, for whom it was converted into a steel-bodied Mega Speedster by tuner Vittorio Strosek. It was purchased by the current owner in 2021 and subsequently sent to Germany, where it was modified by the seller, Evomax, with carbon-Kevlar bodywork and a custom white leather interior. Finished in Meissen Blue, the car is powered by an M64 flat-six that was reportedly built to a displacement of 3.8 liters by Andial at the time of the Strosek build. Additional features include a six-speed manual transaxle, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes with Big Red calipers, adjustable KW coilover suspension, staggered-width 18” multipiece wheels, an HJS exhaust system, a cream-color convertible top, Porsche 918 carbon-fiber seats, air conditioning, power windows, and a Bluetooth sound system. This Evomax Speedster was brought back to the US in 2024 and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in San Clemente, California with documentation from previous ownership, owner’s manuals, early-2000s calendars featuring the car, and a clean California title.",

This Evomax Speedster was brought back to the US in 2024 and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in San Clemente, California with documentation from previous ownership, owner’s manuals, early-2000s calendars featuring the car, and a clean California title. The 964-based Speedster was introduced in late 1992 and featured standard-width bodywork with a twin-hump convertible-top tonneau panel and a lower, more-raked windshield than that of the contemporary cabriolet. The previous Strosek widebody bodywork on this example was replaced in 2022 during the build by Evomax. The carbon-Kevlar bodywork is finished in Meissen Blue with matte black side stripes and “Evomax” script. Among design touches are flared fenders with ducts behind each wheel, a ducktail rear spoiler, LED headlights in black housings, body-color side mirrors, and exposed carbon-Kevlar aerodynamic elements including a chin spoiler, side skirts, and a rear diffuser. A cream-color convertible top can be stowed beneath a body-color “double bubble” cover panel. Note that the majority of the listing photos were taken in Germany in May 2024, and approximately 400 miles have since been added. Multipiece Fuchs-style wheels are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport tires measuring 225/40 up front and 285/30 at the rear. Stopping is handled by power-assisted, anti-lock disc brakes featuring cross-drilled and ventilated rotors and Big Red calipers. KW coilovers were installed during the Evomax build. The cabin houses a pair of Porsche 918 carbon-fiber bucket seats that are trimmed in white leather with “Evomax” script embossed on the headrests. Color-matched upholstery covers the console, dashboard fascia, and rear shelf, while light gray trim accents the upper dashboard, sills, exposed carbon-composite door panels, and front compartment. Additional features include gray square-weave carpeting, leather door pull straps, woven door pockets, air conditioning, power windows, and a Bluetooth sound system. Wrapped in gray leather, the steering wheel features an Evomax-branded hub and sits ahead of instrumentation including a 7k-pm tachometer, a 180-mph speedometer, a Quartz clock, and gauges monitoring fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and fuel temperature. The six-digit odometer shows approximately 500 miles, and total mileage is unknown. The M64 flat-six was reportedly modified by Andial to displace 3.8 liters early in the car’s life. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle. An HJS Motorsports exhaust system was added during the Evomax build. A collection of paperwork that accompanies the car includes a copy of a previous title in Barry Bonds’s name, photos of the car with its Strosek body, and invoices from previous ownership. The Carfax report notes unspecified damage in March 2004 and lists several mileage reports, the most recent of which reflects approximately 35k miles in October 2020. The car cannot pass an emissions test, therefore it cannot be sold to a California private party buyer. The California title carries a “Title Only” notation.
