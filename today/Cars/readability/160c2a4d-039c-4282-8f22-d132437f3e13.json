  "description": "This 1958 Lancia Aurelia B24S is one of 521 convertibles built during three years of production and was purchased in 1976 by Dr. Raymond Boniface, who retained it as part of his Italian car collection until his 2020 passing. Chassis 1502 was then purchased by a collector in Italy who in turn sold it to its current owner. Finished in ivory over red leather, the car is powered by a 2,451cc V6 that breathes through a single Weber carburetor and is paired with a replacement four-speed manual transaxle. Additional equipment includes sliding-pillar front suspension, a De Dion rear axle, a removable hardtop finished in black, and a black convertible top. A Lion Award winner at the 2016 Concours d’Elegance of America, this B24S was listed on BaT in December 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Bari, Italy, with a tool kit and Italian registration that lists the car as a 1959 model.",

Chassis 1502 was then purchased by a collector in Italy who in turn sold it to its current owner. Finished in ivory over red leather, the car is powered by a 2,451cc V6 that breathes through a single Weber carburetor and is paired with a replacement four-speed manual transaxle. Additional equipment includes sliding-pillar front suspension, a De Dion rear axle, a removable hardtop finished in black, and a black convertible top. A Lion Award winner at the 2016 Concours d’Elegance of America, this B24S was listed on BaT in December 2024 and is now offered on dealer consignment in Bari, Italy, with a tool kit and Italian registration that lists the car as a 1959 model. The Aurelia convertible replaced the B24 Spider in 1956 and was differentiated from its predecessor by roll-up side windows, a conventional windshield with fixed quarter vents, larger doors with exterior handles, a single-piece front bumper, and a widened hood scoop. Offered solely in left-hand drive, the model shared its mechanical underpinnings with the contemporary fifth- and sixth-series B20 coupe while riding on a wheelbase 8” shorter than that of its closed counterpart. This example’s Pininfarina-designed bodywork was repainted in ivory, reportedly the original shade, following the current owner’s purchase. The car is equipped with a removable hardtop finished in black as well as a black convertible top, and additional features include a driver-side mirror, a lockable fuel-filler door, turn signals beneath the rear bumper, and dual exhaust outlets. Steel wheels wear bright hubcaps and beauty rings and are mounted with 165R400 Michelin X tires. Stopping is handled by hydraulic drum brakes with inboard rear units. The cabin is trimmed in red leather, and areas of wear and cracking are present on the seats. Color-matched trim covers the door panels, rear center tunnel, and rear storage cubby, while tan carpeting covers the sills, front center tunnel, and rear shelf. Additional features include a floor-mounted shifter, a lockable glovebox, a radio blanking plate, and a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror. A dustpan, broom, and bin are mounted inside the passenger-side footwell, while a collapsible military shovel is stowed in the trunk. The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color dash housing Jaeger instrumentation including a tachometer with an inset clock and a 150-mph speedometer with inset auxiliary displays. The five-digit odometer shows 50k miles, around 300 of which have been added under current ownership. The 2,451cc V6 is an evolution of the Francesco de Virgilio design that made the Aurelia the first series-produced car with V6 power. Characteristics include an aluminum block with a 60° angle between cylinder banks, aluminum cylinder heads with hemispherical combustion chambers, and pushrod-actuated overhead valves. Induction is through a single Weber downdraft carburetor that is said to have been rebuilt in preparation for the sale and is fed through a dual-snorkel air intake. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a replacement split-case four-speed manual transaxle unit that carries the clutch and inboard rear drum brake assemblies. The sliding-pillar independent front suspension comprises coil springs and adjustable shocks contained in oil around vertical pins anchored to either end of a beam axle. The De Dion rear suspension is equipped with leaf springs and tubular shock absorbers. A later-style exhaust system is said to have been fitted under previous ownership. The vehicle is being sold on its Italian registration, which serves as an ownership document in Italy. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
