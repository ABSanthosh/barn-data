  "text": "The site of the crash is where a fatal accident happened years ago; thankfully, these two lived to tell the tale June 28, 2025 at 21:01 by Stephen Rivers Two drivers wrecked out in California, after what police say was a drag race. The pair now both lose their muscle cars for a month and face serious charges. The crash happened at the same spot as a fatal accident over a decade ago. It’s all fun and games until your muscle car ends up in an orchard. The Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro are longtime rivals. They’ve battled it out on drag strips, road circuits, and ovals for decades. In less legal spaces, owners have pitted them against each other countless times. A few nights ago, in such a competition, both lost, and their owners won a second chance after learning a lesson the hard way. According to the California Highway Police in Modesto, a Camaro driver was racing a Mustang on Stoddard Road. Officers say they observed the race and the near-tragic finale. Evidently, the two cars approached Pirrone Road and attempted to turn onto it. “The driver of the Camaro could not negotiate the turn at Pirrone Road, causing them to crash into a nearby orchard,” CHP said. More: Clout Chaser’s Reckless Crash Wreaks Havoc In Boston Tunnel Officers arrested the drivers and didn’t mention any injuries, so hopefully they are perfectly fine. Both the Chevy and the Ford are officially impounded for 30 days, though. What’s notable is that officers found that the Camaro had a license plate hiding device. That’s a huge issue for California and other states, as we’ve reported in the past. Authorities seized it and its remote control as evidence in the case. It’s unclear exactly what changes each driver is facing but the impound fees alone will be significant. Not only will it cost the drivers just to get the cars out of the lot, but they rack up additional daily charges for each day they sit there. Perhaps the wildest part of this whole thing is that the scene has seen tragedy before. Near the light pole at the intersection, it’s easy to see a memorial cross. Placed there for Pedro Melo, a man who died behind the wheel in 2014, it’s a stark reminder of the dangers present on the road. These two drivers might be facing serious charges and a loss of their ride for a month, but they can at least take comfort in the fact that it could’ve been much, much worse. Credit: CHP Modesto",
