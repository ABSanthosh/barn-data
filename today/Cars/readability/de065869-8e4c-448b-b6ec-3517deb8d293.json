  "description": "This 1966 Ferrari 330 GTC is the fourth of 598 examples built between 1966 and 1968 and was sold new in July 1966 to Carrozzeria Pininfarina for use as a design study. Chassis 8727 was subsequently modified by the Turin design house with experimental features including \"Supervis\" pop-up driving lights, hood vents in lieu of fender vents, cloth upholstery, directional dashboard vents, and other aesthetic and functional changes. After the implementation of the design changes, the car was reportedly driven by Sergio Pininfarina before being sold to a Milanese owner in 1967 and passed through two additional Italian stewards before being imported to the US in the 1970s. It was purchased in the 1980s by a pair of California owners who undertook a multi-decade refurbishment that included reinstating the Speciale fog lights before a repaint in the factory shade of Blu Scuro and a re-trim of the interior in tan leather. Following its completion in 2002, the car was sold in 2006 to a collector who retained it until 2023, when it was purchased by the seller. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 that is topped by triple Weber carburetors and is paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, 14” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, and a Becker Grand Prix stereo. This 330 GTC is said to be one of four produced with Speciale features for the 1966 model year and is now offered in Dallas, Texas, with a Marcel Massini report, invoices from current ownership, and a clean Montana title in the seller’s LLC.",

Additional features include servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, 14” Borrani wire wheels, power windows, and a Becker Grand Prix stereo. This 330 GTC is said to be one of four produced with Speciale features for the 1966 model year and is now offered in Dallas, Texas, with a Marcel Massini report, invoices from current ownership, and a clean Montana title in the seller’s LLC. The 330 GTC was introduced at the 1966 Geneva Auto Show with Pininfarina styling combining front-end cues taken from the 500 Superfast and a rounded rear profile from the 275 GTS while sharing the 275 GTB’s 2,400mm wheelbase. Design details include split front and rear bumpers, circular sail-panel vents, and fender vents, the latter of which were removed from this example during Pininfarina’s design study in favor of louvered hood vents that later appeared on the production 365 GTC. Bodywork revisions made by Pininfarina also included the addition of pop-up “super vision” driving lights as seen on the 365 California Spyder as well as the introduction of a countersunk nose badge and the deletion of model-specific badging from the rear. By the early 1980s, the car had been repainted silver, with its fog lamps removed and sheet metal plugs welded into the nose in their place. Replacement fog lamps are said to have been fabricated based on templates from a 365 California with assistance from coachbuilder Steve Moal during the refurbishment performed between the 1980s and 2002. The body was repainted in the factory shade of Blu Scuro during the project. The driving light lift motor was repaired in July 2024. Chrome Borrani wire wheels are secured by three-eared knock-offs and were mounted with 205VR14 Michelin XWX tires in 2022. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted disc brakes with three-piston calipers at each corner. The Pininfarina-installed blue cloth upholstery was replaced with black leather prior to the 1980s-2002 refurbishment, during which the cabin was re-trimmed in tan leather. Design elements distinct to the car include adjustable dual round vents atop the dashboard, lever-type quarter-window opening and closing mechanisms, an ashtray recessed into the console, a passenger-side door safety lock, dual heater control levers, revised window switches, and revised clothes hooks. Additional features include tan carpeting, power windows, and a Becker Grand Prix stereo. The driver-side window wiring was repaired in July 2024. The steering wheel and hub are also said to be unique to the car and sit ahead of Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline, and gauges monitoring oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 45k kilometers (~28k miles), approximately 2,500 of which have been added under current ownership. The 4.0-liter Tipo 209 V12 incorporates single overhead camshafts, triple Weber carburetors, and twin Marelli distributors. The engine is said to have been overhauled in the 1990s. Work performed by Bob Smith Coachworks in Dallas, Texas, between 2022 and 2023 included rebuilds of the carburetors, fuel pump, and water pump, while service in July 2024 included an oil change and replacement of the spark plugs. Power is transferred to the rear wheels via a torque tube and a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch master cylinder was replaced during the July 2024 service. Four-wheel independent suspension incorporates double wishbones, coil springs, and tubular shock absorbers all around. The Massini report lists features including the blue cloth interior upholstery and the pop-up driving lights as well as the car’s sale to Carrozzeria Pininfarina on July 18, 1966.
