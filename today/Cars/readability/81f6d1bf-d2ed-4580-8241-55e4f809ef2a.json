  "text": "BMW is creating an entire central nervous system for its Neue Klasse range of electric cars 1 hour ago by Sam D. Smith BMW‘s Neue Klasse vehicles will get four superbrains, starting with the new iX3 electric SUV. The superbrains control drive and feel, autonomous driving, infotainment, and other functions. Smart e-fuses replace traditional fuses to improve power distribution and increase efficiency. Last month, BMW introduced the Neue Klasse Vision vehicle to us — a preview of what to expect tech-wise from the German brand’s upcoming range of new-generation EVs. One of the headlining features of the Vision vehicle’s tech was the “Heart of Joy” superbrain that controlled how its future EVs drive and feel. Fast forward to now, and BMW has unveiled three additional control units for the upcoming iX3, which was confirmed today for a September debut. These will all be part of a whole new “digital nervous system” set to power every Neue Klasse model. Along with the Heart of Joy, one superbrain will be dedicated to autonomous driving, another will manage BMW’s Panoramic iDrive (aka, infotainment), and a third will manage the remaining ancillary functions, such as lighting and climate control. See: 2026 BMW iX3 Neue Klasse Renders Patents Into Reality To make this happen, BMW has crammed an insanely powerful central computing system into their next-gen cars, claiming it’s 20 times more powerful than what’s in their current lineup. They’ve also put considerable thought into the wiring that connects these digital masterminds. Enter their “zonal wiring harness architecture”, essentially a fancy way of saying they’ve simplified the car’s internal wiring by dividing it into four zones: front, center, rear, and roof. The result? A reduction of 600 meters of wiring and a 30% savings in weight. Less bulk, more efficiency. Smarter Power Management In addition to beefed-up computing, BMW is also replacing 150 traditional fuses with something called digital ‘smart e-fuses.’ These aren’t just fancy circuit breakers; they actively manage power distribution to improve energy use by 20%. In other words, your BMW will be smarter about when and where it uses power — whether it’s driving, parked, or charging. Welcome to the world of intelligent energy management. On top of that, BMW is going all-in on over-the-air software updates. With more than 1,000 software modules, 20GB of software, and a staggering 500 million lines of code, future BMWs will essentially be software-defined vehicles. That means no more waiting for the dealership to install the latest updates; your car will simply upgrade itself. Looking ahead, BMW’s long-term strategy is to keep developing in-house where it matters — like driving dynamics and infotainment — but partner with top-tier software companies for less brand-defining tech. They’ve also built an in-house software development powerhouse with over 10,000 engineers, ensuring they stay ahead of the game.",
