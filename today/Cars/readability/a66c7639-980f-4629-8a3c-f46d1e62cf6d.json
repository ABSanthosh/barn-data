  "text": "GM EV sales have hit an important milestone as the company gears up to launch an assortment of new models 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier General Motors is one of the key proponents of electric vehicles and the automaker has sold over 300,000 of them in the United States since 2016. In the third quarter, they placed second in the EV sales race thanks to strong demand for the Cadillac Lyriq as well as the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV. GM has an assortment of EVs on the horizon including a new Chevrolet Bolt as well as an assortment of Cadillacs. The electric revolution has been slower than many automakers had expected, but momentum continues to build. That’s clear as General Motors has announced they have sold over 300,000 EVs in the United States since the Chevrolet Bolt was launched in late 2016. While that particular model is no longer with us, GM’s electric vehicle lineup has exploded in the past few years as the company has launched the Cadillac Lyriq as well as a host of Chevys including the Blazer EV, Equinox EV, and Silverado EV. They’re joined by the GMC Sierra EV and Hummer EV lineup. More: 2025 Chevy Blazer EV Gains Entry-Level FWD And High-Performance SS Models GM no longer releases monthly sales numbers, but they delivered more than 32,000 EVs in the United States during the third quarter. That was a quarter-over-quarter increase of 46% and a 60% improvement from last year. The Lyriq has been leading the way with year-to-date sales of 20,318 units. The luxury crossover was closely followed by the Blazer EV at 15,232 units, although both will likely be overtaken by the Equinox EV. The affordable electric crossover has been a hit with consumers and GM delivered 9,772 of them in the third quarter alone. GM said this diverse lineup means they offer an electric vehicle for “almost every kind of driver.” There’s also an assortment of new models on the horizon as Cadillac has introduced the Optiq, Vistiq, Lyriq-V, and Escalade IQ. The Chevrolet Bolt is also slated to return next year as an affordable, mass-market option. While GM became the number two seller of EVs in the third quarter with 32,095 sales, they’re well behind Tesla. However, Cox Automotive recently noted they’ve passed the Hyundai Motor Group (29,609) and are miles ahead of Ford (23,509).",
