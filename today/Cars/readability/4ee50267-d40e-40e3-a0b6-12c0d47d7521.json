I say significant, not only because good gear comes at a cost, but also because it could save your skin. When the time comes to invest in new kit, your two biggest considerations should be the level of protection it offers and ensuring that it’s something you’ll actually wear. If you ask us, quality materials and timeless designs never go out of style, and you’ll find all of these qualities from Goldtop Motorcycle Outfitters. We’re incredibly pleased to announce that we’ve added a collection of Goldtop’s motorcycle gear to the Bike EXIF Store, including leather riding jackets, gloves and tank bags. While the trademark has been a staple in the U.K. for decades, younger riders may need a quick history lesson. Goldtop was formed in 1951 with the mission of providing the finest quality riding apparel in the equestrian scene—a different sort of saddle, so to speak—and their products soon became the standard issue of the British Household Cavalry. But it wasn’t long before Britain’s burgeoning post-war motorcycle scene called for a new standard of protective riding gear that didn’t sacrifice style and comfort. Goldtop’s jackets, boots and gloves became synonymous with British quality and were the choice of scores of riders, racers and the U.K. motorcycle police. Financial strain prompted the company to close its doors in the 1980s, but by 2012, London-based rider Kasey Cullen began reviving interest in the revered trademark. Cullen and his crew collected original Goldtop gear and advertisements to ensure the new line would be built with the same style and enduring quality, receiving an official nod from one of the company’s original owners, Ivor Godfrey. But of course, things have changed since the good old days, and premium motorcycle gear needs to do more than look the part. Starting with the finest grade Aniline cowhides, all of Goldtop’s riding jackets achieve a CE AAA rating with the use of Knox Microlock or D30 Ghost armor. Goldtop’s gloves range in form and function, with all their armored offerings achieving a CE Level 1 rating. While it may not be hard to find a CE-rated riding jacket for less money these days, the quality workmanship of Goldtop’s products makes all the difference in the final product. Their Aniline hides are soaked in dyes in a drum, so they absorb through the entirety of the hide, rather than being sprayed on. Stainless steel YKK EXCELLA zippers are used for all exteriors and Goldtop forges all their buckles and snaps from stainless instead of using cheaper nickel-plated hardware. As a curated collection of parts and gear that meets our standards, we’re thrilled to add a selection of Goldtop Motorcycle Gear to the Bike EXIF store. We encourage you to consider Goldtop as a quality investment in your wardrobe—we’re certain you won’t be disappointed.
