  "text": "The 1991 Nissan GT-R was the first of the 100 R32 units delivered Down Under and remained in stock condition 6 hours ago by Thanos Pappas Thieves stole a rare 1991 R32 GT-R from Nissan Australia’s heritage fleet during a brazen heist. The model was the first R32 to be delivered Down Under, and remained in pristine condition. Nissan is asking for help to recover the vehicle, while a police investigation is underway. In the latest episode of “Things We Didn’t See Coming but Totally Should Have,” Nissan Australia has shared that one of its prized possessions, a red 1991 R32 GT-R from its heritage fleet, was brazenly swiped from their Mulgrave facilities in Melbourne on Wednesday, October 9, 2024. Someone had the audacity to steal Godzilla itself, and not the fun, campy movie kind. We’re talking about the legendary R32, a car that probably gets more respect in certain circles than most human beings. Naturally, Nissan is now on the hunt for any info that could lead to the return of their vehicle, which has been part of their collection since 2015. “Unfortunately, our original R32 GT-R has been stolen and is now subject to a police investigation,” the automaker stated. Translation: “Please help us get our national treasure back before someone tries to slap a questionable spoiler on it.” More: Stolen Porsche 993 Turbo Found After Six Years Of Neglect Deserves Restoration This particular R32 was more than just a pretty face, as it was historically significant, being the first one ever registered in Australia. And despite being over three decades old, the car was kept in impeccable, factory-fresh condition. No mods, no aftermarket exhaust that sounds like a leaf blower on Red Bull—just pure, uncut Skyline glory. According to Wikipedia, only 100 street-legal examples of the R32 GT-R were delivered Down Under, though many more Japanese imports followed. If you’re wondering how much a car like this is worth, brace yourself: CarExpert reports that the current value is estimated at over AU$130,000 (or about US$87,427 for those of us who haven’t figured out the exchange rate since last year’s iPhone release). The news quickly hit Reddit, where it became clear that car enthusiasts are, well, a skeptical bunch. According to one Redditor in the r/Melbourne thread, the R32 was stolen straight from Nissan’s head office showroom, adding that the thieves also tried to steal an R35 GT-R, but failed. Maybe they couldn’t figure out how to start it? Who knows. Meanwhile, other commenters asked the obvious question: why didn’t Nissan put a GPS tracker on these cars? Some speculated that the R32 is already halfway across the globe, probably stuffed inside a shipping container headed for the Middle East or the US. For those unacquainted with the significance of the R32 GT-R (and really, shame on you), this third-generation of the Godzilla remained in production between 1989 and 1994, with 43,937 units leaving the factory floor. Powered by a twin-turbo 2.6-liter inline-six engine, it pushed out a respectable 276 horsepower (a figure that might’ve been slightly… conservative), along with 354 Nm (261 lb-ft) of torque. All of this power was sent to all four wheels through a five-speed manual gearbox. And if you needed further proof of its legend status, the R32 is the car that went to Australia’s Bathurst 1000, smacked Holden and Ford around, and then politely took the trophy home. Not just once, but back-to-back in 1991 and 1992, thanks to the Gibson Motorsport team. If you happen to spot it cruising around, Nissan Australia would really appreciate it if you could give them a heads-up by calling 1800 035 035 or shooting an email to csc[at]nissan.com.au. Pro tip: If you’re going to steal a car—which you really shouldn’t—maybe don’t pick one with a fanbase so obsessive they could probably track it by sound alone. Between Nissan, the cops, and a legion of internet detectives, you’re playing a losing game. But hey, enjoy your 15 minutes. Nissan Australia",
