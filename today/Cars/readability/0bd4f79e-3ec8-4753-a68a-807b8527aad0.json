  "text": "The automaker's engineers have given the car an exoskeleton-style exposed roll cage October 24, 2024 at 20:21 by Brad Anderson Hyundai’s RN24 serves as a rolling lab to test high-performance tech for future electric N division vehicles. It uses the Ioniq 5 N’s 641 hp powertrain but in a shorter, rally-style chassis built for performance. The exoskeleton-style RN24 lacks traditional bodywork, using a roll cage and TCR race car-inspired rear wing. Hyundai has just pulled the covers off its latest ‘rolling lab’ model, dubbed the RN24. The car follows in the footsteps of the RN22e and N Vision 74, serving as a testbed for high-performance technologies and motorsport features that will shape future electrified vehicles from the N division. In creating the RN24, Hyundai’s engineers wanted to fit their most powerful powertrain into the smallest possible package they could muster. As such, they’ve developed a custom World Rally Championship-inspired EV chassis and then dropped the 641 hp powertrain of the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. Remarkably, the car even features the same 84 kWh battery pack as the Ioniq 5 N, despite the wheelbase being shortened by a considerable 13.3 inches (340 mm). Read: Hyundai Confirms N Vision 74’s Production After All A laundry list of features ensures the RN24 is no mere prototype. For example, it has a WRC Powertrain Drive Control Logic system that allows drivers to adjust the power, acceleration sensitivity, regenerative brake sensitivity, and power balance using steering wheel buttons, features similar to those of Hyundai’s current WRC cars. Additionally, the technical demonstrator has a dedicated ‘Rally Mode’ that optimizes torque distribution inspired by the i20 N Rally 1 WRC, while there’s even a new e-Handbrake to initiate some epic powerslides. A new version of the N Active Sound+ system of the Ioniq 5 N has also been added. It now includes two side speakers, and the rear fenders double as soundboxes, helping to enhance the soundtrack. You’ll no doubt have noticed the RN24 is almost entirely void of bodywork and instead uses an exoskeleton-style exposed roll cage. It also has the same rear wing as Hyundai’s TCR race cars. Despite the various weight-saving measures employed, the RN24 still tips the scales at an estimated 4,144 lbs (1,880 kg), or roughly 350 kg (771 lbs) less than the Ioniq 5 N it borrows its powertrain from. “RN24 exemplifies Hyundai N’s commitment to advancing electric motorsport technology by prioritizing the driving experience rather than spec numbers,” vice president of N Brand Management Group, Joon Park said in a statement. “This Rolling Lab proves that there remains untapped potential for high-performance EVs and with new technologies ahead, there is much to look forward to.” If the RN24 is a taste of what’s to come, the future of the N division looks promising.",
