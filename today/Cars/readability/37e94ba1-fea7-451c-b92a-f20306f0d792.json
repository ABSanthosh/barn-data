Having 1,400 miles, it is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black leather and Pepita cloth upholstery. The car was optioned with a limited-slip differential, 20\" center-lock GT3 alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes with yellow calipers, a front-axle lift system, the Sport Chrono Package, LED headlights with PDLS, a speed-activated rear spoiler, PCM with navigation, automatic climate control, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, the Light Design Package, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, and cruise control. This 991 911 R was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered in California at no reserve with the owner's manual, service records, a DME report, a clean Carfax report, and an Arizona title.",

Having 1,400 miles, it is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black leather and Pepita cloth upholstery. The car was optioned with a limited-slip differential, 20″ center-lock GT3 alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes with yellow calipers, a front-axle lift system, the Sport Chrono Package, LED headlights with PDLS, a speed-activated rear spoiler, PCM with navigation, automatic climate control, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, the Light Design Package, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, and cruise control. This 991 911 R was acquired by the selling dealer in 2025 and is now offered in California at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, a DME report, a clean Carfax report, and an Arizona title. The 911 R was a limited-production variant developed in the spirit of the 1967 homologation special of the same name. Styling was based on that of the contemporary 911 GT3, with construction elements borrowed from the GT3 RS including a magnesium roof panel and a carbon-fiber hood. The model also featured a carbon-fiber deck lid and front fenders, a model-specific front lip and rear underbody splitter, a retractable spoiler, and an aluminum grille. This example is finished in black and has LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System, fog lights, carbon-fiber upper mirror caps, body-color side skirts, auto-dimming mirrors, side graphics, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. The 20″ GT3 alloy wheels feature center-locking hubs and are mounted with Pirelli tires. Adjustable suspension underpinnings and rear-axle steering were shared with the contemporary GT3, though specially tuned for the 911 R. Stopping power is provided by yellow six- and four-piston monobloc calipers over ceramic-composite rotors at each corner. The optional front-axle lift raises the car on command to help prevent scraping. The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Pepita cloth inserts, “911 R” embroidery on the headrests, silver seatbelts, and contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, steering column, center armrest, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include a fire extinguisher, automatic climate control, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, cruise control, the Light Design Package, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 350-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. A stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 1,400 miles. The naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six was shared with the contemporary GT3 RS and was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale, and the car has not passed a California emissions inspection. Results of a DME report are provided in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. The car is equipped with an extended-range fuel tank. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. A September 2022 entry states that a bond was released and the vehicle was “imported and declared to meet US highway safety specifications.” You are not connected to real-time updates.
