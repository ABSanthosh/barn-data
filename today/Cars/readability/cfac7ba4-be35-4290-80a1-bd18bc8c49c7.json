  "text": "The Cybercab could revolutionize the industry or be another case of vaporware 6 hours ago by Michael Gauthier Tesla is set to unveil its long-awaited Cybercab tonight, but excitement levels are surprisingly low this time. While expectations are tempered, the company could show a prototype as well as renderings of a production model. There’s no word on when a Cybercab could pick you up, but you might not want to wait curbside as it could take years. After plenty of broken promises, Tesla is finally slated to unveil their RoboTaxi tonight at 7 pm PT. While these events are typically big news, there doesn’t appear to be a ton of excitement this time around. The reasons likely vary wildly as Elon Musk has become something of a lightning rod and that’s been amplified by his support of Donald Trump. Aside from politics, many consumers are wary of autonomous vehicles as a AAA study recently found 66% of Americans are afraid of them. More: Tesla’s Delayed Electric Robotaxi Slated For October 10 Debut On top of that, expectations for the event are pretty low. While only time will tell what Tesla has up their sleeve, the company is expected to show a Cybercab prototype as well as some renderings of a potential production model. That’s hardly groundbreaking stuff and Wired quoted a spokesperson with the California Public Utilities Commission as saying the automaker hasn’t reached out for an autonomous driving permit. However, they noted the company has a permit from the Department of Motor Vehicles, although the firm didn’t report any autonomous driving mileage last year. This suggests the effort could be at an early stage or Tesla is playing things a little ‘fast and loose.’ Regardless, there’s little doubt their autonomous driving tech will lean heavily into their Autopilot and Full-Self Driving expertise. It’s also impossible to ignore Tesla’s track record of overpromising and under-delivering. The company’s second-generation Roadster has been vaporware for the better part of a decade and the $39,900 Cybertruck is nowhere to be found. — Tesla (@Tesla) October 9, 2024 With all that being said, are you excited for the Cybercab or do you think it’ll be a dog and pony show? We’ll find out soon enough but, in the meantime, Sugar Design has whipped up some renderings of a wedge-like EV with butterfly doors. If you want to watch the event, you’ll have to do it on X and you can visit the livestream here. Lead render credit: Sugar Design",
