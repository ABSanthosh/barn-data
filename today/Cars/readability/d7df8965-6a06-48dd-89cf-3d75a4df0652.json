  "description": "Ultraviolette has rolled out a performance update for its flagship F77 electric motorcycle. Dubbed the Gen3 Powertrain Firmware, the update brings sharper performance via what Ultraviolette calls Ballistic+, which is available to all existing F77 customers at no extra cost. Ultraviolette F77 gets more torque response Developed using insights from over 8 million km of real-world ride data Available to all F77 customers for free, with no change in peak output Ultraviolette F77 gets Gen 3 firmware update It continues to produce the same 40hp and 100Nm Ultraviolette states that these learnings have been gained after the bikes went on sale in Europe, where average speeds are much higher and thereby put more demands on the system. To counter this, the company worked on pushing the thermal limits on its motor and motor controller to not only extend the duration before performance deration kicks in but also offer more initial torque surge.  While Ultraviolette refers to the update as Ballistic+, the name of the top mode shown on the bike’s TFT display will continue to read ‘Ballistic’. The company claims this update is designed to deliver a noticeably sharper and more engaging riding experience, with quicker throttle response and a stronger initial power surge. However, peak output of 40hp and 100Nm remains unchanged, with the software doing all the heavy lifting. Battery capacity is also unchanged at 7.1kWh for the Mach 2 and 10.3kWh for the Mach 2 Recon, and the company claims no change to the range figures either.  Ultraviolette F77 Gen3 firmware backward compatibility This update is backward compatible with all existing F77 variants The F77’s Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) processes over 3,000 data points in real time. This data, interpreted by the bike’s software systems, helps fine-tune the drivetrain, motor controller and battery-management system. According to Ultraviolette, this has enabled the F77 to extract more performance purely through software optimisation. The update is backwards-compatible across all F77 variants and will be rolled out to all existing customers at no additional cost.
