  "text": "May 3, 2025 5:00 PM EDTThe Toyota bZ7 and Lexus ES are both high-end EVs we wish we could have – but never will By mid-2026, Toyota will be making its first deliveries of the bZ7 and Lexus ES sedans, bringing high-end electrification to those who pre-ordered and the select few who might be lucky enough to snag one from a dealership lot. Both sound like incredible vehicles, and Toyota is making a push to regain market share by going a bit more high-end than it usually does. These sibling Toyota vehicles are set to challenge the Tesla Model S and other high-end sedans, showing that Toyota is eager to pursue electrification beyond collaborations with Subaru. The issue for American buyers is that these two new Toyota vehicles are only available in China, not the United States. The Toyota bZ7 and Lexus ES are classy EV sedans we wish were coming stateside Though Toyota didn’t divulge much about the bZ7 at the Shanghai Auto Show, where the vehicle debuted, we do know it will be “equipped with the latest intelligent technology” and serve as Toyota’s flagship vehicle for the Chinese market. At over 5 meters long, the Toyota bZ7 was developed by Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC), Guangzhou Toyota Motor Company (GTMC), and the Intelligent ElectroMobility R\u0026D Center by TOYOTA. Aesthetically, the bZ7 is reminiscent of a more luxurious Toyota Crown. Toyota’s lightbar sweeps across the front and blurs the line between hatchback and sedan in the rear. The bZ7 has aggressive, linear body lines down its sides and a decidedly svelte interior with bold linear lines traced by the interior lighting panels. Toyota had much more to say about the Lexus ES, which will be available in BEV (fully electrified) and HEV (hybrid) variants. Now in its eighth generation, the incoming ES interior will have what Toyota calls responsive hidden switches, which “seamlessly blend physical controls into the interior” to keep the interior minimal without hiding settings behind a screen. A new Sensory Concierge will personalize your in-car experience via bespoke illumination, climate control, and fragrance dispersion. The BEV ES will be offered in FWB and AWD configurations, earning you 685 kilometers (425 miles) and 610 kilometers (379 miles), respectively. Depending on outside air temperature, Toyota says the ES can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in 30-60 minutes. The HEV will be offered in FWD and AWD as well, with the option of a 2.0-liter or 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. Toyota continues to invest in EVs and China Earlier this year, Toyota debuted the bZ3X SUV to much fanfare, selling over 10,000 pre-orders in under an hour. Toyota also has the bZ3 sedan and bZ5 crossover for China and the bZ4X, which it released globally. The Lexus ES trails the RZ and UX into the Chinese market for Toyota. This provides Toyota with an aggressive lineup of EVs and hybrids for buyers in China, all feature-packed vehicles priced aggressively. Final thoughts Toyota isn’t saying it’s worried about Chinese upstart EV automaker BYD, but it clearly is. Its lineup for China is impressive, and those with pricing – pricing for the bZ7 and Lexus ES wasn’t revealed – are priced to move quickly. And if the bZ3X is any indication, BYD should be worried about Toyota.",
