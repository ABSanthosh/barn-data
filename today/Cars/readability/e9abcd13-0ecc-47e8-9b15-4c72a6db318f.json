  "description": "Maruti Suzuki has crossed the 30 lakh unit production target with the Dzire. It took the sedan over 5.6 years to achieve this goal from 20 lakh in 2019, while the journeys from 10 to 20 lakh and zero to 10 lakh took over 4 years and 6 years, respectively. With this, the Dzire joins the Alto, Swift, and Wagon R Arena stablemates, who are already part of the 30 lakh milestone club.  Maruti launched the first-generation Dzire at Rs 4.49 lakh in 2008 One in every two compact sedans sold is a Dzire The 'Made-in-India' Dzire is exported to 48 countries  In November, Suzuki debuted its fourth-generation Dzire with a new petrol engine, added features, and safety enhancements. As of the time of writing, the ex-showroom prices (Mumbai) for the car range from Rs 6.79 to Rs 10.14 lakh. Before this model, the third (2017), second (2012) and first-generation (2008) Dzires were also despatched in good numbers, making it Maruti’s bestselling sedan. As per data from JATO Dynamics, one in every two compact sedans sold in the country is a Dzire. Talking about exports, the Dzire remains one of Maruti Suzuki's top five models sent out of India. Currently, it is exported to 48 countries across regions such as Latin America, Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, with around 2.6 lakh units shipped so far. In the fiscal year 2024, the Dzire was Maruti’s second most-exported passenger vehicle. In the under-4-metre sedan segment, the Dzire rivals the second- and third-generation Honda Amaze, Hyundai Aura, and Tata Tigor.  IMAGE SOURCE Also, see: 2024 Maruti Suzuki Dzire review: India's favourite sedan massively updated New Maruti Dzire variant-wise features, trims and prices explained New Maruti Dzire launched at Rs 6.79 lakh",
