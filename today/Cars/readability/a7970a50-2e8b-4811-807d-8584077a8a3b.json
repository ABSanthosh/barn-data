  "text": "This G-Class can hit 35 mph and travel 80 miles between charges February 25, 2025 at 19:20 by Michael Gauthier A Mercedes G-Class-inspired golf cart is going up for auction next month. The four-door SUV sports familiar styling as well as a surprisingly high-tech interior. The Bodo G-Wagen apparently costs $21,900 new, which is more than some street-legal vehicles. Mercedes recently confirmed plans for an affordable “G-Class,” which will slot beneath the regular model. However, if you’re willing to make a few tradeoffs, you can get a baby G-Class even quicker. This pint-sized cutie is known as the Bodo G-Wagon / E-Wagon and it’s a golf cart that closely echoes its namesake. The attention to detail is impressive as the model is instantly recognizable as a G-Class and even comes with working lights, turn signals, and windshield wipers. They’re joined by a spare tire carrier as well as stylish two-tone wheels. More: Mercedes-Benz Garia Golf Cart Redefines The Term “Sports Car” While the interior isn’t as nice as the real thing, it’s still pretty impressive for a golf cart as it sports a digital instrument cluster and a small infotainment system. There’s even a dual screen rear entertainment system, although it looks very basic. Screens aside, there are power windows and locks as well as a heater and air conditioner. There’s even a rearview camera and stylish metal accents. Mecum While the G 580 with EQ Technology has a 122 kWh battery pack and a quad-motor all-wheel drive system with 579 hp (432 kW / 587 PS), the Bodo relies on a 10 kWh battery and a 20 hp (15 kW / 20 PS) motor. This enables the model to hit a top speed of 35 mph (56 km/h) and travel up to 80 miles (129 km) between charges. This particular golf cart is being auctioned by Mecum on March 21, but one dealer has the vehicle listed for $21,900 new. That’s more than a new Chevrolet Trax, but it’s a small price to pay to be the ultimate baller on the back nine. Mecum",
