  "text": "The team is expected to use Ferrari engines for two years before GM begins building and supplying its own V6s December 10, 2024 at 19:12 by Brad Anderson GM, Cadillac, and Andretti gained provisional approval to join F1 after the Las Vegas GP. Its engine supply deal with Ferrari rests on the team receiving official written confirmation. The American team originally planned to use Renault engines before switching to Ferrari. Just a few days after narrowly missing out on securing this year’s Formula 1 constructors’ championship, Ferrari has revealed that it will supply its engines to the new Cadillac F1 team from 2026. While financial details about the deal have not been publicly disclosed, the deal is for multiple years. GM, Cadillac, and Andretti received provisional approval to join the F1 grid in 2026 after November’s Las Vegas Grand Prix, having had a previous bid rejected earlier in the year. General Motors has committed to transitioning to a complete works team, stating it will start to build its own engines from 2028. As such, the team needed to secure an engine supplier for 2026 and 2027, and they selected Ferrari. The Italian marque will also continue to supply engines to Haas, the other American team. Read: Toyota Isn’t Returning To F1, But Its Logo Is “It’s great to see the commitment of another American team, backed by one of the most highly respected marques in the motor industry, at a time when Formula 1 is increasing in popularity in the United States,” Scuderia Ferrari HP team principal Frédéric Vasseur said. “We are delighted therefore that we will be supplying the team with our power unit and gearbox as the basis of this technical collaboration. It means we will continue to have two “customer teams” in the championship with all the benefits this brings in terms of technical development within Ferrari,” he added. While quizzed about the tie-up at a recent Reuters event in New York, Ferrari chief executive Benedetto Vigna said he was very proud of the deal, and noted Ferrari has “a sense of responsibility because the success of these other teams, it also depends on our engine.” Importantly, the GM team has yet to receive official written confirmation of its acceptance into Formula 1, so the deal with Ferrari remains subject to this approval. Prior to Michael Andretti handing over day-to-day operations of the outfit to Dan Towriss and TWG Global, the team had secured an engine supply deal with Renault, Motorsport reports. However, the French brand confirmed in late September that it would end its F1 engine program after the 2025 season and switch the Alpine team to Mercedes power.",
