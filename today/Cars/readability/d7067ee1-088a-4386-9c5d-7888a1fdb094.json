  "text": "Here's hoping someone is able to save this 720S and bring it back onto the road April 22, 2025 at 21:01 by Brad Anderson The 720S appears to be in good condition, save for some minor carbon fiber damage. According to the auction listing, the supercar has been driven 59,720 miles so far. Due to its non-repairable title, this McLaren can’t be re-registered in California. At first glance, this McLaren 720S might seem like any other in the sea of supercars, painted in a glossy shade of yellow, rolling on black and silver wheels, and showcasing plenty of exposed carbon fiber. Under the hood, it’s powered by the same 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 that made the 720S a standout in the hypercar world. However, an insurer has deemed it non-repairable, and it’s heading to auction. Currently listed through IAAI, this British beauty ended up at their facility in North Hollywood. On first impressions, it looks absolutely perfect. Look a little closer, though, and you’ll notice it does have some damage. Still, it doesn’t seem significant enough for the 720S to be deserving of a non-repairable title. Read: One McLaren Locked Up Mid-Corner Now Dozens Are Under Recall Most of the visible so-called “damage” appears to consist of what you’d expect from normal wear and tear on a car that’s seen a bit of action. The front has a few scratches and marks on the carbon fiber splitter, and one of the inner arches seems to have suffered a tear. There’s also a small paint chip on the edge of one door. IAAI also mentions damage to the undercarriage but has not shared any photos of the area. With the exception of these small marks, this 720S looks pretty much perfect. Admittedly, it has been driven 59,720 miles (96,110 km), which is a lot for a six-year-old supercar, and does make us wonder if it’s perhaps been used as a rental car at some stage. In California, cars are typically given a non-repairable title when they’ve been so severely damaged that they no longer have usable parts. These vehicles cannot be repaired or retitled in the state. But in the case of this 720S, it seems a bit of an overreaction, unless we’re missing something. It’s entirely possible that this 720S could be repaired and, in the right hands, could be a steal for someone hunting for an affordable McLaren. Of course, getting it titled in the U.S. could be a headache, but even if it ends up as a track-only car or gets shipped overseas, it still holds potential. Let’s hope someone takes the chance on it before it’s completely written off. If you’re feeling adventurous and have the skills or at least a decent YouTube channel, you can check out the listing here. Who knows, maybe you’ll be the next hero of a “look what I fixed” video, complete with a clickbait title and an unexpected comeback story. IAAI",
