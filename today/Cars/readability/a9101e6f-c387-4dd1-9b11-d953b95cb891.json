For the next week, we’ll be testing one with the inline-six turbo in the real world. Few vehicles truly go head-to-head with the Land Rover Defender. Sure, it’s a luxury SUV, one of many in today’s automotive market. But what sets it apart is its ability to excel when the pavement ends and the challenges begin. Over the next week, I’ll be putting one to the test in every way I can think of. What do you want to know about one of Land Rover’s most storied nameplates? When the Defender returned to production in its modern form, it made quite the splash. It’s unmistakably a Land Rover and, by most accounts, stays true to the original Defender’s off-roading spirit. Of course, it’s also far more luxurious, significantly more capable, and, unsurprisingly, much more expensive than the original. More: Frustrated Defender Owners Sue Land Rover Over Windshields That Won’t Stop Cracking For 2025, the two-door Defender 90 starts at around $57,000. That price jumps up quickly though as the four-door 110 starts at $60,800 and the next trim up is $72,100. Speaking of that model, it’s called the X-Dynamic SE equipped with an inline-six and it’s the one we’ll pilot during our test week. While not cheap, it’s definitely far more affordable from the super swanky $152,000 Defender Octa that Land Rover could’ve sent and the one most buyers will go for – although we wouldn’t mind testing that 626 hp twin-turbo V8 beast in the near future… Our specific test car has a $500 cold climate option with heated washer jets, a headlight power wash, and a heated windshield. The off-road package adds an electronic active differential, off-road tires, and a household-style power outlet for $1,550. Finally, a $1,600 option called the air suspension pack with adaptive dynamics and, of course, air-adjustable suspension. After all of the options, destination, and delivery, this car has an MSRP of $81,923. That’s less than the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 Final Edition we recently tested by some $26,000. At first look, the Defender seems like a vastly more comfortable car to spend time in. The cabin is full of luxury appointments like grained leather upholstery, a panoramic sunroof, and high-quality materials. This SUV won’t be as fast as the Jeep, but it’s close. Under the hood of our tester is JLR’s new 3.0-liter inline-six which makes use of an electric supercharger a turbocharger, and a 48-volt hybrid system, so it’s bristling with technology. It delivers a healthy 395 hp (294 kW) and 406 lb-ft (549 Nm) of torque, all routed through a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission. That all said, what do you want to know about it? Other than how to maintain it out of warranty that is. Leave your questions below and we’ll address them soon! Image Credit: Stephen/Casey Rivers",
