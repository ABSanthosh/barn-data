  "description": "This Alpina B7 Turbo/1 is #243 of 278 examples produced between 1984 and 1987 and is one of 42 examples fitted with a catalytic converter. Produced in October 1986, the car was first registered in March 1988 and brought to the US from the Netherlands in June 2021. It was acquired by the current owner on BaT in November 2021 and now shows 140k kilometers (~87k miles). Power comes from a turbocharged 3.4-liter inline-six paired with a five-speed manual transmission, and the car is finished in Diamond Black Metallic over black leather. Alpina-specified equipment included the cylinder head, exhaust, springs, dampers, and 16\" wheels as well as the bodywork and graphics, while the interior is appointed with heated front sport seats, air conditioning, and a Blaupunkt DAB head unit. This B7 Turbo was listed on BaT in January 2025 and is now offered again on dealer consignment in Arizona with Alpina Classic documentation, manufacturer's literature, a tool kit, Dutch inspection reports, import documents, and a Montana title.",

  "text": "This Alpina B7 Turbo/1 is #243 of 278 examples produced between 1984 and 1987 and is one of 42 examples fitted with a catalytic converter. Produced in October 1986, the car was first registered in March 1988 and brought to the US from the Netherlands in June 2021. It was acquired by the current owner on BaT in November 2021 and now shows 140k kilometers (~87k miles). Power comes from a turbocharged 3.4-liter inline-six paired with a five-speed manual transmission, and the car is finished in Diamond Black Metallic over black leather. Alpina-specified equipment included the cylinder head, exhaust, springs, dampers, and 16″ wheels as well as the bodywork and graphics, while the interior is appointed with heated front sport seats, air conditioning, and a Blaupunkt DAB head unit. This B7 Turbo was listed on BaT in January 2025 and is now offered again on dealer consignment in Arizona with Alpina Classic documentation, manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, Dutch inspection reports, import documents, and a Montana title. Finished in Diamond Black Metallic, the car features replacement Alpina graphics as well as front and rear spoilers, a power sunroof, European-specification headlights, fog lights, dual center-mounted exhaust tips, and chrome trim. The sunroof panel, bumper trim, bumper corners, and chrome trim surrounding the windshield and windows have been replaced. The front spoiler, left-front fender, and front area of the hood are said to have been refinished under previous ownership. Paint meter readings can be viewed in the gallery. Silver-finished 16″ Alpina alloy wheels wear 205/55 Continental SportContact 2 tires with 2014 date codes up front. Continental PremiumContact tires with 2021 date codes measuring 225/50 are mounted out back, and a spare resides in the trunk. The B7 is equipped with Alpina/Bilstein springs and dampers as well as M5-specification four-piston disc brakes. The brake booster is said to have been replaced in 2021 along with front pads and rotors. The heated and manually adjustable front sport seats are trimmed in black leather that extends to the rear bench. Interior appointments include a rear sunshade, an onboard computer, air conditioning, and a Blaupunkt Bremen SQR 46 DAB head unit. The four-spoke Alpina steering wheel is wrapped in leather and joined by a wooden shift knob. Alpina-branded instrumentation consists of a 300-km/h speedometer, a 7k rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, and instant fuel economy. The six-digit odometer shows 140k kilometers (~87k miles), approximately 2,600 kilometers of which have been added by the current owner. Alpina modified the 3.4-liter BMW inline-six by reprogramming the Motronic fuel-injection system and fitting a revised cylinder head, lighter Mahle pistons, a revised camshaft, and a KKK turbocharger. Claimed output when new was 320 horsepower and ~375 lb-ft of torque. The camshaft and cylinder head gasket were replaced under previous ownership. Compression-test readings are viewable in the gallery. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Getrag 265 dogleg five-speed transmission. A replacement Alpina exhaust system with dual sport catalytic converters was installed under previous ownership. A dry-ice cleaning process was performed on the underside in preparation for the sale. Additional underside images are provided in the gallery. The delivery confirmation certificate from Alpina Classic shows a production date of October 1986, and factory equipment is listed on an included build sheet. Manufacutrer’s literature, a tool kit, Dutch inspection reports, and import documents will also accompany the car. The Montana title lists “Classic (25)/OK” under the “Brand” heading.
