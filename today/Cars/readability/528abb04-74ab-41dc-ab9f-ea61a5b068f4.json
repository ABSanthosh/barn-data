  "text": "This 1991 BMW 325i sedan has remained registered in California from new through the current owner’s purchase in 2021, and it now shows 63k miles. The car is powered by a 2.5-liter M20 inline-six paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and is finished in black over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes 14″ bottle cap alloy wheels, fog lights, a sunroof, cruise control, a cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This E30 sedan is offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title in the owner’s name. The car is finished in Black (086) and features aluminum trim, quad headlights, fog lights, a sunroof, and a power antenna. There are paint chips on the driver’s door, and close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Silver 14″ bottle cap alloy wheels are mounted with Nexen N5000 tires. Braking is handled by ventilated front and solid rear discs with ABS. The cabin features seats upholstered in black leather along with color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Amenities include an AM/FM/cassette stereo, an onboard computer, cruise control, and air conditioning, the latter of which was serviced in 2024. The steering wheel frames a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, instant fuel economy, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 63k miles. The 2.5-liter M20B25 inline-six was factory-rated at 168 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed and the air filter, spark plugs, and coolant expansion tank were replaced in 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The Carfax report is free of accidents and other reported damage from its first entry in March 1993.
