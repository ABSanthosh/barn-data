  "description": "BMW’s CE 02 is an electric two-wheeler that straddles the line between an electric scooter and a motorcycle. It's aimed at urban riders looking for a more stylish way to get around town and unlike the recently launched CE 04, this one is made in India at TVS’ Hosur plant. We got to spend a short time in Delhi’s traffic with this EV and this is our first impression. A full review will come later. BMW CE 02 design and features The BMW CE 02 breaks from traditional scooter and motorcycle design, offering a minimalistic yet futuristic look. The CE 02 we rode was equipped with the Highline Pack, which included bits like a gold anodised USD fork, teal stickering, tri-coloured seat, heated grips and a smartphone holder. The overall design features minimal bodywork, sharp angles, a single-sided swingarm and fat tyres that give it a unique look. The clean, flat surfaces combined with a simple-looking frame create a distinctive aesthetic that BMW hopes will appeal to younger riders. The CE 02 has a friendly face, with LED elements on the headlight, indicators and DRL creating a unique light signature. Our test bike also came with a unique teal-tinted visor sold as an optional  extra. During our short stint, the CE 02 stood out on our streets and looks like a concept bike. While the rest of the design feels quite cohesive, the front footpegs and their mount do look like a bit of an afterthought. BMW, though, says it's designed this way to accommodate a snow/skateboard. While some may find its playful design too polarising, I found it unique and funky. The CE 02 is equipped with a 3.5-inch TFT screen that may seem small on paper, but it does a pretty good job and has a crisp and clear layout. Additionally, BMW also allows you to mount your phone onto the bike and connect it via BMW’s app, giving you control of features on the app using the switchgear – your smartphone screen becomes an extension of the infotainment. What seemed odd to me was the heated grips, which seemed rather unnecessary in India. I would have preferred the windscreen or comfort seats instead. Speaking of which, with a seat height of 745mm, the CE 02 is quite friendly for shorter riders. However, the standard seat is narrow and will accommodate skinny passengers at best. In the real world, the CE 02 seems better suited for just a rider but a pillion would be a snug fit. As of now, BMW is offering the CE 02 in standard trim and the Highline Package with just one colour option. As part of the Highline Package, BMW will offer a 1.5kW fast charger that will fully charge the CE 02 in under 3.5 hours. BMW CE 02 performance The CE 02 is powered by two 1.96kWh batteries that have a combined capacity of 3.92kWh. The motors have a peak output of 11kW (15hp) and 55Nm. BMW claims the CE 02 is positioned as an electric alternative to a 200cc motorcycle, but its numbers put it more on pace with a sporty 160cc bike. While 15hp may not seem like a lot, the CE 02 picks up pace rather quickly and can effortlessly climb to its 95kph claimed top speed. There are three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. The latter is only available as part of the Highline package and all three modes tweak the throttle response and regen levels. Flow has mild regen, Surf turns off regen entirely whereas Flash puts regen and throttle response on max giving you the most engaging experience. However, all three modes felt quite similar with the difference feeling rather negligible in the real world. BMW also claims that the CE 02 has a range of about 108km, which should make it an effective city commuter. However, we’d need more time with the CE 02 before we can verify those claims. BMW CE 02 ride and handling The CE 02 shines when it comes to ease of handling and urban practicality. Despite weighing a hefty 142kg, it feels rather light and darting through traffic is quite effortless. The thick Michelin City Grip tyres provide great grip and the brakes provide ample stopping power. The lack of rear ABS may seem daunting to newer riders as it’s rather easy to lock up the rear wheel, which may be cause for concern. Another issue I have is the suspension setup, which allows you to feel every imperfection in the road and may not feel as plush as one would come to expect from a thoroughbred city commuter like the CE 02. BMW’s most affordable electric two-wheeler loves to attack corners and it’s not hard to get it to scrap its pegs. BMW says riders can alternate between a more relaxed or a more engaging riding position based on what footpegs they use. While both felt comfortable, I preferred the forward-set position for most part of my journey. BMW CE 02 verdict Priced at Rs 4.50 lakh, it's one of the most expensive electric two-wheelers on sale, second only to its older sibling. However, the CE 02 still remains a niche EV for premium buyers that care more about brand image and futuristic design. While our time with it was short, the CE 02 has made a positive impression with all its credentials. We look forward to bringing you a more detailed review of this electric two-wheeler and testing it over a longer period in the future. Until then, stick around for further updates.",
