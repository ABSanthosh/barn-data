  "description": "Following an action-packed festive season with several special edition launches, November is going to be equally exciting, with four new launches and unveils lined up this month, including two new very important Marutis, a new Skoda SUV and a sporty Mercedes sedan. Let’s take a closer look at what to expect from each. Maruti Suzuki eVX November 4 First showcased in concept guise at the 2023 Auto Expo, Maruti Suzuki will globally unveil the production version of the eVX electric SUV on November 4 in Milan, Italy. This underscores the eVX’s importance as a global product for parent company Suzuki, as a significant portion of the production of the made-in-India EVs, has been marked for export to Europe and Japan. Indian audiences will have to wait until the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025 to see the production-spec eVX in the flesh. This will be Maruti’s first born-electric vehicle that will also spawn a Toyota derivative. The eVX will get a 60kWh battery which is said to give it a range of up to 500km, and it will also come with an AWD system. The price announcement is slated for March 2025. Skoda Kylaq November 6 Skoda will unveil the Kylaq on November 6 in production form, which will be the company’s first attempt at the sub-compact SUV segment, and it will be based on the MQB-A0-IN platform that also underpins its larger sibling, the Kushaq. However, to slip under the 4-metre length, the Kylaq will have a shorter wheelbase as compared to the Kushaq. Skoda says it will be the first model to bring the new ‘Modern Solid’ design language to India but it isn’t likely to stray too far away from the Kushaq, to maintain a family look; the interior, too, is expected to be largely carried over. The Kylaq will be powered by the familiar 1.0-litre TSI turbo-petrol engine that will come with 6-speed MT and AT gearboxes. The price announcement will be due by early-2025. Maruti Suzuki Dzire November 11   Following Maruti’s first EV will be the launch of one of its core volume generators in India, the all-new Dzire. Although it will be based on the new-generation Swift, recent Dzire spy shots gave us a completely uncamouflaged look at the compact sedan, and at least visually, it looks far removed from its hatchback sibling. The new Dzire boasts a much sharper and mature design and is even likely to include a segment-first electric sunroof. The interior and most of the equipment, however, is expected to be carried over, unchanged. The new Dzire will be offered with the same 1.2-litre, three-cylinder Z Series petrol engine as the Swift, which makes 82hp and 112Nm. It will also get a petrol-CNG option. Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance November 12 Mercedes-Benz will launch the new AMG C 63 on November 12. The AMG C 63 drops the V8 for a new plug-in hybrid setup that combines a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine along with a rear-mounted electric motor. The engine on its own puts out 475hp, while the electric motor produces 203hp, taking the total output to 680hp. It gets a 9-speed multi-clutch automatic gearbox with all-wheel drive. The C 63 also gets four-wheel steering, and thanks to the 6.1kWh battery pack, can travel on electric power alone for 13km. It also looks sportier than the regular C-Class with the AMG grille and redesigned front bumper with active cooling flaps. The interior, too, will carry AMG-specific touches, like a new steering wheel and new upholstery.
