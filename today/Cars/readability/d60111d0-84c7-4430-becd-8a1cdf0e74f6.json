  "description": "The next-generation Citroen C5 Aircross was unveiled in concept guise in October 2024, and we've now got leaked design patent images of the production-spec SUV, thanks to our friends at motor.es. To be underpinned by parent firm Stellantis’ STLA Medium platform, the 2025 C5 Aircross doesn’t stray too far away from the concept that previewed its design. An official unveiling is expected later this year. New C5 Aircross takes some design cues from Oli concept of 2022 Will be larger than outgoing SUV with more focus on interior space Expected to come with hybrid and electric powertrain options 2025 Citroen C5 Aircross exterior design The next-gen C5 Aircross looks like an evolution of the current design, drawing some influences from the Citroen Oli Concept from 2022. It features a mix of both sharp lines and smooth rounded surfaces. The slim headlamps with the three-piece C-shaped LED DRLs have been retained from the concept. The bumper also gets a two-tone finish with an air intake down below. 2025 Citroen C5 Aircross concept vs production-spec In profile, the flush door handles from the concept have made for regular pull-type ones, there’s prominent plastic cladding over the wheel arches and the alloys have been toned down a little,  featuring a petal-like design. The detailing around the D-pillar also creates a floating effect for the roof, and the shoulder line looks quite muscular from these angles. At the rear, the C-shaped theme continues for the tail lamps with a connecting LED light bar, while the rear bumper also gets a two-tone finish.    We haven’t got a look at the interior of the new C5 Aircross yet, but it will likely be more spacious than the current model. The C5 Aircross concept measured 4,650mm, which makes it 150mm longer than the current model, and that could translate to more interior space. 2025 Citroen C5 Aircross engine options As already mentioned, the next-gen C5 Aircross will be the first Citroen model to be based on the STLA Medium platform. Although specific powertrain details aren’t available yet, it is expected to get both hybrid as well as all-electric powertrain options. Citroen will officially unveil the new C5 Aircross later this year, so stay tuned for more details. The current C5 Aircross is assembled in India from CKD kits, but there’s no confirmation yet if the next-gen SUV will also be offered here in India.
