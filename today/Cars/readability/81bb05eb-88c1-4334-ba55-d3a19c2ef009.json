  "description": "Mahindra-owned design house Pininfarina is celebrating its 95th anniversary this year. To commemorate this milestone, the brand has released a mildly restyled logo highlighting the brand’s legacy. Apart from designing many iconic cars, the brand introduced the Battista electric hypercar in 2019. Mahindra acquired Pininfarina in 2019 Pininfarina has also built a 1900hp Battista hypercar Pininfarina anniversary celebrations to be held in many cities The new logo is essentially a contemporary graphical evolution featuring the crowned 'f,' a symbol of the company since the 1930s, which has received a minor nip and tuck. Alongside it is the italicized 'Pininfarina' logotype, introduced in 1961 when a presidential decree merged the founder’s nickname, ‘Pinin,’ with the family name ‘Farina,’ creating a new surname and company name. Throughout 2025, the logotype will be accompanied by the number ‘95’ in the same red as the crown. This new logo will be used in all brand communications and events, including those in Italy (Milan and Turin, historic hubs of Italian design), France, Germany, and China. There will also be commemorative events at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance and initiatives organised by Pininfarina of America, based in Miami, New York as well as in the Middle East, where significant architectural collaborations are ongoing. There will also be design competitions for students from all over the world who specialise in mobility design and architecture. Pininfarina vice chairman and CEO Silvio Angori said, “In 2025, we will celebrate an extraordinary milestone that reflects the strength of our history and the power of our vision. This achievement was made possible thanks to all our clients, who have stood by us over the years and will remain at the heart of our 95th-anniversary events. We look forward to 2025 with optimism and determination, ready to embrace future challenges and continue innovating.” Mahindra acquired the Pininfarina brand in 2019 and the Pininfarina Battista electric hypercar made its debut in the same year. The hypercar made its India debut at the Hyderabad Formula E race in February 2023. A few days later, the Battista set a new Indian top speed record of 358.03kph with editor Hormazd Sorabjee behind the wheel.  Also See: Honda-Nissan merger could be in the works Hyundai partners with Google for Android OS infotainment system",
