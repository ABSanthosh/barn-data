  "description": "Royal Enfield’s highly anticipated Himalayan 750 has been spotted testing in Southern Europe, giving us a first look at the brand’s upcoming flagship adventure tourer.  The Himalayan 750 test mule appears to be equipped with a new engine  It has a mono-shock at the rear and a dual disc brake setup at the front Royal Enfield Himalayan 750 details The latest spy shots show a test mule fitted with additional sensors, indicating ongoing engineering and durability testing. This Himalayan appears to be equipped with a new engine, and Royal Enfield will likely use the more powerful motor on what will be its biggest and largest motorcycle to date. While the production model’s final specs are yet to be confirmed, the mule appears closer to production-ready, providing a look at the design as well as some features that are likely to make it to the final version.   The Himalayan 750 will likely be built on a brand-new platform that won’t be shared with Royal Enfield’s current 650cc line-up, including the Interceptor 650, Continental GT 650, Super Meteor 650, and Shotgun 650. It will be powered by a brand-new motor that will produce more power and torque than the existing 648cc twin-cylinder engine, which makes 47hp and 52Nm. This motor is likely to debut in the next-gen Interceptor and Continental GT, which have both been spied testing. Notably, the test motorcycle features a fully adjustable inverted fork at the front and a mono-shock at the rear. It has a different semi-fairing, which helps to distinguish the larger Himalayan from its single-cylinder counterpart. The larger Himalayan is also expected to receive an updated TFT, which seems to be a rectangular unit compared to the current circular display. Additionally, it will also get all-LED lighting, with a similar headlight and tail-light unit featured in the outgoing Royal Enfield Himalayan. The spied motorcycle also sports a new braking system with twin front discs and Bybre-branded callipers. The Himalayan 750 appears to be equipped with a 19-inch front wheel and a 17-inch rear wheel, both featuring wire spokes. It remains to be seen if Royal Enfield will equip the bike with tubeless wheels as standard.   The Himalayan 750 launch is still some time away, although we may see the first bikes with this new, larger engine make their debut later in 2025. Currently, Royal Enfield’s adventure line-up comprises only the Himalayan 450, which costs Rs 2.98 lakh (ex-showroom, Chennai).
