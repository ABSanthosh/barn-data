Finished in Grigio Antares over black leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 6.0-liter V12 mated to a five-speed manual transmission and a Viscous Traction all-wheel-drive system with front and rear limited-slip differentials. Equipment includes an adjustable suspension, a Quicksilver exhaust system, anti-lock brakes, 18″ Speedline alloy wheels, fixed headlights, scissor doors, adjustable bucket seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, and automatic climate control. This Diablo VT 6.0 is offered in California with manufacturer’s literature, service records, a tool kit, a Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC. The Diablo was initially designed by Marcello Gandini and was restyled for the VT model with enlarged intakes at the front and rear of the car. For the 2000 and 2001 model years, the 6.0 was further refined with larger air intakes in the front fascia, smoothed body lines, and a reworked rear wing. This example is finished in Grigio Antares, and additional features include scissor doors and fog lights as well as fixed composite headlights sourced from the contemporary Z32 Nissan 300ZX. The Carfax report shows an undated accident that likely occurred between September 2012 and November 2013, which the seller attributes to a garage door incident. The right quarter panel has been refinished. The 18″ Speedline alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The car was optioned with an adjustable suspension, and stopping power is provided by an anti-lock system with multi-piston Brembo calipers over cross-drilled rotors. The brake cooling ducts, front brake lines, emergency brake cable, and brake handle gear were replaced under current ownership. The cockpit features adjustable bucket seats trimmed in black leather upholstery along with a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, and door panels. Equipment includes dual airbags, automatic climate control, a rear-view camera, and power windows, mirrors, and door locks. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is paired with a dogleg-pattern gated shifter and frames a 220-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 22k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership. The 6.0-liter V12 was factory rated at 543 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensors, oxygen sensor, and spark plugs were replaced under current ownership. Power is routed to all four wheels via a five-speed manual transmission, front and rear limited-slip differentials, and a Viscous Traction all-wheel-drive system. Catalytic converter bypass pipes and a Quicksilver exhaust system have been installed, and the clutch slave cylinder was replaced in 2024. Service records, a tool kit, manufacturer’s literature, and the removed catalytic converters will accompany the sale. The Carfax report lists the aforementioned undated accident. Various aftermarket exhaust components installed are not CARB-compliant, therefore, it cannot be sold to a California private party buyer. You are not connected to real-time updates.
