  "text": "This 2006 Ferrari F430 Spider is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 linked with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronic limited-slip differential, and it has been fitted with Fabspeed Motorsport exhaust headers and high-flow catalytic converters as well as an Alpine touchscreen infotainment unit connected to a custom sound system. Finished in Rosso Corsa over tan leather, the car is further equipped with a black convertible soft top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, and 19″ alloy wheels in addition to power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats, automatic climate control, and carbon-fiber interior trim. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2024, and it now has 46k miles. Previously listed on BaT in August 2024, this F430 is now offered at no reserve in Florida with a car cover, a tool kit, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title. The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features a black soft top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, side air intakes, and quad exhaust finishers exiting on either side of the carbon-fiber rear diffuser. The left door actuator was replaced in 2023, and the selling dealer states that the rear bumper cover has been refinished. A September 2023 invoice notes the convertible top elastic straps are broken. This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in October 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded. The 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with staggered-width Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by red-finished calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors, and a brake fluid flush was performed in 2023. The power-adjustable Daytona-style seats are upholstered in tan leather with red piping and embossed Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests. Carbon-fiber trim accents the dashboard and center console, and additional appointments include automatic climate control, a wind deflector, machined aluminum pedal covers, a rearview camera, and Alpine touchscreen infotainment linked to a JL Audio amplifier, Rockford Fosgate speakers, and a trunk-mounted subwoofer. The soft-touch coating on the ashtray and interior door handles is worn, the driver sill plate has a ding, and the leather is warped on the right side of the dashboard. The leather-wrapped steering wheel features an engine-start button and a manettino dial for controlling dynamic settings. Instrumentation consists of a central yellow-dial tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 46k miles. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system as well as Fabspeed Motorsport headers and high-flow catalytic converters. The battery, mass airflow sensor, oxygen sensor, and catalytic converter temperature sensors were replaced in November 2023. An oil change was most recently carried out in September 2023, and a broken exhaust stud and mount are noted on the record from that service visit. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. Work since 2022 included flushing the F1 hydraulic fluid, changing the transaxle fluid, and replacing the flywheel and clutch assembly. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage.
