The entry-level Utility model comes with a choice or two- and four-wheel drive and can be had as a single-, extended- or double-cab vehicle, from as little as £33,000 including VAT (which many pick-up buyers either don't pay or can can claim back).

The sales split between the automatic and manual stands at roughly 50:50. Verdict New styling and equipment features are fripperies, really, on Isuzu’s slightly crude but tough and dependable workhorse. GoodFeels as sturdy as it looksBacked by great warrantyCheaper than rivalsBadUnrefined, gruff diesel engineSlightly crude, fidgety rideLacks torque relative to key rivals DESIGN \u0026 STYLING6 Pros Looks purposeful and contemporary, if a bit brutishDoesn't sacrifice function for formHas a 3.5-tonne towing capacity Cons Looks slightly less distinctive than rivalsEngine offers less torque than key rivals' Four years ago, the D-Max got a fairly major technical overhaul as it entered a new generation, including a lighter yet stiffer ladder frame, an improved front-axle design and a longer wheelbase. And now the Mk3 model has been given a second dose of cosmetic, electronic and equipment tweaks. At the front, there’s a new bonnet, radiator grille and bumper design; at the rear, there are more upmarket-looking tail-lights. Inside, the D-Max’s multimedia technology has been upgraded throughout the line-up, giving owners wireless smartphone mirroring on every model and part-digital instruments on the range-topper. Only the cheapest single-cab D-Max comes without a switchable, mechanical four-wheel drive system with transfer gearing and a locking rear differential. All are still powered by Isuzu’s 162bhp 1.9-litre four-cylinder turbo diesel engine. The engine's air intakes accommodate an 800mm wading depth, with tougher underbody protection and additional electronic aids such as hill descent control and the 'shift on the fly' four-wheel drive system fitted as standard on almost all derivatives. Pros Competitive with rivals on four-seater spaceImproved infotainment and stereoMaterials and buttons feel hard-wearing... Cons ...but plastics are scratchy and shinyAttempts to add richness and quality fall a bit flatNew digital gauges aren't as readable as traditional ones The double-cab D-Max is about as roomy, for passengers in both front and rear, as any one-tonne pick-up's. The front seats are a little hard and lacking in some adjustment ranges but comfortable enough. Adults can travel in either row and won't feel short-changed for space. The top-tier V-Cross version’s cloth-and-leather seats and wider mix of materials are shinier and cheaper-looking than some in the pickup class, but they needn’t offend anyone. The automatic-transmission version, meanwhile, swaps the chunkier, simpler heater-control knobs of the manual for a console of smaller, neater-looking climate-control buttons, which are no doubt supposed to look more sophisticated but don’t really suit the car and are fiddlier to use. The D-Max's infotainment systems have been upgraded across the range, with cheaper models getting a larger 8.0in system and DL40 and V-Cross models an improved 9.0in setup. Both offer wireless smartphone mirroring, and upper-tier models also have wireless device charging. The system looks quite graphically crude and still lags behind rivals' for responsiveness, but its top-level navigability is decent, allowing you to turn off bothersome ADAS quickly and easily. Storage space is generally quite good, with two gloveboxes and cupholders as large as the door bins. There's also a handy space mounted on the cabin roof for sunglasses, or indeed fishing permits. ENGINES \u0026 PERFORMANCE5 Pros Impressive towing capacityAutomatic makes the driving experience easier and smootherIt's not so heavy that reduced UK speed limits apply to it Cons Engine is gruff and unrefinedFlat spots in the lower and upper reaches are frustrating Starting the D-Max for the first time, you're met with that familiar mechanical clatter associated with agricultural four-pot diesel engines. There's no getting away from the fact that this is not a refined lump. It produces 162bhp and 266lb ft of torque, which is less than most pick-ups in the class can call on, and you feel as much on the road. The engine’s relatively modest torque just doesn’t move the D-Max’s bulk along as willingly as, say, a Toyota Hilux's torqiuer diesel - which obliges you to work the engine harder than you might and leaves you more exposed to its coarseness. At a motorway cruise and in higher gears, the engine settles a little and becomes less intrusive but, despite measures taken by Isuzu to reduce noise, vibration and harshness, it's as rough as the terrain it wants to drive on under load and clunky in stop/start traffic. Another gripe we have is that the start/stop system isn’t very well integrated, shutting the engine down with too much force and vibration and then taking a while to kick in again when you want to set off. RIDE \u0026 HANDLING5 Pros Feels stable at all speeds and on all terrainsStrong and progressive brakesReasonable on-road grip and body control Cons Busy, fidgety, firm low-speed rideImprecise steering Just as the D-Max's diesel engine lends it a certain roughness of dynamic character, there's likewise some fiddling, stiff-legged crudeness to the D-Max’s on-road ride - more than the best-mannered pick-ups now suffer from. It handles precisely enough, though, and is by no means wayward or unpleasant to drive. There's a reassuring level of stability whether it be on the motorway or in town. The D-Max doesn't wander under power or heavy braking and the rear axle doesn't bounce or feel too stiff over ruts and imperfections. The brakes themselves feel strong enough and progressive, despite there only being drums on the rear axle. The steering, meanwhile, has a vagueness that doesn't work so much in its favour on-road as off, which stems from the flex of its ladder-frame chassis and the influence of its high-sidewall hybrid offroad tyres. So you find yourself having to guess a little at how much lock to put on to go round a given corner or roundabout. But after a while, it's easy to get used to. The low-speed ride can get quite busy, particularly on poorer road surfaces, which means the higher level of relative comfort on offer in the Ford Ranger will be more appealing. Also worth a mention is its turning circle which, at 12.5m, is tigher than some rivals. For reference, the Ranger’s turning circle is 12.7m, while the Volkswagen Amarok’s is 12.9m. In off-road driving, the D-Max’s standard-fit mud-and-snow tyres give it plenty of grip and capability and a new Rough Terrain mode for the electronic traction control helps it through really slippery and steep sections. At times, just as on the road, the engine feels a little short on grunt, but not often. MPG \u0026 RUNNING COSTS6 Pros Cheaper to buy than its rivalsCompetitive fuel economy Cons While capable and decently equipped, the basic model certainly feels basic One of the most obvious selling points for the D-Max is its starting price, which undercuts most of its direct rivals', and that includes higher trim levels, such as the V-Cross. At the other end of the spectrum, the Utility version still comes with enough kit to make it comfortable enough to live with and can be secured for less than £33,000, even allowing for VAT.  Worth noting is that all D-Maxes come with a five-year/125,000-mile warranty, five years of roadside assistance and a 12-year anti-corrosion warranty. As for its running costs, we're not yet certain of its real-world economy, but we saw an average of 35.7mpg over 70 miles of stop-start off-roading and motorway driving, which beats Isuzu's claimed figure. By comparison, the Ford Ranger claims up to 44mpg, the Volkswagen Amarok 36mpg and the Ineos Grenadier Quartermaster 21.5mpg. Verdict New styling and equipment features are fripperies, really, on Isuzu’s slightly crude but tough and dependable workhorse. GoodFeels as sturdy as it looksBacked by great warrantyCheaper than rivalsBadUnrefined, gruff diesel engineSlightly crude, fidgety rideLacks torque relative to key rivals While the D-Max's packaging and peripheral stuff has changed a little here, the slightly rough, tough and rudimentary pick-up underneath hasn’t, which for those who rate it - and given the reasons they do - probably isn’t such bad news after all. Isuzu will continue to try to compete with more desirable pick-ups with its V-Cross and niche hardcore off-roading D-Maxes, but in our view, it isn't in a great position to win that battle, due to the slightly coarse, tough and unrefined character of the base vehicle. But at a simpler level and lower price, the D-Max offers plenty. Being both cheaper to buy and just as capable off-road as its more conventional rivals from Ford and Volkswagen, it still offers lots of equipment for the money, along with that measure of utilitarian, back-to-basics toughness and dependability that returning D-Max buyers will look for. And aside from the rather vague steering, Isuzu’s focus on the D-Max’s handling has made it a little more competent on the road than it predecessors. It can’t match the likes of the Ranger or Amarok for handling sophistication or rolling refinement, but for its price, buyers may not expect it to – and the Toyota Hilux is, in its way, little better-mannered. The D-Max has all of its key selling points - ruggedness, durability and usability - well covered and should maintain its reputation as a highly rated, value-for-money workhorse.
