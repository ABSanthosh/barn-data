  "description": "This Rosso Siviglia 1987 Lamborghini Countach 5000 QV was first sold by Maurice Carter Lamborghini of Hamilton, Ontario, and remained with its original owner until it was purchased by the owner of a Canadian restoration shop in 2013. An ensuing refurbishment was completed in 2015, after which the car was imported to the US where it won a Best of Marque award at the 2015 Concorso Italiano. It was inspected and driven by former Lamborghini chief test driver Valentino Balboni in August 2022, and it sold on BaT the same month. Power comes from a rebuilt, fuel-injected 5.2L quad-cam V12 paired with a five-speed manual transmission, and features include servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, an independent suspension with quad rear coilovers, staggered-width 15” OZ alloy wheels, a V-shaped rear wing, air conditioning, black leather upholstery, and an Alpine cassette player. It is now offered by the selling dealer in New York with factory books, tools, refurbishment photos and records, a framed photo of the car, driving gloves, a coffee table book containing photos of the car signed by Valentino Balboni, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title.",

An ensuing refurbishment was completed in 2015, after which the car was imported to the US where it won a Best of Marque award at the 2015 Concorso Italiano. It was inspected and driven by former Lamborghini chief test driver Valentino Balboni in August 2022, and it sold on BaT the same month. Power comes from a rebuilt, fuel-injected 5.2L quad-cam V12 paired with a five-speed manual transmission, and features include servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes, an independent suspension with quad rear coilovers, staggered-width 15” OZ alloy wheels, a V-shaped rear wing, air conditioning, black leather upholstery, and an Alpine cassette player. It is now offered by the selling dealer in New York with factory books, tools, refurbishment photos and records, a framed photo of the car, driving gloves, a coffee table book containing photos of the car signed by Valentino Balboni, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title. Introduced as a prototype in 1971, the Countach was designed by Bertone’s Marcello Gandini with angular wedge-shaped styling and scissor doors. The car features a tubular steel space frame under aluminum bodywork as well as NACA ducts aft of the doors and air intakes above the rear quarters. The 5000 QV model debuted in 1985 and utilized Kevlar front and rear deck lids. This example was originally finished in Rosso Siviglia and was stripped before it was repainted in its factory color during the 2010s work. Equipment includes European-market bumpers and lighting, a quad-exit exhaust, a V-shaped rear wing, Vitaloni side-view mirrors, and Carello fog lights. The 15″ Ruote OZ wheels feature Lamborghini center caps and are mounted with 225/50 front and 345/35 rear Pirelli P Zero Asimmetrico tires showing 2007 and 2011 date codes. A silver OZ Racing wheel with a Michelin tire is mounted in the front trunk. The Countach features a fully independent suspension with quad rear coilovers and rack-and-pinion steering. Stopping power is provided by servo-assisted ventilated disc brakes at all four corners. The cockpit features fixed-back seats trimmed in black leather, a matching dashboard, center console, door panels, and sills, and gray carpets. Additional equipment includes air conditioning, an Alpine cassette stereo, and a gated shifter. Valentino Balboni signed the driver-side door jamb in August 2022. The leather-wrapped Raid steering wheel frames a 320-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer indicates 19k kilometers (~12k miles). The Giotto Bizzarrini-designed 5.2-liter V12 features a 60° cylinder bank angle, four valves per cylinder, and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. It was factory rated at 414 horsepower. The engine was rebuilt by Newman Automotive R\u0026D of Minesing, Ontario, in 2014 and fitted with new gaskets, valve shims, a thermostat, a water neck seal, and an ignition rotor at that time. The selling dealer changed fluids. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the former of which is mounted in the middle of the car, ahead of the engine.
