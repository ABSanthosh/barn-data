  "text": "This is one of the very few naturally aspirated Alpina B2s believed to have been produced in the 1970s 1 hour ago by Brad Anderson The classic Alpina sports a 3.0-liter naturally-aspirated straight-six with 230 hp. As part of a restoration, the car was resprayed in Fjord Blue with 14-inch wheels. While the car has almost 93,000 miles on the clock, the interior looks immaculate. If you’re the kind of person who stops mid-scroll for a classic BMW, this one deserves your full attention. Alpina has a long history of turning already excellent BMWs into something even more special, and the lineup speaks for itself: from the iconic C1 and B7 S Turbo to the flamboyant 3.0 CSL “Batmobile” and recent high-performance models like the XB7 and D3 S Touring. Among these standouts, the 1976 BMW B2 Alpina holds its own as a rare and desirable classic. A fully restored B2 will soon cross the block at Mecum Auctions, and anyone with a soft spot for old-school performance saloons should take note. This car holds a special place in Alpina history and is often recognized by enthusiasts as the first truly high-performance BMW saloon, long before the M5 became a thing. Read: New B8 GT Is Alpina’s Most Powerful Car Ever And Last One Before BMW Takes Over The B2 began life as a BMW E12 528, originally launched in 1975. Alpina transformed it with a 3.0-liter naturally aspirated straight-six engine, enhanced with three double-barrel carburetors, forged pistons, a revised combustion chamber, and a reworked crankshaft. The result is a solid 230 horsepower at 6,750 rpm and 195 lb-ft (265 Nm) of torque at 4,500 rpm. Not bad for the mid-1970s, and still respectable today. Mecum Auctions While Mecum hasn’t shared much about the car’s early life, it does note that this B2 underwent a full rotisserie restoration. During that process, the car was resprayed in Fjord Blue and now comes complete with blue and green stripes on the front, sides, and rear. It also sits on lightweight 14-inch Alpina wheels clad in new tires. The engine, transmission, steering, suspension, and rear axle were also rebuilt as part of the restoration, meaning this B2 should drive just as well now as it did when it was fresh out of Alpina’s factory. Not only is the exterior, engine bay, and undertray of the Alpina absolutely immaculate, but the interior is also in excellent condition, even though the car has 148,936 km (92,544 miles) on the clock. There’s an Alpina instrument cluster, fabric seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and wooden trimmings on the door panels, dashboard, and shifter. According to the auction house, this is one of just a handful of naturally-aspirated B2s that Alpina built back in the day, and it’s bound to attract plenty of interest at auction. If you’re tempted, and let’s be honest, it’s hard not to be, you can check out the full listing on Mecum’s site over here and prepare your best poker face. Good luck. Mecum Auctions",
