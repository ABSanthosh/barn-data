The car has spent time in New York and Florida where the current owner purchased it in 2019, and it now has 3,200 miles. Power is provided by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, and a rear diffuser. This Heritage Edition GT is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a clean Carfax report and a clean Florida title in the owner’s name. The GT took inspiration from the GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features an extruded-aluminum space frame, roll-bonded floors, and aluminum body panels. The Heritage Edition included a Gulf-inspired blue and orange livery similar to that worn by the 1968 and 1969 Le Mans-winning GT40. Additional equipment includes Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and rubber mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The left and right airbag assemblies were replaced in November 2020, per the Carfax report. The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. The steering wheel center emblem has a blemish. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 3,200 miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Koons Sterling Ford of Sterling, Virginia, along with factory colors, equipment, and a total MSRP of $174,595.
