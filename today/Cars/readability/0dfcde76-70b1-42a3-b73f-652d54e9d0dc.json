  "description": "This 1957 Spohn DV-13 convertible is one of what is believed to be fewer than two dozen custom cars built by Hermann Spohn Karosseriebau in Ravensburg, Germany, on commission for American soldiers stationed overseas following World War II. The car was purchased by its current owners, Wayne Carini and Ralph Marano, from the Miami-based Dezer Collection in 2012, at which time it appeared on an episode of Chasing Classic Cars. The car subsequently won the Camille Jenatzy Award for the \"most audacious exterior\" at the 2013 Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance before appearing at the 2014 Boca Raton Concours and appearing at the AACA Library. Based on the chassis of a 1939 Ford, the car features American-inspired steel bodywork finished in red and is powered by a 331ci Cadillac V8. Additional equipment includes a four-barrel carburetor, a Ford three-speed manual transmission, hydraulic drum brakes, 16” wheels with red-painted covers, a black convertible top, and black upholstery over seats for four. This Spohn custom roadster is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve in Portland, Connecticut, with a set of spare gauges and a clean New Jersey title.",

The car subsequently won the Camille Jenatzy Award for the “most audacious exterior” at the 2013 Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance before appearing at the 2014 Boca Raton Concours and appearing at the AACA Library. Based on the chassis of a 1939 Ford, the car features American-inspired steel bodywork finished in red and is powered by a 331ci Cadillac V8. Additional equipment includes a four-barrel carburetor, a Ford three-speed manual transmission, hydraulic drum brakes, 16” wheels with red-painted covers, a black convertible top, and black upholstery over seats for four. This Spohn custom roadster is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve in Portland, Connecticut, with a set of spare gauges and a clean New Jersey title. Hermann Spohn Karosseriebau was established in Ravensburg, Germany, in 1920 and soon after became the preferred coachbuilder for nearby luxury automaker Maybach, while also supplying bodies for Mercedes-Benz, Hispano-Suiza, and other high-end marques. After repairing military vehicles during World War II, Spohn re-emerged as a coachbuilder in the 1940s under the ownership of the son of one of the company’s co-founders, Josef Eiwanger Jr. Between the late 1940s and the company’s demise in 1957, Spohn constructed a variety of custom bodies to design specifications chosen by US soldiers, with inspiration often drawn from American concepts such as the 1951 General Motors Le Sabre concept. This example’s styling elements include a steeply raked nose with staggered-depth lights, split front bumpers, a concave oval grille above a rectangular vent, a hood scoop, triple portholes along each fender, tailfins with bright vertical accents, triple taillights, a central rear lamp at the end of a nacelle-style contour, and dual exhaust outlets passing through the rear bumpers. A black convertible top can be stowed under a matching boot. Areas of the red paint exhibit crazing, and a dent is present in the left-front bumper. Wheels with silver-painted spokes and bright rims wear body-color covers with bright “V8”-branded centers and are wrapped in 7.00-16 Lester tires. Stopping is handled by hydraulic drum brakes all around. The left-hand-drive cabin is trimmed in black upholstery over the front bucket seats, rear bench, and door panels. Features include color-keyed carpeting, roll-up windows, a lockable glovebox, and a dashboard-mounted cigar lighter and ashtray. The banjo-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a bright dashboard fascia that houses a 140-mph speedometer and ancillary gauges, two of which have worn dial faces. The five-digit odometer shows 40k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. A set of replacement gauges is included in the sale. The 331ci OHV V8 is said to have been sourced from a 1953 Cadillac and breathes through a four-barrel carburetor. Fluid changes and a tune-up were performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Ford three-speed manual transmission. Suspension incorporates solid axles, transverse leaf springs, and triangulated torsion bars at front and rear.
