It is powered by a 3.6-liter V8 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Rosso Corsa over Beige leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable seats, a gated shifter, a CD stereo, a Hi-Fi sound system, and automatic climate control. This 360 Modena is now offered in New Jersey by the selling dealer with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title. The Pininfarina-designed aluminum body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable side mirrors, and quad exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. The 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires that were installed in January 2024 and measure 215/45 in front and 275/40 out back. Stopping power is from black-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at each corner. The cockpit features power-adjustable seats upholstered in Beige leather along with matching door panel inserts and carpets. Amenities include a gated shifter, a CD stereo, a Hi-Fi sound system, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control. An air conditioning system line was replaced in March 2023. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a digital fuel level readout and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 10k miles, approximately 20 of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 395 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service was completed in January 2021, the fuel pumps were replaced in March 2023, and an oil change was performed and the starter and battery were replaced in January 2024. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The window sticker shows initial delivery to Wide World of Cars in Spring Valley, New York, and lists factory colors, equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $157,084.
