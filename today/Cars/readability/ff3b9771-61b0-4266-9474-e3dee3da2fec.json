The car has remained registered on the East Coast since new and now has 40k miles. Equipment includes a black soft top, a Magnaflow cat-back exhaust, a head-up display, carbon-fiber interior trim, Enhanced Premium Sound, soft-close doors, 19″ Style 167M wheels, adaptive xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable front seats, Comfort Access, and iDrive with navigation. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this E64 M6 is now offered with a window sticker, a car cover, a December 2024 Blackstone Laboratories oil report, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title. The car is finished in Monaco Blue Metallic and features a power-operated black convertible soft top as well as M-specific body styling. Additional equipment includes adaptive xenon headlights with washers as well as soft-close doors, front and rear parking sensors, M6 fender badging, and quad exhaust outlets. Staggered-width 19″ Style 167M alloy wheels are mounted with 255/40 front and 285/35 rear Continental ExtremeContact DWS06 Plus tires said to have been installed in preparation for the sale. The M6 featured revised suspension geometry and stiffer bushings front and rear when compared to the standard 6-Series and was also factory-equipped with Electronic Damping Control (EDC), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and M Dynamic Mode. Braking is handled by four-wheel vented and cross-drilled rotors measuring 14.7″ and 14.6″ front and rear, respectively. The heated power-adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in Portland Brown Merino leather that extends to the center console and door panel inserts. The factory wood trim has been replaced with carbon-fiber trim, and amenities include a head-up display, Enhanced Premium Sound, Comfort Access, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, and iDrive with navigation. The multi-function leather-wrapped steering wheel features tri-color stitching and frames a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for oil temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 40k miles. The 5.0-liter S85B50 V10 was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a Variable M Differential Lock. The transmission fluid was changed in preparation for the sale. A Magnaflow cat-back exhaust system is installed. The window sticker notes initial delivery to Prestige BMW in New Jersey and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total suggested retail price of $116,970. A car cover and a December 2024 Blackstone Laboratories oil report are also included with the car. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
