Additional equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes, a power sunroof, heated power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, power accessories, and a JVC Bluetooth stereo. This W201 shows 70k miles and is offered by the seller on behalf of their wife with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The 190 underwent a facelift for the 1989 model year, including different side body cladding and revised front and rear valences. This example is finished in Signal Red (568) and has been fitted with a body kit, a three-piece rear spoiler, and Euro-specification headlights and front indicators. Additional features include a single panoramic windshield wiper, a power sunroof, asymmetrical side mirrors, and deep-ribbed taillights. Staggered-width 17″ Zauber three-piece wheels are mounted with 205/40 front and 215/40 rear Yokohama ADVAN Fleva tires. The car features a MacPherson strut front and five-link rear suspension with H\u0026R lowering springs, and braking is handled by antilock discs at all four corners. The heated power-adjustable front bucket seats and rear bench are upholstered in Cream Beige MB-Tex, and Zebrano wood trim accents the center stack and console. Appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, central locking, power windows, and a JVC Bluetooth stereo. The seller notes that the air conditioning system was reconditioned and recharged in October 2023. An AMG Italvolanti steering wheel fronts a 140-mph speedometer and a 7k-rpm tachometer with an inset analog clock as well as gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and instant fuel economy. The six-digit odometer shows 70k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. The 2.6-liter SOHC inline-six was factory rated at 158 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes that the coolant was flushed, the oil was changed, and the fuel accumulator, distributor, pressure regulator, pumps, filters, and injectors and seals were replaced in October 2023 along with the following components: Timing cover seal Spark plugs Ignition wires Distributor cap and rotor Thermostat Coolant reservoir and level sensor Idle air control valve Intake boot and hoses Vacuum lines Drive belts Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission.
