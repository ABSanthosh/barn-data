  "description": "Over three generations, the BMW X3 cemented its reputation as the most fun to drive among the midsize luxury SUVs. This fourth-generation model changes tack by putting the focus on comfort. More chill, slightly less thrill, if you will. That’s not a bad thing because the end result is the most rounded X3 yet and one that should be of great interest to buyers in India. 2025 BMW X3 exterior design Styling is not as polarising as past few BMWs Unlike the latest lot of Bimmers that seem styled to polarise, the new X3 will find readier acceptance from many quarters. There’s a link to older X3s in the long bonnet stance and upward sweep of the glasshouse, but the tight skinning devoid of too many cuts and creases is new-age BMW. The X3 looks well-defined and muscular without relying on overt cues to establish it as such. Illuminated grille is standard on new X3 Not to say that the X3 doesn’t have its shouty bits. The iconic kidney grille occupies significant real estate on the nose, and for added effect, it features diagonally arranged bars and glows, too. The LED outline for the grille might seem kitsch, but it does give BMWs an unmistakable light signature. The headlamps, which slickly sweep back with the bonnet line, are also home to cool blue detailing. Notably, India gets the X3 only in the M Sport guise. Edgy detailing for the flush set front bumper, sporty 19-inch rims and a diffuser-like panel at the back do their bit to up the show value. Illuminated surround for kidney grille: a distinctive light signature on new BMWs. The latest X3 positions the rear number plate down on the bumper, a treatment we had seen on the X3’s coupe cousin, the X4, which, interestingly, isn’t due for replacement. Chunky tail-lights that taper as they move inwards (no light bar business here) give the X3 its distinctive tail end, and what will also grab your attention are the roof spoiler and wind deflectors that line the rear windscreen. X3 is longer, wider and taller than Mercedes-Benz GLC and Audi Q5 The latest X3 might not look so, but it has grown a crucial few millimetres in every dimension. It’s now marginally longer, wider and taller than its German compatriots, though the Mercedes-Benz GLC has a slightly longer wheelbase. Under the skin, the X3 continues on BMW’s rear-biased CLAR platform, but the suspension and steering have been redone for enhanced comfort. Also new is the footwear. The latest X3 dumps run-flat tyres for standard tubeless ones. More on this in a bit. 2025 BMW X3 interior Lighting has been used to great effect in the X3. Cabin feels open and airy. The X3’s doors can be locked/unlocked with the standard key, a tap of an NFC card or a transferable ‘digital key’ on your mobile phone. In either case, your first points of contact are the concealed door handles that are good for aero but don’t feel quite as nice to hold as grab-type handles would. You will, however, appreciate how easy the X3 is to get into and the general ambience inside. Yes, there are familiar BMW aggregates, such as the sloping dash and the curved display, but the interior stylists have done well to give the X3’s cabin a flavour of its own. Ambient lighting used to great effect You’ll see the X3’s interior in its best light at night. The ambient lighting package comprises a light bar on the dash, an illuminated surround for the centre console and lit panels on the front doors. The effect is really cool, and what’s also nice is how the lighting is used to communicate warnings and alerts, such as a door opening. Adding distinction to the X3’s cabin is the material of choice for the dashtop and door panels. Made from recycled polyester, it’s a break from traditional materials, but its knitted texture could be a task to keep clean in our dusty conditions. Knitted material on dashboard made from recycled polyester. Interestingly, leather wrapping for the chunky M Sport steering wheel aside, the rest of the cabin is made from manmade materials. While the leather-like upholstery is convincing, many plastics lower down aren’t in line with the X3’s price. Even the island-like panels on the front doors with haptic controllers for side air vent flow and lock/unlock buttons look better than they are to use. Simply put, the cabin is not as opulent as the GLC’s. 2025 BMW X3 features Feature highlights includes largest in segment panoramic glass roof Panoramic glass roof gets full-length mesh cover. Where the X3 goes the distance is its equipment. Headlining the features list is the largest-in-class panoramic glass roof. The vibrant 12.3-inch digital dials come complemented by a nicely executed head-up display, while the 14.9-inch centre touchscreen is also your display for the crisp 360-degree cameras and augmented reality navigation (it only works with the on-board maps). However, as we’ve said before, the centre screen packs in too much content, and the need to rely on the screen for basic functions like blower speed settings is an unnecessary distraction. BMW’s latest OS 9 does allow greater customisation to put frequently used functions as widgets, but it only helps so much. Of the other items, the 750W Harman Kardon sound system is particularly nice. 2025 BMW X3 comfort and space Sporty front seats pack in ventilation and side bolster adjust Front-seat comfort gets a big thumbs up. The seats are well-cushioned and contoured and offer a good degree of fine-tuning with electric lumbar and side-bolstering adjust, as well as manual thigh-support extension.  There’s front-seat ventilation, too. Rear seat is comfy but best for two occupants There’s ample legroom at the back. Seat is comfy, but backrest angle is fixed. Rear-seat passengers, however, will have to contend with fixed seating. The backrest recline is missed, particularly since the seatback feels a touch upright. On the whole, though, the seating position is comfy, with ample thigh support and kneeroom. A fold-down armrest, a dedicated zone for climate control, manual sunblinds, and an iPad mount (available as an accessory) up the experience at the back. Tall occupants will find the headroom just adequate, while the high centre tunnel eats into middle passenger foot space. Spare tyre gets dedicated compartment below luggage area 570-litre boot is well-shaped. Spare tyre now sits in dedicated bay under floor. The X3 offers loads of storage for small items. The open bay at the base of the dash is home to a wireless charger and two cup holders; there’s a handy box between the front seats, and the door pockets are usefully large. You will have to stuff items into the small glove box, though. The space for larger items has seen a big upgrade with this generation of X3. What helps greatly is a dedicated area for the space-saver spare tyre under the boot floor (the last X3 carried its spare within the boot), so you get a well-shaped 570-litre luggage bay. The 40:20:40 split seats give the flexibility to transport oddly shaped items or open up more luggage capacity. 2025 BMW X3 engines and gearboxes Petrol and diesel engines assisted by 48V mild-hybrid systems The diesel engine beats the petrol unit in terms of output. Like the last X3, the new model can be had with a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol engine or a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel. The thing is, the petrol engine is no longer offered in high-strung 252hp and 350Nm ‘30i’ form but in a milder ‘20’ tune, which brings power and torque down to 190hp and 310Nm. The figures are well shy of what rival petrol models offer, which is a shame. Perhaps BMW is saving the hot X3 M50 with its sonorous straight-six for ardent petrolheads. The 20d diesel featured here is more convincing if you aren’t spooked by the government’s anti-diesel stance, that is. Its 197hp and 400Nm figures are par for the course for this class of SUV, and there’s also the helping hand of a 48V mild-hybrid system that chips in with 11hp and 25Nm under hard load. The other number of interest? 17.6kpl official fuel economy. X3 diesel’s official fuel economy figure is 17.6kpl It’s an engine that’s easy to warm up to. Refinement is particularly impressive, and at average city speeds, you’ll not hear much from the engine bay. Even when pushed, the engine doesn’t sound coarse or strained. Also likeable is the build of power. There’s ready power when you need it and a sustained pull should you find the road to really press down hard on the accelerator. What is missed is that spike in the mid-range, which made BMW’s older diesels particularly exciting. Sadly, that’s the case with all modern diesels calibrated to comply with stringent emission norms. X3 diesel does 0-100kph acceleration run in 7.4 seconds That said, the new X3 diesel’s 7.4 seconds 0-100kph time makes it quicker than the last-gen X3 diesel (8.65 seconds to 100kph) as well as the new Mercedes GLC 220d, which does the 0-100kph dash in 7.8 seconds. The BMW has a slight edge in kickdown acceleration, too. As always, the 8-speed automatic transmission plays its supporting role really well, effortlessly shuffling through the gears depending on your requirements. You really won’t find yourself reaching for the paddles to get the most out of the engine or gearbox. When you do want a quick burst of power, a long pull on the left paddle shifter will engage the Sport mode for 10 seconds. 2025 BMW X3 ride and handling Adaptive suspension is standard fit The diesel engine is very refined even when pushed hard. If there’s one area in which the X3 has taken the biggest stride, it’s ride comfort. The new X3 feels pliant at low speeds, whereas the last one felt jiggly, and while there is some body movement over undulations, ride comfort has improved to the extent it could just be class-best. Adaptive suspension that varies damping force depending on drive conditions is standard, and it also gives drivers the option to toggle between Comfort and Sport settings. Sport mode does tighten things up and helps keep body control in check at faster speeds. Suspension setup aside, a key ingredient in this change of character is the move away from hard sidewall run-flat tyres to more absorbent tubeless ones. The added ‘give’ allows the X3 to do a better job of filtering shocks from the surface below. New X3 switches from run-flats to regular tubeless tyres. The new X3 changes direction smoothly and effortlessly without feeling quite as pointy as its predecessor, 50:50 weight distribution and rear-biased all-wheel drive notwithstanding. There’s good connect at the steering at all times, and the planted feel means you can confidently carry high speeds. Braking power is good, too. Camera and radar-based ADAS features are included The X3 also packs in radar and camera-based ADAS functions. Adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and auto braking worked well enough on well-marked roads but are best thought of as an added safety net rather than features to rely completely on.    2025 BMW X3 price and verdict The new X3 range starts at Rs 75.8 lakh (ex-showroom, India) for the petrol, while this diesel comes in at Rs 77.8 lakh. Pricing is at par with the Mercedes GLC, which is currently the midsize luxury SUV to beat. The latest X3 does a lot of things right. It’s got the right look, it’s got the wow elements inside, and it’s rather nice to drive, too. However, it’s the upped comfort levels that really open it up to a wider buyer base. By retaining most of what we’ve liked about X3s thus far and addressing its biggest weaknesses, BMW has come up with an X3 that’s more complete than it ever was. The one to buy? We’ll have to bring the field of rivals to give the answer but the X3 sure is in the fight for the top spot.

Yes, there are familiar BMW aggregates, such as the sloping dash and the curved display, but the interior stylists have done well to give the X3’s cabin a flavour of its own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAmbient lighting used to great effect\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll see the X3’s interior in its best light at night. The ambient lighting package comprises a light bar on the dash, an illuminated surround for the centre console and lit panels on the front doors. The effect is really cool, and what’s also nice is how the lighting is used to communicate warnings and alerts, such as a door opening. Adding distinction to the X3’s cabin is the material of choice for the dashtop and door panels. Made from recycled polyester, it’s a break from traditional materials, but its knitted texture could be a task to keep clean in our dusty conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250321044325_BMW_X3_Dashboard_Texture.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnitted material on dashboard made from recycled polyester.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, leather wrapping for the chunky M Sport steering wheel aside, the rest of the cabin is made from manmade materials. While the leather-like upholstery is convincing, many plastics lower down aren’t in line with the X3’s price. Even the island-like panels on the front doors with haptic controllers for side air vent flow and lock/unlock buttons look better than they are to use. Simply put, the cabin is not as opulent as the GLC’s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 BMW X3 features\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFeature highlights includes largest in segment panoramic glass roof\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250321044417_BMW_X3_Panoramic_Sunroof.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePanoramic glass roof gets full-length mesh cover.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp class=\"ArticleImage\"\u003eWhere the X3 goes the distance is its equipment. Headlining the features list is the largest-in-class panoramic glass roof. The vibrant 12.3-inch digital dials come complemented by a nicely executed head-up display, while the 14.9-inch centre touchscreen is also your display for the crisp 360-degree cameras and augmented reality navigation (it only works with the on-board maps).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, as we’ve said before, the centre screen packs in too much content, and the need to rely on the screen for basic functions like blower speed settings is an unnecessary distraction. BMW’s latest OS 9 does allow greater customisation to put frequently used functions as widgets, but it only helps so much. Of the other items, the 750W Harman Kardon sound system is particularly nice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 BMW X3 comfort and space\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSporty front seats pack in ventilation and side bolster adjust\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFront-seat comfort gets a big thumbs up.

The backrest recline is missed, particularly since the seatback feels a touch upright. On the whole, though, the seating position is comfy, with ample thigh support and kneeroom. A fold-down armrest, a dedicated zone for climate control, manual sunblinds, and an iPad mount (available as an accessory) up the experience at the back.

You will have to stuff items into the small glove box, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe space for larger items has seen a big upgrade with this generation of X3. What helps greatly is a dedicated area for the space-saver spare tyre under the boot floor (the last X3 carried its spare within the boot), so you get a well-shaped 570-litre luggage bay.

The thing is, the petrol engine is no longer offered in high-strung 252hp and 350Nm ‘30i’ form but in a milder ‘20’ tune, which brings power and torque down to 190hp and 310Nm. The figures are well shy of what rival petrol models offer, which is a shame. Perhaps BMW is saving the hot X3 M50 with its sonorous straight-six for ardent petrolheads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 20d diesel featured here is more convincing if you aren’t spooked by the government’s anti-diesel stance, that is. Its 197hp and 400Nm figures are par for the course for this class of SUV, and there’s also the helping hand of a 48V mild-hybrid system that chips in with 11hp and 25Nm under hard load. The other number of interest? 17.6kpl official fuel economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eX3 diesel’s official fuel economy figure is 17.6kpl\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an engine that’s easy to warm up to. Refinement is particularly impressive, and at average city speeds, you’ll not hear much from the engine bay. Even when pushed, the engine doesn’t sound coarse or strained. Also likeable is the build of power. There’s ready power when you need it and a sustained pull should you find the road to really press down hard on the accelerator. What is missed is that spike in the mid-range, which made BMW’s older diesels particularly exciting. Sadly, that’s the case with all modern diesels calibrated to comply with stringent emission norms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eX3 diesel does 0-100kph acceleration run in 7.4 seconds\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, the new X3 diesel’s 7.4 seconds 0-100kph time makes it quicker than the last-gen X3 diesel (8.65 seconds to 100kph) as well as the new Mercedes GLC 220d, which does the 0-100kph dash in 7.8 seconds. The BMW has a slight edge in kickdown acceleration, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs always, the 8-speed automatic transmission plays its supporting role really well, effortlessly shuffling through the gears depending on your requirements. You really won’t find yourself reaching for the paddles to get the most out of the engine or gearbox. When you do want a quick burst of power, a long pull on the left paddle shifter will engage the Sport mode for 10 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 BMW X3 ride and handling\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAdaptive suspension is standard fit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250321044938_BMW_X3_Rear_Quarter_Tracking.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe diesel engine is very refined even when pushed hard.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf there’s one area in which the X3 has taken the biggest stride, it’s ride comfort. The new X3 feels pliant at low speeds, whereas the last one felt jiggly, and while there is some body movement over undulations, ride comfort has improved to the extent it could just be class-best. Adaptive suspension that varies damping force depending on drive conditions is standard, and it also gives drivers the option to toggle between Comfort and Sport settings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSport mode does tighten things up and helps keep body control in check at faster speeds. Suspension setup aside, a key ingredient in this change of character is the move away from hard sidewall run-flat tyres to more absorbent tubeless ones. The added ‘give’ allows the X3 to do a better job of filtering shocks from the surface below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20250321045043_BMW_X3_Tubeless_Tyres.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNew X3 switches from run-flats to regular tubeless tyres.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new X3 changes direction smoothly and effortlessly without feeling quite as pointy as its predecessor, 50:50 weight distribution and rear-biased all-wheel drive notwithstanding. There’s good connect at the steering at all times, and the planted feel means you can confidently carry high speeds. Braking power is good, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCamera and radar-based ADAS features are included\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe X3 also packs in radar and camera-based ADAS functions. Adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist and auto braking worked well enough on well-marked roads but are best thought of as an added safety net rather than features to rely completely on.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 BMW X3 price and verdict\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new X3 range starts at Rs 75.8 lakh (ex-showroom, India) for the petrol, while this diesel comes in at Rs 77.8 lakh. Pricing is at par with the Mercedes GLC, which is currently the midsize luxury SUV to beat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe latest X3 does a lot of things right. It’s got the right look, it’s got the wow elements inside, and it’s rather nice to drive, too. However, it’s the upped comfort levels that really open it up to a wider buyer base. By retaining most of what we’ve liked about X3s thus far and addressing its biggest weaknesses, BMW has come up with an X3 that’s more complete than it ever was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe one to buy? We’ll have to bring the field of rivals to give the answer but the X3 sure is in the fight for the top spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"new-heding-h6 vrg-headline-text\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-bmw-ix3-design-previewed-by-neue-klasse-x-prototype-434806\"\u003eNew BMW iX3 design previewed by Neue Klasse X prototype\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"new-heding-h6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/auto-features/new-bmw-x3-vs-rivals-price-specification-comparison-434311\"\u003eNew BMW X3 vs rivals: price, specification comparison\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"tagged-articles-container-434904\"\u003e\u003cul id=\"tab-id-434904\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca id=\"tab-vidhref-id-434904\" href=\"#.\" rel=\"#tab-videos-container-434904\"\u003eVideos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
