  "text": "It's not just new car buyers making questionable decisions, as used car shoppers are taking out loans with an average APR of 11 percent 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson New car loans now average $42,113, with 18.9% of borrowers paying $1,000 monthly or more. Average loan terms stretched to 68.8 months as down payments fell to $6,856 last quarter. Used car loans average $28,675 with more manageable $533 payments but sky-high 11% APRs. The number of consumers taking on new-vehicle loans with monthly payments of $1,000 or more hit a record high last quarter, underscoring just how expensive it’s becoming to get behind the wheel. With the cost of financing skyrocketing, analysts are advising potential buyers to consider alternatives, such as used cars or new EV leases, to keep their budgets in check. During the final quarter of 2024, the average amount financed for new vehicle purchases in the US climbed to $42,113, up from $40,713 in Q3 and significantly higher than the $39,977 average from Q4 2023. Among those locked into new-car loans, a striking 18.9% are now grappling with payments of $1,000 or more – a far cry from what most would consider affordable. Read: 92% Of EV Owners Will Never Go Back To ICE-Only, New Study Finds Data published by Edmunds reveals that the average loan term in Q4 2024 reached 68.8 months, a slight uptick from the 67.8-month average in the same quarter last year, but holding steady from Q3 2024. It’s not just the proportion of shoppers with hefty $1,000+ loans that have gone up, as the average monthly payment across the board has jumped from $739 twelve months ago to $754 at the end of the year. Interestingly, despite rising costs, the average down payment for new vehicles dropped from $7,074 to $6,856 over the same period. Interest rates, while still high, are showing signs of easing. The average annual percentage rate (APR) on new vehicle loans fell to 6.8% last quarter, down from 7.1% in Q3 and 7.4% in Q4 2023, a small consolation for those financing record-high amounts. New Car Finance Data (Averages) Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, noted that rising vehicle prices and financing costs are putting significant pressure on the average car buyer’s budget. “It’s getting more and more difficult for the average shopper to walk into a new-car dealership and leave with a set of keys without feeling like they are forced to create extra room in their budget from some other aspect of life,” said Caldwell. “The one bright spot is that interest rates seem to finally be on a downward trajectory, so buyers are at least getting more car for their buck rather than allocating their payments to interest.” Used Cars: The Practical Choice (With a Catch) For many consumers, getting a used car is often a smarter financial move. Last quarter, the average amount financed for a used vehicle was a more manageable $28,675, requiring an average monthly payment of $533, substantially lower than the figures for new vehicles. The downside of going used is that APRs are generally higher and in Q4, averaged a brutal 11%. “For longstanding new-car buyers coming back to the market for the first time in years, used purchases and new EV leases are your best bets to keep your monthly payment in line with what you were accustomed to in pre-pandemic times,” noted Ivan Drury, another Edmunds analyst. In a market where affordability feels increasingly out of reach, alternatives like used cars and heavily factory-discounted EV leases offer some breathing room for budget-conscious shoppers. But even those options come with their own challenges, because apparently, owning a car without financial acrobatics is so 2019. Used Car Finance Data (Averages)",
