  "description": "Renault takes centre stage at the next edition of France's big show – here’s what to look out for The biennial Paris motor show returns on Monday 14 October, and it’s shaping up to have been worth the wait. The show floor will be dominated by the Renault Group, which is revealing no fewer than six new cars. They will range from the next evolution of Alpine’s hydrogen-combustion supercar to Dacia’s Ford Kuga killer and the reborn Renault 4. Stellantis will be out in greater force than in 2022, with Citroën set to unveil the facelifted C4 and an update to the Ami.  The likes of Alfa Romeo, Kia and Mini will also be in Paris, although they’ve yet to announce the extent of their presence. As with the 2022 Paris show, Chinese brands including BYD, GAC and Xpeng will be out in full force too. Welcome to our guide to this year’s Paris show, covering everything new to keep an eye out for. Alfa Romeo Junior Ibrida The hybrid version of Alfa Romeo’s new crossover will make its public debut at the Paris show. Named the Junior Ibrida, it’s fitted with the same 134bhp mild-hybrid powertrain as the related Fiat 600 and Jeep Avenger. Read our Alfa Romeo Junior review Alfa Romeo Tonale Alfa Romeo will unveil the 2025-model-year Tonale at the Paris motor show. The company has yet to detail the changes it has made to the Tonale, but the car is most likely to receive a software upgrade, potentially updating the infotainment system and extracting extra range from the plug-in hybrid powertrain. Read our Alfa Romeo Tonale review Alpine A390 Beta The Alpine A390 Beta concept will provide a tantalising first look at the French brand’s upcoming Porsche Macan Electric rival, an electric SUV with a rakish, coupé-like silhouette. As with the previous A290 Beta and Alpine A290, it’s set to very closely resemble the road-going car, due next year, but could feature a twist such as a novel interior layout or futuristic on-board technologies.  Alpine to unveil electric Porsche Macan rival on 11 October Alpine Alpenglow Hy6 Alpine’s testbed for hydrogen combustion engines will undergo its next evolution at this year’s Paris show. It was first unveiled at the 2022 show and hit the track for the first time earlier this year using a modified Oreca four-cylinder engine, but it’s now making the switch to a bespoke V6. Alpine has prioritising improved efficiency (it reckoned the four-pot could drive 62 miles between fill-ups at racing pace), but it’s likely to boost power beyond the existing unit’s 335bhp too. Alpine's hydrogen V6 hypercar could make production BYD Sea Lion 07 Chinese giant BYD will show the European version of its Sea Lion 07 coupé SUV at Paris. It's expected to sit above the Seal saloon in its line-up, majoring on its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and range figures well above 300 miles. Citroën Ami update “We are going to extend the Ami line-up and do many changes”, Citroën CEO Thierry Koskas recently told Autocar. He wouldn’t be drawn on what those changes would be, but it’s possible that he meant new variants in the vein of the Ami Buggy or technical upgrades to boost its appeal. “We will reveal everything in the Paris motor show,” concluded Koskas. Citroën C4 facelift Asked about the future of the Citroën C4, Koskas replied: “We will update the design; you will have to come to the Paris motor show.” Images of new C4 prototypes spotted testing reveal it will get front and rear lighting signatures inspired by the Citroën Oli concept, and the interior is expected to receive an upgraded infotainment system to boot. Citroën concept Citroën will unveil a concept car “in a major segment”. It’s thought to preview either the next C4 or C5 Aircross, with the latter car set to arrive next year. It will doubtless take inspiration from the Oli concept that the brand revealed two years ago, but could evolve it a step further. Citroen to unveil radical new concept car at Paris motor show Dacia Bigster Dacia has unveiled the Bigster as its largest, most expensive model yet. A rival for the likes of the Skoda Kodiaq and Ford Kuga, it's based on the same underpinnings as the Dacia Duster, albeit stretched to create extra interior space. It'll be making its public debut at the Paris show ahead of its arrival in the UK early next year. Prices are set to start at around £29,000. Dacia Bigster is brand's largest, most expensive model to date Leapmotor B10 Chinese Dacia rival Leapmotor has just landed in the UK with its C10 SUV and T03 city car, which the firm claims to be the best-value EVs in their respective segments. It's already adding to that line-up with the new B10 SUV, which will be revealed at the Paris show. It's expected to be a smaller foil to the C10, rivalling the likes of the Kia EV3 and Volkswagen ID 3. Leapmotor T03 launched as UK’s second-cheapest electric car Mini John Cooper Works Mini's go-faster divison, John Cooper Works, will reveal its first electric cars at the Paris motor show. Details published by the Chinese government reveal that the Aceman crossover and Cooper hatchback have been fitted with a more potent 255bhp motor, which should bring a decent boost in performance for both models. They also get more aggressive-looking styling, with blacked-out grilles, more prominent skirting and bigger alloy wheels. Electric Mini John Cooper Works gets 255bhp motor, sportier styling Mobilize Duo Renault has unwrapped the successor to the Twizy EV. Called the Mobilize Duo, it's a city-focused EV with – in range-topping specification – a top speed of 50mph and a range of 100 miles. Prices will start from around £10,000 when it arrives in the UK next year. Mobilize Duo is reborn Renault Twizy with 100-mile range Peugeot E-3008 Long Range and Peugeot E-5008 Long Range Peugeot will launch Long Range variants of its new e-3008 and new e-5008 at the Paris motor show, with the SUVs offering ranges of 435 miles and 415 miles, respectively.  That's thanks to a new 96.9kWh battery pack – 23.9kWh bigger than the existing 73kWh one, which yields 327 miles of range in the E-3008 and 315 miles in the E-5008. Read our Peugeot E-3008 and E-5008 reviews Peugeot E-408 Peugeot will complete its electric car line-up with the unveiling of the new E-408. It's expected to use the same 54kWh battery and 148bhp motor as the smaller E-308 and could get subtle design tweaks such as a blanked-off front grille. Peugeot E-408 to be unveiled at Paris motor show Renault 4 Having been shown in 4Ever concept form at the previous Paris show, the reborn Renault 4 is now ready to make its debut. The EV is expected to share much of its technical make-up with the smaller Renault 5 but sit higher and wider, in a bid to capture the ever-popular compact crossover market.  Reborn Renault 4 shows off boxy look ahead of October debut Renault 17 Electric Restomod x Ora Ito Bemused by the Ford Capri’s metamorphosis from bold coupé to conformist SUV? This Renault 17 might just be the answer, bringing the Capri’s contemporary rival up to date with a 270bhp electric motor and a carbonfibre chassis. Penned in collaboration with French designer Ora Ito, it’s slightly wider and lower than the original 17 but retains its cabin, door, windows, glass and underbody. Renault 17 reborn with 270bhp, RWD and carbonfibre chassis Renault Embleme This coupé SUV is Renault’s idea of how hydrogen-fuel-cell power could offer long-range transport while slicing carbon emissions by 90% compared with today’s petrol Captur. Its exterior will be shown at Paris, but we’ll have to wait until later this month to see the Embleme in full. Renault Embleme revealed as hydrogen coupé-SUV for 2030 Renault Twingo Renault’s next retro revival after the 4 is the cute new Twingo, which is scheduled to go on sale in 2026. The Paris show will mark its public debut. Renault Twingo to return in 2026 as sub-£17,000 EV THK LSR-05 We'll forgive you if you've never heard of Japanese parts supplier THK, but its latest concept is well worth paying attention to. Penned by Nissan GT-R designer Shiro Nakamura, it is a showcase of the company's latest technological developments, including in-wheel motors and wireless car charging. It'll be making its European debut at Paris. Japanese firm shows high-tech SUV penned by Nissan GT-R designer",
