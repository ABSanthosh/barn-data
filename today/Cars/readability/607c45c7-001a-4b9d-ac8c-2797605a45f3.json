I wish I could've filmed the incident, but there was obviously no way to do so safely, at least not without a dash cam. I didn't see what started it, but someone in a bro-dozer pickup must've pissed off someone in an old, beat-up Mercedes. The Merc continued to speed up, get in front of the truck, and then brake-check him. The two vehicles eventually came to a full stop just up the road from me and I thought it might get worse -- but the truck owner drove around and the situation seemed defused. Believe it or not, I haven't seen a ton of crazy road-rage incidents, at least not beyond the occasional one-finger salute.

Tim Healey Tim Healey grew up around the auto-parts business and has always had a love for cars — his parents joke his first word was “‘Vette”. Despite this, he wanted to pursue a career in sports writing but he ended up falling semi-accidentally into the automotive-journalism industry, first at Consumer Guide Automotive and later at Web2Carz.com. He also worked as an industry analyst at Mintel Group and freelanced for About.com, CarFax, Vehix.com, High Gear Media, Torque News, FutureCar.com, Cars.com, among others, and of course Vertical Scope sites such as AutoGuide.com, Off-Road.com, and HybridCars.com. He’s an urbanite and as such, doesn’t need a daily driver, but if he had one, it would be compact, sporty, and have a manual transmission.
