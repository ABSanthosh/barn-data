  "description": "This 1995 Nissan Skyline GT-R was exported from Japan to Australia in 2001 before being brought to the US, where it was purchased by the seller in 2020. Subsequent refurbishment work involved a repaint in Silver Spark, a rebuild of the twin-turbocharged 2.6L inline-six, and installation of various aftermarket modifications. The car features R33 Series 3 xenon headlights and an R33 N1–style hood lip and front bumper ducts in addition to an Auto Select Chibi carbon-fiber wing blade. It rides on 18\" Rays Engineering wheels along with Öhlins coilovers and is equipped with Wilwood disc brakes as well as a Boost Factory HICAS delete kit. Inside, Recaro front bucket seats trimmed in two-tone gray cloth are accompanied by a NISMO steering wheel, white-dial gauges, and carbon-fiber trim. The engine is noted to have been fitted with an HKS GT III-SS Sport turbocharger kit and exhaust system along with CP-Carillo pistons, Manley connecting rods, Brian Crower camshafts, and a Haltech ECU. Shifting is through a replacement five-speed manual transmission linked with an ATTESA E-TS all-wheel-drive system and a limited-slip rear differential. Previously listed on BaT in November 2024, this modified R33 GT-R is now offered again with a collection of records, spare and removed parts, import documents, and a clean Florida title in the seller's name.",

Shifting is through a replacement five-speed manual transmission linked with an ATTESA E-TS all-wheel-drive system and a limited-slip rear differential. Previously listed on BaT in November 2024, this modified R33 GT-R is now offered again with a collection of records, spare and removed parts, import documents, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name. This example is one of 1,340 Series 1 R33 GT-Rs delivered from the factory in Silver Spark (KL0) and was repainted following the seller’s 2020 acquisition. R33 Series 3 xenon headlights modified for left-hand-drive roads have been installed along with replacement taillights and badges. Additional details include an R33 N1–style hood lip and front bumper ducts along with an Auto Select Chibi carbon-fiber wing blade. The 18×9.5″ Rays Engineering TE37 SL wheels are mounted with 265/35 Continental Extreme Contact Sport tires with 2020 date codes. The car rides on Öhlins Road \u0026 Track coilovers, and further suspension modifications include a NISMO titanium front strut tower brace, underbody bracing, and rear lower control arms along with SPL adjustable front caster arms, GKTech adjustable front control arms, GKTech adjustable rear upper control arms, and Whiteline anti-sway bars. Wilwood six-piston calipers are fitted over 355mm two-piece rotors up front, while four-piston units clamp down on single-piece discs out back. A replacement power steering pump and rack were also installed under current ownership along with a replacement brake master cylinder and stainless-steel lines. The right-hand-drive cabin houses Recaro SR3 front bucket seats and a contoured rear bench trimmed in two-tone gray cloth. NISMO additions include carbon-fiber dash and mirror trim along with drilled aluminum pedals. A chrome Do Luck floor cross-brace has been installed behind the front seats, and the car is further equipped with a Pioneer CD stereo, automatic climate control, and power windows, mirrors, and door locks. The air conditioning compressor, condenser, and dryer were reportedly replaced under current ownership along with the shifter boot and emergency brake assembly. The leather-wrapped NISMO steering wheel was installed following the seller’s acquisition along with a NISMO instrument cluster with a white-dial 320-km/h speedometer, an 11k-rpm tachometer, and readouts for coolant temperature, fuel level, and oil pressure. Auxiliary gauges for front torque bias, oil temperature, and boost pressure are positioned in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 52k kilometers (~32k miles), while the included removed odometer shows 65k kilometers (~40k miles). The 2.6L RB26DETT inline-six is said to have been rebuilt by Total Engine Concepts of Riviera Beach, Florida, under current ownership with CP-Carillo pistons, Manley H-beam connecting rods, an HKS GTIII-SS Sport turbocharger kit, Brian Crower Stage 2+ Street camshafts, GReddy adjustable cam gears, and a Haltech Elite 2500 ECU. A fluid service was performed in 2024. According to the seller, additional components include the following: Supertech 7mm Viton exhaust and 6mm intake valve stem seals Brian Crower valves and guides with titanium single-spring retainer kit ACL bearings Fluidampr harmonic balancer crankshaft pulley ARP head and main stud kits Tomei MLS head gasket Plazmaman 76mm intercooler with GReddy piping Nitto head oil drain, GReddy oil cooler, and relocated oil filter LeaskSpec stainless-steel oil pan extension with NISMO baffling Koyorad aluminum rRadiator with Nissan fan and shroud Silicone coolant hoses Radium Engineering fuel rail Injector Dynamics ID1050X 1,065cc fuel injectors NISMO intake plenum GReddy Type R blow-off valve kit Flex-Fuel sensor kit CAN Wideband O2 Controller kit with Haltech sensors Wiring Specialties RB26DETT Pro Series wiring harness Replacement starter and alternator Power is sent to all four wheels through a replacement five-speed manual transmission and an ATTESA all-wheel-drive system. A replacement clutch master cylinder and stainless-steel lines were installed under the seller’s ownership along with a Boost Factory HICAS delete brace. The HKS exhaust system features Jet-Hot-coated downpipes, a stainless steel F-pipe, and a high-flow catalytic converter. Decoding the replacement chassis plate reveals the following information: G – Two-door coupe GJ – 2.6-liter RB26DETT inline-six P – ATTESSA all-wheel-drive with Super HICAS four-wheel steering R – Right-hand-drive Q – GT-R F – Five-speed manual transmission R33 – Model Z – Twin-turbocharged D – Standard A – Four-person capacity The car is titled in Florida using an assigned VIN—6T91MPAAAR1XFK014—that was issued while the car was in Australia.
