  "description": "The Yezdi Adventure has received its most comprehensive update since launch. While the mechanicals remain unchanged, it now gets revised styling with twin-LED headlights, an updated electronics suite and is now priced at Rs 2.15 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).  Yezdi Adventure gets new twin-LED headlights Now gets traction control with three ABS modes Updated colours, revised bash plate and Bluetooth-enabled console Yezdi Adventure launched with refreshed styling The Adventure now gets six colour options  The 29.6hp, 29.9Nm, 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine continues unchanged and is mated to a 6-speed gearbox. Yezdi claims that it now features optimised gear ratios and revised fuel mapping for smoother performance. The bike’s chassis and suspension setup its 220mm ground clearance and 15.5-litre tank are also unchanged. The most noticeable difference is the twin-LED headlight setup, featuring a dual-chamber reflector-based LED headlight on the right and a single projector on the left. The tail-light also follows the dual-theme, with twin-LED pods. Other updates include a redesigned front and rear fender, beak, new rear rack, adjustable windscreen and six fresh colour options – three matte and three gloss. The Yezdi Adventure’s electronics suite also gets an update with traction control and three ABS modes – Road, Rain and Off-Road. The base model now starts at Rs 2.15 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), while the top-spec variant is priced at Rs 2.27 lakh. The changes between each variant is purely cosmetic; there are no mechanical or feature differences between variants. At this price point, the Yezdi Adventure slots right between the Hero Xpulse 210 (Rs 1.76-1.86 lakh) and KTM 250 Adventure (Rs 2.60 lakh). Jawa also recently rolled out its new Ownership Assurance Programme, which offers a 4-year or 50,000km warranty and one year of roadside assistance as standard. As part of the package, buyers can also opt for extended coverage of up to 6 years. Test rides and deliveries begin across dealerships from June 4. Also see: 2024 Yezdi Adventure video review",
