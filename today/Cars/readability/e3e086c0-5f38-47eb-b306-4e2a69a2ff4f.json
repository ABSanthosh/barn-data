  "text": "Honda engineers are looking for ways to make the two-door coupe more fun to drive than the mechanically-related Civic e:HEV 2 hours ago by Thanos Pappas Honda might be working on a simulated manual gearbox for the hybrid Prelude. The driver will reportedly feel and hear the (simulated) gear changes. While not as engaging as a proper manual, it sounds more fun than a CVT. The gearbox of the upcoming Honda Prelude has become quite the hot topic of discussion lately. Initially, it was believed to feature a continuously variable automatic (CVT), then rumors of a manual surfaced—only to be promptly shut down. Now, the latest chatter hints that Honda may be cooking up a simulated manual for the hybrid coupe, aiming to inject a bit more driving engagement into the mix. Before diving into this “simulated manual” scenario—which sounds like an awkward compromise between the boring CVT and an engaging manual gearbox—let’s take a closer look at what Honda officials have said that sparked all this speculation. More: New Honda Prelude Coupe Spied, Won’t Have A Manual After All The new Prelude will share its bones with the Civic, hybrid powertrain included, which makes the CVT the obvious choice. However, Japanese publication Best Car Web stirred the pot by suggesting that Honda was considering a six-speed manual lifted from the ICE-only Civic RS. It was a juicy tidbit, but reality soon caught up. Honda Responds to Rumors A few weeks later, MotorTrend spoke with Shinji Aoyama, Honda’s Global Executive Vice President, who clarified that the Prelude won’t be getting a conventional manual. But here’s where it gets interesting: Aoyama also hinted that the Prelude is “engineered to shift differently” from the Civic, with drivers expected to feel and hear downshifts. There’s also speculation Honda might beef up the e:HEV system with a more potent electric motor, hinting at improved performance over the Civic hybrid. Chief Engineer and project leader Tomoyuki Yamagami later told Autocar that the “joy of driving” is a top priority for the team behind the new Prelude, as the public has high expectations from a coupe. When asked about the three-pedal rumors, Yamagami replied, “It’s very hard to answer that”. However, he did reveal his personal affection for manual transmissions, admitting it’s something he’d love to see in the Prelude, which would make it “a very fun vehicle to be with.” Baldauf Manual Hybrid History Honda is no stranger to manual hybrids either (remember the discontinued CR-Z?), but the new Civic’s e:HEV setup is a different story. It’s a system that’s tricky enough on its own, let alone adding a traditional manual to the equation. CVT still seems like the safe bet here. Yet, the combination of these semi-contradictory statements and facts suggests that Honda might be exploring ways to sneak in some manual-like driving feel without all the engineering headaches. A simulated manual could allow Honda to keep the hybrid’s core mechanics intact, while offering a driving experience that’s more engaging than your run-of-the-mill CVT. More: Toyota To Debut Manual Gearbox For EVs In 2026 Simulated manuals are quickly becoming a trend, especially for automakers trying to keep driving enthusiasts on their side as EVs take over. Take the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, for example, which mimics manual gear shifts with fake noises and artificial gear changes. Toyota and Lexus are also dabbling in this territorry. So, it wouldn’t be surprising if Honda hopped on board with their own flavor of simulated driving fun. Interestingly, a Reddit post suggests the idea of a simulated manual was floated by Australian publication Wheels Magazine over five months ago, although the published article doesn’t appear to cite a source. Not Just a Civic Clone In an interview with CarsGuide last year, Yamagami admitted that the Honda Prelude “isn’t going to be the sportiest, zippiest car that’s going to be tossed into the circuits.” But don’t let that downplay the intrigue. Based on all this info, it’s clear we’re not looking at some humdrum two-door Civic e:HEV. The Prelude’s sharper looks and promises of a more engaging driving experience suggest Honda is trying to make it appealing to a more discerning, enthusiast-driven audience. The Countdown to 2025 All our burning questions will be answered sometime in 2025, when the production version of the Honda Prelude is expected to be revealed. Judging by the spy shots, the final version will stick closely to the concepts that teased it, which isn’t a bad thing at all. SH proshots",
