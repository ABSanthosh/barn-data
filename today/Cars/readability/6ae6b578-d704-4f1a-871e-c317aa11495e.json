  "description": "A coupé-SUV reworking of the Torres is the ex-Ssangyong brand's first car developed under new ownership At first glance, it would be easy to dismiss the new KGM Actyon as a sleeker coupé version of the distinctive Torres SUV, which was launched last year. And there’s some truth to that: the models are close in size and share a platform, powertrain and plenty of key design elements. But bosses from KG Mobility’s UK importer insist that their newest arrival is far more significant. To understand why, you need a brief history of the car firm originally known as Dong-A Motor but best remembered in the UK as Ssangyong. Since the Korean conglomerate that gave the firm that moniker sold off a controlling stake in 1997, the brand has been variously controlled by Daewoo, SAIC and Mahindra and has always struggled from a lack of investment and consistency.The KG Group – a large Korean chaebol with significant interests in steel and chemical production – bought Ssangyong Motors in mid-2022 and promptly rebranded it as KG Mobility. That happened shortly after the Torres had been launched in South Korea – nearly two years before it reached the UK. KGM hasn’t just been renamed since then: its new owner has invested significantly in it, giving it vital resources to fully develop a new line of models.So much has changed in the two years since the Torres was first launched and, KGM says, much of that is reflected in what are claimed to be significant under-the-skin differences between that model and the new Actyon. With those changes, KGM reckons it might have a car capable of serving as a credible alternative to the Kia Sportage in the lucrative C-segment SUV market and one able to win over new customers to the brand – especially at its competitive price of £36,996.So can the Actyon live up to that billing or will a first outing on UK roads confirm that the new model is merely a Torres with a sleeker roofline?",

  "text": "A sign of KGM’s ambition to target a different audience with the Actyon can be seen with the interior. While the Torres is offered with entry- and mid-level trims (K30 and K40 in KGM parlance), the Actyon will be offered in the UK in K50 trim only, with the firm’s UK bosses basically suggesting they’ve packed it with all the kit. The interior features a layout called ‘horizontal simplicity’, which in essence means there are two 12.3in screens in a single unit next to each other, resting atop a long shelf finished with a bit of wood-styled veneer that runs the length of the dashboard.  The steering wheel is a new shape intended to give it a more sporty feel and a better view of the instrument panel. (In the sort of inessential trivia you’ll want to remember for the 2025 Autocar Christmas quiz, it’s also the first steering wheel to feature the KGM logo in the middle.) The large floating centre console contains the gear selector, which features a ‘crystal-type’ design that looks a bit of a Aldi alternative to the old Volvo crystal glass selectors.  The electronically adjustable seats feature heating and cooling systems and are perfectly fine and comfortable. To give the car a bit of a sporting feel (because it’s a coupé-SUV, you see) there’s plentiful black nappa leather and red trim elements, with chunks of a carbonfibre-esque grain. It doesn't feel entirely premium but neither does it feel like a cheap knock-off. There’s plenty of room in both the front and rear seats too.  Visibility is excellent all round thanks to the commanding and high seating position, the low bonnet and chunky wing mirrors. The rear window does taper a bit due to that coupé roofline but visibility out the back is still decent. The infotainment system will be familiar to users of other KGM models and is perfectly decent, if a little fiddly at times. There are plenty of physical buttons on the steering wheel for some of the key controls, including a customisable favourites button that you can map particular tasks to. Swiping down from the top of the infotainment home screen brings up a shortcut menu from which you can easily turn off the lane keeping assist and the speed limit warning. You’ll probably want to do this, because both of them are extremely eager to let you know of even the most minor of transgressions, and the bongs are not a particularly soothing tone.",
