  "description": "Red Bull Racing has confirmed that Yuki Tsunoda will replace Liam Lawson at the team from the 2025 Japanese GP (April 4-6) onwards. “It has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the RB21 at the first two races, and as a result, we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch,” said Red Bull Racing CEO and team principal Christian Horner. “We came into the 2025 season with two ambitions: to retain the World Drivers’ Championship and to reclaim the World Constructors’ title, and this is purely a sporting decision.” Lawson replaced after just two rounds Tsunoda to make Red Bull debut at his and Honda’s home race Tsunoda replaces Lawson: Why the early switch? Having made the decision to part ways with Sergio Perez, Red Bull had narrowed down its shortlist to Lawson and Tsunoda.  At the time, Lawson had made 11 grand prix appearances – replacing an injured Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull’s sister team at the end of 2023, and later taking his place from the 2024 US GP onwards. Tsunoda, meanwhile, had raced in F1 for four seasons, and 2024 was his best yet. Red Bull eventually opted to promote Lawson. At the time, Horner suggested that the 23-year-old’s mental resilience played a key role in this decision. However, Lawson has had a difficult start to the 2025 F1 season. Starting both races from the pit lane, he crashed out of the Australian GP and finished P12 in China (after Charles Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton and Pierre Gasly’s disqualifications). Horner acknowledged that “there’s a lot of work to be done” on Red Bull’s 2025 race car, the RB21, adding that “Yuki’s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car.” As for Lawson’s early demotion to Racing Bulls, Horner explained, “We have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam. We see that after such a difficult start, it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience as he continues his F1 career with Visa Cash App Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well.” Also see: Cadillac, General Motors to join F1 in 2026",
