  "description": "Just five months after revealing the Skoda Enyaq facelift and Enyaq Coupe, the Czech brand has taken the wraps off the cars’ sportier RS versions. Along with RS-specific (read: sportier) changes to the exterior and interior, the Enyaq RS and its coupe sibling feature a larger battery pack and higher output figures than the standard models. Skoda Enyaq RS, Coupe RS get 84kWh battery with up to 568km range Both models sprint from 0 to 100kph in 4.5 seconds RS’ drag coefficient is higher than the standard models’ Skoda Enyaq RS, Enyaq Coupe RS battery, range, performance Enyaq RS, Enyaq Coupe RS range is 562km and 568km, respectively Among the mechanical changes over their standard counterparts, the Enyaq RS and Enyaq Coupe RS get a larger 84kWh battery pack, up from the 63kWh and 82kWh units on the standard models. Skoda claims a WLTP range of 562km for the Enyaq RS and 568km for the Coupe. The battery can be charged at speeds of up to 185kW, taking 26 minutes to go from 10 to 80 percent. An 11kW AC charger is said to take 8 hours to top up the battery from 0 percent to full. Additionally, the RS versions get 340hp of power that is sent to all four wheels (up from 286hp seen on the Enyaq Coupe AWD), which means that they are also quicker to sprint from 0 to 100kph. Both have a claimed time of 5.4 seconds, which is 1.3 seconds quicker than their standard higher-spec counterparts. Skoda Enyaq RS, Enyaq Coupe RS interior, exterior changes Blacked-out exterior elements and 2 interior upholstery options Compared to the standard Enyaq and Enyaq Coupe, their RS versions sport numerous blacked-out elements – from the Skoda and RS badges to the window trims, mirrors and winglets on the redesigned front bumper – and larger 20-inch alloy wheels (21-inch ones are optional), and they come with an additional Mamba Green colour option. Interestingly, the Enyaq RS and Coupe RS have slightly higher drag coefficients of 0.251 and 0.239, respectively, than their slower counterparts (0.245 and 0.225), which makes them marginally less aerodynamically efficient. Inside, the RS-badged versions get 2 options: the sporty RS Lounge and the elegant RS Suite. The RS Lounge’s highlights include Suedia microfibre and faux leather with lime green contrast stitching and piping. The RS Suite gets leather and faux leather upholstery with grey stitching and piping. Regardless of the interior option, both get an RS-spec 3-spoke steering wheel along with integrated headrest sports seats – the driver’s seat includes a massage function – as standard. The feature list is the same as the standard model.
