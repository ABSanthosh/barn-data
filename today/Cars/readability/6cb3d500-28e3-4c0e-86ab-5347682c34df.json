  "description": "This 1996 Dodge Viper GTS was first registered in California, and around 2008, it was relocated to Texas, where it was believed to have been modified by Hennessy Performance with their Venom 1000 package. The modification included installing aerodynamic bodywork and a twin turbocharger system that reportedly increased output for the overhead-valve V10 to 1000 horsepower. The car is finished in Viper GTS Blue over black and blue leather upholstery and features a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, 18″ polished aluminum-alloy wheels, racing harnesses, an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, power windows, and dual airbags. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this Viper GTS shows 29k miles and is now offered in Minnesota with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean Texas title.",

The modification included installing aerodynamic bodywork and a twin turbocharger system that reportedly increased output for the overhead-valve V10 to 1000 horsepower. The car is finished in Viper GTS Blue over black and blue leather upholstery and features a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, 18″ polished aluminum-alloy wheels, racing harnesses, an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, power windows, and dual airbags. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this Viper GTS shows 29k miles and is now offered in Minnesota with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean Texas title. The car is finished in Viper GTS Blue with white center stripes, and Hennessey aerodynamic bodywork fitted under prior ownership includes revised front and rear bumper covers and a rear wing with a Gurney flap. Additional exterior details include projector-style headlights, fog lights, a vented hood, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. Exterior blemishes include some bubbling paint on the doors, corrosion and peeling paint on the rocker panels, stress cracks on the lower front splitter, and worn seals around the windows. The 18″ polished aluminum-alloy wheels are mounted with 285/35 Nitto NT05 tires up front and 345/35 Mickey Thompson ET Street S/S rubber out back. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The selling dealer states the parking brake does not hold and may require adjustment. The cabin features bucket seats upholstered in black leather with blue inserts along with a color-matching dashboard, center console, and door panels. Interior elements include chrome accents, blue racing harnesses, an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, power windows, and dual airbags. The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline. Auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and voltage are mounted atop the center stack. The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 29k miles. The overhead-valve V10 engine was modified under previous ownership with a Hennessey Performance twin turbocharger setup. The spark plugs were replaced, and an oil change was performed in April 2025. Oil drips from the turbochargers and catch can are noted weekly. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The selling dealer does not believe that catalytic converters are currently equipped. The Carfax report shows at least one open recall from May 2022. The listed lien was released in August 2017.
