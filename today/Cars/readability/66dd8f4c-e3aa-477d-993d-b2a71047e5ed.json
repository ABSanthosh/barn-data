It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 linked with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronic limited-slip differential. Equipment includes the Interior Carbon Fiber Package, Matte Dark Miron 20″ Corsa Design wheels, heated power-adjustable sport comfort seats, and a Sonus Faber High Premium sound system. This MC20 was delivered new to the selling dealer and is now offered in Massachusetts with a clean Carfax report and a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin. Design work for the MC20 was done internally at Centro Stile Maserati in Turin, Italy, and the cars are assembled at the Viale Ciro Menotti plant in Modena. This example is finished in Fuoriserie Digital Mint, a $21,500 color, and other exterior details comprise a black roof, dihedral doors, parking sensors, LED lighting, and a vented clear engine cover. The 20″ Corsa Design forged wheels are finished in Matte Dark Miron and are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza Sport tires measuring 245/35 up front and 305/30 out back. Braking is handled by gloss black-painted calipers fitted over ventilated and cross-drilled rotors at each corner. The car is equipped with a suspension lift system, launch control, and a double-wishbone suspension that utilizes active dampers. The heated power-adjustable sport comfort seats are trimmed in Ice and gray leather and Alcantara. Amenities include a Sonus Faber High Premium sound system, front and rear cameras, a digital rearview mirror, an Alcantara headliner, wireless charging, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, and Maserati Intelligent Assistant with a 10.25″ touchscreen display, navigation, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto. The Interior Carbon Fiber package added a carbon-fiber gauge binnacle, paddle shifters, and door sills. The Alcantara- and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted shift paddles and frames a 10.25″ digital instrument cluster. The digital odometer indicates 127 miles. The twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter Nettuno V6 was factory rated at 621 horsepower and 538 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber engine cover was equipped from the factory. Power is routed to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and an electronic limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and notes at least one recall. The car does not have a title as it has never been sold to a private party owner. It is being offered on its Manufacturer’s Certificate of Origin, and the selling dealer will assist the buyer with registration, titling, and tax collection.
