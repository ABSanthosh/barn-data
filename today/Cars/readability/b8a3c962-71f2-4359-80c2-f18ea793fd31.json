This Serie Speciale Aventador roadster is now offered with a scale model of the car, accessories, service records, a trickle charger, and a clean California title in the owner’s name. The LP720-4 50º Anniversario was designed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the marque’s founding and was limited to a total of 100 cars worldwide in both coupe and roadster configurations, with 43 designated for the US market. The cars were distinguished from the contemporary LP 700-4 by an enlarged front splitter and air intakes, revised aerodynamics, and expanded engine-compartment ventilation. Featuring a carbon-fiber composite monocoque shell, this roadster example is finished in Nero Aldebaran and features removable carbon-fiber roof panels that store in the front cargo area. Bi-xenon headlights, scissor doors, and a center-exit exhaust are further details. Carbon-fiber strips were adhered to the the underside of the front splitter by the original selling dealer when new. Paint protection film was also applied to the lower half of the car when new. Film on the front bumper and hood were replaced in March 2025 following photography in preparation for sale. Black-finished 20″ and 21″ Dione alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 255/30 up front and 355/25 out back. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system and rides on an Öhlins pushrod suspension, while stopping power is provided by six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The tires were replaced in 2023, while work in 2025 involved replacing the brake master cylinder and fluid. The twin carbon-fiber-backed seats are trimmed in black leather that extends to the dashboard and door panels. Lamborghini logos are embossed in the headrests, and carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Further details include an infotainment system with a 7″ TFT display as well as a Sensonum sound system, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The seatbacks were refitted in 2016. The multi-function steering wheel fronts column-mounted shift paddles. The digital instrument cluster incorporates a central tachometer, a speed readout, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 5,600 miles. The mid-mounted 6.5-liter V12 featured revised engine calibration in LP 720-4 50º Anniversario specification for a factory rating of 710 horsepower, 19 more than the standard LP 700-4. An evaporative control system recall fix was completed in May 2017, and the wiring harness was repaired in January 2020. The spark plugs were replaced in January 2023 along with the accessory belts and tensioners, and an oil change was last performed in January 2025. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential. The fluids for the transmission and differentials were flushed in 2024. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates.
