  "text": "Ticking the $31,925 Equipment Group 803A option transformed this F-150 Raptor into a 5.2-liter, supercharged V8 super-truck June 1, 2025 at 21:14 by Chris Chilton A used Ford F-150 Raptor R made a mockery of its MSRP at auction. The performance truck cost $114,320 new and sold for $138,000. Options fitted include the Raptor R package and $1,495 moonroof. It’s tempting to think that with the pandemic behind us, those crazy days of people paying wildly over sticker for new cars have also been consigned to history. Well, they have for the most part, but as this Ford F-150 proves, buyers will still splash the cash for rare and special vehicles. The 25MY truck had an original MSRP of $114,320, but when the digital gavel dropped on the Bring a Trailer auction, bidding had soared past that point, reaching $138,000. That means someone paid almost $24,000 more than list price to be the second owner of this Ford pickup. More: Ford’s Factory Made A Mistake And Now Thousands Of Trucks Could Have Steering Issues But this F-150 is no ordinary pickup. It started out on the Ford configurator as a Raptor, which would have cost $78,905 and come with a 450 hp (456 PS) Ecoboost V6 if the original buyer had skipped straight to the end of the online configurator session. He didn’t though. Instead, he opted inflate the final bill to the tune of $31,925 by adding Equipment Group 803A, which is a ton of cash for very innocuous sounding option package. But 803A is what turns the already rapid F-150 Raptor into the next best thing to a GT500 with a truck bed. Bring a Trailer The R junks the stock Raptor’s V6 for a Ford 5.2-liter supercharged Predator V8, upping the pony count to 720 hp (730 PS) and increasing torque from 510 lb-ft (692 PS) to 640 lb-ft (868 Nm). Zero to 62 mph (96 km/h) on dry pavement takes less than 4.0 seconds, and the combination of bead-lock-capable 17-inch wheels, 37-inch BF Goodrich All-Terrain T/A rubber, Fox Racing shocks and an electronically controlled locking rear differential means fun isn’t restricted to sealed surfaces. A twin-panel moonroof costing $1,495 was the only other option the original buyer – who is also the seller – chose, but he hasn’t had much opportunity to enjoy it. The truck had only covered 476 miles (766 km) from new before being listed on Bring a Trailer. The auction site has sold a stack of similar Raptor Rs this year, and most have gone for well over MSRP because there’s such huge demand for Ford’s most practical performance vehicle.
