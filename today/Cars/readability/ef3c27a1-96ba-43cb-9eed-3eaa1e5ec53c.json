Powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 linked to a six-speed F1 automated transaxle, it has an electronic limited-slip differential, 19″ split-spoke wheels, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, and a CD stereo. A 49-hour powertrain service was completed in December 2021, and subsequent work included servicing the fuel system and exhaust before the car was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. This F430 Spider has 24k miles and is offered in California with a car cover, manufacturer’s literature and accessories, and a clean Montana title. Exterior details include a power-operated soft top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, parking sensors, and quad exhaust tips flanking the rear diffuser. A November 2019 entry on the Carfax report states “very minor damage” was reported. The selling dealer adds that the front bumper has been refinished, and the front valance was repaired in preparation for the sale. The 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 225/35 front and 285/35 rear Continental ExtremeContact Sport tires. Silver-finished Brembo brake calipers are fitted over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The brake fluid was flushed in 2021. The power-adjustable Daytona-style seats are upholstered in Blu Scuro leather with contrasting stitching and embossed Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, which has automatic climate control, aluminum pedals, and a CD stereo. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for selecting dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 24k miles. The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features a dry-sump lubrication system, and it was factory rated at 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. In December 2021, a ~$14k service by Grand Prix Motors of Campbell, California, included replacing the rear main seal, right fuel pump, cam cover gaskets, exhaust manifold gaskets, engine mounts, spark plugs, air filters, and accessory drive belt. The flywheel was also reconditioned, and the clutch assembly and pilot bearing were replaced, as well. The left fuel pump was replaced in May 2022. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage entry and lists at least one open recall. Photo Gallery You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
