The car remained under the care of its original owner in California until 2025 and now has 7k miles. Equipment includes a five-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, a sunroof, Shadow-finished 17″ Style 40 wheels, heated sport seats, a BMW Business CD stereo, a Harman Kardon sound system, air conditioning, and cruise control. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2025, this M Coupe is offered in Connecticut at no reserve with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title. This car is finished in Estoril Blue Metallic (335) and features front fender vents, a sunroof, a rear window wiper, and quad exhaust outlets. The hood roundel and front signal lenses were replaced in 2025, and the selling dealer notes evidence of paintwork on the rear portion of the roof. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Shadow-finished 17″ Style 40 wheels are fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tires that were mounted in preparation for the sale. The car is equipped with Dynamic Stability Control and All-Season Traction (AST), and braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs. The cabin features black and Estoril Blue Nappa leather covering the heated sport seats, door panel inserts, and center console. Amenities include air conditioning, cruise control, a BWM Business CD stereo, and a Harman Kardon sound system. The rearview mirror and shift knob were replaced in 2025. The M-branded leather-wrapped steering wheel features tri-color stitching and frames a tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline, a 170-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 7k miles. The 3.2-liter S54B32 inline-six features double-VANOS variable valve timing and a Siemens MSS 54 engine management control system. Output was factory rated at 315 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The engine oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The fluids for the transmission and differential were changed in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates.
