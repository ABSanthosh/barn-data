  "text": "With vehicles getting bigger and bigger, would you settle for something that doesn't fit in your garage? 3 hours ago by Michael Gauthier Vehicles have been growing in size, while consumers have embraced trucks and SUVs. This means it’s become increasingly hard to park in garages, especially in older homes. Do you find parking in a garage a must? Or are you fine leaving your vehicle outside? The typical two-car garage measures 18 feet (5.5 m) wide and 20 feet (6.1 m) deep, but automobiles have been growing in size for decades. On top of that, consumer preferences have shifted as people have embraced trucks and SUVs that are even bigger than sedans. Take the 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL, for example, it measures a massive 228.5 inches (5,803 mm) long. That’s over 19 feet (5.8 meters) and people could struggle fitting it inside their garage. This is especially true of the 2025 Ram 2500, which can span up to 260.8 inches (6,626 mm) long. More: Would You Actually Buy A Sedan? That brings us to our question of the day: would you buy a vehicle that you can’t park in your garage? I recently had to ask myself this very question as I was replacing my daily driver and considering a handful of three-row crossovers. While they’d fit in my garage lengthwise, width would be an issue unless things were significantly revamped or another vehicle was parked outside. This turned out to be a bit of a deal breaker, even though I’ve been leaving a truck in the driveway. This is an interesting question in the era of EVs as you’ll ideally charge them at home. The garage is a natural place for this, but some people add a charging station to the exterior of their home. Of course, longer runs typically mean higher expenses. Parking in a garage also has other benefits as your vehicle is protected from the elements and so are you as you get in and out. It’s also much nicer getting into a slightly warmer car on cold days or a cooler car on hot days. With all that being said, would you buy a vehicle that you can’t park in your garage? Let us know in the comments below.",
