  "description": "This 1995 Ferrari F512 M is a left-hand-drive, European-market model that resided with its original owner in Germany until it was brought to the US in April 2024. It is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero Connolly leather. Equipment includes 18\" multi-piece Speedline alloy wheels, fixed headlights, air conditioning, a Grundig CD radio, traditional seatbelts, power windows, aluminum pedals, and a gated shifter. A timing-belt service is noted to have been completed in preparation for the sale. This F512 M shows 7k kilometers (~4,400 miles) and is now offered by the selling dealer with the owner's manual, a binder of service records, a Platinum award from the Pennsylvania Concorso Ferrari, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title.",

It is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Rosso Corsa over Nero Connolly leather. Equipment includes 18″ multi-piece Speedline alloy wheels, fixed headlights, air conditioning, a Grundig CD radio, traditional seatbelts, power windows, aluminum pedals, and a gated shifter. A timing-belt service is noted to have been completed in preparation for the sale. This F512 M shows 7k kilometers (~4,400 miles) and is now offered by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, a binder of service records, a Platinum award from the Pennsylvania Concorso Ferrari, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title. The Pininfarina-designed F512 M was the final installment of the Testarossa with NACA hood ducts as well as revised fixed headlights, quad taillights, and bumper covers when compared to the outgoing 512 TR. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa and features fog lights, side intake strakes, body-color rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. Silver multi-piece Speedline 18″ alloy wheels are mounted with Goodyears Eagle GS-A tires. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. Nero Connolly leather upholstery covers the seats, door panels, and dashboard. Interior amenities include a Grundig CD radio and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows. As a European-market model, the car is equipped with traditional, non-motorized seatbelts. The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,300-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 7k kilometers (~4,400 miles), approximately 50 of which were added under current ownership. The 4.9-liter DOHC flat-12 received updates over the version used in the 512 TR including a revised crankshaft and titanium connecting rods, and it drives the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A timing-belt service was completed in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
