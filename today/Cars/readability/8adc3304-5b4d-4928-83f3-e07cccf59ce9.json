It rides on 17″ forged monoblock wheels and is further equipped with a roof vent, a hood scoop, front bucket seats trimmed in blue cloth, automatic climate control, and a touchscreen Sony head unit. This STI Type RA Limited indicates 64k kilometers (~40k miles) and is now offered in Canada with partial service records and British Columbia registration in the seller’s name.  The car was finished from the factory in Sonic Blue (74F), and the seller states that it was repainted following a slow-speed collision under current ownership. A Prodrive rear wing has been retrofitted, and additional details include a roof vent, a hood scoop, and mud flaps. The majority of the photos used in the listing and in the image gallery were taken in June 2024.  Gold-finished 17″ forged monoblock wheels are mounted with an older set of 215/45 Falken Ziex ZE950 A/S tires. The seller states that the suspension has been modified with ST Suspensions XTA adjustable coilovers, a Cusco front subframe brace, and a Whiteline anti-lift and center correction kit. Braking is handled by red-finished Subaru-branded calipers at all four corners with slotted rotors fitted at the rear.  The right-hand-drive cabin features front bucket seats trimmed in blue cloth, which are joined by a rear bench seat upholstered in black cloth. Appointments include automatic climate control, a Sony touchscreen head unit, and power windows. A plaque affixed to the center console identifies this STi Type RA Limited as #0286 of 2000 examples produced.  An OMP steering wheel with a yellow centering stripe frames white-dial instrumentation that includes a 180-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. Additional readouts for air/fuel ratio and boost pressure are mounted to the right side of the dash. The digital odometer indicates 64k kilometers (~40k miles), approximately 30k of which have been added under current ownership. The turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-four features an intercooler water sprayer and has been modified with an A’PEXi air intake filter and an aftermarket ECU tune. The timing belt and water pump were replaced in 2016, and an oxygen sensor was changed in preparation for the sale.  Power is delivered to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a driver-controlled center differential. A turbo-back Invidia Q300 exhaust system is noted to have been fitted.  The vehicle is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada.
