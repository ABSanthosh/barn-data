  "description": "The car you see in these pictures needs no introduction. An icon of the Mr Bean series and The Italian Job movies, the Mini Cooper is perhaps more famous than the characters behind its wheel. It has been the benchmark for fun, fast, small hatchbacks, and this new Cooper S is the last to be petrol-powered, as from here on, it will be an EV-only model. So, let’s see if it lives up to its legacy. 2024 Mini Cooper S: design The new triangular tail-lamps get individual configurable LED elements. The easiest way to tell that this is the latest Cooper S is to look at the rear end. The Mini Cooper now gets triangular tail-lamps with individual LED elements that can be configured to display three different animations, including the famed Union Jack pattern. Similarly, the iconic round headlights are bezel-less, and they, too, have custom animations. The octagonal front grille is larger and features a blanked-off trim in the centre. In keeping with its sporty theme, there are no chrome elements on the outside; instead, you get a generous dose of gloss black surrounding the grille, the mirrors, the roof and the tailgate. There’s also some cladding around the wheel arches and stylish 17-inch alloys. 17-inch alloy wheels with run-flat tyres are standard. A special mention must go to this Sunny Side Yellow paint on our test car, which grabs many eyeballs. Notably, this new Cooper S forgoes the air intakes in the bumpers and, more controversially, visible exhaust tips. 2024 Mini Cooper S: interior, features In the pursuit of minimalism, Mini has forgone the instrument cluster, giving the dashboard a clean look. The 9.4-inch OLED centre touchscreen doubles up as the instrument cluster, showing relevant driving information, depending on which mode you’re in. This Android-based screen is the cabin’s highlight, and it controls most functions, too. The crisp 9.4-inch OLED touchscreen doubles up as an instrument panel. The screen is high in resolution, and the touch is slick. However, the multiple menus and sub-menus mean that you need time to get accustomed to it. Mini has used sustainable materials on the dashboard, door cards and seats, which look nice and rather unconventional but will be challenging to keep clean. The steering is nice to look at, with its two-spoke design, and the tensioned fabric piece that acts like the third spoke is a cool touch. However, the steering’s rim is too thick, much like those of several M Sport BMWs. The front seats are accommodating; they hold you well in place around corners and offer good adjustability, but electrical adjustment is part of an optional pack. Entry to the rear seat is tight, and it isn’t particularly spacious, but adults can fit here for shorter journeys. What does help matters is the dual-pane sunroof, which opens up the feeling of space in the cabin. The rear seat is comfy enough for adults on short trips. As for features, the Cooper S packs in quite a bit of standard equipment, and our test car was also fitted with an optional Classic pack worth Rs 5.85 lakh, which brought in a couple of feel-good bits. Chief among them are the superb-sounding Harman Kardon sound system and the head-up display, which shows you the necessary information, such as speed, gear and tachometer. Uniquely, it also brings in an inside camera for taking photos or videos while you’re out on a drive. Standard features include auto climate control, LED lights, a rear camera, a large wireless charging pad in the centre console, ambient lighting and cruise control.  HUD (optional) replaces the traditional instrument cluster. 2024 Mini Cooper S: powertrain, performance Underpinning the new Mini Cooper S is a heavily updated version of the outgoing Mini’s platform. The engine is also the same 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbo-petrol but uprated for this latest version. Output stands at 204hp and 300Nm, up from the older car’s 178hp and 280Nm, and it continues to send power to the front wheels. The 2.0L 4-pot unit has been uprated to 204hp. Twist the toggle switch in the centre console, and the four-pot burbles to life. This simple twist switch makes you feel like you’re operating an aircraft and adds to the cool factor. The exhaust, while not particularly loud, does have a nice raspy tone to it. And like most modern, sporty cars, the Cooper S also pipes an artificial exhaust sound into the cabin through the speakers. While some might say this is sacrilege, I actually think it enhances the experience. The BMW-sourced motor is a highlight of this car as power is plentiful, and its rev-happy nature just eggs you on to drive harder. It leaps off the line, and the instant power delivery never leaves you wanting more. Cooper S leaps off the line, and the instant power delivery never leaves you wanting more. The engine is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox that is quick and responsive, and depending on which drive mode you’re in, it’ll either upshift at the earliest to conserve fuel or hold on to lower gears longer for maximum performance. One of the biggest misses with this new Cooper S, though, is that it lacks any form of manual control for the gearbox: no paddles, no Tiptronic function and not even a proper gear lever, with only a toggle switch to select drive direction. The only way to get it to downshift is by pressing the accelerator hard and then waiting for the gearbox to kick down. For a hot hatch like the Mini Cooper S, this is a big letdown. Another miss is a handbrake lever, so there’s no scope for fun manoeuvres such as handbrake turns and J-turns.  The Cooper S is sprightliest in the Go-Kart mode, where it feels quite literally like a go-kart. On the move, the Cooper S feels energetic and quick despite its 1,360kg kerb weight. And that’s backed up by the performance figures. Mini claims a 0-100kph time of 6.6 seconds, but we managed to time it a shade quicker at 6.48 seconds in Go-Kart mode. And despite having no manual control, the gearbox is quick enough to kick down, which enables you to dart in between the gaps in slow-moving traffic. In-gear acceleration, then, is strong, too, taking 3.62 seconds for the 20-80kph sprint and 4.56 seconds for 40-100kph. Ambient light colour and pattern depend on the drive mode. The new Cooper S offers seven modes, each with unique ambient lighting and screen graphics, with the Classic pack. However, only three of them – Core, Go-Kart and Efficient – actually alter the driving experience. Core is the standard mode, offering the best balance between performance and efficiency. Efficient, as the name suggests, is the eco mode, which dulls throttle response in the interest of efficiency.  The Cooper S is sprightliest in the Go-Kart mode, where it feels quite literally like a go-kart. It’s in this mode where the engine, gearbox and throttle are the most responsive, and the car feels like it shrinks around you. The other four modes only alter the ambient lighting and graphics and play an audio track. 2024 Mini Cooper S: ride, handling The brakes are sharp, with a strong initial bite followed by progressive stopping power. In our test, it took 25.76 metres to come to a halt from 80kph. On Mumbai’s less-than-perfect streets, the Cooper S felt stiffly sprung, and the larger bumps were jarring. There’s no scope for adjustability, as it doesn’t get adaptive dampers. The run-flat tyres don’t help either. The optional 18-inch alloys will have even slimmer side walls, which will further hamper the ride quality. But drive it on a perfectly paved road like the new coastal road in Mumbai, and it is just super. On Mumbai’s less-than-perfect streets, the Cooper S felt stiffly sprung, and the larger bumps were jarring. The stiff ride means that it feels tight and agile around the bends, with absolutely no body roll. The steering is also sharp, and the Cooper S is quick to turn into corners, making it feel like it shrinks around you. There’s barely any slack at the centre position, and you’ll like the fact that it is communicative, too. You’ll also notice torque steer when driving flat-out, but it’s nothing that’s not manageable; here, it is actually fun and adds to the drama. Like Coopers of the past, this new one remains a hoot to drive. Then, there’s also the fact that Mini is saving its best for the full-blown John Cooper Works (JCW) version, which is expected to arrive at a later date, and that should dial things up further. 2024 Mini Cooper S: price, verdict The Mini Cooper S is a car you clearly buy with your heart rather than your head, especially considering it costs Rs 44.90 lakh (ex-showroom), before options. Then, there’s the lack of manual control for the gearbox, and it’s a stiff ride to contend with. Beyond that, though, it is simply a hoot and remains as charming as ever. It’s packed with more tech than before and has a superb engine. Moreover, you won’t be able to buy this petrol-powered hot hatch after a couple of years. That might be reason enough to get the Mini now.  Also see: 2024 Mini Cooper S video review New Mini Convertible revealed Electric Mini Cooper JCW gets 258hp",

And that’s backed up by the performance figures. Mini claims a 0-100kph time of 6.6 seconds, but we managed to time it a shade quicker at 6.48 seconds in Go-Kart mode. And despite having no manual control, the gearbox is quick enough to kick down, which enables you to dart in between the gaps in slow-moving traffic. In-gear acceleration, then, is strong, too, taking 3.62 seconds for the 20-80kph sprint and 4.56 seconds for 40-100kph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20241014011614_5.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmbient light colour and pattern depend on the drive mode.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new Cooper S offers seven modes, each with unique ambient lighting and screen graphics, with the Classic pack. However, only three of them – Core, Go-Kart and Efficient – actually alter the driving experience. Core is the standard mode, offering the best balance between performance and efficiency. Efficient, as the name suggests, is the eco mode, which dulls throttle response in the interest of efficiency. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Cooper S is sprightliest in the Go-Kart mode, where it feels quite literally like a go-kart. It’s in this mode where the engine, gearbox and throttle are the most responsive, and the car feels like it shrinks around you. The other four modes only alter the ambient lighting and graphics and play an audio track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2024 Mini Cooper S: ride, handling\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe brakes are sharp, with a strong initial bite followed by progressive stopping power. In our test, it took 25.76 metres to come to a halt from 80kph. On Mumbai’s less-than-perfect streets, the Cooper S felt stiffly sprung, and the larger bumps were jarring. There’s no scope for adjustability, as it doesn’t get adaptive dampers. The run-flat tyres don’t help either. The optional 18-inch alloys will have even slimmer side walls, which will further hamper the ride quality. But drive it on a perfectly paved road like the new coastal road in Mumbai, and it is just super.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Reviews/20241014011755_12.jpg\u0026amp;c=0\u0026amp;w=700\"/\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOn Mumbai’s less-than-perfect streets, the Cooper S felt stiffly sprung, and the larger bumps were jarring.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stiff ride means that it feels tight and agile around the bends, with absolutely no body roll. The steering is also sharp, and the Cooper S is quick to turn into corners, making it feel like it shrinks around you. There’s barely any slack at the centre position, and you’ll like the fact that it is communicative, too. You’ll also notice torque steer when driving flat-out, but it’s nothing that’s not manageable; here, it is actually fun and adds to the drama. Like Coopers of the past, this new one remains a hoot to drive. Then, there’s also the fact that Mini is saving its best for the full-blown John Cooper Works (JCW) version, which is expected to arrive at a later date, and that should dial things up further.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2024 Mini Cooper S: price, verdict\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Mini Cooper S is a car you clearly buy with your heart rather than your head, especially considering it \u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-mini-cooper-s-launched-at-rs-4490-lakh-432273\" title=\"New Mini Cooper S launched at Rs 44.90 lakh\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecosts Rs 44.90 lakh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (ex-showroom), before options. Then, there’s the lack of manual control for the gearbox, and it’s a stiff ride to contend with. Beyond that, though, it is simply a hoot and remains as charming as ever. It’s packed with more tech than before and has a superb engine. Moreover, you won’t be able to buy this petrol-powered hot hatch after a couple of years. That might be reason enough to get the Mini now. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlso see:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-video-reviews/2024-mini-cooper-s-video-review-432675\"\u003e2024 Mini Cooper S video review\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/new-mini-convertible-revealed-433157\"\u003eNew Mini Convertible revealed\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/electric-mini-cooper-jcw-gets-258hp-432891\"\u003eElectric Mini Cooper JCW gets 258hp\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
