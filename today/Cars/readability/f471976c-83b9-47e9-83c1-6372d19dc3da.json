  "text": "The 2025 LS arrives at dealers later this year with a base price of $81,685 1 hour ago by Michael Gauthier Lexus has introduced the 2025 LS, which carries over unchanged. Despite the lack of updates, pricing has climbed $500 to start at $81,685. While the LS is celebrating its 35th anniversary, the future doesn’t look bright as sales have been declining for years. 35 years ago, an upstart luxury brand was launched to challenge BMW and Mercedes. It was Lexus and they had high hopes for their LS 400 flagship. Despite an uphill battle, Lexus was a smashing success and the brand outsold their German competitors in the United States in 1991. That success continues to this day as Lexus is a constant contender for the luxury sales crown. More: 2026 Lexus ES Reveals Subtle Facelift Ahead Of Its Official Debut Unfortunately, the LS has seen better days as the 2025 model carries over without a single update. That’s disappointing, but not surprising as the latest generation is eight years old and sales have been steadily declining. In 2018, Lexus sold 9,301 flagship sedans in the United States. That number has fallen significantly and sales totaled a mere 2,237 units last year. That means the Mercedes S-Class outsold the LS by nearly 5:1, while the BMW 7-Series wasn’t far behind. While sales are down, prices have moved in the opposite direction. For 2025, the LS 500 starts at $81,685 while the 500h hybrid begins at $116,560. These are increases of $500 each and both prices include a $1,350 destination fee. 2025 Lexus LS Since there isn’t anything new, we’ll remind you the LS 500 has a twin-turbo 3.4-liter V6 developing 416 hp (310 kW / 422 PS) and 442 lb-ft (599 Nm) of torque. It’s paired to a ten-speed automatic transmission, which can be mated to either rear- or all-wheel drive. Lexus says both versions accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 4.6 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 136 mph (219 km/h). The all-wheel drive 500h has a 3.5-liter V6, two electric motors, and a small lithium-ion battery pack. This provides a combined output of 354 hp (264 kW / 359 PS) as well as a fuel economy rating of 23 mpg city, 31 mpg highway, and 26 mpg combined. Besides being a tad more efficient, the hybrid is slightly slower as the dash to 60 mph (96 km/h) takes 5.2 seconds, while the top speed is 126 mph (203 km/h). That brings us to an interesting question, does the world need an all-new LS? The answer is most likely no as our readers have previously declared the era of the flagship sedan over. However, it would be nice to see Lexus take one more swing at the Germans. First-Generation Lexus LS",
