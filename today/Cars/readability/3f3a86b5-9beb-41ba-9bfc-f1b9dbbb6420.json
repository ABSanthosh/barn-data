  "description": "Nissan is evaluating launching its global flagship SUV, the Patrol, in India sometime in 2026. It could be brought to India as a fully imported unit to serve as a halo model, according to sources. The Patrol recently underwent a full generation change globally (codenamed: Y63) and is currently on sale only in left-hand drive markets, with right-hand drive versions set to arrive a little later. Nissan Patrol could come to India as a CBU in 2026 Will likely be powered by a petrol V6 engine Could be positioned against the upcoming Land Cruiser Prado in India Nissan Patrol to serve as brand builder in India At a time when Nissan, and Renault, are gearing up for a fresh product onslaught with two new mass-market SUVs set to arrive from 2025 onwards, the Patrol could potentially be used to better the brand image for Nissan in India. The rugged, body-on-frame Patrol is a legend in the SUV world and has cemented its reputation as an indestructible model over six generations. Nissan recently tried doing the same with the fully-imported X-Trail in our market, but it received a rather lukewarm response, thanks to it being a comparatively older model and its prohibitive pricing. The Patrol, however, being an all-new and a modern product will be much better placed to do so. Moreover, the Patrol will give Nissan a formidable rival to take on the Toyota LC300, and with the latter also gearing up to launch the new Land Cruiser Prado in India by late 2025, it could give rise to a new segment of XXL-sized 4x4 SUVs.  We reported about Patrol's India launch in the Confidential section of the October 2024 issue. This is not the first time Nissan has considered launching the Patrol in India. Back in 2020, the brand was evaluating the previous-gen Patrol (Y62) for an India launch just as it was gearing up to introduce the Magnite, then too serving as a brand builder in our market. It even conducted multiple customer clinics for the SUV, but ultimately decided against it. Nissan Patrol's global rollout plan Nissan is gradually introducing the new Patrol to its existing markets, although all of it are currently left-hand drive markets. However, demand for the new SUV from markets like Australia, South Africa and even its home market in Japan has prompted Nissan to tool up for RHD versions, and it is expected to launch internationally by 2026. The Patrol currently gets two petrol V6 engine options – a naturally aspirated, 3.8-litre unit and a more powerful, twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre unit – and it is likely one of these will be brought to India; there’s no diesel or a petrol V8 like previous generations of the Patrol. Of course, the Patrol won’t come cheap. Being Nissan’s flagship model globally and a full import, prices will likely be well upwards of Rs 1 crore, ex-showroom.  Also See: New Kia Carnival sold out for nearly a year in India Mitsubishi DST seven seat SUV concept revealed",
