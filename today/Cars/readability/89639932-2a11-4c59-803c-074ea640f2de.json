The selling dealer acquired the truck in 2024 and it now has 66k miles. This G500 is offered in South Carolina at no reserve with a clean Carfax report and a clean Texas title. The truck is finished in Arctic White (650) and has been modified with a Front Runner roof rack and ladder, W461 side mirrors, light guards, mudflaps, a European-style receiver hitch, and black-finished bumpers. Additional exterior details include a sunroof, fog lights, rear parking sensors, and a rear window wiper. Paint meter readings are shown in the gallery below. The black-finished 17″ Fifteen52 wheels are wrapped with 275/75 Falken Wildpeak tires, and a spare tire carrier is mounted on the swing-out rear cargo door. The heated power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Gray leather, and interior amenities include a heated rear bench, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Harman Kardon sound system, a CD stereo, a backup camera, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. Plaid fabric lines the door panels. The heated steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 66k miles. The 5.0-liter M113 V8 was factory rated at 292 horsepower and 336 lb-ft of torque. In 2024 an oil change was performed and the air filter and cabin filter were replaced. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and locking front, center, and rear differentials.
