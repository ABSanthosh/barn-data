Finished in Grigio Silverstone over tan leather upholstery, the car has 20″ Y-spoke alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, carbon-ceramic brakes, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear parking sensors, a retractable hardtop, xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable Daytona-style front seats, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. This California was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with the owner’s manual, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title. The Pininfarina-designed bodywork is finished in Grigio Silverstone and features a two-piece folding retractable hardtop, fender vents, a hood scoop, a front lip spoiler, xenon headlights, an integrated rear spoiler, front and rear parking sensors, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and stacked quad exhaust outlets. Imperfections are highlighted in the gallery. The 20″ Y-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Stopping power is provided by Brembo calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. Three wheels have curb damage. The 2+2 cabin features heated power-adjustable Daytona-style front seats upholstered in tan leather with Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests. Interior amenities include a CD stereo, dual-zone automatic climate control, machined aluminum pedals, and a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation. The right window switch is missing. The leather- and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel features an engine-start button, LED shift indicator lights, and a manettino drive-mode selector dial. Paddle shifters are mounted on the steering column, and instrumentation includes a central 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by a 220-mph speedometer and a digital screen. The digital odometer indicates 20k miles. The 4.3-liter F136 V8 was factory rated at 483 horsepower and 372 lb-ft of torque. The car passed an emissions inspection in October 2023. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.
