  "text": "The Crosstrek Premium now packs a 182hp punch, offering a notable boost in performance over the previous model's 152 hp engine 4 hours ago by Michael Gauthier The 2025 Subaru Crosstrek starts at $25,695, marking a price increase of $300 to $500 from last year. The Premium trim now includes a 2.5-liter engine delivering 182 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque. New safety tech includes Automatic Emergency Steering that helps prevent forward collisions. The Subaru Crosstrek was redesigned for 2024, but that hasn’t stopped the company from making a handful of updates for 2025. Most notably, the automaker is putting the premium back into the Premium trim. As part of this effort, the model trades its previous 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine for a new one that displaces 2.5-liters. Thanks to this switch, the output climbs from 152 hp (113 kW / 154 PS) and 145 lb-ft (197 Nm) of torque to 182 hp (136 kW / 185 PS) and 178 lb-ft (241 Nm) of torque. More: Subaru Dolls Up Crosstrek For The Wilderness The boxer unit is connected to a continuously variable transmission, which sends power to a standard all-wheel drive system. The Premium trim also gains a new X-Mode system with Snow/Dirt and Deep Snow/Mud settings to better “optimize all-wheel drive performance in difficult weather or adverse road conditions. Given the updates, it’s not surprising to learn pricing for the Crosstrek Premium climbs from $26,345 to $26,945. That works out to be $20 per extra pony, although that’s before factoring in the destination fee which has increased from $1,345 to $1,420. Additional changes are limited, but Subaru mentioned minor tweaks to color options and upholstery. The automaker also revealed Crosstreks featuring Rear-Cross Traffic Alert and Blind-Spot Detection with Lane Keep Assist, now have Automatic Emergency Steering. It “works with EyeSight and Blind-Spot Detection to assist with steering control within the lane of travel to help avoid forward crashes at speeds slower than 50 mph (80 km/h).” If you’re wondering about pricing across the range, the 2025 Crosstrek starts at $25,695 for the entry-level trim, which sticks with the 152 hp 2.0-liter engine—$500 more than last year’s model. However, the remaining trims stick with the $300 price hike seen on the Premium. 2025 Subaru Crosstrek Pricing",
