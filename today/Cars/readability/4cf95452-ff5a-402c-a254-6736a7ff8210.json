  "description": "Honda has taken the wraps off its first electric bike in China – the E-VO – created in alliance with its local partner Guangzhou, and branded under Wuyang-Honda. Honda E-VO gets 4.1kWh and 6.2kWh battery pack options Features a dual 7-inch TFT setup Features like front dashcam, TPMS and three riding modes standard Wuyang Honda E VO battery pack details 4.1kWh pack has 120km claimed range, 6.2kWh pack has 170km claimed range The Honda E-VO is the brand’s first electric bike, made in collaboration with its Chinese partner Wuyang. The E-VO looks like a cafe racer and is available with two battery sizes – 4.1kWh and 6.2kWh. The smaller dual-battery setup gets a 4.1kWh battery pack with a WMTC-claimed range of 120km and a kerb weight of 143kg. It can be charged using a home charger in 1 hour 30 minutes or with a traditional car charger in 1 hour. The larger triple-battery configuration gets a 6.2kWh battery and a higher 170km (WMTC) range. This model weighs in at 156kg, and can be charged in 2 hours and 30 minutes via a home charger and in 1 hour and 30 minutes using a traditional car charger. Both the battery packs power the motor that produces a peak power of 15.3kW. The E-VO runs on an unconventional 16/14-inch (F/R) wheel setup shod in semi-slick tyres. It gets dual-channel ABS. The chassis features a forged all-aluminium build. Wuyang Honda E VO features The E-VO’s features list is also generous with some innovative firsts. It gets three riding modes (Eco/Normal/Sport), a 7-inch TFT dash with a secondary TFT of the same size that communicates navigation, music, tyre pressure and battery SOC information, among others. The smaller battery pack gets a front dash cam whereas the larger battery model adds a rear dash cam to the package. It is available in two colours – black and white. It is priced at CNY 30,000 (Rs 3.56 lakh approx) for the 4.1kWh battery variant and CNY 37,000 (Rs 4.39 lakh approx) for the 6.2kWh variant. This electric bike is made specially for the Chinese market with their regional partner Wuyang, and it is unlikely that Honda launches the E-VO in India. All CNY to INR conversions based on current exchange rate. Also see: Yamaha electric scooter based on River Indie spied testing",
