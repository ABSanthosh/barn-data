  "text": "Both cars sold for $265,265, which is roughly what a new Demon 170 went for at some dealers October 11, 2024 at 20:36 by Stephen Rivers A pair of Dodge Demons, one from 2018 and the other from 2023, sold for $265,265 on BaT. That value is in line with what some dealers asked for the Demon 170 when it was brand new. The 2018 SRT Demon makes up to 840 hp while the Demon 170 boasts an impressive 1,025 hp. Dodge Demons as we know them are no longer. Not only is the Challenger itself out of production, but so is the HEMI V8 and the Hellcat. The only way to get anything close to a new one is to buy second-hand. That’s exactly what one savvy buyer just did and he snagged a pair of VIN-matched Demons at that. Up for sale over on Bring A Trailer were two Pitch Black Demons, one from 2018 and the other, the prized 170 model from 2023. They each bear a #1636 VIN, leverage a supercharged V8, a manual transmission, and each has incredibly low mileage. The 2018 model sports just 450 miles while the 2023 one has only 17.

That of course, didn’t stop dealers from charging an arm and a leg. In one case, a dealer asked $386,321 for a Demon 170 just a year ago. That’s why the buyer here did well, considering that he picked up both for $265,265, although he admittedly paid a $50k markup over the original MSRPs combined. The 2018 SRT Demon makes up to 840 horsepower (626 kW) and 770 lb-ft (1,042 Nm) of torque. The Demon 170 outdoes that by being capable of making 1,025 horsepower (764 kW) and 945 lb-ft (1,279 Nm) of torque. Undoubtedly, these are two majestic muscle cars. In addition, each car comes complete with other SRT, Dodge, and Demon-branded accouterments. That includes the Demon crate from 2018. Inside buyers will find a race-tuned ECU, a performance air filter, a cordless impact wrench, front runner wheels, a tire pressure gauge, and a hydraulic floor jack. The Demon 170 comes with a decanter set engraved with the car’s VIN number on it. Interestingly, there were only 12 bids during the entire auction and there was no big frenzy at the end. The pair sat at $250,000 beginning on the 5th and didn’t move north until mid-day on the 8th when it rose to the final price. Hopefully, Demon owners who patiently waited to buy until huge markups died off feel a bit better about that choice. Even though they might have still paid over MSRP, it saved them tens of thousands nonetheless. Photos Bring A Trailer",
