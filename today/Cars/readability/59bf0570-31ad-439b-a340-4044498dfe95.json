  "description": "A few months ago, we got a taste of the seventh-generation (G90) BMW M5 at the Buddh International Circuit. However, that was with a pace car; today is different. Very different. We have it all to ourselves at the CoASTT racetrack and out on public roads. So, it’s time for a full review and to get some answers to that weighty issue. You see, amidst stringent emissions regulations, the new M5 has managed to hold on to the V8 engine thanks to a plug-in hybrid setup. While the new M5 is a lot more powerful than its predecessor, it’s also far heavier. Oh, and it’s got all-wheel drive too. 2025 BMW M5 powertrain and performance Twin-turbo V8, plug-in hybrid setup BMW M5 specificationsFuel typePetrol-hybridEngine4395cc, twin-turbo V8 petrolPower585hp at 5600-6500rpmTorque750Nm at 1800-5400rpmBattery18.6kWhElectric motor power197hpElectric motor torque280NmCombined power727hpGearbox8-speed torque converter automaticTyres (front)285/40 R20Tyres (rear)295/35 R21Kerb weight2435kgGround clearance115mm It was clear that if the M5 had to continue with the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet and still do its diligence to Mother Nature, it would need some form of electrification. Enter the plug-in hybrid, which provides a claimed 67km of all-electric range. It also gives the 585hp engine an additional 197hp from an 18.6kWh battery pack. The combined output stands at a healthy 727hp and 1,000Nm. V8, hybrid and AWD all add up to a lot of weight. Expectedly, with the motor’s instant response and the power of the mighty V8, the new M5 is rapid off the line. It simply shoots off and continues to pull well past hysterical speeds. 0-100kph in 3.5 seconds might be slower than the previous version, but 0-200kph in under 11 seconds is very quick. Opt for the M Driver’s Pack, and the top speed jumps from 250kph to 305kph. As soon as it gets a straight road, it’s as excited to unleash its 1,000Nm as a dog is on the beach. However, while the numbers are strong, the M5 has always been more about the experience behind the wheel. Yes, the acceleration is impressive, but the sensation of speed just isn’t there. It also gets a ‘Boost’ mode, which lends a push under acceleration. Still, the abundance of foam and leather cocoons you, and the hushed cabin feels unfazed by the blur on the outside. Sure, the exhaust sound that is piped in through the speakers adds some drama, but none of it feels raw or unhinged. 2025 BMW M5 ride comfort and handling Heavy kerb weight can be felt in the corners Get to the long and flowing corners of CoASTT, and the elephant in the room starts to make its presence felt. The 2.5-tonne kerb weight is too much to hide. Yes, BMW has done its best to keep the weight in the centre and low to the ground with the floor-mounted battery pack, but it’s not enough, especially when it comes to a change of direction. There is constant understeer, and despite getting the tyres up to temperature, they just scream in despair as the AWD system tries to find grip on every inch of tarmac.   No fun if you are into attacking corners. You can try and find the sweet spot by tinkering around in the drive mode settings menu, which is nothing short of a Pandora’s box. You can either get it way too wrong or hit the jackpot. Either way, it will take time. With settings that can be altered for throttle response, steering feedback, chassis setup, brake feedback and dampers – before you even get to the hybrid modes – it is far too overwhelming. You’d expect BMW to provide a ready-made car like the M340i, where it sticks to one basic character, and you can fine-tune a few settings to a limit. But with the M5, it’s to each his own. Vast setup needs a lot of trial and error. It can be an altogether different beast, depending on the buttons you press. In the event you do find the right setup, there are two red buttons tagged ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ that act as preset switches, so you don’t have to spend hours calibrating the setup again. However, if lap times aren’t your priority, there is the option to switch to 2WD, which sends power exclusively to the rear wheels for some sideways action and tyre smoke. Sure, it needs confidence to push the rear out on a 727hp rear-wheel-drive car, but, if done correctly, it makes for a fantastic Instagram post. Also worth praising are the carbon-ceramic brakes, which have the toughest job here – stopping this very quick woolly mammoth. The brake feel is natural, and the strong bite means you don’t need to worry about a tired ankle after a track day. It gets all the cutting-edge tech to master a racetrack but feels at home on highways. So, it’s clear that on a race track, the new M5 is not particularly fun. It is better suited for long highway straights. In Comfort, the suspension is tamer, too, and broken roads are dealt with impressively. There is body movement over highway undulations, but nothing that can be termed unsettling. The car remains flat at cruising speeds and is surprisingly comfortable. The steering can be set up for lightness, the gearbox for lenient shifting, and the throttle for a less aggressive approach. What further helps its daily manners is the plug-in hybrid system, with approximately 50km of real-world electric range on a full charge. It may not sound like a lot, but any saving of high-octane fuel is always welcome. Expect about 50km of all-electric driving range. Don’t think you’re missing out on the speed, though. Even in electric mode, the top speed is 140kph, so as long as there is charge, the M5-ness is there. At low city speeds, the one thing you need to be wary of is the speed bumps. With no ride height adjust, there isn’t much you can do to tackle some poorly constructed breakers, and you have to crab-crawl like a supercar. Still, it feels more at home and comfortable outside of a racetrack. You have the instant acceleration for quick gaps, the drama with the exhaust that will get all the metropolitan attention, and plenty of features to keep you busy while at a standstill. 2025 BMW M5 exterior design Less of a 'sleeper' than prior M5s In the past, the M5 has mastered the art of being a ‘sleeper car’ – an unassuming, discreet design that packs a surprise under the bonnet. But with each generation, the subtle approach has taken a back seat. Speed bumps need to be dealt with caution, but it is better than an i5. The new one shows off aggression with flared wheel arches, aggressive bumpers, and a matte black paint that is nonchalant yet gets enough second looks. 20-inch front wheels and 21-inch rear wheels further elevate the drama, and if nothing else, a simple exhaust upgrade will have people take notice. 2025 BMW M5 interior and features 14.9-inch infotainment system, 12.3-inch digital driver's display Inside, the M5 gets BMW’s minimalistic layout with a curved display. The 12.3-inch cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen are crisp and responsive, but the minimalistic dashboard has resulted in a chaotic iDrive system. Everything from the HVAC to media and the drive modes are buried under menus and sub-menus, and while there are shortcuts and widgets, it just isn’t natural or intuitive. Funky dashboard with generous use of crystal and ambient lighting. Feels racy yet luxurious. The chunky steering wheel feels great to hold, and the seats are superbly accommodating – sporty but broad, with lots of adjustability and well-cushioned. Long drives are what this M5 yearns for. For all the cutting-edge tech underneath to help it out at the Nürburgring, it feels like it would be happiest on the Autobahn. Rear seat space is inevitably of lower priority, but despite being the standard wheelbase (unlike the long-wheelbase regular 5 Series), there is plenty of room on offer. Being chauffeured around in electric mode from Monday to Friday sounds like a good idea, so long as you are okay handing your chauffeur the keys to your 727hp supersedan. Don't look up to pray. No sunroof here. Boot space is impressive too, so that weekend escape to the farmhouse can definitely happen, and it will be rapid and comfortable. Just engage Comfort mode, amp up the 18-speaker Bowers and Wilkins system, and blast off. 2025 BMW M5 price and verdict Rivals the Porsche Panamera GTS and upcoming Mercedes-AMG E 63 At Rs 1.99 crore (ex-showroom, India), the M5 has some stiff competition. The closest of the lot is the Porsche Panamera GTS, which is also a four-door super-sedan with a V8 engine. The new Mercedes-AMG E 63 will soon set foot on our shores, but in the past, the competition was never a major threat to the M5. With this new one, though, things don’t seem as easy. The M5's competitors are much stronger this time round. It’s not as exciting as the last one when it comes to driving dynamics. Making some amends is the outstanding straight-line speed and the fact that it is a comfortable daily driver. If you’ve driven the previous F90 M5, the excitement is missing, and this one will not impress you as much. However, if you’re getting into one with no M5 baggage, the new-gen M5, with its V8 intact, will do enough to have you smiling.

There is constant understeer, and despite getting the tyres up to temperature, they just scream in despair as the AWD system tries to find grip on every inch of tarmac.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW_M5_Driving.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo fun if you are into attacking corners.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can try and find the sweet spot by tinkering around in the drive mode settings menu, which is nothing short of a Pandora’s box. You can either get it way too wrong or hit the jackpot. Either way, it will take time. With settings that can be altered for throttle response, steering feedback, chassis setup, brake feedback and dampers – before you even get to the hybrid modes – it is far too overwhelming. You’d expect BMW to provide a ready-made car like the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/bmw/3-series\"\u003eM340i\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, where it sticks to one basic character, and you can fine-tune a few settings to a limit. But with the M5, it’s to each his own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW_M5_Touchscreen.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eVast setup needs a lot of trial and error.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be an altogether different beast, depending on the buttons you press. In the event you do find the right setup, there are two red buttons tagged ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ that act as preset switches, so you don’t have to spend hours calibrating the setup again. However, if lap times aren’t your priority, there is the option to switch to 2WD, which sends power exclusively to the rear wheels for some sideways action and tyre smoke. Sure, it needs confidence to push the rear out on a 727hp rear-wheel-drive car, but, if done correctly, it makes for a fantastic Instagram post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso worth praising are the carbon-ceramic brakes, which have the toughest job here – stopping this very quick woolly mammoth. The brake feel is natural, and the strong bite means you don’t need to worry about a tired ankle after a track day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW_M5_Rear_Quarter_Tracking.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt gets all the cutting-edge tech to master a racetrack but feels at home on highways.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, it’s clear that on a race track, the new M5 is not particularly fun. It is better suited for long highway straights. In Comfort, the suspension is tamer, too, and broken roads are dealt with impressively. There is body movement over highway undulations, but nothing that can be termed unsettling. The car remains flat at cruising speeds and is surprisingly comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe steering can be set up for lightness, the gearbox for lenient shifting, and the throttle for a less aggressive approach. What further helps its daily manners is the plug-in hybrid system, with approximately 50km of real-world electric range on a full charge. It may not sound like a lot, but any saving of high-octane fuel is always welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW_M5_Charging_Port.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eExpect about 50km of all-electric driving range.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t think you’re missing out on the speed, though. Even in electric mode, the top speed is 140kph, so as long as there is charge, the M5-ness is there. At low city speeds, the one thing you need to be wary of is the speed bumps. With no ride height adjust, there isn’t much you can do to tackle some poorly constructed breakers, and you have to crab-crawl like a supercar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, it feels more at home and comfortable outside of a racetrack. You have the instant acceleration for quick gaps, the drama with the exhaust that will get all the metropolitan attention, and plenty of features to keep you busy while at a standstill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2025 BMW M5 exterior design\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLess of a \u0026#39;sleeper\u0026#39; than prior M5s\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past, the M5 has mastered the art of being a ‘sleeper car’ – an unassuming, discreet design that packs a surprise under the bonnet.

The 12.3-inch cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen are crisp and responsive, but the minimalistic dashboard has resulted in a chaotic iDrive system. Everything from the HVAC to media and the drive modes are buried under menus and sub-menus, and while there are shortcuts and widgets, it just isn’t natural or intuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.autocarindia.com/Reviews/BMW_M5_Interior.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;c=0\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFunky dashboard with generous use of crystal and ambient lighting.

Long drives are what this M5 yearns for. For all the cutting-edge tech underneath to help it out at the Nürburgring, it feels like it would be happiest on the Autobahn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRear seat space is inevitably of lower priority, but despite being the standard wheelbase (unlike the long-wheelbase regular 5 Series), there is plenty of room on offer.
