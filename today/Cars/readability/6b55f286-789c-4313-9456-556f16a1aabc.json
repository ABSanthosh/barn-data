  "text": "Combine Dodge's existing offers and the 710-hp family hauler becomes a more enticing option 2 hours ago by Brad Anderson The super SUV comes with Dodge’s ‘Power Dollars’ offer, providing a $7,100 cash discount. Existing Ford customers are also offered a conquest bonus valued at $2,000. Dodge will discontinue the Durango SRT Hellcat after the 2025 model year. The days of high-powered V8s are numbered, especially those wearing a Dodge badge. Soon, the brand’s dealers will begin delivering the all-electric Charger to customers, with a whole lineup of other EVs likely to follow. So, if you want a new V8 Dodge, you may want to make the most of this new deal for the 2025 Durango SRT Hellcat. Not long after Dodge confirmed that it would build the Durango SRT Hellcat in limited quantities for the 2025 model year, the brand made it eligible for a range of incentives that can knock up to $13,100 off the price. If this limited-time offer doesn’t convince potential buyers to add the performance SUV to their shopping lists, then we’re not sure what will. Read: Dodge Durango Hellcat Silver Bullet Sends Off Hemi V8 With A Bang First up, the 2025 Durango SRT Hellcat is available with the ‘National Power Dollars Retail Bonus Cash’ offer which is valued at $10 per horsepower. As the Durango SRT Hellcat’s 6.2-liter supercharged V8 delivers 710 ponies, that equates to $7,100. Importantly, this deal is only offered to those purchasing the super SUV, not leasing it. On top of that, Dodge is offering a $4,000 National Engine Bonus Cash deal, Cars Direct reports. This offer is available to both purchasers and lessees, and it can be combined with an additional $2,000 in National Ford Conquest Bonus Cash for customers who currently own a Ford. Add everything up, and you’re looking at a potential discount of $13,100. While Dodge hasn’t revealed the full pricing details for the 2025 Durango SRT Hellcat lineup, we know the limited-run Hammerhead and Silver Bullet versions start at $113,720 and $113,325, respectively. For context, base versions of last year’s Durango SRT Hellcat were priced starting at $97,590. While it’s certainly not cheap, the Durango SRT Hellcat might just offer some bang for your buck—if it’s raw performance and a big, brawny V8 are what your after. That is, as long as you’re willing to overlook the fact that it’s a decade-old platform with a giant engine crammed into an SUV. Sure, its massive V8 cranks out 710 hp and 645 lb-ft (874 Nm) of torque, letting it rocket to 60 mph (96 km/h) in just 3.5 seconds and tear through the quarter-mile in 11.5 seconds. But for the price, you might expect a little more innovation, luxury and modern tech features rather than just brute force, especially considering we’re talking about a three-row SUV, not a sports car.",
