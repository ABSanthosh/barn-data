Equipment includes an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, a sport exhaust system, a retractable hardtop, 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, SCM-E magnetorheological suspension, a front-axle lift system, AFS adaptive LED headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear parking sensors, heated power-adjustable seats, front and rear cameras, a JBL sound system, carbon-fiber interior trim, adaptive cruise control, a sport exhaust system, and navigation. Purchased new by the owner, this F8 Spider has 12k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title. The F8 was designed under the direction of Flavio Manzoni at the Ferrari Styling Centre and debuted at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. This example is finished in Rosso Scuderia and has a retractable hardtop, AFS adaptive LED headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, front and rear parking sensors, quarter panel air intakes, and dual exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior. The 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The car was factory-equipped with an SCM-E magnetorheological suspension and a front-axle lift system, and braking is handled by yellow Brembo calipers fitted over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors at each corner. A wheel was replaced in May 2024, and a brake fluid flush was performed in November 2024. The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in beige leather with red center stripes and Cavallino Rampante logos on the headrests, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Additional appointments include a JBL sound system, adaptive cruise control, front and rear cameras, drilled aluminum pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and navigation. The carbon-fiber- and leather-trimmed steering wheel sits ahead of paddle shifters and features an engine-start button, a manettino drive-mode selector, and shift lights. Instrumentation consists of a central 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by configurable digital displays. The digital odometer indicates 12k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The mid-mounted twin-turbocharged 3.9L F154 V8 was factory rated at 710 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. The car was optioned with a sport exhaust system. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Ferrari of Seattle in Washington, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total suggested retail price of $368,254.
