  "description": "This 1980 Aston Martin V8 is a Series 4 Volante that was sold new in Texas and later spent time in California before being purchased by the current owner out of Washington in 2005. It is powered by a 5.3-liter V8 that was rebuilt between 2010 and 2011 and topped by quad Weber 48mm carburetors. The car was listed on BaT in May 2019 and subsequently cosmetically refurbished in Italy, with work including a repaint in Jubilee Silver, the installation of a new convertible top, a re-trim of the interior in gray leather, and the installation of a Euro-spec rear valance and bumper. The car is also fitted with a five-speed manual gearbox, painted 15\" GKN Kent alloy wheels, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo. This V8 Volante is now offered on dealer consignment with spare and removed parts, service records, and a Maryland title in the owner's name.",

It is powered by a 5.3-liter V8 that was rebuilt between 2010 and 2011 and topped by quad Weber 48mm carburetors. The car was listed on BaT in May 2019 and subsequently cosmetically refurbished in Italy, with work including a repaint in Jubilee Silver, the installation of a new convertible top, a re-trim of the interior in gray leather, and the installation of a Euro-spec rear valance and bumper. The car is also fitted with a five-speed manual gearbox, painted 15″ GKN Kent alloy wheels, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo. This V8 Volante is now offered on dealer consignment with spare and removed parts, service records, and a Maryland title in the owner’s name. The car was reportedly shipped to Italy in June 2019 to be stripped and refinished in its original Jubilee Silver with blue pinstripes. A replacement gray convertible top was also fitted along with a Euro-spec rear valance and bumpers. The painted 15″ GKN Kent alloy wheels are mounted with Radar LT 71 tires. Haziness and water-spotting are noted on the wheels, as are weathered center caps. The car was equipped from the factory with an independent front and de Dion rear suspension, and stopping power is provided by ventilated discs at all four corners. The front bucket and individual-back rear seats were reupholstered in gray leather in 2019. Interior amenities include wood trim, power windows, a Blaupunkt AM/FM/cassette stereo, and air conditioning, the latter of which does not work. The knob for the choke lever is missing, and wear is present on some of the buttons and face plates. The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation including a 7k-rpm tachometer, a 170-mph speedometer, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and voltage. The five-digit odometer shows 62k miles, roughly 17k of which were added under current ownership. The 5,340cc V8 was rebuilt between 2010 and 2011 according to receipts in the gallery. The engine was fitted with four Weber 48mm downdraft carburetors using a European-style base plate, throttle linkage, and air filter box.  An invoice in the gallery shows that in 2011 the cylinder heads were rebuilt and the carburetors were serviced and reinstalled with new fiber washers. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed dog-leg manual transmission and a Powr-Lok limited slip differential. The clutch was replaced in 2010 prior to the engine rebuild. A photocopy of the Aston Martin Car Record Card lists factory equipment and identification numbers and indicates that the car was produced for the US market with a ship date of August 29, 1980.
