Specified in Bahama Yellow, the car was imported to the US in 1985 and underwent a refurbishment in 2013 with work that involved a repaint, a rebuild of the replacement 2.0-liter flat-six, and a refresh of the Type 901 five-speed manual transaxle. The interior was reupholstered in 2016 and houses sport seats trimmed in black leatherettte and Pepita cloth, and additional equipment includes driving lamps, fog lights, 15\" Fuchs wheels, a Webasto heater, and aftermarket taillights. This SWB 911S coupe is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a copy of the Kardex report, the owner's manual, service records, and a clean California title.",

The interior was reupholstered in 2016 and houses sport seats trimmed in black leatherettte and Pepita cloth, and additional equipment includes driving lamps, fog lights, 15″ Fuchs wheels, a Webasto heater, and aftermarket taillights. This SWB 911S coupe is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, a copy of the Kardex report, the owner’s manual, service records, and a clean California title. The car came finished from the factory in Bahama Yellow (6705) and was repainted in 2013 by John Esposito’s Porsche Repair. Exterior details include fog lights, driving lamps, and aftermarket clear taillight lenses. The 15″ Fuchs wheels are mounted with 165-width Michelin XZX tires. The car was factory equipped with an independent front suspension including an anti-sway bar, longitudinal torsion bar, upper struts, and lower wishbones. The rear semi-trailing arm setup features a transverse torsion bar. The brake master cylinder and rear brake pads and rotors were replaced in 2013 along with suspension bushings. The cabin was overhauled in 2016, including the installation of sport seats trimmed in black leatherette and Pepita cloth and replacement of the carpets and headliner. The door panels were also reupholstered, the dash was repainted and re-trimmed, and Dynamat was added to the floors. A Webasto heater came optioned from the factory. The four-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central 8k-rpm tachometer, a 150-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 3,700 miles, which is not considered to be accurate. Total mileage is unknown. The replacement 2.0-liter flat-six was installed in 1968 and was rebuilt in 2013. Dual Weber carburetors have been installed. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Type 901 five-speed manual transaxle, which was refreshed and fitted with replacement first gear dog teeth in 2017. The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity lists the factory colors and serial numbers. A copy of the Kardex is viewable in the gallery. You are not connected to real-time updates.
