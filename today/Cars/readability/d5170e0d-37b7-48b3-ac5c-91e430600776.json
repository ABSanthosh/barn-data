  "description": "BMW has taken the wraps off the new M2 CS at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este 2025. The CS – typical of what it suggests in BMW’s parlance – is a lighter, more performance-focused version of the M2 Coupe. Notably, this could be the final version of the brand’s junior sports car to feature a pure combustion engine. New M2 CS will be produced in limited numbers Is powered by a 530hp, 3.0-litre twin-turbo petrol engine Has a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.8 seconds 2025 BMW M2 CS engine, specs  Power and torque up by 50hp and 100Nm over regular M2 The M2 CS continues with the same 3.0-litre, inline 6-cylinder twin-turbo petrol engine as the regular M2, but the output has now been bumped up to 530hp and 650Nm – that’s 50hp and 100Nm more. In this car, the engine comes exclusively mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. There’s no manual gearbox because BMW says the 6-speed MT offered with the regular M2 isn’t engineered to handle the higher torque figure. BMW also says it hasn’t seen much demand for the manual, which further supported its decision to offer only the automatic gearbox. As for acceleration, the M2 CS sprints from 0 to 100kph in a claimed 3.8 seconds. 2025 BMW M2 CS chassis upgrades Weighs about 30kg less than the regular M2 More grunt aside, weight-saving measures are also part of the CS package, and to that end, it gets a carbon-fibre roof and boot lid. So, the 1,700kg kerb weight of the CS is about 30kg lower than the regular M2. The M2 CS also gets stiffer engine mounts and bespoke spring and damper tuning. The steering, brakes and differentials, too, have been upgraded. BMW also offers the CS with an optional lightweight titanium M Performance exhaust, which has been specifically designed for this model, and it provides a “more aggressive soundscape”, says the brand. The retuned suspension has resulted in an 8mm lower ride height. 2025 BMW M2 CS exterior and interior   Light weight alloys and ducktail spoiler are the most distinctive elements It will take a keen eye to make out the differences between the face of the M2 CS and the regular M2, but this version has a slightly reworked grille and air vents on the bumper to allow the engine to breathe better. The car’s side profile features new lightweight alloy wheels exclusively finished in gold – again, a typical CS design element. The CS comes in four paint shades – Black Sapphire, Portimao Blue, Brooklyn Grey and Velvet Blue. The most distinctive detail on the new M2 CS is a ducktail spoiler, which should help improve stability at high speeds. The car also gets a more blown-out rear diffuser. Inside, the M2 CS has much sportier carbon bucket seats trimmed in M performance colours, lots of carbon fibre flourishes, and new CS logos on the seats and door sills; there’s a new M-spec Alcantara steering wheel, too. Despite its hardcore positioning, the CS still features creature comforts like a heated steering wheel, 3-zone climate control, a head-up display and a Harman Kardon sound system.
