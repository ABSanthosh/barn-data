  "text": "Remember the Mercedes-Benz EQC? An electric analogue to the GLC-class compact luxury SUV has been in the works for years—and in markets beyond the U.S., it actually existed as a thing people could buy. We in the States didn't get that lucky, though; the EQC as originally conceived suffered several setbacks and ultimately never arrived here. But that'll soon be rectified with the electric GLC. Ahead of the new EV's debut at the IAA auto show in Munich this September, we got a taste of the GLC at Benz's winter proving ground in far-north Sweden.The regular GLC is a bestseller in the U.S., and its electric variant will live within that greater lineup. We don't have an official name yet, but the lineup currently contains the gas-only GLC300 and the plug-in-hybrid GLC350e, so the EV could slide above that as the GLC380 or GLC480, similar to how the electric G580 is positioned above the gas-only G550. Going forward, this is likely how Mercedes will continue to structure its lineups, even when cars within the same line don't share a platform. Despite looking like a gas-powered GLC, the electric variant rides on the dedicated MB.EA platform, which will underpin additional future EVs as well. Ahead of our prototype drive, Mercedes told us the decision to use MB.EA was all about compromise—or rather, a lack thereof; putting an EV on the gas-fed GLC's platform would've required the automaker to make undesirable concessions, whereas MB.EA lets Mercedes engineers optimize for the EV part. The examples we drove were heavily camouflaged inside and out, and concrete specs at this stage are few. But Mercedes did tell us that the GLC EV's body is just a bit longer than the gas model's, granting enough space in the floor to fit a roughly 94.5-kWh battery. The top offering works at 800 volts, and it is said that charging rates of 320 kW can be \"sustained\" on a 350-kW charger. As for range, Mercedes estimates that this juice box will be good for a hair over 400 miles on the European WLTP test cycle, with an EPA estimate north of 300 miles. Lift the hood, and you won't find any power hardware—just a four-cubic-foot frunk, which, according to our eyeballs, should hold at least 50 pounds of shrimp. At least.Similarly, we're not quite sure of the full breadth of powertrains we'll get in the U.S., but deep in wintry Sweden, we sampled a dual-motor all-wheel-drive variant that makes approximately 483 horsepower. On roads covered in snow and ice, that proved more than enough power to get the rear end loose at will, and Sport mode offers a surprising amount of yaw before it slowly dialed back the power and brought the rear end in line. There's a two-speed transmission tucked in at the rear, too, as in the Porsche Taycan, and like the Porsche, the transmission's shifting is nearly imperceptible.Thankfully, there were some stretches where we were able to assess the GLC EV's ride quality on normal pavement. Unsurprisingly, it was mighty smooth; the vehicle we drove included the optional air-spring suspension, which did a great job counteracting the EV's as-yet-unknown curb weight. The car can take a licking, too; with the suspension raised about an inch, we blasted up a small mountain road riddled with washboard bumps and deep ruts. And aside from having the fillings shaken out of our molars, the GLC sailed its way upward without much drama. That's probably more off-roading than most owners will ever do, but it's nice that the capability is there. Mercedes-Benz's complicated all-in-one brake module makes an appearance on the GLC EV, too. We first sampled this unit on the upcoming new CLA-class hybrid; the module combines the booster, master cylinder, and other components, with the goal of providing a seamless brake feel whether using regeneration or friction. The brakes prioritize regen as much as possible to boost efficiency. In most situations, it doesn't rely on a mechanical link between your foot and the brake discs—the feedback and pressure underfoot are simulated, and they're simulated quite well.The interior was completely shrouded, so we can't yet speak to how closely the cabin resembles that of the gas-powered GLC. But we can say that the EV's extra length pays off in rear-seat legroom, which was ample behind a six-foot-two front-seat passenger. The platform's flat floor also left more than enough space to comfortably tuck our feet under the front seat. Between that and the sizable panoramic glass roof, the cabin is airy and feels more spacious than the average compact SUV. There's a long time to go until the GLC EV's official debut in September, and it will likely end up as a 2026 model when it goes on sale in the States. While pricing likely won't be announced until after the Munich show concludes, we can look at current context; the GLC350e PHEV tops out at $65,2o0 in its loaded Pinnacle trim, so we'd estimate a starting price somewhere above that. The electric GLC will be expensive, but after our brief spin in one, we think it'll fit right into the greater lineup—when it finally arrives. Which we think it will, this time.Cars are Andrew Krok’s jam, along with boysenberry. After graduating with a degree in English from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2009, Andrew cut his teeth writing freelance magazine features, and now he has a decade of full-time review experience under his belt. A Chicagoan by birth, he has been a Detroit resident since 2015. Maybe one day he’ll do something about that half-finished engineering degree.",
