  "text": "A rare limo with a Hollywood backstory, minibar, and custom build heads to auction next month July 20, 2025 at 21:01 by Michael Gauthier A one-off Volkswagen Beetle limousine is heading to auction next month in California. The wheelbase was stretched 40 in. to accommodate a fully customized interior layout. Its estimated value is $150,000–$200,000, nearly 100 times its original sticker price. Monterey Car Week is home to some of the most amazing auctions as you’ll see countless rare and beautifully restored cars – including some you’ve never heard of before. While many of them are highly desirable exotics, this 1969 Volkswagen Beetle limousine could be the oddest of them all. Commissioned by Porsche and Volkswagen West Coast distributor John von Neumann, the conversion reportedly cost $34,499.95. That might not sound like much these days, but the Beetle retailed for a mere $2,063. More: This Puny Bug Pulled Nearly $100K After Triggering A Bidding Frenzy So what did that princely sum get? A heavily modified bug that was constructed by Troutman-Barnes, which was known for building Chaparral and Scarab racecars. However, the company also built a four-door Porsche 911, so a Volkswagen limo was right up their alley. The resulting car is instantly recognizable as a Beetle and the team used genuine Volkswagen components whenever possible. This means the limo is pretty faithful to the original, despite having a wheelbase that has been stretched by 40 inches (1,016 mm). RM Sotheby’s Thanks to the extra length, Troutman-Barnes was able to add custom rear doors and a bespoke passenger compartment. The latter features a gray bench as well as two jump seats that are separated by a minibar with a deployable table. Elsewhere, there’s mahogany trim and a partition with a power divider. They’re joined by an intercom, soundproofing, and power windows. The model also sported a five-speaker Phillips audio system with a cassette player, although a more modern Kenwood head unit and CD changer have been installed in recent years. The driver’s compartment is pretty basic, but there are black vinyl seats and a minimalist instrument cluster. They’re joined by a four-speed manual, which is certainly something you don’t see in modern limousines. RM Sotheby’s RM Sotheby’s listing is light on specifics, but the auction house notes the original 1.5-liter four-cylinder was replaced by a 1.6-liter engine with 48-millimeter Weber downdraft carburetors as part of the conversion. The extra oomph was designed to help offset the 400 lb (181 kg) weight gain. The Rollswagen, as it would become known, became something of a star and was shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It also appeared in an ad campaign and was reportedly used to drive John Wayne to the 1970 Academy Awards. It’s slated to be auctioned off next month without reserve. While it’s hard to put a price on unique models like this, RM Sotheby’s lists an auction estimate of between $150,000 and $200,000. RM Sotheby’s",
