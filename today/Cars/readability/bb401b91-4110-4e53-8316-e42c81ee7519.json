  "description": "When Massimo Rinchiuso of Fuchs Workshop received a call from his good friend Niko Sorbo about a new project, it didn’t take much convincing to get him on board. Niko is a three-time French FFM flat track champion, holds gold and silver medals from the German Krowdrace series, and finished third in the Italian FMI Cup. A dirt racer at heart, his motto is “Go fast, turn left, * brakes.” “Niko represents many things: a rider to admire on the track, a pain-in-the-neck client who’s always got something new to ask, but above all, a true friend,” beams Massimo. “Someone who feels like family, like a brother.” The bike that introduced Niko to the sport of flat track racing all those years ago was this humble Honda NX650 Dominator.…",

  "text": "When Massimo Rinchiuso of Fuchs Workshop received a call from his good friend Niko Sorbo about a new project, it didn’t take much convincing to get him on board. Niko is a three-time French FFM flat track champion, holds gold and silver medals from the German Krowdrace series, and finished third in the Italian FMI Cup. A dirt racer at heart, his motto is “Go fast, turn left, * brakes.” “Niko represents many things: a rider to admire on the track, a pain-in-the-neck client who’s always got something new to ask, but above all, a true friend,” beams Massimo. “Someone who feels like family, like a brother.” The bike that introduced Niko to the sport of flat track racing all those years ago was this humble Honda NX650 Dominator. “Since then, the Dominator has become a personal symbol for Niko,” Massimo adds. “So much so that he gave it his mother’s nickname: Rusinella.” Niko came to Massimo’s workshop in Ravenna, Italy with the old Dominator and something that he has in abundance—enthusiasm. The bike was worse for wear, so Massimo knew they were in for a challenge, even before they went down the rabbit hole of modifications. Massimo and Niko are masters of their crafts though, so putting in work behind the scenes is what they do. “The bike had to perfectly meet Niko’s needs as a rider, with geometry tailored for dirt, speed, and oval racing,” Massimo explains. “But it also had to be beautiful to look at, because every welded joint, every line, every color choice reflects a part of me, too.” To prep the Honda Dominator for its new life in the dirt, Massimo adapted the swingarm from a Honda CRF450 to fit the older frame. Chosen for its longer length, increased stiffness, and lightweight construction, it’s paired with an adjustable YSS rear shock. 19” Kineo tubeless spoked wheels were chosen for their lightness, strength, and looks, and shod with Anlas ARD-1 flat track tires. 41 mm Honda CBR forks with custom YSS internals sit in CNC-machined aluminum fork yokes, with a modified 25-degree headstock for sharper steering. And since this is a proper flat track bike with no front brake, the fork lowers were liberated of their brake caliper mounts. A tiny handmade aluminum fuel tank sits in front of a fiberglass flat track tailpiece, which is supported by a bolt-on aluminum tube subframe. An electronics box is tucked under the seat, integrated with the subframe to add structural rigidity. A custom-made internal fender protects the electronics and air filter from dirt and grime. Tall, wide CMV Meccanica handlebars sit up top, fitted with ODI bolt-on grips, a new clutch lever, a decompression lever, and a tethered killswitch. A simple plastic number plate is affixed to the fork clamps, wearing Niko’s racing number and other small graphics. The engine also received a major rebuild, thanks to Fuchs Workshop’s engine guru, Claudio Lanconelli. Performance-focused upgrades include a high-compression oversized piston, a port-matched cylinder head, a lightened crankshaft and flywheel, and a re-profiled camshaft. The intake features an updated carb with an enormous pod filter, and the exhaust system was pieced together using parts from SC-Project. The Dominator’s livery is a beguiling mix of classic Honda colors, set against the clear-coated aluminum of the fuel tank and the bike’s blue frame. Gold wheels and fresh black paint on the engine give the whole thing a factory race bike feel. A machined fuel cap adds a finishing touch, engraved with the names of the shop, Niko, and the bike. “While it may look like a ‘simple’ bike, there are countless custom-built details,” says Massimo. “Many of them were crafted from scratch using a lathe, a CNC mill, and even 3D-printed parts, highlighting just how much care went into every element.” This Honda NX650 Dominator flat tracker is a combination of two friends’ passions—Niko’s for riding, and Massimo’s for detail, functionality, and aesthetics. They’ve nailed the overall design and proportions, and it’s even got that legendary air-cooled Honda reliability as a bonus. The only changes we’d suggest are lights and a license plate, so that we could make this our daily runner. Fuchs Workshop Facebook | Instagram | pics by Christian Fussi",
