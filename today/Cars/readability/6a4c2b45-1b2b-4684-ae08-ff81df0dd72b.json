The Speedhunters store has finally returned, and we’ve already stacked it full of the merch you’ve been asking for all this time… We’re talking tees, hoodies, stickers, and tote bags to name a few. In recent years we’ve dropped collaborations from the likes of Renown and Earnest – both of which we’re immensely proud of – but we’ve been missing a dedicated Speedhunters store for the merch you’ve wanted most. To celebrate the return of our store, we’ve decided to kick things off with a modern twist on a Speedhunters classic: the OG 55SHズ collection, otherwise known as Go-Go Speedhunters! We’ve also included an OG badge range for those who simply want a straight Speedhunters logo. Now before we get into the merch details, we’ve got even more news arriving next week – a new Speedhunters look. Consider it a Speedhunters: Dark Mode refresh. While we know it’s not going to appeal to everyone initially, there are a few key reasons behind the freshen-up that’s designed to make your user experience easier than ever before. First and foremost, mobile compatibility. For more than a decade, the Speedhunters site has utilized a custom skin within WordPress framework, which has worked brilliantly. But an awful lot has changed over that time, not least the way we now view Speedhunters. Smartphones. We’ve all got a smartphone, and while the old site wasn’t terrible on your phone, it did often feel clunky or take an age to load – something the new design has addressed and (hopefully) rectified. Secondly, we’re making the jump to a proper CMS that will allow us much more control and flexibility when implementing new functions in the future. We’ll be retaining the blog-like, long-form display which we firmly believe is where Speedhunters excels, it’ll just be simplified to make the navigation and management easier. We’ll cover that in more depth at a later date, but onto the real juicy stuff – Speedhunters official merchandise. To kick off the OG 55SHズ collection we’ve bundled tees, hoodies, hats, tote bags, and stickers all with a range of colors, fits and sizes together. For our flagship OG 55SHズ tees, each has been crafted from heavyweight 7.5oz (250GSM) cotton and designed with an oversized fit – keep that in mind when choosing your size. Two colors are available priced at US$44.99 each – limo black and off-white – but if the 55SHズ isn’t your style we’ve still got you covered… Sitting alongside the OG 55SHズ is the OG Badge Collection – a simplified design utilizing the Speedhunters logo in the same fit and quality, just with the addition of navy as a colorway alongside limo black and off-white. What about hoodies? Each design is manufactured from heavyweight 9.7oz (330GSM) fabric with a generous fit, complete with a fleece-lined hood, nickel eyelets, and cotton-braided drawcord. Just like the tees above, you’ve got the beauty of two different options – OG 55SHズ and OG Badge – both offering a range of fits and colors including navy, limo black, and off-white, all priced at US$69.99 each. Show me the stickers! If you’ve been on Etsy, you’d assume Speedhunters stickers have been available all this time, but the only official items you can get are exclusively from the Speedhunters store. Whether it’s for your laptop, office, or car, you can choose between a medium or large sticker set in a range of colors. Guess what, these are also available in OG 55SHズ and OG Badge designs, perfect to match the rest of your purchase… Sold! What else do we need to know? The good news is that all the items listed in the store are priced with shipping included. The bad news? Right now, for this first collection, we’re only able to ship within the US. But before you mash the keyboard in frustration, this is just the first collection of merch dropping, and we’ve got much more planned in the coming weeks and months. We’ll make sure you’re kept up to date across the Speedhunters website and social channels too. One final thing to keep in mind; each of these collections will only be available for a limited time through pre-ordering on the Speedhunters store (unless sold out). Once the drop ends, all products will be shipped out within 3-4 weeks in case you’re wondering where your orders are. This is our first collection in a long time, so we’d love to hear your feedback on it and understand what you guys want to see in follow-up collections. It’s not going to be without its compromises, but it’s a massive step in the right direction and we can’t wait to see what you all think of it. Oh, and when you’ve bagged your merch, grab some shots and tag us on Instagram – @TheSpeedhunters – we’d love to see where it ends up.
