  "text": "The upcoming French flagship model will ride on the STLA Medium architecture, offering 435 miles of range 11 hours ago by Thanos Pappas The DS8 is set to become the brand’s flagship model when it launches later this year. A prototype with an exposed front end was recently captured by our spy photographers. The model is built on the STLA Medium platform and features a dual-motor electric powertrain. Stellantis’ DS Automobiles employees seem to be slipping when it comes to camouflaging their prototypes. Take, for example, the upcoming flagship DS8 model, which was recently spotted with its front end exposed, giving us a sneak peek—perhaps unintentionally—at what’s to come. The DS8 sports an aggressive face, with slim LED headlights and sharply defined DRLs integrated into the front bumper. While the large grille is mostly shrouded, black trim connects it to the lower bumper intakes. Other notable design elements include flush door handles, a charging port on the rear fender, and angular LED taillights that make no effort to blend in. More: DS Marks 10th Anniversary With Slammed SM Tribute Concept According to our spy photographers (who clearly had a field day with this one), the exposed front bumper might have been the result of previous damage. Maybe they ran out of duct tape? Or, more likely, DS just didn’t bother camouflaging the entire thing for these late-stage development tests. After all, with the official debut looming, who cares about keeping a secret anymore? Overall, the production model has been significantly toned down compared to the 2020 DS Aero Sport Lounge Concept. Additionally, the five-spoke wheels on this particular prototype seem undersized for the bodywork, suggesting it could be an entry-level trim. SH Proshots Earlier spy shots have uncovered the interior of the DS8, showcasing a four-spoke steering wheel, a high-tech center console, and premium upholstery finished in blue. DS has promised that the new model will offer “extraordinary technology and refinement,” thanks to Stellantis’ parts bin. The DS8 will adopt a fastback bodystyle with crossover cues, somewhat reminiscent of the Peugeot 408 and Citroen C5 X. However, while those models ride on the EMP2 platform, the DS8 will be built on the newer STLA Medium architecture, powered by a fully electric drivetrain. Stellantis previously confirmed that a 98 kWh battery would deliver a WLTP range of over 435 miles (700 km). More: Electric Peugeot E-408 Is A Stylish French Fastback With A Disappointing 282-Mile Range DS has pledged to only introduce EVs from 2024 on, but we can’t help but wonder if they will rethink their strategy for the DS8, given the current challenging market conditions. After all, the STLA platform is versatile, supporting mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid setups—something we’ve already seen in the Peugeot 3008/5008 and Opel Grandland, which share its underpinnings. The new DS8 is expected to launch in late 2024 or early 2025, replacing the DS9 and joining the DS3, DS4, and DS7 lineup. DS Automobiles has confirmed they’ll show off the SM Tribute concept at the 2024 Paris Auto Show. Could the production-ready DS8 make a surprise appearance alongside it? It’s possible but nothing has been confirmed (yet). SH Proshots",
