The new pack adds a sportier treatment to the exterior and interior of the standard Mini EV, which is already on sale here. Mini will import just 20 units of the all-electric Countryman JCW, and bookings for these can now be made for a token amount of Rs 1.5 lakh. Deliveries are slated to begin on June 10, 2025.  Checkered grille design, blacked-out wheels come courtesy of the JCW Pack Countryman Electric JCW Pack's interior features sports seats, all-black dashboard No changes made to the motor and battery pack Mini Countryman Electric price: variant-wise Mini Countryman Electric price (ex-showroom)Countryman Electric variantsPriceEssentialRs 54.90 lakhClassic PackRs 57.35 lakhFavoured PackRs 59.95 lakhJCW PackRs 62 lakh At an over Rs 60 lakh price point, the Mini Countryman EV JCW Pack rivals the Rs 67.20 lakh Mercedes EQA and the Rs 66 lakh Kia EV6 SUVs. Additionally, there are lower priced Favoured and Classic packs on offer with the Countryman Electric in India as well. Mini Countryman Electric JCW Pack: what's new? Exterior The JCW Pack comes with two exterior paint options: Midnight Black and Legend Grey; the latter also features black sports stripes. The Countryman Electric JCW further stands out with a checkered design (inspired by Mini’s racing legacy) on the closed-off nose, which also extends to the bumper. Even the side skirts, rear spoiler and door sills get the JCW treatment, and the alloy wheels are blacked out. JCW badges with a checkered flag are also pasted on the C-pillar and next to the charging port up front. Interior Interior appointments feature a JCW-specific steering wheel with boost mode, sports seats, black upholstery and red accents for the dashboard. Carried over features from the standard Countryman EV are a 9.4-inch circular OLED touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, Harman Kardon sound system, wireless charger, electrically adjustable front seats, panoramic sunroof, and ambient lighting. On the safety front, it comes with front and side curtain airbags, ABS, TPMS, rear-view camera and a Level 2 ADAS suite. Mini Countryman Electric JCW Pack: performance Familiar 204hp motor, 66.45kWh battery pack on offer The JCW Pack does not make any changes to the Countryman Electric’s 204hp, 250Nm motor or the 66.45kWh battery pack. The system’s output is sent only to the front wheels, and the Countryman EV clocks 0-100kph in 8.6 seconds, maxing out at 170kph. On the WLTP cycle, the Countryman returns a single-charge range of up to 462km. As for charging, a 10-80 percent charge takes 29 minutes with a 130kW DC fast charger, while it takes 6.4 hours to juice up the battery from 0 to 100 percent with an 11kW AC charger.  Also see: Tata Sierra interior spied with three-screen setup Tata Curvv EV, Nexon EV, Tiago EV get up to Rs 1 lakh discount in June",
