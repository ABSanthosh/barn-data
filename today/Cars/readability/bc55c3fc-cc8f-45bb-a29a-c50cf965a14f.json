  "description": "A few weeks ago, we reported that Kinetic Green had filed a design patent for what appeared to be a 21st-century electric reincarnation of the original Kinetic Honda DX scooter. Now this very scooter has been spotted testing, and there are some interesting details to talk about. Kinetic Honda DX to be revived as an EV, launch likely soon Has a boxy styling faithful to the original KiHo scooter Uses a hub-mounted motor and front disc brake New Kinetic electric scooter spotted testing It uses bodywork and wheels that remind one of the original KiHo scooter from the ’90s From these images, it is crystal clear that the design of this upcoming electric scooter will be a boxy one and will bear more than a passing resemblance to the original Kinetic Honda DX. The boxy headlight, as well as the rest of the panels, all point to that fact.  One interesting little detail that can be made out is that this particular test mule has red bodywork that’s peeking out from underneath all that camouflaged stickering. One neat touch is that the seat has red stitching, which leads us to believe that this could be offered on other colour options of the scooter as well.  Coming to the mechanical bits that can be seen, we can make out a hub-mounted motor, a front disc brake, a twin shock absorber setup, a centre stand and what appear to be 12-inch wheels at both ends. The hub-mounted motor suggests that performance is likely to be modest, perhaps somewhere in the iQube/Chetak ballpark.  Considering that this test mule has no rough edges or exposed wiring, we believe that this Kinetic electric scooter is in its final stages of development. It remains to be seen where this EV ends up in the market, but going by what we’ve seen in these images, it is likely to be a practical, family-centric offering. Given that Kinetic Green today doesn’t have as much brand equity in the electric scooter space and that other more established brands have been present for longer, we expect this new scooter to be priced at around Rs 1 lakh (ex-showroom) when it launches, which will likely be in the next couple of months, perhaps around the festive season.  Also See: Hero Vida VX2 electric scooter launched at Rs 59,490",
