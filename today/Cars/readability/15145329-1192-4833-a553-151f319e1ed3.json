  "text": "Facing several periods of falling sales, Tesla is pulling out all the stops to drive interest in its electric vehicles. The automaker is offering deals on every vehicle it sells, including hefty price cuts and other incentives. Every Tesla delivered by September 30 comes with a $7,500 lease incentive, and the automaker is offering a one-month trial of its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver-assist technology. Lessees also get a trial of Tesla’s Premium Connectivity system, with a 30-day trial for the Model 3 and Y, and a one-year trial for the Model S, X, and Cybertruck.Cybertruck buyers also get a free upgrade to 20-inch wheels with all-terrain tires, and people interested in a Model 3 can get a year and a half of free Supercharging if they pay cash. Tesla’s also offering a zero-percent finance deal for the Model 3 and Cybertruck, and the Model Y is available with cut-rate financing. There may be plenty of negative noise about Tesla online, but in the real world, pricing makes a big difference in many people’s willingness and ability to buy a car. The $7,500 federal EV tax credit is going away at the end of September, which could compound Tesla’s problems, so it’s not surprising to see it scrambling. That said, the automaker remains a heavyweight in the American EV market, selling almost half of the electric vehicles here.[Images: Tesla]Become a TTAC insider.
