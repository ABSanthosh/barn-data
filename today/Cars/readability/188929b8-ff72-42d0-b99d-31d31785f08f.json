  "text": "Thinking about leasing a 2025 Acura MDX, find a detailed breakdown of the current national lease offer plus our quick thoughts on the 2025 MDX.This October, Acura is offering a lease special on the 2025 MDX. It is worth evaluating whether this offer provides good value or if exploring other options might be more beneficial.2025 Acura MDX lease offer for OctoberYou can currently lease an Acura MDX from $559 per month. The lease will last for 36 months and require you to put down at least $4,999 at the time of signing.This will obviously vary depending on your credit score and a few other factors. Taxes and fees will also bump both the overall cost and monthly payment up. You’re also responsible for the vehicle’s maintenance, any “wear and tear” that could be deemed excessive, and you’ll be on the hook for $0.20 per mile if your annual mileage exceeds 10,000. If you want to keep your MDX at the end of the three-year lease, expect to pay a further $33,397.50.As things stand, the deal expires on October 31, 2024, and to get things over the line you’ll have to pick a vehicle the dealership already has on the lot.Quick thoughts on 2025 Acura MDXAs with many of its competitors, the 2025 MDX didn’t see a major overhaul. Many of the changes are cosmetic, though the vehicle’s infotainment system did get a much-needed upgrade. As with many Acuras, the powertrain is punchy enough (especially on the S) and the handling is amongst the best in the segment.Unfortunately, there are still many downsides to the MDX. Fuel economy is poor, the “luxury” touches are closer to what you’d find in the “premium” segment, and while it has three rows, any full-sized adult sitting in the back is going to suffer. This particular offer relates to the 2025 MDX SH-AWD with a 10-speed automatic transmission.Rear view of the Acura MDX A-Spec Acura2025 Acura MDX trim optionsWhen you’re picking an MDX, six trims are available. The MDX is the basic trim, priced at $51,200, and that’s followed by the $56,600 “Technology Package.” Both of these entry-level trims come with front-wheel drive at their most basic level, but all-wheel drive can be added for $2,200 bringing the price to $53,400 and $58,800 respectively.All other trims come with AWD as standard. This includes the A-Spec Package priced at $61,800, the Advance Package for $66,300, the A-Spec Advance for $68,300 and the top-end Type S Advance for $75,250.With the exception of the 355-horsepower Type S Advance, all trims share a powertrain and boast similar specs. Acura crams a good level of tech into its most basic trims, but you’ll see slightly better driver’s aids, some cosmetic and material upgrades, and better suspension as you increase the trim level.Competition to considerIn theory, this should be competing with the likes of the Audi Q7, BMW X5, Lexus RX, Volvo XC90 and so on. But it’s really not quite there, both in terms of performance and luxury touches.In reality, something like the Ford Explorer or Dodge Durango is a fairer comparison to what’s offered with this lease. You can get a top-level trim on one of these vehicles for a similar price to a lower-end MDX, and you may be better off doing that.Final thoughtsWhile the amount you’re paying is closer to the pre-covid, pre-semiconductor shortage, low-interest rate good times we had a few years ago--it still seems a lot for what you’re ultimately getting from Acura. There’s a lot of competition in this particular class, and while this offer may make an MDX one of the more affordable options, you may be better off either looking for something else or waiting until interest rates drop and deals get a little more appealing.Unlike some other lease offers, you’re pretty much paying enough to match the full MSRP if you want to keep the vehicle once the lease ends. A best-case scenario will see you shelling out $20,124.00 over the course of the lease, add on the $33,397.50 and you’re only about $1,000 shy of the vehicle’s full price. Add in the fact that this isn’t the best example of a “luxury” mid-sized SUV and this lease deal may be one to miss.",
