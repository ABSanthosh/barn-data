  "text": "Aston Martin Vantage S Debuts With Subtle Tweaks, Sharper PerformanceThe Aston Martin Vantage S returns with subtle upgrades.Aston MartinJul 8, 2025 7:01 PM EDTNew Vantage S Makes Big Deal Out Of Small Changes Aston Martin is expanding the Vantage lineup with a new, even sportier model. Unveiled Tuesday, the Aston Martin Vantage S boasts more power and model-specific throttle and chassis tuning aimed at sharper responses. Slated to make its public debut at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, it’s available to order now in both coupe and convertible form at an undisclosed price, with deliveries starting in the fourth quarter. The new Vantage S follows the DBX S in Aston’s new generation of “S” models. Originating with the DB3S race car in 1953, the nomenclature has been used in the 21st century to denote upgraded versions of Aston road cars, including the 2004 Vanquish S, the 2015 Rapide S, and two previous versions of the Vantage S in 2011 and 2013. 670 HP Delivered More Urgently The latest Vantage S starts with a power boost for the twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8, sourced from Mercedes-AMG. It now makes 670 horsepower, an increase of 14 hp over the standard Vantage. Torque is unchanged at 590 lb-ft, and power is still sent to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transaxle. Aston also made calibration changes to the accelerator pedal weight and response in line with an “S”-specific engine map, plus changes to the launch control. That shaves 0.1 second off the zero to 60 mph time, which is now 3.3 seconds, according to Aston. Top speed remains unchanged at 202 mph. On the chassis side, Aston claims changes to the tuning of the Vantage’s adaptive dampers yield increased front-end feel and response. Rear-spring stiffness was also reduced to improve low-speed ride quality, while the transmission-mount stiffness was reduced by 10% to improve refinement. However, the rear subframe is also hard-mounted to the body to give the driver a more connected feel. “S” Is For “Subtle” Visual changes include two functional hood vents, which play an active role in extracting hot air from the engine compartment, according to Aston. Also functional is a new rear spoiler, which adds 97 pounds of downforce at the car’s top speed, contributing to a 244-pound total. Additional changes to the underbody, including a new air dam and Venturi vanes, make up the rest of that total. The Vantage S also wears model-specific 21-inch wheels, but the best way to identify one will likely be the contingent of “S” badges. Each is hand made from brass, with a red enamel coating and chrome plating to match the main Aston bonnet badge. The interior includes a mix of Alcantara and leather upholstery with carbon fiber trim that’s typical of high-end performance cars, plus more “S” logos. That includes a pair embroidered into the seats with what Aston claims are over 2,500 stitches. The Vantage S’ late-2025 delivery timeline means it should also get the latest Apple CarPlay Ultra software. Updates like this, and the Vantage S model itself, will help keep Aston’s lineup fresh between redesigns. About the AuthorStephen EdelsteinKeep Reading",
