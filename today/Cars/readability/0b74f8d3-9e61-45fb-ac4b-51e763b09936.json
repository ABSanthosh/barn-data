  "text": "They’re back! BaT sellers fiminod and roadscholars1 have returned with the sixth edition of their Gruppe P collection sales (parts I, II, III, IV, and V can be reviewed by clicking on their respective links. This latest installment is focused primarily on late-model cars, apart from a lovely G-body Targa. Five of the six are 911s from the 997 generation forward, and include such low-production, high-performance models as a European-specification 997 Sport Classic edition here on a “show or display” exemption, a 2011 GT3 RS 4.0, and a driver’s license-shredding 991 GT2 RS Weissach. Auctions will begin going live soon, and their links will be listed at the bottom of this post as they get under way. First up is this 1980 911SC Targa in a classic red-over-tan scheme (the red in this instance being Kiln Red Metallic). The car was acquired from the original owner’s family earlier this year, and is said to be unrestored with 44k miles showing on the odometer. It features Fuchs wheels, air conditioning, and a Blaupunkt cassette radio and graphic equalizer. Just 250 “Sport Classic” 911s were built for the European market, and fiminod brought this example to the US in 2013 under the “show or display” exemption. Many late-model special editions have only surface-level differences, but the Sport Classic package elevated the C2S with unique equipment like a double-bubble roof panel, Fuchs-style wheels, a ducktail spoiler, a special shifter and seats, and several hectares of leather. The Sport suspension package, carbon-ceramic brakes, a limited-slip differential, and “Exclusive Powerkit” engine upgrades were all included as well. This 2011 Porsche 911 GT3 RS 4.0 is one of 600 such cars produced for the world, and one of 141 said to reside in the US. The model represents the apotheosis of the 997 platform, at least as far as naturally-aspirated cars are concerned. The RS 4.0 hearkens back to the first 911 RS with lightweight body panels (in this case carbon fiber) that bring the total weight down below 3,000 lb., and its Mezger engine is happy to rev to over 8,000 rpm, where it pumps out a staggering 493 horsepower—123 horsepower per liter. We could go on about its performance and specifications (and many have), but the important thing to note here is that this example, for all its driving potential, has traveled a mere 144 miles over its lifespan. The 997 911 Turbo remained on the outgoing platform for one more year after the next generation was introduced, so was built concurrently with the then-new 991 generation for the 2012 model year. The Turbo S was particularly well-equipped in its base configuration, with pricey items like carbon ceramic brakes, center-lock wheels, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Porsche Stability Management, and Automatic Brake Differential included as standard. This triple black cabriolet was ordered with a full leather interior, heated and ventilated comfort seats, and stainless steel door sill trim. The 2018 911 GT2 RS is a car whose primary mission is velocity, even more so when equipped with the Weissach package like the example on auction. With 700 horsepower on tap, the 991 GT2 RS is capable of 2.7-second 0-60 mph runs, and its top speed of 211 mph is, amazingly, electronically limited. In addition to the Weissach equipment, this GT2 RS features staggered-diameter magnesium center-lock wheels, a front axle lift, an extended-range fuel tank, black leather and red Alcantara over carbon fiber-backed seats, and Bose audio. The exterior is wrapped with paint-protection film, and just 1,100 miles are shown on the odometer. The most recent car in the collection is this 5k-mile 2019 911 GT3 Touring, fully blacked out apart from its red brake calipers outside and red gauge faces and belts inside. Peak output of 500 horsepower is sent to the back wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle, and options include Adaptive Sport Seats, the Sport Chrono Package, Bose audio, a front axle lift, and an extended-range fuel tank. A Sharkwerks exhaust has been installed, and four new Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires were recently mounted. Steve Serio of The Bond Group provides a partial overview of the collection in the video above. A full list of the cars on offer is below. 1980 Porsche 911SC Targa 4k-Mile 2010 Porsche 911 Sport Classic 144-Mile 2011 Porsche 911 GT3 RS 4.0 2012 Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 Touring",
