  "description": "Kia India will bring the Carnival Hi Limousine, based on the recently launched Carnival, to the Auto Expo 2025. The Carnival Hi Limousine has a luxurious seating layout replete with a high-roof setup aimed at chauffeur-driven customers.  Carnival Hi Limousine gets a 21.5-inch roof-mounted TV It has a custom high-roof setup for more headroom It is equipped with a 290hp V6 petrol engine Kia Carnival Hi Limousine takes on the Vellfire overseas The Kia Carnival Hi Limousine 4-seater has been specially designed for extraordinary comfort levels and offers oodles of space and adjustments. It is on sale in markets like South Korea and Singapore, where it rivals the likes of the Toyota Vellfire, which, too, has a luxurious, passenger-focused interior. Like the Vellfire, the decked-out Carnival has two large “premium captain’s chairs” in the second row, each of which gets a high-quality Nappa leather surface with a 3D quilted design. Typical to most limousine seats, these also come with an extended leg support. These seats get individual picnic tables and a range of electric adjustments, which can be controlled by a touchscreen remote display. This display can also adjust the AC, cabin lights and curtains and serve as a remote for the large 21.5-inch LED TV mounted on the roof just behind the front row. It also gets armrests for both seats, with a console housing a wireless charging pad and heated/cooled cup holders. What’s more, the second-row passengers also get a foot massager for themselves. Kia says that it has specifically developed this foot massager in collaboration with Hu-Tech, a healthcare company, to provide a relaxing experience to the passengers. The luxury MPV also has special storage for shoes and a heated or cooled cabinet with individual cup holders for cold or hot drinks for both passengers. In the cargo hold, space has been optimised with a ceiling-mounted hanger and storage boxes under the floor. On the outside, the Carnival Hi Limousine gets additional chrome bits, a unique alloy wheel design and additional side steps for the front and rear passengers. Kia Carnival Hi Limousine powertrain, India launch details Unlike the standard Carnival for India that comes with a diesel engine, the Carnival Hi Limousine 4-seater comes with a 3.5-litre Smartstream V6 petrol engine good for 290hp and 355Nm of torque, mated to an 8-speed automatic. Additionally, Kia has re-tuned the suspension for the Hi Limousine variant in order to ensure better ride quality over the standard Carnival. Sources tell us that the Kia Carnival Hi Limousine will be displayed only to gauge customer interest and that Kia India has not yet finalised plans for its India launch.  Also see: 2024 Kia Carnival video review Kia Syros, EV6 facelift to be showcased at Auto Expo 2025 Kia Syros prices to be announced on February 1",
