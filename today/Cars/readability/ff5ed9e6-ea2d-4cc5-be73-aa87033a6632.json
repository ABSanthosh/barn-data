  "description": "F1 has announced a new 2025 season launch event where all 10 teams will unveil their livery on February 18, marking the start of the championship’s 75th anniversary year. Tickets will be available for fans to attend the event, which will be held at London’s The O2. F1 2025 launch event tickets go on sale on November 15 All 20 drivers will be present F1 2025 season launch tickets, livestream All 10 F1 teams will be unveiling their 2025 season liveries at the event. An official statement shared by F1 says the event will also feature interviews with key figures from the sport – including the drivers and team principals – as well as entertainment segments and special guest presenters. The event will take place on February 18 from 8pm-10pm GMT (1:30am-3:30am IST) and ticket prices range from £58 to £113 (around Rs 6,200-12,000). Tickets go on sale on Friday, November 15. For fans who can’t attend the event in person, there will also be a livestream. Further details on this will be revealed in the coming weeks. “For the first time we will bring together our fans, all 20 superstars of our sport and some very special guests to officially kick off our new season and mark our 75th year of racing,” said Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1. “With 2025 set to be a classic season following all the drama so far for 2024, this is a fantastic opportunity for fans of all ages to experience up-close the incredible entertainment spectacle that is Formula 1.” Will teams show their real cars? It is very unlikely that teams will showcase their final 2025 contenders at the event. 2025 F1 pre-season testing will take place from February 26-28 in Bahrain. Given that most teams will not want to give away any major secrets ahead of this, we can expect the launch event to largely feature show cars simply sporting the new liveries. But this has already been the case for several years now, with majority of the teams opting to share cleverly concealed renders or displaying show cars during their individual launch events. What about traditional F1 launches? This replaces the standard pre-season build-up where teams usually hold their own launch events across several weeks. However, F1 hasn’t confirmed whether this will be a permanent addition. For now, it’s simply been billed as a special event to celebrate the championship’s 75th anniversary.
