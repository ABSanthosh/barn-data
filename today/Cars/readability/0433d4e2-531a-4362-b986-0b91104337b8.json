The crew behind the Chiller motorized BMX developed their first prototype four years ago, while they were still based in Russia. Since then they’ve refined the Chiller to create production-ready electric- and petrol-powered versions, pushed the design further with a springer fork, and relocated themselves, their workshop, and their families to Serbia. It’s been a rocky road for Alex Mazan, Arseniy Chekar, and Vlad Zaki, but they’re too excited about the future to focus on the past. They’ve just wrapped up an electric Chiller for a very special customer—the legendary rapper B-Real, best known as the frontman of Cypress Hill. “We literally grew up on Cypress Hill’s music,” says Arseniy. “We got this sick chance to show our respect by doing what we do best—building custom projects. We took our standard Chiller and turned it into something we think is worthy of our idol.” The Chiller’s drawcard is its Raleigh Chopper-inspired aesthetic. Each bike starts with a hand-welded aluminum frame, based on a templated design that can be configured for either a pit bike engine or an electric motor, and can support either 24- or 26-inch wheels. The handmade nature of the Chiller frame opens it up for myriad custom options, but the crew went the extra mile on this particular build. First, they prepped all of the aluminum tubing as per their normal procedures. Then, they used a chemical etching process to transfer a smorgasbord of Cypress Hill album graphics onto the frame tubes. Only then was the frame welded together, with a clear coat to protect the custom finishes. Machined components like the rear dropouts, and the bracket that holds the pedal-assist motor, were polished to contrast the rough finish on the frame, while the steering tube was adorned with a one-off Cypress Hill-inspired badge. ChillFab’s proprietary springer fork sits up front, offering more compliance than the rigid units that graced earlier Chiller prototypes. The fork integrates with the bike’s CNC-machined stem, which holds a set of traditional high-rise BMX handlebars in place. A small banana seat sits out back, sporting faux leather upholstery over automotive foam on a stainless steel base. ChillFab has been working on a height-adjustable saddle and a sissy bar, but they decided to stick to their tried-and-true ‘standard’ Chiller design this time around, mainly because it’s been tested extensively and works well. Call us loco, but we find the whole arrangement delightfully retro and impossibly charming. “We’re huge fans of lowrider and cruiser BMX shows with extremely polished bikes and insane designs,” Arseniy adds. “We want to create a bike that is a daily runner that can be transformed into a show bike.” Powering B-Real’s Chiller is a Shimano EP6 pedelec motor, tuned to deliver a top speed of 50 km/h [31 mph]. The rear hub is an internally-geared five-speed Shimano unit with a 263-percent gear ratio, and the hydraulic disc brakes are dual-piston items, also from Shimano. The finishing kit on this Chiller includes a set of 26” wheels, fitted with Vee Rubber Speedster tires. Lawless Bicycles in the USA supplied a pair of machined pedals, plus cup holders; “A must-have for cruising around Los Angeles!” You might scoff at the idea of a pedelec BMX, but Arseniy says the guys don’t feel the need “to sugarcoat it.” Although they get requests for their petrol-powered Chillers too, the electric variant is easier to get on the road in most countries, thanks to the laws surrounding bikes of this ilk. Plus, with a curb weight of just 29 kilos [64 lbs] as shown here (they can build them lighter too), it’s a hoot to blast around on. Officially designated “Chiller 420.001,” the bike should be touching down in Los Angeles any day now. But for ChillFab, that’s just the beginning of the next chapter of their story. While European orders have been steadily rolling in, the guys are on the hunt for a distribution partner in the US, and are planning to open pre-orders soon. We wish them nothing but the best. Yes, Chiller is technically a bicycle. But let’s be real—it’s a bicycle we’d happily park in the Bike EXIF garage next to our gas guzzlers, to wheel out for Saturday morning coffee runs.

Plus, with a curb weight of just 29 kilos [64 lbs] as shown here (they can build them lighter too), it’s a hoot to blast around on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-745x497.jpg\" alt=\"Chiller pedal-assist electric BMX with Raleigh Chopper style\" width=\"745\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-745x497.jpg 745w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-420x280.jpg 420w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-570x380.jpg 570w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-135x90.jpg 135w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-258x172.jpg 258w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-275x183.jpg 275w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://kickstart.bikeexif.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/custom-electric-bmx-chiller-2.jpg 1490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\"/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nOfficially designated “Chiller 420.001,” the bike should be touching down in Los Angeles any day now.
