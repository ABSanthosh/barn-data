  "description": "This 1966 Shelby Mustang GT350H was first delivered to City Motors of National City, California, in March 1966, and is believed to have been retained by Hertz until 1977. It was acquired by its first private owner at that time, repainted, and stored for ~12 years, and in 1989 it changed hands before further restoration work was performed. It later served as the model for the Lane Collectibles 1:18-scale model of the car and was featured in the February 2000 issue of Mustang Illustrated, and it was purchased by the selling dealer from the Carroll Collection of Jackson, Michigan, in 2021. Its 289ci HiPo V8 has a cast aluminum high-rise intake manifold and a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and it is linked to a three-speed automatic transmission and a 9\" rear end. The car rides on 14\" Magnum 500 wheels and has front disc brakes, a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood, and a dual exhaust system with an H-pipe and glasspack mufflers, while the cabin features low-back front bucket seats with latch-and-link lap belts as well as a fold-down Sport Deck rear seat, a woodgrain steering wheel, and a push-button AM radio. This GT350H is now offered with owner's manuals, historical ownership documents and license plates, service and refurbishment records, various tags and decals, Shelby American Automobile Club email correspondence, a copy of the Shelby factory invoice, diecast models, a period advertisement, a copy of Mustang Illustrated magazine in which the car appeared, and a Michigan title.",

It was acquired by its first private owner at that time, repainted, and stored for ~12 years, and in 1989 it changed hands before further restoration work was performed. It later served as the model for the Lane Collectibles 1:18-scale model of the car and was featured in the February 2000 issue of Mustang Illustrated, and it was purchased by the selling dealer from the Carroll Collection of Jackson, Michigan, in 2021. Its 289ci HiPo V8 has a cast aluminum high-rise intake manifold and a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and it is linked to a three-speed automatic transmission and a 9″ rear end. The car rides on 14″ Magnum 500 wheels and has front disc brakes, a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood, and a dual exhaust system with an H-pipe and glasspack mufflers, while the cabin features low-back front bucket seats with latch-and-link lap belts as well as a fold-down Sport Deck rear seat, a woodgrain steering wheel, and a push-button AM radio. This GT350H is now offered with owner’s manuals, historical ownership documents and license plates, service and refurbishment records, various tags and decals, Shelby American Automobile Club email correspondence, a copy of the Shelby factory invoice, diecast models, a period advertisement, a copy of Mustang Illustrated magazine in which the car appeared, and a Michigan title. Approximately 1,000 GT350H examples were produced as part of a partnership between Ford and the Hertz rental company. This example left the factory finished in Sapphire Blue (G) with gold over-the-top and GT350 side stripes and was repainted c.1977. The rocker panels and gold stripes were both refinished in 1990. Exterior details include a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood with a center scoop and release pins as well as a bullet-style side mirror, plexiglass rear quarter windows, fiberglass rear-brake-cooling scoops, and chrome bumpers and guards. Close-up photos that show paint chips and touch-ups can be viewed in the gallery. Chrome 14×6″ Magnum 500 wheels wearing Hertz Sports Car Club center-cap decals were mounted with Goodyear Blue Streak tires in 1992, and a matching spare is stowed in the trunk. GT350s were factory-equipped with Kelsey-Hayes front disc brakes as well as larger rear drums than standard Mustangs, and additional Shelby modifications included revised front suspension geometry, quick-steer idler and pitman arms, stiffer springs, a larger front sway bar, and rear traction bars. The upper and lower control arms, front brake pads, and rear brake shoes were replaced in 1990. The cabin features low-back front bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl with textured weave inserts and a color-coordinated dash pad, door panels, and carpeting. Interior details include latch-and-link lap belts, a Sport Deck rear seat, rear lap belts, a Ford-branded AM radio, a heater, and a glovebox that bears a Carroll Shelby signature on the door. The three-spoke woodgrain steering wheel fronts a 140-mph speedometer flanked by auxiliary gauges, and a Cobra-branded 9k-rpm tachometer is center-mounted atop the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 98k miles, while a 2013 bill of sale for the car lists an odometer reading of 98,500 miles. The Shelby-modified 289ci HiPo V8 is equipped with a cast aluminum high-rise intake manifold topped by a Holley four-barrel carburetor and a chrome open-element air cleaner as well as a baffled aluminum oil pan and ribbed aluminum valve covers. Long-tube headers flow into a dual exhaust system equipped with an H-pipe and Blue Streak glasspacks. Advertised output was 306 horsepower and 329 lb-ft of torque when new. The radiator was replaced in 1992. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a C4 three-speed automatic transmission and a 9″ rear end. The car’s Shelby American-assigned serial number is SFM6S1177. Shelby American Automobile Club correspondence indicates that serial number SFM6S1177 aligns with a Shelby GT350 serial number recorded in Shelby American’s factory records. The car is accompanied by owner’s manuals, historical ownership documents and license plates, service and refurbishment records, various tags and decals, Shelby American Automobile Club email correspondence, and a copy of the Shelby factory invoice as well as diecast models, a period advertisement, and a copy of the February 2000 issue Mustang Illustrated magazine in which the car appeared.
