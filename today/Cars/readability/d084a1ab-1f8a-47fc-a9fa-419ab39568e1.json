  "text": "The options are truly remarkable and worthy of deep consideration 2 hours ago by Stephen Rivers Today, automakers have largely replaced names with alphanumeric codes. In the past, car names were carefully chosen to evoke emotion and identity. It’s rare these days to stop and consider the meaning behind a car’s name. That wasn’t always the case. In Europe, the birthplace of the automobile, designers and marketers alike once took pride in crafting names that resonated. Over the years, some truly spectacular names have emerged. So today, we’re asking: what’s the best European car name ever? Here are a few of the many contenders. Read: One Of The Most Expensive Pagani Zondas Is Up For Sale Again The car you see below is an obvious option. The Lancia Stratos is a legend. It changed the game in rally racing, looked absolutely out of this world at the time, and still garners deep admiration and recognition today. It wasn’t just its ground-breaking performance or styling that stood out, though – its name is significant, too. Lancia Stratos Stratos comes from the idea that this car had “fallen from the stratosphere,” according to TheLanciaStory. It seems that Lancia, all those years ago, knew that this car would live in rarefied air for decades to come. Still, it’s far from the only example of this kind of thoughtful naming structure. The Bentley Mulsanne is another excellent example. This super-luxury brand isn’t above trading on its heritage; in fact, it’s one of the things it’s exceptionally good at. No wonder then that it leveraged the name Mulsanne for its 2011 sedan that could reach 184 mph. After all, it’s named for the famous straight at Le Mans where Bentley once dominated competition. Can we really finish this conversation though, without talking about Lamborghini and its Countach? Over the years, the rumors have swirled to create stories that include beautiful women and exclamations of shock and awe. In reality, the story behind the name is far more sedate but no less moving. The late Marcello Gandini, who designed it, famously clarified the origin of the name: The late Marcello Gandini, the car’s designer, once explained it like this: during late-night sessions building prototypes for auto shows, the team would joke around to stay awake. One of their colleagues, a towering Piedmontese-speaking locksmith, would frequently exclaim “Countach,” a regional expression meaning something between “goodness” and “wow.” It wasn’t meant to be serious. It was a joke. But Gandini floated the idea of using it anyway. They mocked up a badge, stuck it on the car, and just like that, a legend was born. Forget all the stories you’ve heard about it meaning something like “Holy S@#t,” or what have you. It means someone, somewhere, was genuinely impressed, and they turned that moment of spontaneous admiration into one of the most iconic model names of all time. Of course, these are just a few highlights. There’s no shortage of worthy names from across Europe’s automotive history. Some evoke speed, others heritage, and a few are just beautifully strange. What’s your pick for the best European car name ever? Let us know in the comments.",
