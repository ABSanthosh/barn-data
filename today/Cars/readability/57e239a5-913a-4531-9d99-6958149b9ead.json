  "text": "This 911 monster started out as a street car, went racing for several years, and what happens next could be up to you December 26, 2024 at 19:47 by Stephen Rivers This 1992 Porsche 911 America Roadster was rebuilt for championship racing in 2007. The car features a 993 gearbox, roll cage, Recaro seat, and Kevlar carbon-fiber upgrades. Now, it’s up for sale and if it ends up on the road or track is up to the next owner. These days, many well-loved Porsche 911s (especially the air-cooled models) command a hefty price tag. That’s because the 911 series has earned its reputation as a sports car that neatly balances performance, everyday usability, and reliability—qualities that make it a true driver’s car you can live with and enjoy. This particular 911 takes things a step further. It’s built to dominate both the road and the track with raw passion and absolutely no creature comforts. That’s right, this racing-bred monster can technically be made street-legal in certain states. Equipped with a modified 3.8-liter flat-six, this 911 started out life as an America Roadster in 1992. Sometime in the late 1990s, the owner transformed it into a race car. Then, in 2007, it was rebuilt and prepared for events such as the PRC Championship, Rennsport Reunion IV, and NASA competitions. Read: You Can Buy The Shelby Cobra Replica From The Original Bad Boys Film The result of those modifications includes a 993 six-speed manual gearbox, a 997 GT3 Cup limited-slip differential, 993 Turbo front brakes, a roll cage, a Recaro carbon-Kevlar racing seat, and a 996 Cup carbon-fiber rear wing. Originally, this car would’ve made around 250 hp (186 kW) and 228 lb-ft (308 Nm) of torque. What it makes today is unclear because it now has a JWE race engine under the hood. What’s not up for debate is how well-suited it is for racing today. It has a multi-point harness, a fire suppression system, a radio, adjustable brake bias, and a fuel cell. On top of that, it has a history of real racing under its belt so it’s clearly capable of walking the talk so to speak. Sure, this isn’t a car you’d want to daily drive—there’s no sound deadening, no mufflers, and a back-breaking race-tuned suspension, among other compromises. In fact, to make it truly street-legal one would likely need to add headlights as those don’t exist anymore. Nevertheless, this is a seriously capable monster that would fit in well at a local track day as well as it would on a rally across the USA. Those interested should check out the auction over at Bring a Trailer. As of this writing, the bid is up to $71,500. That’s not too much for a 964 Porsche 911 with this sort of performance capability and track record. No doubt, the adage “don’t buy another man’s project” is worth considering here but by all accounts, it seems this car is well-loved.  Photos Bring a Trailer",
