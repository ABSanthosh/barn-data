  "description": "JSW MG Motor India has officially revealed key details about its highly anticipated Cyberster electric sportscar. Scheduled for a January 2025 launch, the Cyberster will be available through MG Select, a new sales channel dedicated to the brand’s forthcoming line of \"premium vehicles.\" The India-spec Cyberster to get 510hp, 725Nm AWD setup To be sold as a fully imported unit here Mifa MPV to join Cyberster at Select outlets later MG Cyberster battery, motor specs Confirming our earlier report on the electric vehicle, the MG Cyberster will be powered by a 77kWh battery pack (110mm thickness), paired with two oil-cooled motors on each axle, simulating an AWD setup. This powertrain produces 510hp and 725Nm of peak torque, with a claimed 0-100kph sprint time of 3.2 seconds. MG claims a maximum range of 580km on a single charge (CLTC cycle). For enhanced traction and stability, the MG EV will be equipped with a front double wishbone along with a rear five-link independent suspension. High-speed stability is further helped by a 50:50 front and rear weight distribution. Depending on the response, JSW MG may consider bringing the Cyberster RWD to India in the future. MG Cyberster design The Cyberster draws inspiration from the MG B Roadster of the 1960s, featuring a soft-top, two-seater configuration. Notably, it debuts scissor doors on an EV with dual radar sensors and an anti-pinch mechanism for added safety. According to regulatory filings, the wheels are expected to be between 19 and 20 inches, reinforcing its sporty stance. Its rear haunches and side skirts also maintain a pronounced look. At the back, a connected LED strip spans the width of the car, beneath which sit left- and right-arrow-shaped tail lights and an aggressive split diffuser. MG Select retail channel details Dedicated to NEVs (New Energy Vehicles) – including EVs, PHEVs, and hybrids – the MG Select outlet will initially bring four new products, which will be assembled locally. The Select channel will offer entry-luxury models and will be a standalone facility with workshops. MG plans to launch 12 Select experience centres across India in the first phase and gradually expand in a phased manner, eventually reaching Tier 2 cities. MG Select Chief Growth Officer Gaurav Gupta earlier stated that the channel will be distinct from the existing MG Channel, which will continue as the mainstream brand, with no overlap between the two. “To begin with, we are looking at products that will help us put a stick in the ground in the entry-luxury space. We feel there’s a lot of opportunity to offer something fresh to the customer, and we will have a good mix of product, pricing, and experience,” he added. After the Cybertser, MG plans to bring the Mifa 9 MPV, which will also be showcased at the upcoming Bharat Mobility Expo.
