Having 4,800 miles, the car was optioned with a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring as well as Satin Black-finished 20″ 718 Spyder alloy wheels, a manually retractable black soft top, bi-xenon headlights with PDLS, rear parking sensors, a backup camera, carbon-fiber interior trim, the Light Design Package, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, heated power-adjustable seats, and Porsche Communication Management. This 718 Spyder was acquired by the seller in 2024 and is now offered in Ohio with a build sheet, the owner’s manual, a battery tender, a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the seller’s name. The car is finished in Chalk, and exterior equipment includes a manually retractable black soft top, rear parking sensors, a backup camera, and bi-xenon headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS) as well as power-folding side mirrors, gloss black accents, side air intakes, and dual exhaust outlets. Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, per the seller. Satin Black-finished 20″ 718 Spyder alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Stopping power is provided by ventilated and dimpled rotors with red-finished calipers at each corner. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). The heated power-adjustable seats are trimmed in black leather and Race-Tex and are joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, carpets, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include the Light Design Package, a Bose sound system, Apple CarPlay, automatic climate control, cruise control, Porsche-branded floor mats, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. The heated multifunction steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline, and a TFT LCD screen. A stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 4,800 miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. Located in a sealed compartment forward of the rear trunk, the 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 414 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in January 2025, at which time the windshield washer fluid reservoir cap was replaced. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch automatic transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery. The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect.
