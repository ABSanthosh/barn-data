  "text": "POSTED 12/29/2024 The R27 showed up in the stable courtesy of our good friend and artist Christopher Myott. It’s a DeLorean, an underpowered time machine that couldn’t hit 88 mph if my life depended on it. And though the records may show a top speed of 81 mph, I managed to hit 70 and it was reaching. Given that it’s 54 years old and 250 cc, expecting it to do much more than maintain 55 mph is asking a lot, and it did that without complaint. Ultimately, my experience of the bike is more reverence than critique. What it lacks in power and all-around performance, it makes up for with character and charm, which shone through in unexpected ways. Over time, I began to actually appreciate its overtaxed 18 hp single. It allowed me to focus on riding by completely removing from the equation my temptation to fool around. With nothing to prove, I would get from A to B at the R27’s pace, and because showing off was not an option, I was able to relax and adjust my expectations of not only the bike, but of myself. The R27’s characteristics are quirky, counterintuitive, and oddly reassuring. Though the bike is (and feels) underpowered, it’s not lacking in applied ingenuity and it puts a smile on my face with every dogged crank of the throttle.
