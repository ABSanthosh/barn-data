One victim was told to hand over $15,000 in exchange for their car’s return, the LAPD says. Numerous tips led the LAPD, CHP and other agencies to recover and return 145 vehicles. Dozens of Los Angeles residents have been reunited with their cars after cops busted an alleged illegal towing operation. More than 140 vehicles were recovered after a joint operation between the LAPD, California Highway Patrol and other agencies swooped on the business in Van Nuys. Authorities said they had received numerous tips about the company’s nefarious activities, which involved tricking drivers into letting them tow their cars after minor accidents. In some cases, the truck drivers would get someone to pose as a witness to an accident so they could exchange phone numbers with the driver of the damaged car. The driver would then receive a text saying their insurance company had authorized the dodgy towing outfit to take their car.

In one case, a victim was asked to hand over up to $15,000 just to get their car back, according to investigating officers who had a warrant to search two locations under the control of Legend Auto. In one instance, a driver refused a tow from Legend’s operator at the scene of a minor smash, drove her car home and arranged a tow through her insurance company, but a company driver allegedly took the vehicle from her house. “That was a straight grant theft auto,” the LAPD’s Lt. Laurel Friedlander told reporters at a press conference to announce the bust. Asked for comment by ABC7, a manager at Legend Enterprise claimed the company also feels victimized, but conceded it needed do work harder at vetting its tow truck drivers. The LAPD’s advice to drivers is that if you haven’t called for a tow truck and one turns up and tries to take your vehicle, it’s probably a scam. “Unless a police officer is at the scene and requests the tow truck for you, you can claim which tow operator can tow your vehicle from the scene,” Lt. Joe Dominguez with CHP told ABC7. Lead image Harut V/Yelp",
