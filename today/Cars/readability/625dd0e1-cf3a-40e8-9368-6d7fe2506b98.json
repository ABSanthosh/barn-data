  "description": "Hyundai India is gearing up to launch its first mass-market EV, the new Creta Electric, later this week. This will be the beginning of an EV onslaught as the Korean carmaker has three more EVs lined up for India. Speaking to Autocar India, Hyundai Motor India COO, Tarun Garg, said, “Three more models will come in after the Creta Electric and that will also drive up the volumes.” He, however, did not comment on the timeline or order in which these EVs would arrive. Both born electrics and ICE-derived EVs on the cards Focus will be on the high-volume segments Like the Creta Electric, future EVs will also be locally assembled Garg also did not divulge further details on what exactly these models could be, but he did hint that these will be focused at the more affordable spectrum of the market. “I would not like to say exactly which segment, but we are looking at all the high-volume segments with a lot of interest,” he added. Notably, the upcoming EVs will be locally produced. Hyundai has already localised the battery for the Creta Electric, so the future EVs can take advantage of that. Going forward, the brand even plans to localise cell manufacturing, powertrain and power electronics as well. While Garg refrained from sharing model-specific details, he did hint that the brand is looking at multiple body styles, and not just SUVs. “We are looking at different body types. Some will be dedicated EVs and some will be derived EVs. So, I think it will be a good combination of both.” Upcoming Hyundai EVs: what could they be? We expect one of these models to be based on the Inster EV sold overseas. Internally codenamed the HE1i, this compact EV could be positioned as a rival to the Punch EV. It will be based on the born-electric E-GMP (K) platform, and could arrive in India by the second half of 2026. Overseas, the Inster gets two battery pack options – 42kWh and 49kWh – with WLTP range of up to 355km. The other two EVs are likely to be electric versions of the Venue and the Grand i10 Nios. Both models are due a generation change by 2027, and it is likely that they will feature an electric powertrain as well. With Garg specifying their focus on volume segments, an electric Venue and Grand i10 Nios also fit the bill appropriately. These aside, Hyundai is also expected to introduce a facelift for the Ioniq 5 sometime this year.
