Finished in Onyx Black over beige leather and suede upholstery, the car is powered by a 2.0-liter inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, Koni dampers, 15″ 12-hole alloy wheels, an Alpine head unit, air conditioning, and power windows. Work performed in 2024 has included replacing the water pump, lower radiator hose, and drive belt. This Series 4 Spider is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner at no reserve with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service records, spare parts, and a clean Illinois title in the owner’s name. The Series 4 Spider received an exterior refresh with color-matched bumpers and a revised tail with integrated wrap-around taillights. The Pininfarina-designed bodywork of this example is finished in Onyx Black (817) and features a replacement black soft, body-color side mirror, and a power antenna. A November 1998 entry on the Carfax report lists “moderate damage” with another motor vehicle, while a subsequent entry from May 2012 lists an accident that resulted in damage to the rear of the car. The left front fender, front bumper cover, and hood have been refinished. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below. Silver-finished 15″ 12-hole alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires that the seller recommends replacing. Koni dampers and a chassis stiffener have been added. Power steering and four-wheel disc brakes were fitted as standard equipment on the Series 4 Spider. The bucket seats are upholstered in beige leather and suede as well as a color-coordinated lower dashboard, center console, and door panel inserts. Interior amenities include an Alpine head unit linked to Bose speakers, air conditioning, a rear parcel shelf, a driver-side airbag, and power windows. The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, voltage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 42k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership. The 2.0-liter inline-four features Bosch Motronic electronic fuel injection and was factory rated at 120 horsepower and 117 lb-ft of torque. The oil and coolant were changed and the water pump, lower radiator hose, and drive belt were replaced in September 2024. Power is routed to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The clutch was adjusted in September 2024. The window sticker lists initial delivery to Lochmoor Alfa Romeo in Detroit, Michigan, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $24,505. The Carfax report shows the aforementioned November 1998 and May 2012 damages. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
