  "description": "This 1974 Porsche 914 was acquired by the current owner in 2004 and built into a race car by Zuffenhaus Eurowerks of Monroe, North Carolina shortly thereafter, competing in PCA, SCCA, NASA, and HSR events for several seasons before being put into storage around 2016. Power comes from a twin-plug 3.4L flat-six that was rebuilt in 2023, and it is equipped with a 993 oil pump, 50mm PMO carburetors, an Electromotive ignition system, and custom exhaust headers. A GT-class roll cage has been added to the chassis, which rides on Ground Control adjustable coilovers with an ERP 935 front suspension system, Elephant Racing sway bars, and adjustable front caster and camber plates. The race-prepped cabin houses an ISP aluminum racing seat, a MOMO steering wheel, an AiM MXL digital dashboard, and Coolshirt and fire suppression systems. The engine is linked with a G96-50 six-speed manual transaxle, and additional build highlights include a Rennspeed hood, fender flares, front and rear spoilers, CCW Classic 17” wheels, \"Big Red\" 993 disc brakes, a Fuel Safe fuel cell, Peterson oil tanks, and dual Setrab oil coolers. This 914 race car is now offered on dealer consignment in North Carolina with logbooks, build records, and a bill of sale.",

This 914 race car is now offered on dealer consignment in North Carolina with logbooks, build records, and a bill of sale. The body has been modified with a Rennspeed full-width hood, a front lip spoiler, a decklid spoiler, a perforated tail panel, flared fenders and quarter panels, and composite bumper fascias and rocker panel covers. The car is finished in a green, yellow, and red livery with #48 roundels, and details include exposed hood locks, rubber decklid latches, windshield retainers, and dual side mirrors. Blemishes are noted on the windshield, and paint chips and other imperfections around the car are shown in the image gallery below. CCW Classic 17” wheels have black center sections and are wrapped in 245/40 Hoosier racing slicks. Tubular reinforcements have been added to the chassis, and the car rides on Ground Control adjustable coilovers at all four corners with an ERP 935 front suspension system, Elephant Racing sway bars, 930-specification tie rods, and adjustable front caster and camber plates. The hubs were converted to five-lug units, and the rear swingarms were modified. A “Big Red” 993-specification disc brake conversion kit was installed along with stainless-steel lines and custom cooling ducts. The master cylinder was also upgraded, and a proportioning valve was added. Sound-deadening material was removed from the cabin, which is protected by a GT-class roll cage with door bars and houses an ISP aluminum racing seat with a black cover and a Simpson harness that is valid through December 2026. A Coolshirt system has also been installed along with a fire suppression system, a raised shifter assembly, a four-panel rearview mirror, a removable window net, and a Rennline perforated aluminum floorboard and pedal set. The MOMO Champion steering wheel is mounted to a quick-release hub and sits ahead of an AiM MXL digital dashboard. The car is not equipped with an odometer. The front trunk houses a Fuel Safe fuel cell, an Optima Yellow Top battery, Peterson Fluid Systems oil tanks, and dual Setrab oil coolers fed by air inlets in the front bumper. The 3.4-liter flat-six was rebuilt in 2023 by Dawe’s Motorsports of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and features an Electromotive twin-plug ignition setup, 50mm PMO carburetors, a 993 oil pump, and custom-fabricated straight-pipe exhaust headers. The car has not been raced since the rebuild. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G96-50 six-speed manual transaxle with custom close-ratio gears and custom-fabricated drive axles. Photos taken of the car on track are presented in the gallery along with photos taken at various stages during the build. The car is not legal for road use and carries no title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale. You are not connected to real-time updates. Attempting to connect. Your real-time updates could not be connected.
