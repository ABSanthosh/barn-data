  "text": "When it comes to reasonably priced cars that are truly fun to drive, it seems like they have become harder and harder to find. This is particularly the case when applying a $30,000 limit to your purchase. That's not to say that such examples are extinct, and we've rounded up five such cars that we think fit the above criteria to a T.Keep in mind that these prices are MSRP, which does not include shipping charges. These will typically add around $1,000 to the cost of the vehicle. Dealer markup is another wild card, so shop around at several dealers if you are coming up against it. Then there are customer incentives from the manufacturer, which can be applied against your purchase or lease. Now on to our selections.Mazda MX-5 Miata2025 Mazda Miata Sport - $28,985Since Miata Is Always The Answer, let’s start here. This is the base trim of the Miata, the only one left below $30,000. For that, you get a 2.0-liter inline-four with 181 horsepower mated to a six-speed manual transmission driving the rear wheels. The Sport offers a single no-charge paint color (black, with Soul Red a $595 option), black cloth interior, LED headlights, and 16” metallic black wheels. It’s got everything you need as long as you can fit into it.Toyota GR86Toyota2025 Toyota GR86 - $29,950While the base-trim GR86 comes in at just under $30,000, the same cannot be said for its Toyobaru twin, the Subaru BRZ. The 2025 BRZ has broken the $30,000 barrier with its current price of $31,095, leaving the GR86 as the sole contender here.The GR86 is available in four no-charge exterior colors, with two additional hues for $475 additional. Included is a six-speed manual transmission connected to the rear wheels, while a six-speed automatic with paddle shifters is a $1,100 option. The sole interior choice is black cloth.2025 Honda Civic SiHonda2025 Honda Civic Si - $29,950The Civic Si is the under-$30K performance choice in the Honda lineup, giving you a 1.5-liter, 200-horsepower inline-four that’s both turbocharged and intercooled. The only transmission is a six-speed, close-ratio manual, driving the front wheels through a helical limited-slip differential. Sport suspension, 18” wheels, three driving modes, an LED shift light, sport pedals, and a rear spoiler complete the performance-related additions. You can choose from two standard no-charge paint colors, black or red, with two additional colors at a $455 upcharge. One worthwhile option on the Si may be the high-performance tires for an additional $300.2024 Hyundai Elantra N LineHyundai2025 Hyundai Elantra N Line - $28,725This is Hyundai’s equivalent of the Civic Si in a similarly-sized package. Identified by Hyundai as “the sporty trim with race-inspired style,“ the Hyundai Elantra N Line is powered by a turbocharged 1.6-liter inline-four with 201 horsepower. A seven-speed DCT transfers the power to the front wheels, with a multi-link independent suspension bringing up the rear. A set of 18” alloy wheels, sport seats, aluminum pedals, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, Bose premium audio, and a power sunroof complete the package. There are five exterior colors available at no charge, with Ultimate Red a $470 option.2025 MINI Cooper 2-door ClassicMINI2025 MINI Cooper 2-door Classic - $28,950Our final selection is once again the entry-level model. This is the smallest MINI, renowned over the years for its “go-kart” handling. Power comes from a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with an output of 161 horsepower, driving the front wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (a manual is no longer available). Standard wheels are 17” with all-season tires fitted. No run-flats on this one. Other standard features are one no-charge color, namely red, with three additional colors at a $650 upcharge. Leather-free sport seats, a head-up display, and a remote engine start are also included.Honda Civic Si interiorHondaFinal thoughtsIt’s getting more difficult to find affordable cars that can still put a smile on your face when you get behind the wheel. This is a very diverse group of vehicles that manage to accomplish this but they are by no means the only ones in existence.With one two-seat roadster, one 2+2 sport coupe, two four-door sedans, and the latest incarnation of an iconic car that dates back to 1959, we've tried to prove that fun can come in all shapes and sizes. Drivetrains differ too, as two are powered by their rear wheels, while the other three are driven by their fronts. Whichever you choose, you will find a fun driving experience to make up for the slog of the daily commute.",
