    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld macOS Sequoia is now available. If you want to know what the new features are and whether your Mac will be compatible with Sequoia, read on. The new version of macOS is called Sequoia, named after the Californian National Park and, more specifically, the world’s largest trees. Among the new features coming to Macs in Sequoia are iPhone mirroring, which puts your iPhone screen on your Mac’s display and lets you interact with it via your mouse and keyboard, a new Video conferencing presenter preview, and changes to Safari. In addition, developers will be easily able to port games between iPhone, Mac, and iPad. order iphone 16 The free software update brings a raft of interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about macOS 15 Sequoia including how to download it. We also link to various tutorials about how to use the new features. Some features will only work on Macs with an M-series chip, including several Apple Intelligence features that will offer help with writing, creating images, editing photos, and more. Some people have been running Sequoia for some time thanks to Apple’s beta testing program. In this article, we also discuss the latest versions of both the developer and public beta. macOS Sequoia: Release date Launched on September 16 Apple released macOS Sequoia to the public earlier than usual, alongside iOS 18 on Monday, September 16. iOS 18, watchOS and iPadOS 18 were released at the same time. macOS Sequoia: Latest version The latest version of macOS Sequoia is macOS 15.0.1, which was released on October 3, 2024. It does not contain new features but it does include important bug fixes. Apple is also working on macOS Sequoia 15.1, which includes Apple Intelligence features. This is in beta and not officially released. For information about what is coming in the next version look at the latest version of the Sequoia beta section below. macOS Sequoia: Problems \u0026 bugs Several third-party security tools have reported issues with the new version of the Mac operating system. Read more here: Hold off on updating to macOS Sequoia if you’re using cybersecurity tools. CrowdStrike referenced “changes in the network stack” in an alert sent to its customers and has held off on support for the new OS. ESET indicated that there is a problem is with ESET Cyber Security version 6, an older version that “will be End of Life soon.” Firefox apparently has firewall-related issues with Sequoia. Having problems with Sequoia? Read: How to downgrade macOS Sequoia to Sonoma macOS Sequoia compatibility: Which Macs will be able to run macOS 15? The following Macs get support for macOS 15. iMac from 2019 and later Mac Pro from 2019 and later iMac Pro from 2017 Mac Studio from 2022 and later MacBook Air from 2020 and later Mac mini from 2018 and later MacBook Pro from 2018 and later There are two 13-inch MacBook Air models from 2018 and 2019 running Sonoma that won’t be able to install Sequoia. The compatibility list is becoming a pressing concern for users of Intel Macs. After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it would continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but the last generation of Intel Macs remains on the macOS 15 compatibility list with a few Intel Macs that can run macOS Sequoia. However, only Macs with an M1, M2, or M3-series chip will support the new AI features referred to as “Apple Intelligence.” That includes the following: iMac from 2021 and later Mac Pro from 2023 Mac Studio from 2022 and later MacBook Air from late 2020 and later Mac mini from late 2020 and later MacBook Pro from late 2020 and later If your Mac can’t be updated to Sequoia that doesn’t mean you are completely abandoned by Apple. Apple will provide security updates for some Macs that don’t run macOS 15. Generally, Apple provides software updates for the past two versions of macOS. See: How long does Apple support Macs? On average, Macs get 6.6 years of macOS updates. To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our macOS compatibility list. macOS Sequoia: Should I install Sequoia? As long as your Mac can run it, we recommend updating to Sequoia. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough. We address how macOS Sequoia compares to Sonoma? in a separate article. We also run through 6 reasons why you need to upgrade to macOS Sequoia. However, it’s wise to wait a week or so for the inevitable issues with the early release to be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets out into the wide Mac world. It’s also wise to wait because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. Refer to the problems and bugs section above to see if any of the identified issues might affect you. macOS Sequoia: How to install Installing macOS Sequoia is a breeze. Open System Settings and go to General \u003e Software Update; macOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our macOS updating guide. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. However, if you do encounter problems the following may be useful: How to install macOS Sequoia on your Mac How to get your Mac ready for macOS Sequoia How to fix macOS installation problems macOS Sequoia Beta: Latest version Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and will continue even after the launch of macOS Sequoia to the general public. There is a separate macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta that includes Apple Intelligence features. Below you can find information about the latest beta versions and how to install them. If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so now everyone can get the earliest possible access to the macOS beta without paying a penny. Anyone can sign up for the Public Beta, which should be more stable than the developer beta, but it may still be unstable. By nature, beta software is not as stable as the final version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed. Once registered, when you go to System Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the developer beta select macOS 15 Public Beta, alternatively, if it’s the public beta you want, select macOS 15 Public Beta. We explain How to join Apple’s beta program separately, including details of how to get a free developer account. If you want to install the beta, follow our macOS beta installation guide. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: How to remove macOS beta. The beta testing will continue even after Apple releases macOS Sequoia to the general public as Apple develops new features unavailable at launch. Read How to join Apple’s beta program for more advice. Latest developer beta macOS 15.0 macOS Sequoia 15.1 – developer beta 4 – Latest version September 17, 2024 Apple began the beta program soon after it revealed the details of macOS 15 at WWDC. The developer beta is available for anyone who wants to run it, but it should be noted that betas can be buggy, so we don’t recommend installing it on a primary device. Read: How to install the Mac beta. The second version of the developer beta arrived on June 24. This version brought iPhone Mirroring–the ability to access an iPhone through a Mac. (See the new features section below for more details). The third developer beta arrived on July 10. The macOS Sequoia 15 developer beta 4 was released on July 23. Developer beta 5 was released on August 5. Developer beta 6 was released on August 12. Developer beta 7 on August 20, and developer beta 8 on August 28. The RC final version of the macOS 15 developer beta arrived on September 9. On July 29, Apple started work on the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta and introduced some Apple Intelligence features. This separate beta development was necessary because the initial launch of macOS 15 Sequoia wouldn’t include the AI features. On August 12, Apple released the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 2. Beta 3 of macOS Sequoia 15.1 came on August 28. And the fourth version of macOS Sequoia 15.1 came on September 17. This is a developer beta and will only run on M-series Macs. A report by 9to5Mac states that Apple Intelligence will not run if the 15.1 beta is running on an external drive. It’s not known if this condition will remain when Apple officially releases 15.1. Latest public beta macOS 15 – RC – Latest version September 9, 2024 macOS 15.1 public beta released September 19, 2024 Running alongside the developer beta is the macOS Sequoia 15 public beta. A public beta of macOS 15.1 with Apple Intelligence was released on September 19, 2024. Apple released the macOS Sequoia public beta on July 15, 2024 (in 2023 Apple Apple released the first public beta of macOS 14 on July 12). The second update to the pubic beta came on July 23, 2024, and the third on August 6. The Sequoia public beta 5 was released on August 20, 2024. Apple released the Sequoia public beta 6 on August 28, 2024. The final release candidate arrived on September 9. The first public beta of macOS Sequoia 15.1 was released on September 19, 2024. macOS Sequoia: All the new features Many new features arrived in macOS 14 Sonoma in 2023 including changes to Widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Rumors suggested that there wouldn’t be many new features in macOS 15, with AI-related improvements in iOS 18 taking most of the development focus. However, some AI improvements are coming alongside iPhone mirroring on your Mac display, a new Presenter Preview for video conferencing apps, and Game Porting Toolkit 2 for porting games between Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Apple has announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below. Not all the new features will be available at launch though. Some new features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update. iPhone mirroring iPhone mirroring is a new development of Continuity. Continuity is a feature that has existed on Macs for a number of years that means you can use your Mac together with other devices in a seamless way, making cut and paste, screen sharing and mouse and keyboard sharing possible across devices. With the new ability to mirror an iPhone on a Mac’s display, it will be possible for a Mac to connect to an iPhone and display the iPhone screen on the Mac’s display. This way a user will be able to control their iPhone from their Mac, using the keyboard and mouse to interact. Drag and drop between the Mac and iPhone will also be possible. Users can also mirror the iPhone in a window on the Mac. It will also be possible to launch their iPhone apps via their Mac. Any audio from the iPhone will play through the Mac’s speakers. During any manipulation of the iPhone via the Mac, the iPhone will remain locked so nobody can see what is being done. It will also be possible to use the phone normally while it is connected to the Mac. Users will also be able to receive iPhone notifications on a Mac. They will appear alongside Mac notifications. These can be interacted with even when the iPhone isn’t nearby. Click on a notification and be taken into the app on your iPhone via the Mac’s display. Read: How iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone on your Mac in macOS Sequoia Apple Apple Apple Window Tiling macOS Sequoia will bring a new, neater, way to arrange windows. When a user drags a window to the edge of the screen it will show a place on the desktop that you can slot that window into. This will make it easy to quickly arrange tiles side-by-side so that more apps are in view. There will be new keyboard and menu shortcuts to help users organize tiles even faster. Read: Why you don’t want to ditch your tiling window manager just yet Apple Apple Apple Video conferencing A new presenter preview will show users what they’re about to share before they share it. This feature will work with Zoom and other apps, as well as FaceTime. It will also be possible to apply built-in backgrounds with color gradients and wallpapers. Users will also be able to upload their photos. These Background replacements can be applied in various video calling apps, even mid-call. Apple Apple Apple Safari 18 Safari 18 will include several new features including a new Highlights feature which will help users discover information. The Reader feature is also getting a redesign to minimize distractions when you are reading an article. Joining the more streamlined version of the article that can already be accessed, users will see a summary and a table of contents for longer articles. If there is a video on the page it will be placed front and center and the user will have access to playback controls and picture-in-picture playback will also be possible. Other rumored features included a “Web Eraser,” and a new page controls menu. An update in 2025 is also said to be bringing an AI enhancement to Visual Lookup not just in Safari, but throughout the OS, although we are awaiting confirmation. Read: How to use Distraction Control to remove ads and This new Safari feature lets you snap away annoying ads. Apple Apple Apple New Passwords app Apple is bringing the iCloud Keychain into the 21st century. Apple says the new Passwords app will make it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one place. It will seamlessly syncs between both Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app. Apple Apple Apple Calculator It had been rumored that Apple is working on a new Calculator app. It may be redesigned to resemble the iOS version, with new features including a history tape, revamped conversions, and a resizable window. Apple did reveal that it will be possible to see previous calculations with a history feature. Calendar and Reminders The Calendar app will allow users to manage Reminders. Users will be able to view events and tasks from Reminders in the Calendar. An updated Month View will also be available and both apps will see UI changes. Other new features iCloud – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the new Keep Downloaded option. Installing apps – Apple is removing the double free space requirement to download and install an app. Read: macOS Sequoia makes it easier to install large apps. Security \u0026 Privacy – The beta indicates that macOS Sequoia will require regular permission checks when using certain apps. Gaming improvements In 2023 Apple introduced the Game Porting Toolkit to help developers bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever. Now Game Porting Toolkit 2 adds the most-requested capabilities from game developers. In addition, improvements to Game Mode on the Mac will unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup. Apple proudly shared details of several gaming titles that will be coming to the Mac, including: Assassin’s Creed Shadows Control Ultimate Edition Frostpunk 2 Palworld RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard RESIDENT EVIL 2 RoboCop: Rogue City Sniper Elite 4, Ubisoft Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown World of Warcraft: The War Within (coming later this year). Wuthering Waves Apple noted that they are “leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup” and that they are “taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.” Personalized Spatial Audio will result in significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Apple Intelligence features Several reports over the past few months have indicated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Those reports weren’t wrong. Apple’s new personal intelligence system is coming to Mac, iPhone, and iPad with macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by Macs with an M-series chip though, so Intel Macs will not offer these new features. Read: Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it Writing Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing-focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Apple Apple Apple Images New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground, users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Photos A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo. Siri Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. Next version of macOS Since Apple stopped using the names of jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. Apple has trademarked several other place names, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia. But it’s anyone guess which Californian location macOS 16 will be named after. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to macOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS: macOS 15 Sequoia: September 16, 2024 macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023 macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022 macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021 macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020 macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019 macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018",

If you are wondering if Apple has sales, prepare to be disappointed. Apple rarely discounts its own products–even during its annual Black Friday shopping event, it traditionally elects to give out gift cards rather than actual price reductions. It also offers year-round discounts to students, including a Back To School event where students can get up to $150 in gift cards when purchasing certain Apple products. There’s also the Apple Refurbished Store where you can sometimes grab a bargain. But if you want a new Apple device right now, other stores often offer up Apple discounts worth grabbing.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/678255/best-airpods-apple-headphones-compared.html",
    "description": "Macworld If you’re thinking of buying AirPods any time soon, you’ve got a few options to choose from. Apple currently has four models in the range, but how do they compare in terms of features? In this article, we take a look at which AirPods are the best for your needs, not to mention your bank balance. What types of AirPods are there? Apple sells various types of AirPods. These range from the standard AirPods right up to the over-the-ear AirPods Max and as the models vary quite a bit in terms of construction and features, the range also encompasses a wide span of pricing. In September 2024 Apple announced a hearing aid update for the AirPods Pro 2 and two different versions of the new AirPods 4. More about that update below. Apple’s AirPods lineup as of September 2024: AirPods 4: $129 at Apple U.S./£129 at Apple U.K. AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancelation: $179 at Apple U.S./£179 at Apple U.K. AirPods Pro (2nd Generation, with USB-C): $249 at Apple U.S./£229 at Apple U.K. AirPods Max: $549 at Apple U.S. / £499 at Apple U.K. Those aren’t the only earphones that Apple sells. Apple also sells the $19 Apple EarPods/£19 Apple EarPods (either with Lightning connector, USB-C connector, or 3.5mm plug). Plus, Beats is a subsidiary of Apple, so Beats headphones often include Apple-specific features. If you are happy to consider alternatives to AirPods, take a look at our roundup of the best wireless headphones, best USB-C headphones and best over-ear headphones. There are some AirPods that are no longer sold by Apple, we’ll mention them here because you might still find one of these older models on sale elsewhere, so you should be aware of them: AirPods (1st generation): Launched in December 2016 and discontinued in March 2019. AirPods (2nd generation): The version that came with the MagSafe case is no longer sold. AirPods (3rd Generation) with Lightning or MagSafe charging case, discontinued in September 2024.

You may be thinking of Apple’s AirPods as earbuds, earphones, headphones, or whatever you call them. Perhaps all you want to do with your AirPods is listen to music, but there is so much more that they can do. Here are a few of the benefits of having AirPods: Simple setup: the AirPods are easy to set up to use with all your Apple products. You can instantly pair them with every device linked to your iCloud account just by tapping the AirPods once on your iPhone or iPad. Bluetooth headphones: that’s not to say AirPods can only be used with Apple products. You can connect to PCs, Android phones, game consoles, and TVs via Bluetooth. See: AirPods compatibility: What Do AirPods work with. Automatic switching: You can seamlessly move from listening to audio on your Mac to answering a call on your iPhone. They are intelligent: They sense when they’re in your ears, pause when you take them out and resume when you put them back in. They recognize when you’re speaking and filter out external noise so that your voice is clear. Audio Sharing: You can share an audio stream between two sets of AirPods. Want to listen to your favorite album or Podcast with a friend? Bring their AirPods near the iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV you’re listening to and they will connect. You can listen together and each of you will have independent volume control. Conversation Boost: helps you hear people talking to you. Live Listen: helps you to hear people across the room by working with your iPhone to pick up sound from a distance. Access to Siri: Siri, your AI assistant, can read your messages or alerts as they arrive. You can even get Siri to reply to messages using voice commands. Free Apple Music: if you haven’t previously had a trial you can get 6 months of Apple Music free See How to get Apple Music for free. Hearing aid: The AirPods Pro 2 is getting a software update that will allow it to function like over-the-counter hearing aids. AirPods comparison If you are wondering what the main differences between the various AirPods read on. We also cover elements like design, controls, waterproofing, noise cancelling, sound quality, charging times and battery life, below. First we’ll run though the key differences between the various AirPods sold by Apple, starting with the most expensive model. You can also see the best prices right now. Apple AirPods Max Price When Reviewed: $549 Best Prices Today: $429 at Amazon$459 at B\u0026H$477 at Walmart At more than twice the cost of the AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max are the definition of a considered purchase. Thanks to the size of the ear-cups, Apple is able to put a H1 chip in each one, as opposed to the single chip that appears in all of the other AirPods. Like on the Pros, there are features such as Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode and Spacial Audio, but the Max doesn’t have the custom high-dynamic range amplifier found in the 3rd gen and Pro AirPods, or (more surprisingly) any form of waterproofing. The smart case is also different in that you can’t use it to charge the AirPods Max, but this isn’t as bad as it sounds, as the onboard batteries provide around 20 hours of listening time. Again, thanks to the size of the AirPods Max, controls are handled not by taps but a Digital Crown similar to that found on the Apple Watch, and a dedicated Noise Control button. There are also multiple microphones to aid with noise cancellation, plus updated sensors for better performance. For a comprehensive look at the AirPods Max, read our full review. Read our full Apple AirPods Max review AirPods Pro 2 USB-C Price When Reviewed: $249 Best Prices Today: $157.95 at B\u0026H$249 at Apple$249.99 at Best BuyNot Available at Amazon The AirPods Pro had a significant update in 2022, bringing Find My to the charging case, better battery life, improved noise cancellation and enhanced audio quality, new extra small ear tips and so much more. Then in 2023 Apple switched Lightning on the case for USB-C and added a few new features including a case that charges with USB-C instead of Lightning, the ability to use an iPhone 15 to reverse your AirPods case, better protection against dust, and Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency for Apple Vision Pro. In September 2024, Apple announced that the AirPods Pro 2 will get a firmware update that will add hearing aid features to the earphones. The update should be available before the end of 2024. Learn more about the hearing aid feature. The AirPods Pro are better than ever, but the price is still high. We haven’t reviewed the USB-C model yet, but here is our full review of the 2nd gen AirPods Pro. Read our full AirPods Pro 2 USB-C review Apple AirPods 4 (with ANC) Price When Reviewed: $179 with Active Noice Cancelation Best Prices Today: $179 at Adorama$179 at Amazon$179 at Apple The AirPods have been redesigned with each generation, each one promising a better fit. The AirPods 4, according to Apple, has a design with “a natural and secure fit for more people than ever.” The company said it used an “unparalleled data set” to make “the most comfortable AirPods ever.”  The effectiveness of the AirPods 4’s active noise cancelation is heavily affected by the open design. The AirPods 4 don’t absolutely cancel the noise around you, which might be preferable, depending on your situation. If you’re in conditions where you need to muffle as much as possible, you’ll want to turn to the AirPods 2’s snug ear tips. Like the AirPods Pro 2 case, the $179/£179 AirPods 4 with ANC case has a speaker to play alerts through Find My. It also supports USB-C or wireless charging–it works with the Apple Watch charger as well as Qi chargers. If you use active noise cancelation, it shortens the AirPods 4’s battery life—when fully charged, Apple states a 4-hour listening time with the earbuds and 20 hours of charge with the case. Turn off ANC, and fully charged earbuds can last 5 hours, and the case adds 30 total hours.The AirPods 4 with ANC for $179/£179 are a much better value than the 3rd-gen AirPods with numerous pro-level features. They sound great, the active noise cancelation is extremely useful and works surprisingly well, they fit better than previous AirPods, and the wireless charging and Find My speaker on the case are much-welcomed conveniences. Read our full AirPods 4 with ANC review. Apple AirPods 4 (without ANC) Price When Reviewed: $129 without Active Noise Cancelation Best Prices Today: $119 at Amazon$129 at Adorama$129 at Apple Apple offers the AirPods 4 without Active Noice Cancelation for $129/£129, a $50/£50 lower price than the model with ANC. Apple identifies this product as the AirPods 4. The earbud and case designs are the same as the $179/£179 AirPods 4 with ANC. However, the $129 AirPods 4 does not have the following features: Active Noise Cancelation (as well as Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode) Conversation Awareness Wireless charging case Speaker on the case for Find My alerts Otherwise, they’re the same. The AirPods 4 have an H2 chip like the ANC model as well as the same audio quality, fit, and features. So you’ll have to consider if those features listed above are worth the extra $50. AirPods features: How to choose the best AirPods We’ll now run through all the differences between the various AirPods, looking at the design, controls, waterproofing, noise canceling, sound quality, compatibility, charging times and battery life to help you decide which AirPods will meet your needs. Design All earbud style AirPods are available in white, just like the iPod earbuds that were so iconic. However, if you are willing to spend more on a pair of over-ear Apple headphones then the AirPods Max come in a variety of two-tone colours including Blue, Midnight, Orange, Purple, and Starlight. The AirPods Max are designed to create an acoustic seal around your ear to aid noise cancellation. There’s a Digital Crown on one side for volume control. There was an expectation that the AirPods Pro would have shorter stems when Apple updated them in 2022, but this wasn’t the case. This means that to distinguish between the AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro (2nd generation) you need to look to the earbud. Only the AirPods Pro come with silicone ear tips to create a seal in your ear. There are four sizes: XS, S, M, L included in the box. The extra small size is new with the AirPods Pro 2. The AirPods Pro are the only other AirPods to offer external noise cancellation. Apple Apple Apple You might not be keen on pushing something inside your ear, in which case it’s worth noting that the AirPods Pro 2 offer a vent system for pressure equalisation so that it feels comfortable to wear them. This vent system combined with the silicon ear tips means you may find the AirPods Pro 2 more comfortable to wear than the standard AirPods with their hard plastic tips that sit in your ear. The most obvious difference between the new AirPods 4 and the older AirPods 2 and 3 is the size of the stem. There’s a lot else that is visibly different though, as you can see from the image above. Size is another difference, that may or may not matter to you since it doesn’t really impact comfort or fit. The AirPods 4 are lighter than the AirPods Pro 2, which are 5.3g (0.19oz). The AirPods Max weigh a lot more at 384.8g (13.6oz). Controls One of the benefits of using any kind of AirPods is that you can also tell Siri (the artificial intelligent assistant) to do things for you. However, you don’t have to use Siri to control your music playback (luckily). You can use a combination of taps and swipe depending on which AirPods you have. On AirPods 2nd generation you use a double tap to play, skip or answer the phone. AirPods 3 and 4 use a force sensor. It’s one press for play, pause or answer call, two presses to skip forward, and three presses to skip back. Press and hold to activate Siri. AirPods Pro 2 use touch control with different presses for different features. It’s one press for play, pause or answer call, two presses to skip forward, three presses to skip back. You press and hold to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Adaptive Transparency, swipe up and down to adjust volume, and you Say Hey Siri to trigger the voice assistant. AirPods Max feature a Digital Crown that you turn to control volume, press to play, pause or answer a call, press twice to skip, three times to go back, and press and hold to activate Siri (or say Hey Siri). There’s also a Noise control button to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. There’s a Noise control button to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode on the AIrPods Max. There’s a Noise control button to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode on the AIrPods Max.Apple There’s a Noise control button to switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode on the AIrPods Max.Apple Apple Waterproofing: Are AirPods waterproof? Given that a lot of people like to wear headphones when exercising or walking around outside, so the question “can AirPods get wet” is a fair one. The answer to the question is that the AirPods 4 generation and AirPods Pro 2 are sweat and water resistant (IPX4 rated), according to Apple. Which means you can wear then when exercising, in the shower and in the rain but not in the swimming pool. The AirPods aren’t considered water resistant. Noise cancelling: Are AirPods noise cancelling? The AirPods Max, AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods 4 offer Active Noise Cancellation. Noise cancellation works by using a microphone to detect external sounds and then countering them by playing anti-noise. The AirPods Pro 2 offer better noise cancellation thanks to a new driver and improved acoustic algorithms as well as better microphones and a new speaker grille on top of each earbud to help filter out outside sounds. Apple also offers the AirPods 4 without Active Noise Cancelation. Active Noise Cancellation isn’t the only sound related feature in the AirPods. There is a Transparency mode available on the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max that lets the outside noise in when you need to hear what’s going on around you. You can switch between these two modes by tapping on a location on your AirPods Pro or AirPods Max (indicated by the blue arrows in the image above). There’s a difference between the Transparency Mode on the AirPods Max and the Pro: the AirPods Pro 2 offer Adaptive Transparency, which will minimise the intensity of loud noises like sirens, so you won’t be deafened if an ambulance passes while you are using Transparency Mode. Conversation Boost is a feature that came to the AirPods Pro in an October 2021 software update. The feature can be used to enhance the voice of the person talking beside you, which could be helpful for the hard of hearing. The feature can be turned on in iOS Accessibility settings, here’s How to use Conversation Boost to turn your AirPods Pro into a hearing aid. Another related feature is Live Listen, which can be used in conjunction with an iPhone or iPad to help you listen to someone speaking from across the room or in a noisy place. You can use Live Listen with AirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and also Powerbeats Pro or Beats Fit Pro. Read How to use Live Listen. Sound quality: Which AirPods have the best sound quality? We’ve never had any reason to criticise any AirPods sound quality, although they aren’t necessarily the best sounding headphones you can buy. However, we were glad to find that the AirPods 4 and the AirPOds Pro 2 use the same H2 chip that processes sound, so the audio quality is similar in both, which the differences due mostly to the eartips in the AirPods Pro 2. Another way that AirPods can create personalised sound is via Personalized Spatial Audio , which requires iOS 16 on iPhones with the TrueDepth camera and is compatible with 1st and 2nd generation AirPods Pro, AirPods, and AirPods Max. It can also be used with Beats Fit Pro. A personal profile based on your unique ear shape is set up for you based on a photo of your head and each of your ears in order to create a three-dimensional audio experience when you move your head. Dynamic head tracking can also be beneficial in group FaceTime calls. All AirPods support Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio in Apple Music, but only the 3rd-generation AirPods or either generation of the AirPods Pro support Spatial Audio for video with head tracking. Charging and battery life AirPods Pro 2, AirPods 3 and AirPods 2 in their charging cases AirPods Pro 2, AirPods 3 and AirPods 2 in their charging casesApple AirPods Pro 2, AirPods 3 and AirPods 2 in their charging casesApple Apple Before we get onto battery life, a few words on charging. The $129/£129 AirPods 4 case charges only through USB-C. The $179/£179 AirPods 4 with ANC has USB-C charging but also can charge wirelessly. The charging case for the AirPods Pro 2 includes USB-C and wireless charging. But perhaps even better, you don’t need to find a power adapter to plug the cable into: you can reverse charge the 2023 version by plugging the case into any iPhone 15. You can also charge the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro and the MagSafe-equipped 3rd-gen AirPods wirelessly. Here’s how the battery life of the different AirPods Apple sells compares: AirPods 4: 5 hours listening or 4.5 hours talking, plus 30 hours listening or 20 hours talking from charging case. AirPods 4 with ANC: 4 hours (with ANC on) or 5 hours (with ANC off) listening or 4.5 hours talking, plus 20 hours (with ANC on) 0r 30 hours (with ANC off) listening or 20 hours talking from charging case. AirPods Pro 2: 6 hours listening or 4.5 hours talking, plus the AirPods Pro 2 charging case can add a total of 30 hours of listening or 24 hours talking. AirPods Max: 20 hrs on one charge, but no charging case boost here. These battery life measures are claimed by Apple. It’s worth noting that the AirPods Pro 2 battery life if superior to the 1st generation of that model (previously 4.5 hours and 24 hours listening time). To check the remaining battery life users can hold AirPods next to their iPhone or ask Siri “How’s the battery on my AirPods?”. Should AirPods need charging a notification will appear on the paired iPhone. Prospective buyers will also want to know how quickly the AirPods will charge – or how quickly you can charge them before leaving the house. AirPods 4: 5 minutes in the case provides around 1 hour of battery life. AirPods Pro 2: 5 minutes in the case provides around 1 hour of battery life. AirPods Max: 5 minutes of charge time provides around 1.5 hours of battery life. Again, those are the times quoted by Apple. You won’t always be in a hurry to charge your AirPods of course. Under more usual circumstances the AirPods have a variety of ways in which they can be charged. All but the AirPods 4 without ANC can come with a wireless charging case. There did used to be a version of the AirPods 2 that came with a wireless charging case, but Apple no longer sells that model. Compatibility We mentioned already that AirPods don’t only work with Apple products. They are Bluetooth headphones and as such can connect to any device that supports Bluetooth. In that respect there might be some difference based on the fact that both generation of AIrPods and the AirPods Max support Bluetooth 5.0 while the AirPods Pro 2 support Bluetooth 5.3, which brings improvements such as less interference and improved sound quality. So, if you were wondering if AirPods can connect to your PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox, Android or even Samsung phone, the answer is yes. You just need to connect via Bluetooth. One last thing to note: if you have a really old iPhone and want to use AirPods, only the AirPods 2nd gen work with iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 5s and the iPad mini 3, iPad mini 2 and iPad Air (1st generation) and iPod touch (6th generation). Other AIrPods won’t work with those ageing devices. But we can’t imagine many AIrPod users will have such old Apple devices. We cover various scenarios separately: How to use AirPods with PlayStation or Xbox How to pair AirPods with a Nintendo Switch (without an adapter) How to connect AirPods to Apple TV Which AirPods to buy The AirPods that are right for you will no doubt depend on a variety of factors. Perhaps you want the cheapest option, in which case the 2nd generation AirPods at $129/£129 might look the most attractive. But if you are a real music lover the AirPods might not be enough for you. The AirPods Pro offer noise cancellation, superior sound and many more benefits (including USB-C and reverse charge from the iPhone following the 2023 update). They cost a lot more though, at $249/£229. We think they are worth the extra expense, but you might not. If you have money to spend though then the AirPods Max, which have a very high price in comparison with the rest of the range, at $549/£549, do have a lot of appeal. But those who would appreciate what they offer can look beyond Apple’s offering and probably find something just as good, or better. One other factor influending your decision though is if you find a good deal on a new or old pair of AirPods. Check out the deals below to see if the AirPods you want are discounted – then perhaps you can afford to splash out on the AirPods Pro instead of the AirPods.

    "description": "Macworld The Apple Watch is the best smartwatch on the market for many, offering a high-quality smartwatch experience, but it’s not cheap—starting at $399/£399 for the Apple Watch Series 10. However, you don’t have to pay full price for an Apple Watch. Right now resellers are offering some fantastic deals on the Apple Watch. The deals are likely to get even better as resellers look to clear out stock of older watch models that Apple has stopped selling since introducing the latest models at its September iPhone event. If it doesn’t have to be the latest Apple Watch, you could see some good savings by plumping for the Series 9 or another discontinued model. Another way to save money is to find a deal that bundles an Apple Watch with another device. In this article, we share the best Apple Watch deals you can get right now so you don’t have to pay full price. But if you’re trying to choose the right Apple Watch model for you, take a look at our Best Apple Watch buying guide. Best Apple Watch deals The Apple Watch Series 10 arrived in September 2024.

There, you’ll find huge Apple Watch discounts, sometimes even on the latest models. These Apple Watches have been returned to Apple for various reasons, and then completely revamped for resale.

In the U.S. you can get an Apple Watch Series 9, either generation of Ultra, or the SE for less than full price. You can, for example, save $120 on a refurbished 2nd-gen Apple Watch Ultra.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/201379/best-over-ear-headphones-airpods-max-vs-the-competition.html",
    "description": "Macworld Large over-ear headphones have taken a bit of a backseat in recent years, overshadowed by the success of Apple’s AirPods and other pocket-size earbuds (sometimes referred to as true wireless stereo headphones, or TWS). Larger over-ear headphones do still have some important advantages, though, and they’re starting to make a bit of a comeback. There are a lot of low-cost over-ear headphones that only use Bluetooth to provide wireless audio, but the best over-ear models also tend to provide one or more wired connections via a USB-C interface or a 3.5mm audio connector (or both). Apple has always focused purely on Bluetooth for wireless audio, ignoring the fact that you really need a wired connection to play the high-quality lossless and high-res audio formats that are now available on Apple Music and other streaming services. That is a weakness with the expensive AirPods Max, which rely on Bluetooth alone, and can’t even play the best audio formats provided by Apple’s own streaming service. Apple has plenty of competition in this space, including traditional hi-fi manufacturers, such as Bowers \u0026 Wilkins, who have decades of expertise producing over-ear headphones that can meet the demanding standards of audiophiles and hi-fi buffs. Apple also has competition from within its walls in the shape of Beats, an Apple subsidiary, which has been known to produce superior and less expensive headphones than Apple. On that note, compared to the Beats Studio Pro (at just $349.99/£349.99) the AirPods Max is left looking very overpriced at $499/£499. The AirPods Max had a minor update in September 2024 when Apple added USB-C and refreshed the colors on offer. You can now get the AirPods Max in blue, purple, Midnight, Starlight or orange. The price didn’t change. These larger headphones have other advantages too, most obviously starting with the fact that they can use larger drivers–the mechanism inside the earpiece that produces the sound you listen to–providing a more powerful and detailed sound. Larger earpieces can also provide longer battery life, with many of Apple’s rivals providing far more than the 20-24 hours of the Beats and AirPods range. So here’s our guide to some of the best over-ear headphones currently available for use with your Mac, iPhone or iPad. Here we are concerned with over-ear headphones, also known as on-ear, cans or full-sized headphones. We cover the different styles of headphones separately, see: Best earbuds and Best wired and USB-C headphones. Updated October 2024 to add details about the refreshed AirPods Max. Best Over-Ear Headphones for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV 1. Beats Studio Pro Pros Lightweight Good compatibility with Apple and other devices 3.5mm and USB-C audio input Excellent battery life Clean and balanced audio Cons Headband is a little stiff No ear detection Price When Reviewed: $349.99 Best Prices Today: $179.99 at Target $249.95 at Walmart$349 at Adorama While Apple’s AirPods Max are now more than nearly four years old (albeit with a minor September 2024 update), Apple’s subsidiary, Beats, has launched a set of over-ear headphones that cost less, deliver better sound and offer most of the AirPods features, including one-touch pairing, iCloud pairing (although not instant switching!), Handoff to Apple Watch, hands-free “Hey Siri” support, and Find My support. They even support personalized Spatial Audio and head tracking. You’ll find all the necessary controls built natively into iOS, as you would expect from of a product from an Apple-owned company. There are a few missing Apple features, such as ear detection (which would stop them playing when you took them off) and they don’t feature Apple’s H-series headphone chips (even though some Beats products do). Instead, they offer a proprietary Beats processor which allows them to more easily support Android features. The Beats Studio Pro sound really good. The low end has the clarity and punch of AirPods Max, but the high frequencies are noticeably crisper. The built-in DAC supports hi-res and lossless audio up to 24-bit/48KHz. Adaptive noise canceling quality is excellent, though perhaps not as good as the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro. Noise canceling is not supported in USB-C wired mode. The headphone’s mic can be used as mic input on your Mac or PC (though the quality is not up to the standard of a good dedicated headset). They are less comfortable to wear than the AirPods Max. The ear cushions don’t have the soft velvety feel of AirPods Max, and the headband is much stiffer, but they are lighter (260 grams compared to 384 grams). They fold up to easily fit in a bag and come with a real carrying case. On the left cup, you’ll find integrated controls concealed by the b. These are standard play/pause/advance/back control buttons. You’ll also find a standard headphone jack with audio input fully supported without any dongles or adapters. On the right cup you’ll find the power button which is also used to enter pairing mode, or you can double-click it to change noise canceling modes between Signature, Entertainment and Conversation. There is also a USB-C port for charging that can also be plugged any supported audio source for audio input. We got around 4 hours of playback time from a 10-minute charge. A full charge takes around 2 hours. Beats claims 40 hours of battery life with ANC off and 24 hours with ANC on. That’s about 20 percent better than AirPods Max. Even if they weren’t $200 cheaper, we’d recommend these over the AirPods Max. The lack of ear detection is a bummer, but Beats Studio Pro delivers betters sound, battery life, controls, and compatibility, and they weigh a lot less too.-Jason Cross Read our full Beats Studio Pro review 2. Sonos Ace Pros Comfortable Stylish and premium feel Transfer sound from Sonos soundbars Top-notch noise cancelling and transparency Cons Sonos App upon release is in rough shape Pricey Price When Reviewed: $449 Best Prices Today: $439 at Amazon$449 at Adorama$449 at B\u0026H Sonos has waited almost 20 years to make a pair of headphones, and its first wearable sound product is worthy of the brand. It’s expensive, but delivers excellent quality in an effortless way. Audio quality is roughly on par with AirPods Max—you’ll want to bump up the treble just a touch in the Sonos app’s EQ settings—and noise cancelling holds its own against contemporaries from Bose, Sony, et al. Of note, the transparency mode (Sonos calls it “Aware Mode”) on the Ace is the only one I’ve ever heard that’s as good as Apple’s. Battery life is fantastic, rated at 30 hours with ANC enabled, and you get some nice features like full USB-C audio mode (with support for lossless audio) and a standard 3.5mm plug for analog sources. If you also sometimes use Android products, you’ll be happy to know you give up none of its features, and in fact with some Android headsets (those that use AptX Lossless) you can even do lossless audio over Bluetooth. One downside is that it slightly defies expectations for those who are used to Sonos products; unlike all the Sonos speakers, this is not a Wi-Fi connected product that directly streams audio. Rather, it’s Bluetooth only and streams audio from your phone or other Bluetooth device. If you have a Sonos soundbar, a long-press of the main “content key” will instantly swap the audio from your soundbar to your Ace headphones and back again. This feature only works with the Sonos Arc soundbar now, but others are coming in a software update later in 2024. One word of caution: The Sonos Ace launch was accompanied by a forced update to the Sonos app that the community has not been happy with. It’s prettier and more streamlined, sure, but it’s quite buggy and lacks important features the old app had. Sonos has already pushed out a couple updates to rectify some issues and more are on the way, but you might want to check on the app situation before you buy.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Pros High-grade audio reproduction Bose’s best-ever active noise cancellation All day wearability Immersive Audio Cons While improved, battery life isn’t state of the art Immersive Audio can be gimmicky Price When Reviewed: $429.00 Best Prices Today: $429 at Amazon$429 at B\u0026H$429 at Best Buy The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are pricy, at $429/£449.95 which is more than the $399/£319 Sony WH-1000XM5, but they are still cheaper than the Apple AirPods Max at $499/£499. They do offer excellent sound quality and active noise cancellation, though, which goes a long way to justify the price. They also support aptX streaming, and feature Bose’s CustomTune technology for personalizing the headphones’ audio to your unique ears. There’s also a spatial audio option. Operational controls are minimalist. On the right-hand cup, there are two buttons and a thin thermal volume strip. Sliding a finger up or down the strip adjusts the volume. Tapping and holding the strip activates one of several shortcuts. A second button performs several functions such as play and pause the music, answer or decline a call. A long press lets you cycle through audio listening modes including Quiet, Aware and Immersion. There’s also a Wind Noise Suppression feature. Immersive Audio feature is particularly impressive, but doesn’t suit every music type. On-Head Detection circuitry senses when you put them on and take them off, so there is no need for the power button. The manufacturer says they will auto-shut off after 24 hours of idle time. Run time is quoted as up to 24 hours and they achieve a full charge in less than three hours The headband is soft-touch pleather and the memory foam in the ear cups feels premium grade. It seals and cushions reasonably without being bulky and resided comfortably on my head almost all day long. –Jonathan Takiff 4. Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Px8 Pros Hi-fi sound quality Luxurious design Bluetooth with AAC, aptX USB-C and 3.5mm wired connections Cons Expensive A little heavy (320g) Price When Reviewed: $699.00 Best Prices Today: $499.99 at Amazon$699 at B\u0026H$699 at Best Buy Apple surprised a lot of us when it (finally) added USB-C and 3.5mm wired inputs to the Beats Studio Pro. However, hi-fi specialists Bowers \u0026 Wilkins have been using USB-C to provide lossless and high-res audio with their PX range of headphones since 2017. It’s a little pricey – at $699/£599 it’s even more expensive than the AirPods Max – but the design and sound quality are impeccable. Available in black or tan, the padded headband and earpieces feel absolutely luxurious (although the leather covering might not suit everyone). The adjustable cast-aluminum armatures look very smart and are sturdy enough to cope with life on the road when you’re traveling, and there’s a hard-shell carrying case included as well. The 40mm drivers support Bluetooth with support for both Apple’s AAC and aptX Adaptive for Android users. As mentioned, there’s a USB-C interface for wired connections and lossless audio, and a 3.5mm adaptor is included for good old-fashioned analog audio as well. The sound quality is as good as you’d expect from a company with B\u0026W’s hi-fi heritage. There’s an icy clarity to the steel guitar on You Can’t Trust Violence by Low, and the band’s harmonies are smooth as silk, even as they repeat the chilling chorus of “no, you can’t trust violence…”. There’s a nice bass sound too, bouncing along with a firm, infectious rhythm on Bad Guy by Billie Eilish, and contrasting well with the sharp, precise finger snaps that set the pace and drive the track forward. The noise-cancellation features work very well too, and with 30 hours of battery life when using Bluetooth and noise-cancellation the Px8 is a great option for frequent fliers or commuting on a train. The luxurious design and sound quality of the Px8 are worth every penny, but if you’re on a tight budget then you can still find the previous Px7 S2 model available online with a recent price cut to £299, which makes it a real bargain. –Cliff Joseph Read our full Bowers \u0026 Wilkins Px8 review 5. Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Pros Competitive price Impressive battery life Supports AAC, aptX Adaptive Good carrying case and accessories Cons  2.5mm line-in connector  Some users may require a USB-C adaptor Price When Reviewed: $379.95 Best Prices Today: $249.95 at Amazon$299.95 at Adorama$379.95 at B\u0026H The first set of headphones that I ever bought in my student days was made by Sennheiser, but the company isn’t trading on nostalgia with its Momentum 4 Wireless, which provides excellent sound quality and features at a competitive price. This fourth-generation Momentum is a bit more compact and streamlined than its predecessors, with the weight now reduced to just 293g in order to ensure that it’s light and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Even so, Sennheiser has still managed to squeeze an impressive range of features into the headphones, starting with 42mm drivers that are larger than those used by most of its rivals. These also provide an impressive frequency response of 6Hz – 22KHz, which again beats most rival headphones in this price range. Unsurprisingly, the Momentum 4 provides excellent sound quality. It digs deep and delivers a taut, menacing bass pulse on You Should See Me In A Crown by Billie Eilish. The higher frequencies work well too, capturing Billie’s whispered vocals with great clarity, and picking out the edgy ticking of percussion that gives the song its manic energy. The digital features are right up to date as well, with Bluetooth 5.2, and support for both AAC for Apple devices and aptX Adaptive for Android. The USB-C port on the right earpiece can be used for charging, but also supports USB audio for wired connections, and there’s a 2.5mm analog line-in connector too (with cable provided). However, the USB cable provided by Sennheiser is USB-A-to-USB-C, so you’ll need to provide your own USB-C adaptor for Macs and iPads that only have USB-C. The noise-cancellation features work very well, and Sennheiser’s Smart Control app lets you adjust the level of noise-cancellation manually, by using a slider control, or you can just select the ‘adaptive’ option which allows the Momentum to monitor background noise and adjust the noise-cancellation automatically. But, even with all those features, the really outstanding feature of the Momentum 4 Wireless is its battery life – lasting for around 60 hours even when using Bluetooth and noise-cancellation together. There’s a good set of accessories too, with a hard-shell carrying case and airline adaptor provided for when you’re traveling. And, with a competitive $379.95/£309.99 price, the Momentum 4 Wireless even manages to undercut the price of the new Beats Studio Pro as well.-Cliff Joseph 6. Beats Solo 4 Pros Excellent Apple \u0026 Android support Great battery life USB-C and 3.5mm audio support Cons No ANC Design is dated No on-ear detection Price When Reviewed: $199.99 Best Prices Today: $129.99 at Target $199 at Amazon$199.95 at Adorama It’s been a while since Apple-subsidiary Beats updated its more affordable on-ear Solo headphones. More than seven years, to be exact. As you would expect, a lot has changed. The Apple W1 chip has been replaced with a proprietary technology platform that supports features in both Apple and Android devices. Apple users get personalized spatial audio with head tracking and hands-free “Hey Siri” support in addition to all the older stuff (one-touch pairing, iCloud pairing, and Find My support). For non-Apple users there’s support for Google Fast Pair, cloud pairing with your Google account, Find My Device and multi-point pairing for seamless audio switching. Sound quality is improved compared to the previous generation, as it should be. There is support for USB-C audio output and input, and it is possible to charge and play USB-C audio at the same time. Over USB-C or 3.5mm you can listen to lossless audio (unfortunately the sound reproduction of these headphones is not good enough to notice). Sound is going to be limited by the fact that these are on-ear headphones, lacking the larger diaphragms of over-the-ear models or the tight in-ear fit of earbuds. There’s a power button on the bottom of the right earpiece. You need to use this because there is no on-ear detection to automate things. The left earpiece has a big button for play/pause/forward/reverse and to trigger the voice assistant. Pressing above or below that button changes the volume. Beats claims 50 hours of battery life, likely a result of the lack of active noise cancellation, which is probably the biggest strain on battery life. The lack of ANC, which is expected on all but the cheapest earbuds and headphones, could be seen as a disadvantage. The earpads are soft, but the spring tension makes the pressure a little uncomfortable after long listening periods when I wear my glasses. This is a common problem with on-ear headphones and a reason why over-the-ear cans may be more comfortable. The new models replace the old micro-USB plug with USB-C. – Jason Cross Read our full Beats Solo 4 review 7. Master \u0026 Dynamic MW75 Price When Reviewed: $599 Best Prices Today: $599 at Master \u0026 Dynamic Master \u0026 Dynamic is a relatively young company, having been founded in New York barely a decade ago, but it quickly developed a reputation for the impressive craftsmanship and sound quality of headphones such as the MW75. Priced at $599/£549, and available in a variety of colors, the MW75 oozes quality, constructed out of lightweight aluminum and tempered glass, and with a padded headband and earpieces wrapped in soft leather (although, of course, the choice of leather may not be to everyone’s taste). The earpieces are relatively small for an ‘over-ear’ headphone, though, and some people might find the fit a bit snug. The little control buttons on the earpieces are also rather small as well. It’s got a classy design on the inside too, with 40mm drivers that are constructed out of Beryllium – a very rigid material used in many high-end hi-fi systems in order to reduce vibration and distortion that might affect the sound quality. The MW75 supports Bluetooth with both AAC for Apple devices and aptX Adaptive for Android, and there’s a USB-C port for wired connections with support for lossless and high-res audio formats up to 24-bit/96KHz. There’s also a USB-A adaptor included for older computers, a 3.5mm adaptor for analog input, and a 6.3mm adaptor for use with high-end hi-fi equipment. Travelers will also appreciate the smart, fabric-covered hard-shell carrying case and airline adaptor, as well as healthy battery life that lasts for 28 hours when using Bluetooth and noise-cancellation together (or 32 hours without noise-cancellation). The noise-cancellation features are very effective and, like most headphones these days, the MW75 includes an ambient mode that lets in some of the background noise when required. However, there’s also an additional ‘voice’ mode that helps to pick out people’s voices if you’re in an office or perhaps waiting for a flight announcement in an airport. But, as always, the sound quality is key, and the MW75 provides excellent clarity and detail right across the spectrum. It provides a deep, ominous rumble for the electronic bass on Max Richter’s Shadow Journal, but it doesn’t allow the bass to overwhelm the piercing clarity of the violin, or the gentle ambient sound-cloud of electronic loops that swirl lightly through the air.-Cliff Joseph 8. Yamaha YH-E700B Pros Strong sound quality Bluetooth with AAC and aptX Adaptive 3.5mm audio connector Good app for customizing sound Cons No USB audio A little heavy (335g) Price When Reviewed: $350 Best Prices Today: $291.72 at Amazon$349.95 at B\u0026H$350 at Yamaha Yamaha has decades of experience producing musical instruments and audio equipment for professional musicians, and it brings that audio expertise to its YH-E700B headphone. Yamaha gets all the basics right, with large 40mm drivers that are designed to reduce distortion and provide an impressive 8Hz – 20KHz frequency response. The YH-E700B uses Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless audio, with support for both AAC for Apple devices and the latest aptX Adaptive for our Android-toting friends. There’s also a 3.5mm connector to provide a wired connection, although it’s disappointing that the USB-C connector on the headphone is only used for charging, and doesn’t provide USB audio input too. And, since the YH-E700B is an update for Yamaha’s older YH-E700A headphone, it also provides improved noise-cancellation features – which are very effective – and an ambient mode that lets you listen out for background sounds when you need to (but watch out, as the original YH-E700A is still on sale online, so make sure you buy the correct model). The internal mics used for noise-cancellation also work with Yamaha’s Listening Optimiser technology to scan the inside of your ear canal to create a personalized sound ‘profile’. And, if you want to fine-tune the sound even further, then Yamaha’s Headphone app includes a five-band equalizer with a variety of presets and the ability to create two custom presets as well. That set of features ensures that the YH-E700B provides excellent sound quality. The headphone’s 8Hz low-end digs really deep for the slinky bass guitar riff on Leonard Cohen’s You Want It Darker, and Cohen’s own voice has a terrifically deep and world-weary tone. But the YH-E700B handles higher frequencies well too, with a crisp, sharp stab on the percussion that sets the pace, and a smooth velvet tone on the choir that joins in on the chorus. And, with an impressive battery life of 30 hours when using noise-cancellation – or 32 hours if you switch it off – you can enjoy that high-quality music even on the longest journeys.-Cliff Joseph 9. Logitech Zone Vibe Pros Affordable Bluetooth headset Adjustable boom mic with mute Supports AAC for Apple devices Cons No noise-cancellation for music No spatial audio No wired inputs Price When Reviewed: $109.99 Best Prices Today: $79.99 at Amazon$79.99 at Best Buy$99.99 at B\u0026H Most headphones just focus on the music side of things, with features such as spatial audio or noise-cancellation to enhance the listening experience, but Logitech takes a different approach with its Zone Vibe range of headphones. It’s more affordable than many of its rivals and focuses mainly on office use, for people who may work in call centers or customer support, or perhaps need a headset for video calls when working from home. There are currently two versions of the Zone Vibe available from Logitech, with the Vibe 100 being a basic Bluetooth headset that costs $99.99/£109.99. There’s also the Vibe 125, priced at $129.99/£129.99, which uses the same headset but also includes a USB wireless adaptor for use in busy offices that may have a lot of Bluetooth devices that could potentially cause interference and affect call quality (there’s a third model as well, although this is designed for large corporate users and is only available from specialist business suppliers). The headset weighs just 185g, which is very light for a large over-ear headset such as this, as it’s designed for people who may have to wear it all day long while they’re at work. It also has a boom mic for voice calls, which can be folded up out of the way in order to quickly mute the mic as well. There are no fancy audio features – there’s a noise-canceling filter on the microphone to keep your voice clear for calls, but the earpieces don’t provide active noise-cancellation (ANC) for listening to music. However, the headset supports Apple’s AAC codec for Bluetooth audio and provides good sound quality for both calls and music. It delivers a clear, detailed sound for the dense production on Kate Bush’s The Big Sky, and manages to balance the song’s huge avalanche of drums and percussion very well, without overlooking more delicate details such as the gentle tambourine that shimmers away in the background. Battery life is good too, with 20 hours of listening time, or 18 hours of talk time for voice calls. And, paying good attention to detail, Logitech’s Tune app is available for Macs and Windows, as well as Android and iOS mobile devices, so you can easily get the Zone Vibe set up when you’re preparing to take voice or video calls at work.-Cliff Joseph 10. Austrian Audio Hi-X25BT Price When Reviewed: $179 Best Prices Today: $179 at AmazonNot Available at Adorama Austrian Audio makes high-end headphones and microphones for musicians and audiophiles, and they also make more affordable headphones, such as the Hi-X25BT, which provides impressive sound quality for a very affordable $179/£135. As the name suggests, the Hi-X25BT does include Bluetooth to provide a wireless option when required, with an impressive 30 hours of battery life in Bluetooth mode. It’s not at its best with Bluetooth, though, as it doesn’t support either Apple’s AAC or AptX for Android, relying on the more basic SBC codec for wireless audio.  The emphasis, therefore, is more on using the Hi-X25BT as a set of wired headphones via its USB-C connector. Austrian includes two cables with the headphones, with a USB-C-to-3.5mm connector that provides standard analog audio, or a straightforward USB-C cable that provides digital audio from an iPad, Mac or other devices that have USB-C. There’s also a USB-A adaptor included too, and I had no trouble using the Hi-X25BT with both USB-A and 3.5mm connections on my aging office iMac. I also found a Lightning audio adaptor from Belkin in my desk draw, which allowed me to use the Hi-X25BT with a Lightning connection on my iPhone as well – although, of course, this isn’t included with the headphones, so you’d need to provide your own adaptor for an iPhone. And, as you’d expect from a company with Austrian’s Hi-Fi background, the sound quality is great, thanks to 40mm drivers with impressive 12Hz – 24KHz frequency response. The cymbal crash that starts Blondie’s Rapture rings out crisp and clear, with a loose relaxed feel on the jangling rhythm guitar. The song’s bouncing bass line works a treat too, and never gets lost in the mix as can sometimes happen with less precise headphones.–Cliff Joseph 11. Apple AirPods Max (2024) Price When Reviewed: $549 Best Prices Today: $449.99 at Walmart$537.99 at Amazon$545 at B\u0026H The AirPods Max are quite comfortable, despite their heavy weight of 384 grams. They look good, thanks to their smooth matte finish on the aluminum closed-back earpieces, the stainless steel rods in the band, the fine mesh of the ear pads and canopy headband. The headband and soft, deep, breathable ear pads are comfortable enough to wear that the weight isn’t too much of a bother (although if you run with them on you’ll feel the bulk). The controls are simple, intuitive, and unobtrusive. There’s a digital crown like that on the Apple Watch along and a single button on top of the right earpiece. The crown controls volume and playback (skip forwards and backward, press and hold for Siri, etc). The button toggles between noise-canceling and transparency mode and turns noise-canceling on. Audio reproduction matches other high-end premium wireless Bluetooth headphones. Apple has tuned the AirPods Max to boost bass and mid-high frequencies a bit, which most listeners will probably find quite pleasing. The bass has kick when it’s called for, and it’s clean with no distortion. The active noise canceling excels at clearing away irregular sounds like traffic, general office disturbances, or background talking. Apple’s transparency mode, which allows you to have a conversation while still listening to the music, sounds clear, natural, and normal. Since the September 2024 update, the AirPods Max charge with USB-C, but prior to that used the Lightning connector. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack. To listen to lossless audio, or if you’re editing video and want to eliminate the latency of Bluetooth, you can at least now plug them in via USB-C. If you have an older iPhone then you may still be able to buy the older Lightning-equipped version. We aren’t keen on the Smart Case that the AirPods Max ship with. It’s a case that hardly covers the headphones and doesn’t do anything to protect them. The case does evoke a low-power mode to save battery, but that’s about it. Apple promises a battery life of 20 hours of listening time with noise canceling enabled, which isn’t quite as good as the competition. Charging is fast: just 15 minutes on a basic 5-watt power adapter took us from 20 to 44 percent But, the biggest problem is the price. At $549/£499 it’s difficult to recommend AirPods Max when the competition costs $200/£200 less. At least the price has come down in the U.K. in recent years. You do get what you pay for though: build quality is unmatched and there are some clever design flourishes. But there are all the compromises we’ve mentioned above. The main reason to get AirPods over other headphones is their seamless integration with your Apple ecosystem. They pair just by holding them near your iPhone, switch easily to your Mac or iPad, and you can change settings and get firmware updates within Settings instead of requiring a separate app. One of the coolest features of the AirPods Max (and AirPods Pro) is Spatial Audio, whereby Dolby surround is massaged into a sort of faux-3D sound stage. Initially only available on the iPhone and iPad, Spacial Audio now works on Apple TV and (Apple silicon) Macs too. See Best AirPods deals.–Jason Cross Buying advice Full-size headphones fall into two categories: closed and open. Closed models block out some degree of external noise (and also keep your music from disturbing others), while open models, which some people prefer sonically, let more noise in and out. Note that to reach their potential, many full-size models (open or closed) require more juice than others. For the most part, the main differences between models relate to comfort and sound quality, but not all full-sized headphones are equal and there are some other features that may interest you. To help you find the perfect set of over-ear headphones, here’s what to look (and listen) for. Noise-Canceling: If you’re not a fan of in-ear-canal ‘phones, but you want something that can filter out external noise such as airplane engines, train rumblings, or the hum of a crowd or noisy office, consider investing in a good set of noise-canceling headphones. These headphones sample outside sound and then pipe in an inverse audio signal to “cancel out” a good deal of monotonous noise. (For more on the technology and its limitations, see my review of noise-canceling models from a while back.) Although they don’t usually sound as good as comparably priced in-ear-canal headphones, noise-canceling models are easier to put on and take off, and they let you hear what’s going on around you. Noise-canceling headphones are available in canalbud, lightweight, and full-size models, but full-size models tend to provide the best noise isolation and audio quality. Wireless/Bluetooth: If you think being tethered to your Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod is a drag—or, for the gym rats, an equipment-snagging hazard—consider going wireless. You can stream audio to stereo Bluetooth headphones from Macs; iPad; and iPhones. Most Bluetooth headphones also double as headsets, letting you seamlessly switch between music and voice features. Specs and sound quality: As I noted in our speakers buying guide, you should generally ignore manufacturers’ specifications—especially frequency-response numbers. There’s no standard testing methodology for headphone frequency response, and many vendors exaggerate their specs for marketing reasons. Even if specs were accurate, they wouldn’t tell you much about how a particular set of headphones actually sounds. Instead of reading specs, use your ears. (If you can’t audition a product in person, read reviews from a source you trust.) As with speakers, a quality set of headphones reproduces audio with good balance between the treble (upper), midrange, and bass (lower) frequencies, producing full, rich sound while preserving detail. However, because of their especially small drivers (speakers), headphones present a unique challenge when it comes to bass response: Unlike huge speaker woofers that you can not only hear, but feel, the drivers in most headphones can’t reproduce the visceral impact of low bass—you may be able to hear the lowest frequencies, but you probably won’t be able to feel them. We point out this bass issue because some vendors address it by emphasizing certain bass and upper-bass frequencies to give their headphones more “kick.” This helps the headphones stand out from other headphones in the store, and some people—especially those who use their headphones when exercising or for beat matching—really want that visceral impact. But such headphones often become fatiguing to listen to over time. If you’re interested in accurate audio reproduction, be careful not to be wowed by emphasized bass. (The same goes for exaggerated treble detail.) The best approach is to audition a set of headphones for several hours—or, even better, several days—with a variety of music. If the headphones still sound great at the end, there’s a good chance they’ll satisfy you over the long run. Headset functionality and inline control modules: Many current headphone models include, right on the cable, an inline module with a microphone and one or more remote-control buttons. At the minimum, the remote features a single multi-function button for controlling media playback; making, taking, and ending phone calls; and taking advantage of iOS’s Siri and Voice Control features. You may also find dedicated volume-up and -down buttons, as well. The module’s microphone can be used to talk on the phone, make voice recordings, and give Siri and Voice Control commands. Fit/comfort: Unlike most consumer-electronics devices, you actually wear headphones. So how well a set of over-ear headphones fits your head plays a significant role in your long-term satisfaction (or lack thereof). We include a few comfort-related tips below when describing the different headphones, but reading about a particular style is no substitute for actually giving a product a test drive (or a test run, as the case may be).",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s AirPods wireless headphones offer an iconic look, exceptional convenience, and strong audio quality. They come with a premium price tag, however, so it’s important to shop around for a good deal… or find a bunch of tech experts who’ll do this for you. That’s where we come in. In this article, we round up the best AirPods discounts and deals to help you save money. We’ve got the best prices on the 4th-gen AirPods, the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro with USB-C, and the premium AirPods Max over-ear headphones. Here are quick links to the best deals; you’ll find more detailed advice and price comparisons for each model further down. U.S. Amazon, AirPods (2nd gen): $89 ($40 off, but it’s since been discontinued) Amazon, AirPods Pro (2nd gen, USB-C): $190 ($59 off, but now discontinued) Amazon, AirPods Max: $459 ($90 off) U.K. Amazon, AirPods (2nd gen): £109 (£20 off, RRP was £129, but now discontinued) Amazon, AirPods (3rd gen, MagSafe): £159 (£20 off, RRP was £179, but now discontinued) Amazon, AirPods (3rd gen, Lightning): £149 (£20 off, RRP was £169, but now discontinued) eBuyer, AirPods Max: £494.97 (£4.03 off, RRP £499) You can check the automated price comparison tables below to see if any retailers have dropped their prices since we last updated this article. How much do AirPods cost? Some changes were announced at Apple’s September 2024 event, so make sure you’re up to date with the latest prices: AirPods Max (2024): $549 / £499 (price dropped from £549 to £499 in September 2023) AirPods Pro with USB-C (2nd gen, 2023): $249 / £229 AirPods 4: $129 / £129 AirPods 4 (with ANC): $179 / £179 Discontinued: 3rd-gen AirPods with Lightning (2021): was $169 / £169 3rd-gen AirPods with MagSafe (2021): was $179 / £179 2nd-gen AirPods (2019): was $129 / £129 You should never pay more than the price above: we’ve seen unscrupulous retailers claim the MSRP/RRP is higher and work out ‘savings’ based on that. Remember to take delivery and postage fees into account when evaluating deals; we include it in our list of prices but most retailers won’t add it until you’re at the checkout. And watch out for deals that seem too good to be true, but turn out to have no stock. We see this a lot. Good AirPods deals are rare and tend not to last long. If you see one (and you’re sure the supplier is legit: look it up on TrustPilot if you’ve not bought from there before), grab it. Best new AirPods deals Apple sells two sets of basic (non-Pro) AirPods, both introduced at the 2024 Glowtime event: the 4th-gen model with active noise cancellation, and the 4th-gen model without. Best Buy is worth a look for some worthwhile savings in the U.S., while U.K. customers can save a little money across the range. The 2nd- and 3rd-gen AirPods were discontinued at the same event and may be available for a discount at retailers other than Apple. You can buy the 4th-gen AirPods directly from Apple, but you’ll find the best prices elsewhere in the automated tables below. AirPods (4th gen, 2024, with ANC) deals These replace the AirPods (3rd generation) and have a redesigned, smaller USB-C case that works with wireless charging and now has Find My functionality, with a built-in speaker for locating the device. They feature active noise cancellation, previously found only on the AirPods Pro and Max, and sport Apple’s H2 chip, which was introduced in the 2022 AirPods Pro and improves audio quality.

They feature most of the features of the higher-priced model with the main exception of Active Noise Cancelation, Transparency Mode, and Adaptive Audio. MSRP: $129/£129 Retailer Price $119 View Deal $129 View Deal $129 View Deal $129 View Deal $129.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Best AirPods Pro deals The 2nd-gen version of the AirPods Pro was released in September 2022. Rather than introduce the third generation in 2023, Apple instead tweaked them to support USB-C for charging (including charging via the iPhone 15) The Lightning models have now been discontinued, but will be available from other retailers for a while; make sure you’re getting the exact model you want. AirPods Pro (2nd gen, 2023, USB-C) deals This is the 2023 version with USB-C charging. You can also use an iPhone 15 to charge the case. MSRP: $249 / £229 New Refurbished Retailer Price $157.95 View Deal $249 View Deal $249.99 View Deal $274.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Apple AirPods Pro 2nd gen (2023) – MagSafe (USB-C) Charging case $165 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket Best AirPods Max (2024, USB-C) deals The AirPods Max are available to buy directly from Apple for $549 / £499 (they were £549 in the U.K. before September 2023). The AirPods Max haven’t exactly been updated for 2024, beyond a new set of colors and USB-C instead of Lightning. These are still effectively the same as the 2020 models. It may still be possible to buy old models in the original colors for some time so we have included the best prices for the older model in the discontinued section of this article. Find the latest prices in our automated table embedded below.

Other ways to save: AirPods Bundle deals The best way to get a good price on AirPods may be to bundle them with a phone, although this is mainly an option in the U.K. Phone network Three offers a variety of bundles that include the AirPods. Visit the company’s accessories page to browse the best options for you. Vodafone and O2 aren’t currently bundling the AirPods with their iPhone plans, although O2 sells the 2021 AirPods, the early-2019 AirPods and the 2022 AirPods Pro on their own. Whichever bundle you go for, remember to check if you’re getting the AirPods Pro, the early-2019 AirPods (sometimes called the second gen or AirPods 2) or the new 2021 AirPods (third-gen or AirPods 3). If you’re getting the AirPods Pro, find out if they include the new MagSafe charging case. AirPods buying advice Wondering if a pair of AirPods is right for you? We have a guide to the Best AirPods, and you could read AirPods Pro vs AirPods to find out how the models compare, but let’s quickly discuss the pros and cons. Apple has launched various AirPods versions, several of which are still on sale: 2016: 1st-gen AirPods, discontinued 2019: 2nd-gen AirPods, discontinued 2019: 1st-gen AirPods Pro, discontinued 2021: 3rd-gen AirPods, Lightning and Magsafe variants, discontinued 2022 \u0026 2023: 2nd-gen AirPods Pro, Lightning and USB-C variants 2020 \u0026 2024: AirPods Max All four non-Max models are wireless, sitting in your ears and in theory staying there through snugness of fit alone. The advantages of this are clear–they allow you to go running or work out without worrying about snagging the cables–but they may fall out once you pick up the pace. Our experience, however, is that the AirPods are among the best earbuds around in this regard. The AirPods Pro offer a snugger fit than the others because they have a choice of flexible ear tips, and are actually able to tell you whether you’ve selected the right tip or not. Sound quality is decent but not exceptional on the original and early-2019 models; the 2021 3rd gen AirPods were better, while the AirPods Pro are a step above thanks in part to their better fit and implementation of active noise cancellation. What AirPods consistently do better than non-Apple headphones is coordinate with other Apple products, thanks to the W1 chip (in the 2016 model) and H1 chip (2019 and 2021) which makes pairing with an iPhone a breeze. Battery-wise, most non-Max AirPods will last around five hours, but that’s not the end of the story: they come with a little charging case with its own larger battery, so you can pop them back in for a quick charge. The case should offer another 24 hours (give or take) before it’ll require charging. The 2021 AirPods, however, offer more in this department, with claimed figures of six hours out of the case and 30 hours in total. We’ve got some advice on getting better AirPods battery life. Apple’s 2nd gen AirPods can respond to Hey Siri commands, charge wirelessly if you opt for the Wireless Charging Case, and offer more talk time than the originals. Those features are kept in the 2021 3rd-generation models, with Spatial Audio and Adaptive EQ added to the mix. The 4th generation AirPods arrived in 2024 and add ANC to the mix. The AirPods Max are over-ear headphones and essentially a completely different product to the rest of the AirPods range. They are a lot more expensive and a totally different proposition to the other AirPods. Audio quality is almost universally considered to be exceptional, but it’s debatable whether it’s exceptional enough to justify that premium price tag. And many reviewers have pointed out that the case is oddly designed, given that the one part of the headphones that it doesn’t protect–the mesh headband–is the one that’s most vulnerable to damage.The AirPods Max are an appealing prospect, but may not be practical for most budgets.

    "title": "Best iPhone chargers: How to pick the right USB-C power adapter",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html",
    "description": "Macworld If you’ve ordered a new iPhone recently, you’ll notice that the box is a whole lot slimmer than in previous years. That’s because the bulkiest accessory is gone: the power charger. Apple has removed the power adapter from all iPhones it sells, so you need to bring your own. If you’ve been using Apple’s feeble old 5W adapter, it’s a perfect time to upgrade. Apple now supplies a cable in all iPhone boxes to allow for fast charging, so all you need is the right charger. Here we list our favorite trusted iPhone chargers—many of which do more than the plain Apple-branded charger, and nearly all of which are much smaller. Lightning or USB-C for iPhone? When we talk here about USB-C chargers, we mean the port on the charger, not on the iPhone. Starting with the iPhone 15 family, Apple has switched the port on its iPhone from Lightning to USB-C. But iPhones older than the 15 with the Lightning port should still hunt out a charger with a USB-C port as only these offer fast iPhone charging. Older phones will use a USB-C-to-Lightning cable, while the iPhone 15 series will have USB-C at both ends. Which wattage charger for iPhone? It’s important to consider the amount of wattage a charger will provide to your device. For years, Apple supplied “good-enough” 5-watt chargers in the iPhone box, which take about 2.5 hours to fill up your iPhone. The newest iPhone models require a charger that can handle 20 watts or greater for fast charging—30W will charge recent iPhones even faster. You can fill up about 50 percent of an iPhone 15 or 16’s battery in about 30 minutes with the right adapter. The latest iPhones can take in around 30W of power, so aim for that as a minimum for your iPhone charger. Higher wattages mean you could use the charger for your MacBook, too. Wired and wireless iPhone charging? From the iPhone 8 on, iPhones have the ability to be charged wirelessly. The iPhone 12 and later also feature Apple’s superior MagSafe wireless charging technology that uses magnets to make the connection with the wireless charging pad more efficient; check out our roundup of the best MagSafe chargers, most of which require one of the USB-C wall chargers tested here. Magnetic wireless chargers come in different charging speeds: 7.5W for MagSafe compatible, 15W for certified MagSafe and Qi2, and 25W on Apple’s newest MagSafe Charger. However, charging with a cable plugged into the iPhone will always be faster than wireless as less power is lost than in a wireless connection. Below our chart of the best iPhone chargers we recommend our favored charging cables. Count the ports Many adapters offer multiple ports on a single wall charger. If you’re going to be regularly charging more than one device at a time, buy an adapter with at least two ports—some have as many as four ports. You can even get a mix of USB-C and USB-A, depending on your needs. Plugs: To fold or not to fold Some chargers have folding pins to protect the adapter as well as other items if you toss it in a bag, but Apple’s 20W charger and a few others have less flexible protruding prongs. It’s a small thing, but it could make a big difference in your travel bag. As any traveler knows, plugs come in all shapes and sizes around the globe. We’ve tried to cover the most used types here. Some USB-C power adapters even come with different prong sets so you can leave the multi-holed travel adapter at home when you travel. Best iPhone chargers reviewed Official Apple iPhone charger: Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter Pros Official Apple charger Foldable prongs on U.K. model Cons No foldable prongs on U.S./AU models One port Price When Reviewed: $19 Best Prices Today: $14 at Walmart Electronics$14.99 at Amazon$14.99 at Best Buy Why we love it: Apple’s 20W USB-C power adapter is as basic as it gets. It’s one of the bulkiest chargers on this list as well as one of the heaviest, It won’t charge a laptop, and you can’t charge more than one device at a time. However, if you want to keep your chargers in the Apple family, it’s a solid option for $19/£19. In our testing, it won’t charge your phone noticeably faster than the old Apple 18W plug, but it is noticeably cheaper than the model it replaces. We’d like it better if Apple offered a half-price option for iPhone buyers, but even at full price, it’s not a terrible value at all. The U.S. and Australian models don’t feature a folding plug, but the more cube-like U.K. model does, despite the larger plug type, and is a much cleaner design as a result. While 20W is the minimum for fast charging, we recommend a 30W charger for newer iPhones. Best single-port iPhone charger: Anker 30W Nano Charger 511 Pros Smallest, lightest 30W charger 30W Foldable plug Multiple color options Cons One port Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: $16.99 at Walmart Electronics$18.99 at Amazon$19.99 at Anker Why we love it: Measuring just 1.12 × 1.12 × 1.39 inches (U.S. model), the 30W Anker USB-C Nano 3 Charger 511 is the smallest 30W USB-C charger we’ve had in our labs for testing. It weighs just 1.3oz (36g). We recommend you buy a 30W charger over 20W as it will charge newer iPhones even faster. The iPhone 15 Pro models will probably fare better with 35W for the fastest iPhone charging, so owners of the very latest iPhones should look at the two-port 40W Anker Nano Pro charger reviewed lower down. Earlier iPhones should be fine with 30W chargers such as this one. It’s available in a range of pastel colors, including Misty Blue, Lilac Purple, Phantom Black, Aurora White and Natural Green. The U.K. Anker Nano 3 (511) model is larger and doesn’t feature foldable prongs—so for U.K. buyers, we recommend the equally incredibly light and powerful Anker Nano USB-C Wall Charger (30W), pictured above, that does have foldable prongs. Ugreen Nexode 30W USB-C GaN Charger Pros Small size 30W Foldable plug Cons One port Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: $11.99 at Walmart$16.99 at Amazon$19.99 at Ugreen Why we love it: At 1.26 x 1.26 x 1.57 inches and 48g (U.S. model), the tiny Ugreen Nexode 30W GaN Charger is slightly larger than the similar Anker Nano (reviewed above). To make it even more portable both U.S. and U.K models feature foldable prongs. That extra power won’t make much difference with many iPhones as 20W is enough for fast charging. But if you have an iPhone Pro or Max, a 30W charger will allow it to charge a little faster (27W), and it certainly won’t hurt to have the added power on other models. At 30W, It could even recharge a 13-inch MacBook Air! While the 2-Port Nexode 45W Charger, also by Ugreen and reviewed below, gives you two ports, the single port of this charger pumps out a few more watts than either of the two on the 45W dual charger—so if you only have one device to charge, this is the better (and cheaper choice). Plugable 30W USB-C GaN Charger Pros Small size 30W Foldable plug Available in white or black Cons One port North America only Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $15.95 at Walmart$19.95 at Amazon$19.95 at B\u0026H Why we love it: This is another new-generation USB-C charger that measures just 1.22 × 1.26 × 1.37 inches—only marginally larger than the 30W Anker Nano and about the same as the Ugreen Nexode. It weighs just 45g—although you’ll likely not notice the difference with the 36g Anker Nano or 50g Ugreen Nexode. Available in either white or black, it’s not available outside of North America. Budget iPhone charger: Anker PowerPort III 20W Cube Fast Charger Pros Small size Foldable plug on U.S. model Available in white or black Cons One port No foldable plug on U.K. model Price When Reviewed: $14.99 Best Prices Today: $12.99 at Amazon$14.99 at Anker Why we love it: At 1.23 x 1.25 x 1.3 inches, the compact GaN-tech Anker PowerPort III is also pretty tiny and may be found cheaper than the 30W USB-C chargers as it is rated at the lower 20W. The U.K. model is less flexible due to the size of the U.K. plug and doesn’t allow for foldable prongs, so we prefer the Anker Nano or the even finer Apple 20W Charger in that country only. However, if you can afford it we recommend you go for a 30W charger if your iPhone is a version 13 or later. Fastest two-port iPhone charger: Ugreen 2-Port Nexode 45W Charger Pros Two ports 45W Small size Foldable plug (U.S. and U.K.) Price When Reviewed: $29.99 Best Prices Today: $29.99 at Amazon$39.99 at Ugreen Why we love it: The Ugreen Nexode 45W GaN Wall Charger 2-Ports Charger has more ports and power than the Anker 511 Nano Pro, but at 1.57 x 1.57 x 1.93 inches isn’t much larger. Each USB-C port is rated at 45W, although note that 45W is the maximum total output—you can choose either port to supply it. Using both ports, one will give 25W and the other 20W. It’s a great compact choice for homes with a couple of iPhones in need of a power boost. Slimmest two-port iPhone charger: Plugable 40W Dual USB C Charger Pros Two ports 40W Foldable plug Slimline Cons North America only Price When Reviewed: $34.95 Best Prices Today: $34.95 at Amazon Why we love it: Measuring 1.7 x 1.9 x 0.9 inches (4.4 x 4.8 x 2.3cm), the Plugable 40W Dual USB C Charger is a dual-port charger that is a little larger in volume than the Ugreen 2-Port Nexode 45W Charger reviewed above, but has a slimmer profile when plugged into a power socket. It’s wider but sticks out of the wall half as far as most chargers. It’s also lighter than the two-port Ugreen charger: 2.5oz vs 3.46oz (70g vs 98g). Each USB-C port is rated at 40W (maximum total output is 40W). Using both ports, that 40W is intelligently shared by priority. A 9V or higher device will charge faster than a 5V device, and you can see which devices is charging the fastest with the LED indicating the charge speed: blue for fastest, and green for slow. The Ugreen beats it on charging speed, but that which means more for 45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 Samsung users than max 30W iPhone users. If you want to use it to charge a MacBook, that extra 5W might be more useful. Best four-port charger: Minix NEO P3 100W Turbo Pros Four ports Up to 100W U.S./U.K./EU pins Foldable plug Cons May be overkill for just a phone Price When Reviewed: $65.99 Best Prices Today: $53.90 at Amazon Why we love it: The Minix NEO P3 100W Turbo packs a lot of power and has four ports: three USB-C and one old-school USB-A. Two of the USB-C ports can charge at 100W, although obviously not at the same time. That means you can use this power adapter to charge a laptop as large as the 16-inch MacBook Pro as well as tablets and phones. The third USB-C is perfect for fast iPhone charging at 20W, as is the 18W USB-A port if you have an older charging cable. Using two ports at the same time it supports one 65W and one 30W feed. Using three supports 45W, 30W, and 20W charges. With all four, it supports, 45W, 30W, and two 7.5W feeds. Like Apple’s dual-port charger, this adapter features intelligent power allocation, automatically adjusting the power output of each port depending on the devices connected to it. The U.S. plug folds, making it a tidy package for carrying around, and the U.K. and EU pin converters simply slide onto the U.S. pins to make this a great home charger in those territories and a useful international travel companion. Best travel adapter charger: OneAdaptr OneWorld 65 Pros Five ports Travel plug adapter 65W PD Cons Total output limited to 5 ports Price When Reviewed: $74.99 Best Prices Today: $74.99 at OneAdaptr Why we love it: The OneWorld 65 is an international adapter that also boasts a built-in 65W PD Charger that can charge up to six devices simultaneously. It features one 65W USB-C PD port, one 20W USB-C PD port, another USB-C charging port, and two USB-A charging ports—the non-PD USB-C port and two USB-A ports share 15W of power. Note that the maximum power output is 65W so if you are charging a mid-sized laptop in full use, there won’t be much spare juice for fas-charging your iPhone. But the real benefit of the OneWorld 65 is that as well as all the USB ports you can also use this as a travel adapter. Sliding connectors will fit into U.S., European, Australian/Chinese, and British wall sockets so covering over 200 countries, and you can plug a similar range of plugs into the OneWorld 65 from the other side. OneAdaptr has a few versions of this handy travel adapter—all with the sliding international prongs and an AC socket. The $39 entry-level OneWorld30 features one 20W USB-C PD port, 2x 15W USB-C and 2x 15W USB-A ports; the $69 OneWorld65 reviewed here; the $89 OneWorld100 features two 60W USB-C PD ports and 2x 15W USB-A ports; and the $109 OneWorld135 features two 100W USB-C PD ports, 1x 20W USB-C and 1x 18W USB-A port. Colorful two-port iPhone charger: Casetify 33W Fast Charger Pros Small size Two ports Foldable plug on U.S. model International plug heads Cute Pink/Blue model Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $42 Best Prices Today: $42 at Casetify Why we love it: The biggest selling point of the Casetify Fast Charger is its cute pink/blue color, although it is also available in plain white. Its 33W beats standard 30W chargers—enough for an iPhone fast charge and AirPods or Apple Watch at the same time. This two-port charger (USB-C and USB-A) is not as tiny as some other chargers but at 1.3 x 1.9 x 1.5 inches it isn’t much larger. It comes with U.K. and E.U. plug heads that slip over the foldable U.S. prongs, so makes a great travel charger, too. Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter Pros Two ports U.S. models have a foldable plug Cons Non-U.S. models don’t have a foldable plug Expensive Price When Reviewed: $59 Best Prices Today: $29 at Walmart Electronics$35.99 at Best Buy$59 at B\u0026H Why we love it: Apple offers its own dual-port USB-C charger in two models. As far as we can tell they are identical in everything except shape and size. As an Apple product, it’s reassuringly expensive but also a little smarter than most power adapters. The neat 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter is aimed at iPhone users, and the larger non-compact model is called the 35W Dual USB-C Port Power Adapter, which is the one built for the newer MacBook Air models. Both U.S. chargers feature foldable plugs. The larger version is maybe only preferable if you prefer the ports pointing straight on rather than below the plug itself. As it was designed to work with an iPhone and also something as energy-hungry as an M2/M3 MacBook Air, it needs to be able to distinguish which device needs what. When you connect two devices, power is automatically distributed between them based on their power requirements. In most cases, it will give each device 17.5W, but if you connect a MacBook or iPhone and an Apple Watch or AirPods, it will receive up to 27.5W and the Watch/AirPods gets up to 7.5W. Apple doesn’t say so, but we expect that it uses GaN technology to keep its size to a minimum. Plugable Wall Outlet Extender Pros Adds two ports, keeps AC socket 30W Cons North America only Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $24.95 at Amazon$24.95 at B\u0026H Why we love it: If you are short on power sockets, adding a wall charger leaves you with one less place to connect a plug for another device. You could add an extension strip—such as the Ugreen GaN Power Strip reviewed below—but the Plugable Wall Outlet Extender is smaller and neater, giving you two USB ports and a passthrough power socket. The USB-C socket can power an iPhone at up to 30W, and there’s another USB-A port that can handle 12W. Note, though, that the combined USB power output is 32W, so if you use both, that USB-C port might get pegged back to just 20W. UGreen 100W USB-C GaN Power Strip Pros 4 USB ports and 3 AC power sockets 100W Cons Bulky Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Best Prices Today: $99.99 at Amazon$99.99 at Ugreen Why we love it: This power strip is both a desktop charger and AC extender with three power sockets, and includes four USB ports (3x USB-C, 1x USB-A), two of which are PD compatible at 100W so powerful enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro or super-fast-charge the latest iPhones. This is great for adding all sorts of device-charging on or underneath your desk. The other USB-C port and the USB-A port can each fast-charge an iPhone at 22.5W. Maximum output on the USB ports is 100W, and for the three power plugs (one on the top, and two behind) 1,870W. Amazon Amazon Amazon FAQ 1. What’s the best iPhone Lightning charging cable? Apple still includes a cable in the box with all new iPhones whether they have Lightning or USB-C. But you can never have enough charging cables, right? Older iPhones (before iPhone 15) require a Lightning port on one end. If you need a spare, make sure you buy a USB-C to Lightning cable that’s certified Made for iPhone (MFI). Anker makes several of our recommended iPhone chargers, and its MFI-certified USB-C to Lightning cable is a little cheaper than Apple’s own cable and is twice as long. Anker has a bunch of USB-C to Lightning cables in various lengths and colors on its U.S. Amazon Store and at Amazon UK. We also rate UGreen’s USB-C to Lightning iPhone charge cables. For more detail, read our roundup of the best Lightning cables. 2. What about USB-C to USB-C cables? From the iPhone 15 onwards—or until Apple offers only wireless charging—Apple has replaced the iPhone’s Lightning port with a standard USB-C port so you need a USB-A to USB-C or USB-C to USB-C cable. The new iPhones ship with the correct cable so you don’t need to go looking for a new one unless you require a spare—and, let’s face it, most of us need several. Check out PCWorld’s list of the best USB-C cables.

    "title": "From the iPhone X to the iPhone 16: Apple’s insane battery life visualized",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2473371/battery-life-iphone-16-pro-plus-max.html",
    "description": "Macworld Premium smartphone manufacturers have been steadily improving battery life for years, and Apple is no exception. In fact, if you only look at the improvement of the current iPhones compared to last year’s models, you may not realize just how far they’ve come. The battery in today’s new iPhones lasts several times longer than that of the iPhone X introduced just seven years ago! Fortunately, we have been testing iPhone battery life in the same way since then, so we wanted to illustrate just how much better iPhone battery life has become. iPhone battery life over the years We have tested battery life using the Geekbench 4 battery life test going all the way back to the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. We perform the test the same way each time, setting screen brightness to 200 nits and disabling all notifications and auto-brightness settings. We then run the test with the “dim screen” feature turned off to maintain consistent brightness. The Geekbench 4 battery test runs the Geekbench 4 benchmarks repeatedly on a loop until the battery dies, with a small break between runs. It’s a way to keep the screen active and the processor occupied in a consistent fashion over an extended period. It is, however, a little dated—the more modern Geekbench 5 and Geekbench 6 unfortunately did not include a battery benchmark. Here’s how long each of the regular iPhones lasted during this test. There are two tabs on this chart, one showing battery life (in minutes) and one showing the capacity of the battery (in milliamp hours). You can see a clear and impressive increase in battery life over time. Battery capacity has grown a lot, almost doubling from the iPhone 8 to the latest iPhone 16. But battery life has extended much more than that, with the iPhone 16 running this same test, at the same brightness, lasting over five times as long as the iPhone 8! Bear in mind that screen size has increased quite a bit over this time, too. Also read: iPhone batteries compared – Capacity, mah and watt hours for every iPhone Taking a look at the “large” model phones, we see a similar story: an increase in battery capacity, but a much bigger increase in battery life. There are fewer phones to consider here, as the iPhone XR and iPhone 11 had no larger variant, and the iPhone 12 and 13 had a “mini” model instead of a larger one. Pro iPhones shine even brighter The iPhone Pro models are known for often having slightly longer battery life, in part because they may use newer or more advanced components that are more efficient. Here’s how long the iPhone Pro models last, along with the battery capacity in mAh. While the iPhone X and XS don’t carry the “Pro” name, they’re included here as they were clearly the pro models of their release year. Starting with the iPhone XS, Apple produced a larger Max model that always had a larger display and a larger battery. Here’s how they compare. You can see only a modest increase in battery capacity over the last five years, but a more than doubling of battery life. Whether Pro or not, large or standard, Apple’s battery life gains have dramatically outpaced the bigger battery capacities. In other words, efficiency is going way up. iPhones are now more than twice as efficient We can easily derive a sort of basic “efficiency score” when we divide battery capacity (in milliamp-hours) by battery life (in minutes). The result is a mAh per minute score that lets you know how much battery is being used to run the phone for one minute during these tests: meaning, brightness stuck at 200 nits on a mostly-white screen (with a bit of colored and black text), running Geekbench 4 tests on a loop. For this value, lower scores are better, as it means less battery capacity is being used per minute. The iPhone Pro models are almost always just a touch more efficient than their non-pro siblings, with a notable exception of the iPhone XS being a little less efficient than the iPhone XR. But no matter how you slice it, iPhone power efficiency has become steadily better over time, even as performance has gone way up and displays have become larger and brighter. Now let’s take a look at the large-size phones. Again, the Pro phones are slightly more efficient than their non-Pro equivalents, but the big story is the absolutely huge improvement in overall power efficiency in the last seven years. What is the cause of this efficiency improvement? It’s undoubtedly difficult to pin down. There have been improvements in iOS over the years, but also in the low-level microcode that controls everything in your iPhone from USB and Lightning ports to haptics and NFC. Wireless radios have improved, from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth to 5G to NFC. Display technology keeps improving, offering not only better quality and higher brightness but also the ability to turn power into photons with greater efficiency. And of course, the main application processor and supporting chips continue to evolve not just to offer better performance but to use less power. That means A-series Apple Silicon, RAM, power regulation circuitry, and so on. The impressive and steady efficiency gains of the iPhone line over the least near-decade come in little drips and drops—a few percent here, a fraction of a percent there—until they all add up to a downpour. It’s the compound interest of mobile power efficiency, and we are all the beneficiaries of it. Still, we can’t help but notice the stark improvement in this year’s iPhones, even relative to just the year before. Not since the iPhone 11 to iPhone 12 generation has overall power efficiency improved this much in one year. But unlike that generational leap, where iPhone battery capacity went down, this year the efficiency leap was paired with larger batteries. No wonder the iPhone 16 line is delivering the longest battery life ever in an iPhone by such a wide margin.",

    "description": "Macworld You don’t have to pay full price to buy an iPhone; if you shop around you can find a bargain. Every month the Macworld team hunts down the best prices on iPhones at all major retailers and cellphone operators, saving you the hassle of finding the best iPhone deals. In this article, we reveal the best iPhone deals, contracts, and bundles available right now. We’ll help you find a discounted iPhone suitable for any budget, and cover all the currently available models, including the brand-new iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, as well as last year’s iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. We also have the best prices for older iPhones, including models that Apple has removed from sale, but which you can still buy elsewhere. The iPhone 16 is the latest iPhone to arrive, debuting in September 2024. It will be followed in 2025 by the iPhone 17 and (probably) iPhone SE 4. You might also like to read our detailed iPhone buying guide, and our comparison of every iPhone available to buy today. Best iPhone deals right now U.S. In the U.S., the only big iPhone deals you can find come from carriers, and have a lot of strings attached. Typically, you have to buy a phone on a multi-year installment plan and get your discount in the form of monthly bill credits. AT\u0026T: Get up to $1,000 in bill credits when you buy a new iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max and trade in your old phone, with a qualifying unlimited plan. Up to $700 towards an iPhone 15 or 15 Plus. T-Mobile: Get up to $830 in bill credits toward the purchase of any iPhone 15 model when you trade in your old phone and join the Go5G plan. Verizon: Get up to $839 in bill credits toward any iPhone 15 model with trade-in and the activation of a new line. U.K. In the U.K., Apple-certified resellers discount unlocked iPhones frequently. But Apple just dropped a lot of its iPhone prices by £100, and it can take retailers a while to catch up: some deals that looked appealing a month ago aren’t quite so worthwhile any more. Look for money off at Amazon, John Lewis, Currys, and Very. There aren’t yet any discounts on the new 16-series iPhones. John Lewis, iPhone 15 (128GB): £681 (£18 off; RRP was £799, but is now £699) Amazon, iPhone SE (64GB): £379 (£50 off, RRP £429) Amazon, iPhone SE (128GB): £429 (£50 off, RRP £479) In the U.K. it’s also possible to find discounts on older iPhones, including the now-discontinued iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 14 Pro. Amazon, iPhone 15 Pro (128GB), £899 (RRP was £999, now discontinued) Amazon, iPhone 15 Pro Max (256GB), £1,099 (RRP was £1,199, now discontinued) Amazon, iPhone 14 Pro (256GB): £999 (£210 off 2022’s price of £1,209; Apple discontinued this phone in September 2023) For models that Apple no longer sells, bear in mind that we can only compare current prices against RRPs from before their discontinuation. It’s reasonable to assume that the price of the iPhone 15 Pro, for example, would have dropped in September 2024 if Apple hadn’t stopped selling it. There’s more information in the individual sections below. Where to buy an iPhone Apple is the obvious place to look for a new iPhone. You can purchase directly from Apple’s online store (there’s a separate U.K. store), which won’t give you savings, but does at least allow you to take advantage of trading in your old iPhone (see: How to sell or trade-in your old iPhone). We also have a complete guide to every iPhone Apple sells. Alternatively, Amazon U.K. regularly discounts iPhone models, so it’s well worth keeping an eye out there. If you think you’ll be doing lots of Amazon shopping, we’d recommend signing up to the 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime for free next-day delivery and access to deals 30 minutes early. You can sign up here. Amazon U.S. offers fewer savings on SIM-free iPhones, but we do see them from time to time. It’s always worth checking the price of the iPhones in the following U.S. stores, which occasionally provide solid savings: Amazon Walmart Best Buy And U.K. readers should try these shops: Amazon U.K. John Lewis Carphone Warehouse KRCS In addition, we recommend you check out our automatically updated price tables, embedded below, which gather the best prices from a wide range of retailers in your region. Where to buy an iPhone on contract Most of the major networks will offer the iPhone at a discount if you meet certain conditions (usually opening new lines, or buying on multi-year installment plans). Here are links to browse the latest deals: AT\u0026T T-Mobile Verizon U.K. readers can browse contract deals using the tool embedded below. Click ‘Choose Smartphone’ to register which model you’re interested in. If you’d like to research deals for yourself, try the following U.K. providers: O2 Vodafone Three Virgin Mobile EE Sky Mobile Carphone Warehouse (use the comparison tool by clicking View Deals, and remember to tick the box labeled “Show total cost of ownership”) Note that you can save money if you’ve got another iPhone to trade in, see: How to sell or trade in your old iPhone. Best prices for Apple’s iPhones Apple currently sells eight iPhone models: the iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max; the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus; the iPhone 13; and the iPhone SE. We look at the best prices for each model, plus a handful of discontinued models that are still available from other retailers, in the sections below.

The smallest iPhone you could buy, although the SE is also on the small side. In most respects, it was identical to the iPhone 13, simply squeezed into a smaller chassis and equipped with a smaller screen and smaller battery. That means you’re getting a great (but non-ProMotion) screen, 5G, a super-fast A15 processor and great cameras with Cinematic Mode. Read our iPhone 13 mini review for more information and expert analysis. Apple no longer sells the iPhone 13 mini, so if it’s what you want you will need to look around.

Apple no longer sells the the iPhone 12, but when it did, prices started at $599/£649 (down from the $699/£679 charged between September 2021 and 2022).

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2469334/october-mac-surprises-studio-display-m4-imac-lightning-accessories.html",
    "description": "Macworld According to reports, Apple will release new Macs at an event sometime in October. The rumors about these new Macs have been consistent: Apple will likely release M4 MacBook Pros, an M4 iMac, and a redesigned M4 Mac mini. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is the main source reporting about the upcoming event, and he has a reliable track record–it’s so good that he has historically been spot-on with what is eventually released, down to the specifications of the products. Which can set up Apple followers for a bit of a letdown once the event comes and goes–we already know what will be revealed. But there’s always a chance that the rumors miss out on something and that always ends up being the surprise and delight of the event. What surprises could happen at the upcoming Mac event? Here are a few ideas. (Or, considering the context of what I just wrote, here are some “spoilers.”) A bigger iMac Several reports indicate that a 32-inch iMac is in the works, but Gurman reported in August that it is “unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later.” Mac hardware rumors catch on because of reports about parts that can be tracked in the supply chain, so in the case of a big iMac, you’d think we’d heard a lot about Apple buying a ton of 32-inch panels. But we haven’t heard much. Apple could revive the iMac Pro as a bigger, faster companion to the current iMac. Apple could revive the iMac Pro as a bigger, faster companion to the current iMac.Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry Apple could revive the iMac Pro as a bigger, faster companion to the current iMac.Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry That doesn’t mean it can’t happen, though. A 32-inch iMac with an M4 or M4 Pro (following the model of the Mac mini) would complement the 24-inch iMac Apple currently offers and inject some excitement into the lineup again. A new Apple display Since Apple is going to release a new Mac mini, this is a good opportunity to release a new display, too. The Studio Display is over two years old, which isn’t outdated in terms of how Apple handles its display lineup; Apple has historically kept displays in the lineup for two or three years before replacing them with something new. But Apple could update the Studio Display and promote it as an ideal display for the new Mac mini. The Pro Display XDR, however, is almost five years old and for a display that costs $4,999 without a stand, you’re paying a severely high price for outdated tech. An upgrade with ProMotion and proper HDR is a no-brainer, but I’ll admit this doesn’t seem like the event to release a new pro display, though. It’s a better fit for a new Mac Studio or Mac Pro, which are expected to be released at WWDC next year. Lightning strikes on the Magic Mouse, Trackpad, Keyboard Much was made when Apple transitioned the AirPods, iPhone, and iPad from Lightning to USB-C. Apple has switched those products successfully, but Apple still uses Lightning in the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard. Gurman reported before last year’s “Scary Fast” event that these devices would be outfitted with USB-C, but that didn’t happen. Apple sticking with Lightning on its Magic devices would be more surprising than switching to USB-C. Apple sticking with Lightning on its Magic devices would be more surprising than switching to USB-C.Foundry Apple sticking with Lightning on its Magic devices would be more surprising than switching to USB-C.Foundry Foundry But the surprise here isn’t that Apple replaces the Lightning port on these devices with USB-C, but that Apple doesn’t update these accessories, and Lightning sticks around for a while longer. After all, the switch to USB-C seems inevitable, so Apple deciding to keep using Lighting would be out of line with the current trend and an unexpected move. MacBook Pro with a display update Apple is using displays based on OLED technology in its iPad Pro and iPhones, and it’s been rumored that it will replace the mini LED display in the MacBook Pro. The iPad Pro 4 uses a Tandem OLED (which it refers to as “Ultra Retina XDR”) and it looks great. Some reports say that the MacBook Pro switch to OLED isn’t scheduled to happen for a while, but Apple has been known to surprise us before with new tech we weren’t expecting. Event? What event? What would be a huge surprise is if Apple didn’t hold an M4 Mac event and simply posted press releases in its Newsroom to announce the releases. It’s not totally out of the realm of possibility, since the M4 upgrade isn’t especially remarkable over the M3, and a demo of the Mac mini’s new design won’t take much time. However, in case you haven’t heard, AI is all the rage in the tech world and Apple puts considerable effort into promoting its Apple Intelligence feature set. It’s not as though the M4 does anything special with Apple Intelligence, which runs on any M-series Mac (as well as Intel Macs with a T2 chip). But Apple will use this event to promote Apple Intelligence, and it will be a big part of the show.",

    "title": "iPhone SE 4: Everything you need to know about Apple’s next budget phone",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple updated its entry-level iPhone in March 2022, adding a few nips and tucks here and there along with a quiet price increase. It kept the Home button and small form factor that appeals to some, but the aging design and minimal upgrades meant the new iPhone SE was coolly received by the masses, with many looking forward to the next generation and reviewers hoping Apple was planning a more radical overhaul of the device. Rumors are now starting to appear about what that might look like. In this article we’ve gathered together everything we know so far, and what we can reasonably speculate, about the iPhone SE 4. For information about the iPhone 16 series – read our separate article about the iPhone 16 and our separate article about rumors about the iPhone 17. iPhone SE 4 release date: When will the iPhone SE 4 be released? Spring 2025 (estimated) Apple’s iPhone SE doesn’t follow the same predictable annual release schedule as the standard iPhone line, and the intervals between updates can be harder to predict. The timing of the next launch points to a biennial routine, but that followed a far longer gap between the first and second phones. Here’s when the three models released so far made their debut: iPhone SE (3rd gen): March 2022 iPhone SE (2nd gen): April 2020 iPhone SE (1st gen): March 2016 Analyst Jeff Pu thinks that the iPhone SE will arrive in 2025. Since the SE models typically launch in the spring, it seems obvious that we’re looking at a spring 2025 release date (or later). Furthermore, Ming-Chi Kuo tweeted that Apple was using a prototype iPhone SE to test its 5G modem, which will arrive in the iPhone SE before the flagship iPhone models. Kuo states that “there are no plans for mass production and sales” of this prototype iPhone SE and has reported that the next iPhone SE isn’t expected until 2025. Apple’s current budget phone, the iPhone SE (2022) Apple’s current budget phone, the iPhone SE (2022)Dominik Tomaszewski Apple’s current budget phone, the iPhone SE (2022)Dominik Tomaszewski Dominik Tomaszewski iPhone 4 SE price: How much will the iPhone SE 4 cost? Pricing has steadily increased across the three existing generations, no doubt influenced by the global cost of components and distribution. While the iPhone SE (3rd generation) was released around the same price as the model it replaced, Apple added a chunk onto the cost, making the current model somewhat less desirable than previous iterations, especially when you factor in the measly amount of storage that comes with the baseline model. At launch the prices were even higher in the U.K. but, in September 2023, after adjusting for inflation, Apple dropped the price back to match the U.S. price. Apple did the same thing for prices in Euros in September 2024. Here’s how they line up: iPhone SE (3rd gen, 2022): 64GB: $429/£429 (was £449 at launch) 128GB: $479/£479 (was £499 at launch) 256GB: $579/£579 (was £609 at launch) iPhone SE (2nd gen, 2020):  64GB: $399/£419 128GB: $449/£469 256GB: $549/£569 iPhone SE (1st gen, 2016):  32GB: $399/£379 128GB: $499/£449 However, the iPhone SE needs to be inexpensive, and we’d be surprised to see the price increase too much with the next generation, even with several rumored upgrades. The latest rumors claim the 4th-gen iPhone SE could start at $499, still far less expensive than any other new iPhone Apple sells. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman claims the next model is intended to help Apple compete with low-end Android phones in China, so a low price would be necessary to achieve this plan. iPhone 4 SE design: What will the next iPhone SE look like? Will the iPhone SE get a long-overdue design revamp? Rumors suggest that we could see a move away from the iPhone 8 chassis to something more like the iPhone 14, or even the iPhone 16. The big difference will be good or bad news depending on your viewpoint. It seems likely that the Home button will be no more. Some people prefer the Home button as a means to interact with their iPhone, for some older people and those who are less dexterous it is helpful to have a physical button. If the iPhone SE has an action button this could take on the role of the Home button for those who require it. No Home button is likely to mean a notch – and that’s a notch, rather than the Dynamic Island. So perhaps the iPhone 14 will lend its shell to the new iPhone SE. Over the years there has been a lot of speculation as to which older iPhone could lend its chassis to the next-generation iPhone SE. Apple can lower production costs by not straying too far from an existing chassis. iPhone 13 mini? As the iPhone SE has always traditionally been one of the smallest devices Apple offers, it seems logical that the discounted iPhone 13 mini format might make its way down to replace the iPhone 6 chassis on the SE. iPhone XR? On an August 2022 episode of the Geared Up podcast, tech tipster Jon Prosser said the “iPhone SE 4… is just the iPhone XR,” meaning it has an “all-screen” design and a 6.1-inch display. However, a report by Ross Young in late October 2022 claimed that Apple is mulling a 5.7-inch display, which would be a new size for an iPhone. The iPhone 13 mini is 5.4 inches and the iPhone X and XS were 5.8 inches. Young also says that Apple is deciding whether to use LCD or OLED for the display. iPhone 14? In February 2023, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple is moving forward with a 6.1-inch OLED display for the iPhone SE 4 with an overall design and features similar to the iPhone 14. Another rumor in April 2024, suggest that the body will resemble an iPhone 14, with a 6.1-inch OLED and notch. The rumored dimensions of the iPhone SE 4 state that it could be about the same size as the iPhone 15 but a smidge taller. iPhone 16? Finally, a rumor in July 2024 suggested Apple will change course with the iPhone SE 4 and instead use the same body as the iPhone 16, making it a true budget version of the latest iPhone lineup. If Apple chooses to use the chassis of the iPhone 16 rather than the iPhone 14 that could allow the best alignment of two camera lenses for talking videos for the Vision Pro. But that would mean that the iPhone SE would have two cameras on the back, rather than just one, as it does currently. iPhone SE 4 specs: Will Apple Intelligence be supported? Now that iOS 18 is here, Apple is preparing its devices for Apple Intelligence AI features which will arrive with iOS 18.1 in the fall. Not all devices currently sold are compatible. The iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max and the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max are the only iPhones that currently support those features. That means that the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, and the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus do not support Apple Intelligence. Processor \u0026 RAM: To run Apple Intelligence an iPhone requires an A17 or A18 chip and 8GB of RAM. There is some expectation that the iPhone SE 4 could meet these requirements. But that would be a strange choice on Apple’s part as it would make both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 redundant. But it would be strange to launch a new product that didn’t support Apple Intelligence at this point in time. Alternatively, the iPhone SE 4 could take the place of the iPhone 14 in the lineup with the same A15 chip. It all depends on where Apple sees the iPhone SE in the range and what its purpose is. Other than the processor and RAM requirements, we may see some other internal changes including the following: Modem: The iPhone SE 4 might be the first iPhone to feature one of Apple’s own 5G modems. In February 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expected it to be and claimed the baseband chip will be manufactured with a 4nm process and support only sub-6GHz bands. In April 2023, MacRumors reported that analyst Jeff Pu believes that Apple will release a fourth-generation iPhone SE with an Apple-designed 5G modem in 2025. TSMC will manufacture the modem chip. However, Pu doesn’t have a track record for accuracy like other analysts. In April 2023, Kuo tweeted that the iPhone SE 4 is dead (again) and that Apple is using an engineering prototype iPhone SE to test its 5G modem. Storage: With the iPhone 13 range moving to a baseline of 128GB (and the 14-series handsets following suit), it’s hoped that the new iPhone SE might do likewise, as 64GB isn’t enough for most people anymore, especially since system files take up more than 10GB. But we’re not terribly hopeful—the iPhone SE (3rd gen) launched after the iPhone 13 range and still started with the same 64GB of storage, and the redesigned 10th-generation iPad also starts at 64GB. We explain more about this in why you shouldn’t buy the 64GB iPhone SE. USB C: We expect the iPhone SE 4 to feature a USB-C port for charging, as all new iPhones do, and IP68 water resistance. The current SE is one of the last remaining Apple devices to still have a Lightning port. Camera(s): One of the defining features of the iPhone SE is a single camera on the back. This is probably not going to change, although if the new iPhone SE does adopt the chassis of an iPhone 14 or 16 it is possible. Regardless, we expect a similar 12MP wide-angle lens, despite the move to 48MP main camera on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16. The selfie camera is also expected to be 12MP. iPhone SE 4: Will the new iPhone SE use Touch ID or Face ID? The most recent rumors say the new iPhone SE will have Face ID with a notch (not dynamic island), similar to an iPhone 13 or iPhone 14. That means Touch ID, which has been a staple of the SE line since its debut, will go away. iPhone history The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone SE 3 are the current-generation models available from Apple. In addition to this SE 4 model we’re also expecting iPhone 17 to launch in 2025. Below you can find links below to our reviews of all iPhone models, including the latest generation.

Of course, you can still buy from Apple directly, either in-store or online, but the lowest prices can generally be found elsewhere.

These deals can be complicated, so be sure to read the fine print. In the U.S., Apple partners with carriers to offer discounts on the 2022 iPhones. You get a $30 discount if you buy a phone activated on AT\u0026T, Verizon, or T-Mobile/Sprint, however, if you shop around there are some good deals to be found. U.S. AT\u0026T: Get up to $800 in bill credits when you buy a new iPhone 14 and trade in your old phone, with a qualifying unlimited plan. T-Mobile: Get up to $800 in bill credits when you buy an iPhone 14 and trade in your old phone when you add a new line. Verizon: Get up to $1,000 in bill credits toward an iPhone 14 Pro with trade-in and select Unlimited plans. U.K. Contract offers vary quite widely in price, but you’ll need to check the fine print and the perks and extras that are thrown in.

Refurbished devices are thoroughly tested and repaired to work and look just like new.

See our full guide to buying refurbished or second-hand iPhones for more. The first place to shop for a refurbished iPhone is on the Apple Refurbished Store. At time of writing, Apple does not yet offer refurbished iPhone 14 models for sale, but that could change at any time. Rest assured, the Apple Refurbished Store is where you can get the highest quality of refurbished iPhones.

    "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for an iPhone but don’t want to spend a fortune, the third-gen iPhone SE, Apple’s cheapest current handset, is the phone for you. It features a powerful processor (the A15, which also appeared in the flagship iPhone 13 Pro from 2021) at an affordable price, starting at $429 in the U.S. or £429 in the U.K. For a phone that’s even cheaper, however, you may want to consider the second-gen iPhone SE from 2020. Apple no longer sells this device itself, but other vendors may still sell you one for a bargain price. In this article we round up the best deals and discounts currently available on each iPhone SE model, as well as cheap bundle offers worth considering. We cover both SIM-free and contract deals, identifying which retailers which have the handsets in stock, and which offer the best price. If you want to get yourself an iPhone SE, read on for the best deals. How much does the iPhone SE cost? Apple’s most affordable iPhone starts at $429/£429. (And you can get it for less if you trade in an older qualifying phone.) The 2022 model is currently available in three configurations: iPhone SE (2022, 64GB): $429 / £429 / AUD$719 iPhone SE (2022, 128GB): $479 / £479 / AUD$799 iPhone SE (2022, 256GB): $579 / £579/ AUD$969 That’s a slight price increase on the previous model. The 2020 iPhone SE is no longer available from Apple itself, but had the following MSRPs at launch: iPhone SE (2020, 64GB): $399 / £399 / AUD$679 iPhone SE (2020, 128GB): $449 / £439 / AUD$759 (If you’re buying the iPhone SE we recommend that you avoid the lowest-capacity model. We explain in a separate article: Why you shouldn’t buy the 64GB iPhone SE.) Where to buy iPhone SE (2022) SIM-free Apple sells the iPhone SE starting at $429/£429. You can buy from Apple right now. (That’s the U.S. store; depending on where you are, the U.K. store or the Australia store may be more suitable.) It’s also available from other retailers, who may offer discounts on Apple’s price. But this phone is relatively cheap (at least by Apple’s standards), so you’re unlikely to see any startling savings just yet. In the U.S., in fact, all the major retailers are sticking at Apple’s price. Best U.K. deals: Amazon, iPhone SE (64GB): £379 (£50 off, RRP £429) Amazon, iPhone SE (128GB): £429 (£50 off, RRP £429) You can check the best and latest offers in our automatic pricing tables, below. iPhone SE (64GB), MSRP $429/£429 New Refurbished Retailer Price $429 View Deal $429 View Deal $429 View Deal $449 View Deal $449 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price iPhone SE (2022) 64GB – Midnight – Unlocked $161.30 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket iPhone SE (128GB), MSRP $479/£479 Retailer Price $479 View Deal $479 View Deal $479 View Deal $499 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Numerous retailers are stocking the iPhone SE. Just make sure you get the third-gen or 2022 version of the iPhone SE: many will continue to stock the second-gen model from 2020, which features the older A13 processor and doesn’t support 5G. U.S. readers should check the following stores: Amazon Best Buy Target Walmart U.K. readers, meanwhile, should check the retailers below. Affordable Mobiles Amazon Argos Carphone Warehouse Currys E2Save Giff Gaff John Lewis KRCS Mobiles.co.uk Mobile Phones Direct Very Where to buy iPhone SE (2022) on contract Try the following stores and carriers for the best iPhone SE contract deals. As mentioned above, make sure you’re getting the 2022 model with the A15 processor and 5G. It’s also bearing in mind that you’ll want the contract to include 5G support too: you need both hardware and contract to support the tech, and this may cost extra. If in doubt, ask a member of the sales support staff. AT\u0026T T-Mobile Verizon U.K. readers can browse the best contract deals using the table below: If you’d like to research further, try the following U.K. carriers: Affordable Mobiles BT Mobile Carphone Warehouse EE E2Save iD Mobile Fonehouse Giff Gaff O2 Sky Mobile Tesco Mobile Three Virgin Mobile Vodafone Mobiles.co.uk Mobile Phones Direct iPhone SE (2020) deals The iPhone SE model from 2020 is no longer sold by Apple itself, but there are good deals available from other vendors. Where to buy the iPhone SE (2020) SIM-free You’ll see the lowest prices from third-party retailers in the automatic pricing table below. You can also buy the iPhone SE SIM-free from a number of other retailers. Try these U.S. stores: Amazon Best Buy Target Walmart U.K. readers should try the following: Affordable Mobiles Amazon Argos Carphone Warehouse Currys E2Save John Lewis KRCS Mobiles.co.uk Mobile Phones Direct Very Where to buy the iPhone SE (2020) on contract You can pick up the iPhone SE from a number of different networks in the U.S. and U.K.: AT\u0026T T-Mobile Verizon U.K. contract providers: Affordable Mobiles BT Mobile Carphone Warehouse EE E2Save iD Mobile Fonehouse O2 Sky Mobile Tesco Mobile Three Virgin Mobile Vodafone Mobiles.co.uk Mobile Phones Direct We’ve also compared the original iPhone SE to the iPhone SE 2 if you want to know what kind of upgrades and differences to expect. Trade-in discounts Don’t forget you can save when you trade in your old qualifying phone with Apple or other retailers participating in a trade-in programme. Apple offers up to hundreds of dollars off the iPhone SE when you trade in your old iPhone (but if your phone is older, you’ll likely get much less). You’ll have to select the trade-in option during purchase and answer a few questions about your existing phone model, storage capacity and condition. You’ll need to provide your IMEI number as well. Read about Apple’s Trade In scheme in the U.S. and U.K. In the U.K. you could get even more money off if you trade-in via Currys PC World, which has offered up to £240 off previous iPhone SE models when you trade in an older iPhone. Head to Currys to see how much your device is worth. Amazon offers some good trade-in values, so you should see if you can get more there. Check out Amazon’s Trade In program in the U.S. U.K. readers can see how Amazon trade-in process works here. Apple reseller KRCS also offers a trade-in scheme. Refurbished deals You can save on the iPhone SE by opting for a refurbished model. This is an excellent option for the second-gen model from 2020. Although you’re buying a device that has been pre-owned, buying refurbished isn’t the same as simply buying second-hand, the main difference being that the product has been repaired and rigorously tested to ensure it works just like new. Refurbished devices often come with additional warranty arrangements for peace of mind if you are to run into any issues after purchase. Decluttr (better known as MusicMagpie in the U.K.) is a great source to shop for refurbished deals, although right now its prices are higher than Amazon’s. You reduce the rate if you choose to trade-in your old device or old tech for cashback. When shopping refurbished, look out for Apple Certified Refurbished products. These have been repaired, with parts replaced as needed, and thoroughly tested (and cleaned) to meet the Apple standard. You can find Apple Certified Refurbished iPhones from the Apple Refurbished Store. We have a dedicated guide on buying refurbished iPhones with everything you need to know, as well as the best refurbished iPhone deals. Wondering if there’s a more affordable option than the SE? We answer the question What is the cheapest iPhone? in a separate article. Our iPhone buying guide, meanwhile, offers in-depth advice for those looking to buy or upgrade.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple has a reputation as an uncompromising driver of new technology. Look no further than the classic example of shipping the original iMac without a floppy drive or legacy ports, or designing the iPhone without a hardware keyboard, or even killing off the iPod mini to make way for the iPod nano. The company certainly puts forth an image of pushing technology forward without dwelling on the past. While those examples might get a lot of attention, the Apple of these days is a bigger, more ponderous organization, a battleship that can’t simply turn on a dime. As a result, the move to any new technology takes time, and often what came before isn’t excised in months, or sometimes even years. As much as Apple might like to see itself as an unstoppable force barreling ever forward, you don’t have to look too far through its lineup to see plenty of places where it’s still clinging to the past, even if it’s out of sheer practicality. You can’t go Home button again One of the original trademarks of the iPhone was its single front-facing button. The Home button evolved, gaining a Touch ID sensor and eventually transforming from a physical button into a capacitive sensor with haptics. But its demise was heralded by the introduction of the iPhone X design with its edge-to-edge display and Face ID. The iPhone SE is the last iPhone with a Home button. The iPhone SE is the last iPhone with a Home button.Jason Cross/IDG The iPhone SE is the last iPhone with a Home button.Jason Cross/IDG Jason Cross/IDG But that design debuted in November 2017, almost seven years ago now. And while the Home button has been gradually removed from both the iPhone and iPad lines, it lives on even to this day. The third-generation iPhone SE, which came out in 2022, remains a product in Apple’s lineup, proudly sporting the classic design ushered in by 2016’s iPhone 7. That said, the Home button’s days seem to be numbered. Rumor has it that a fourth-generation of the low-cost phone will show up next spring, finally bringing it into line with the modern iPhone design. The Home button will shuffle off this mortal coil after almost eighteen years. There’s a curve describing the practicalities of this kind of design: as Apple produces more of a certain design, doing so gets cheaper—but eventually as it scales up its new models, that old design becomes the outlier, meaning it’s now more expensive to keep around, especially for just a single model. So in the end, Apple saves money and effort by shifting the SE’s design to look like the rest of the phones and bidding adieu to the iconic Home button. Lightning bolts When Apple introduced the Lightning connector in 2012, the response would have had you thinking they’d methodically kicked every single one of their customers’ dogs. Its predecessor, the 30-pin dock connector had originated on the iPod back in 2003, but that nine-year tenure had seen an explosion of accessories that relied on it–to think, people who’ve only started using an iPhone in the last decade may have never even seen the once-ubiquitous alarm clock/speaker with a dock-connector built in. Lightning lives with the Mac’s Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad. Lightning lives with the Mac’s Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad.Foundry Lightning lives with the Mac’s Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad.Foundry Foundry So last year, when Apple first dropped the Lightning port for USB-C on the iPhone, you might have expected a similar outcry. But perhaps the fact that USB-C had already been on Macs since 2015 and was introduced into the iPad lineup in 2018 helped soften the blow. Plus, in the intervening years the prevalence of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth speakers and Qi charging, made switching out the physical connector less of an issue. Still, Lightning has not yet been excised from Apple’s products either. In addition to the older iPhones that Apple still sells (the iPhone 14 line, the aforementioned iPhone SE), the Lightning port is still used for charging by Apple’s wireless Mac input accessories: the Magic Keyboard, Trackpad, and Mouse. (Name a more iconic trio, I’ll wait.) And in case that’s not enough for you, it’s also still sneaks in one last place: the first-generation Apple Pencil, which has stuck around for compatibility with all those older iPads out there. Many of those are surely not long for the world. The iPhone SE’s rumored refresh will undoubtedly switch to USB-C and Apple will probably (hopefully?) update its Mac accessories in the not too distant future—perhaps when a new Mac mini shows up? But that Apple Pencil, well, it may be a few years yet before it’s finally erased. Quid pro status quo Stand back, because I’m going to dish the hottest of takes and add to this list of legacy technology hanging on by a thread an entire Apple product: the Mac Pro. Apple update the Mac Pro with an M-series chip in 2023, but the overall design is over five years old. Apple update the Mac Pro with an M-series chip in 2023, but the overall design is over five years old.Foundry Apple update the Mac Pro with an M-series chip in 2023, but the overall design is over five years old.Foundry Foundry Look, the Mac Pro might be important for Apple from a psychological perspective, signaling that the company is just at home in a professional environment as it is on the average person’s desk or lap. But even many of the people who today might want a Mac Pro frankly don’t stand to get a lot out of it–or not appreciably more than they could get from a similar specced Mac Studio. Though the Mac Pro might still be the most expandable in Apple’s lineup, that’s in large part due to the incorporation of internal PCI slots that some users might need. But they may be of limited use based on a dearth of available compatible hardware. I say all of this not to argue that the Mac Pro should disappear, but simply to point out that it is the longest of long tails, a category of product that dates back decades and may never fully disappear, but still fundamentally represents the way computers used to be. For a company that prides itself on relentlessly pushing forward, Apple still can’t quite seem to let go of the past.",

    "description": "Macworld If you’re in the market for a 13-series iPhone, you’ve come to the right place. This article offers a summary of the best deals and promotions offered by popular retailers to help you get the best deal.  It’s been a long time since you could only get an iPhone directly from Apple or from AT\u0026T. Today, they are offered by all major carriers and big retailers, and many of them want to entice you to buy with them by offering special deals. Of course, you can still buy from Apple directly, either in-store or online, but you can probably find a lower price elsewhere. That’s particularly relevant if you’re looking at devices that Apple itself no longer sells. The company discontinued the iPhone 13 Pro when the 14-series handsets came out in fall 2022, dropped the 13 mini in fall 2023, and finally killed off the standard iPhone 13 in fall 2024. If you want to buy a 13-series iPhone, you’ll need to shop around other retailers. But luckily we’re here to guide you to the best deals available across the entire market.

If Apple had carried on selling them, they would probably have seen price cuts in 2022, 2023 and 2024, but we’ll never know exactly how generous those cuts would have been. The best we can do when evaluating third-party deals is look at the launch prices from 2021 and demand a significant drop to take into account the passage of time. Then again, a full two years after they were discontinued, stock of these models is likely to be extremely scarce.

The Apple Refurbished Store can be the most expensive place to buy refurbished handsets, however, so you may want to try the following resellers instead: U.S. BackMarket Best Buy Refurb.me Gazelle Reboxed U.K. Music Magpie (U.K.) Envirofone (U.K.) Reboxed (U.K.) 4Gadgets (U.K.) Smartfone Store (U.K.)",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html",
    "description": "Macworld Beta testers have been exploring the features in iOS 18 for some time now, having raced to install the beta on their iPhones as soon as it became available. Testing the beta of iOS 18 gave testers a glimpse of what was to come in iOS 18 and bragging rights when it came to exploring the new features. But running a beta can have more risks than benefits, and if it messes up your phone. Now iOS 18 is out beta testers may decide to move on from the bugs and enjoy the tried and tested features. Luckily switching from the iOS 18 beta to the full version of iOS 18 is a lot easier than before the new software launches. Unfortunately, the process of downgrading from the iOS 18 beta to iOS 17 isn’t as simple. We’ll detail both methods below. If the buggy beta of iOS 18 becomes more trouble than it is worth here’s how to remove it and install the full version of iOS 18, or to revert back to iOS 17 if you’ve had enough of iOS 18 for now. How easy this process is depends at what stage of the beta testing phase you are. We’ll start with downgrading the beta of iOS 18 to iOS 17, before discussing removing iOS 18 beta to install the final version and leaving the beta program. How to switch from iOS 18 beta to iOS 18 Now iOS 18 is here it is easy to update to that from the beta. Here’s how: Go to Settings. Go to General on your iPhone. Tap on Beta Updates and switch it to Off. Tap Back. If you have the beta installed you will see iOS 18.0 is up to date, however, at the bottom of the screen you will also see Also Available iOS 18.0. Tap Update Now. Screenshot Screenshot Foundry Screenshot Foundry Foundry You will find more information below on how to leave the beta program and stop getting beta updates, which you may want to do now the full version has arrived. We run through How to downgrade an iPhone to an older version of iOS in a separate story. How to stop getting iOS Beta updates The final version of iOS 18 has arrived, but Apple will continue to issue beta updates as it works on new features. Now that your iPhone has a stable release of a shiny new operating system, you might not want to keep up with the betas anymore. It is easy to stop getting beta updates and just use the final version. If you want to stop getting Beta updates you only need to turn off Beta Updates so that you don’t receive them on your device. Open Settings. Tap on General. Tap on Software Update. Tap on Beta Updates. Tap on Off. Tap on Back. Now you’ll only receive software updates when Apple pushes them to the general public, roughly once every six weeks. You can still see that there is a beta update, but your iPhone won’t volunteer to download them unless you switch Beta Updates back on by following the steps above. How to leave the beta program If you want no part of the iOS beta program you can remove your device from it. That way you won’t be able to see any Beta updates, and won’t be tempted to install them. To leave the iOS beta program, follow these steps on your iPhone: Remove your device from the iOS beta program. Sign in. Click Leave Program. If you ever decide you want back into the beta program–like when the iOS 19 public beta arrives, for instance, you can head over to the Apple Beta Software Program site and re-enroll your device. Read more about how to be a beta tester here: How to join Apple’s beta program and try out new software. How to downgrade from iOS 18 beta to iOS 17 During the pre-release testing of iOS 18 beta downgrading from the iOS 18 beta to iOS 17 required you to completely wipe your iPhone and then reinstall iOS 17. If you just wipe your iPhone and restart it will still be running the iOS 18 beta. This is what developers needed to do to revert to iOS 17 from iOS 18 beta – and what will eventually be required to revert from iOS 19 beta to iOS 18: 1. Restore the iPhone and reinstall the pre-beta iOS via the Finder Foundry Generally downgrading from the beta and installing a full version of iOS should be easy enough and the stops below will work. In the early stages of the beta you may find that the software is too buggy though, in which case you may have better luck if you restore your iPhone to factory settings first – as per the steps further down this article. Download the correct version of iOS for your iPhone from IPSW.me. It needs to still be signed by Apple, so you will only be able to choose the current full version of iOS. Open the Finder on your Mac. (Or iTunes on a PC). Plug in your iPhone. If you haven’t done so, you will need to turn off Find My on your device. Go to Settings and click on your ID information. Tap Find My \u003e Find My iPhone and switch the slider to off. Enter your Apple ID password. Hold down the Option/Alt key and click on Restore iPhone. This should allow you to select the version of iOS you wish to install on the iPhone from your downloads folder, locate it and click on Open. A message will appear saying which version of iOS you will install. Click to confirm this and wait while your iPhone is restored. Your iPhone will be set up as a new device, so you will either need to get your hands on a backup or sync the data you want on your iPhone, we’ll explain what to do next below. 2. Restore your iPhone using an iCloud backup Foundry Now you have wiped your iPhone and reinstalled the non-beta version of iOS, you can get on with the process of recovering it from a backup prior to your beta adventure if you have one. Note that if the backup was made since the beta was installed you will reinstall the beta at this stage! You may be able to locate and use an older backup or a backup from a different device – check which version of iOS the backup is in by tapping on it. If you don’t have a usable backup you may still have a fair amount of your data available to you if you use services like iCloud Photo, Messages in iCloud and iTunes Match or Apple Music. Our How to back up an iPhone or iPad tutorial runs through what is and isn’t included in the backup. Swipe up from the Welcome screen on your iPhone. Tap on your language and select your country or region. Click on Set Up Manually. Work through the various steps until you get to the Transfer Your Apps \u0026 Data screen and tap on From iCloud Backup. Log into your Apple ID and wait while your device signs in. Now choose an iCloud backup from before you downloaded the beta. Click on Show More Backups to find an older one if you don’t see it. Unsure, tap on the device to see which version of iOS the backup was made in. Wait while the Restore from iCloud takes place, which could take a while. 3. If that doesn’t work, wipe the iPhone using Recovery Mode first Foundry If the straightforward method above doesn’t work, in order to reinstall iOS 17 on your iPhone after you have been running the iOS 18 beta you may need to restore your iPhone to factory settings using Recovery Mode. To do this you will need to use the Finder on a Mac (or iTunes on a PC). Plug your iPhone into the Mac (or PC). You will need to put your iPhone into Recovery Mode. To do so press the up volume and down volume in quick succession, then the side button but keep pressing the side button until you see the image above of a cable and laptop (expect it to take a while). Once your iPhone is in Recovery Mode, on your Mac or PC click on Restore, but at the same time press the Option/Alt key. This will allow you to locate the version of iOS 17 you just downloaded from IPSW.me, as per the steps above. Wait while your iPhone is wiped and the older version of iOS is installed. How to remove a Beta Profile Prior to iOS 16.3, the process for removing an iOS beta was different. Head over to the Settings app. Tap General. Tap on VPN \u0026 Device Management. Select the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears. Tap Remove Profile. Enter your device password. Tap Remove a second time to confirm. The iPhone will now need to restart.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Losing Steve affected me more than it probably should have, given that I never met him or had any correspondence with him. But losing him was devastating — not just to my world, but the world. He was a sort of virtual father figure: I was always hoping that maybe Steve would notice something I did. We all wanted his attention and approval, and that drove us to do better work — even those of us who never worked at Apple. Nobody replaced him in this role. Nobody can. But as an outsider who had no personal relationship with him to mourn, it has been most depressing to consider how much of his work the world missed out on. He wasn’t taken from us after a long, complete life — he was taken in his prime. He had so much more to offer the world.",

    "description": "After the dust settles from the developer class-action settlement, the South Korean law, the JFTC announcement, and the Apple v. Epic decision, I think the most likely long-term outcome isn’t very different from the status quo — and that’s a good thing. Allowing external purchases Here’s what I think we’ll end up with: Apple will still require apps to use their IAP system for any qualifying purchases that occur in the apps themselves. All app types will be allowed to link out to a browser for other purchase methods. Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods.1 Only “Reader apps” will be exempt from this requirement.2 Apple will have many rules regarding the display, descriptions, and behavior of external purchases, many of which will be unpublished and ever-changing. App Review will be extremely harsh, inconsistent, capricious, petty, and punitive with their enforcement.3 Apple won’t require price-matching between IAP and external purchases. These few but important corrections reduce Apple’s worst behavior and should relieve most regulatory pressure. The result won’t look much different than the status quo: Most big media apps (qualifying as “reader” apps) won’t offer IAP, but will finally be allowed to link to their websites from their apps and offer purchases there. Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children (commissions from which have been the largest portion of Apple’s “services revenue” to date). Most importantly, many products, services, and business models will become possible that previously weren’t, leading to more apps, more competition, and more money going to more places. External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP (especially if Apple Pay is permitted in this context), and payment processors will reduce the burden of manual credit-card entry with shared credentials available across multiple apps. The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won’t happen, in part because App Review will prevent most obvious cases, but also because parents don’t typically offer their credit cards to untrustworthy children; and for buyers of all ages, most credit cards themselves provide stronger fraud prevention and easier recourse from unwanted charges than the App Store ever has. No side-loading I don’t expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I’m relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS. When evaluating such ideas, I merely ask myself: “What would Facebook do?” Facebook owns four of the top ten apps in the world. If side-loading became possible, Facebook could remove Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger from Apple’s App Store, requiring customers to install these extremely popular apps directly from Facebook via side-loading. And everyone would. Most people use a Facebook-owned app not because it’s a good app, but because it’s a means to an important end in their life. Social pressure, family pressure, and network lock-in prevent most users from seeking meaningful alternatives. People would jump through a few hoops if they had to. Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world. Technical limitations of the OS would prevent the most egregious abuses, but there’s a lot they could still do. We don’t need to do much imagining — they already have attempted multiple hacks, workarounds, privacy invasions, and other unscrupulous and technically invasive behavior with their apps over time to surveil user behavior outside of their app and stay running longer in the background than users intend or expect. The OS could evolve over time to reduce some of these vulnerabilities, but technical measures alone cannot address all of them. Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook’s apps would become even more monstrous than they already are. As a user and a fan of iOS, I don’t want any part of that. No alternative app stores Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store. Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger could all be available exclusively there. The majority of iOS users in the world would soon install it, and Facebook would start using leverage in other areas — apps’ social accounts, stats packages, app-install ads, ad-attribution requirements — to heavily incentivize (and likely strong-arm) a huge number of developers to offer their apps in the Facebook App Store, likely in addition to Apple’s. Maybe I’d be required to add the Facebook SDK to my app in order to be in their store, which they would then use to surveil my users. Maybe I’d need to buy app-install ads to show up in search there at all. Maybe I’d need to pay Facebook to “promote” each app update to reach more than a tiny percentage of my existing customers. And Facebook wouldn’t even be the only app store likely to become a large player on iOS. Amazon would almost certainly bring their garbage “Appstore” to iOS, but at least that one probably wouldn’t go anywhere. Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app and further marginalizing native apps when they’re already hurting. Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps. Running your own store means you can promote all of your own apps as much as you want. What giant corporation would resist? Don’t forget games! Epic and Steam would come to iOS with their own game stores. Maybe Microsoft and Nintendo, too. Maybe you’d need to install seven different app stores on your iPhone just to get the apps and games you already use — and all without App Review to keep them in check. Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews. As a user, a multiple-app-store world sounds like an annoying mess; as a developer, it terrifies me. Apple’s App Store is the devil we know. The most viable alternatives that would crop up would be far worse. Course correction The way Apple runs its business isn’t perfect, but it’s also not a democracy. I loved this part of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision in Apple v. Epic, as quoted by Ben Thompson’s excellent article that you should read: Apple has not offered any justification for the actions other than to argue entitlement. Where its actions harm competition and result in supracompetitive pricing and profits, Apple is wrong. I interpret “entitlement” without a negative connotation here — Apple is entitled to run their platform mostly as they wish, with governmental interference only warranted to fix market-scale issues that harm large segments of commerce or society. As a developer, I’d love to see more changes to Apple’s control over iOS. But it’s hard to make larger changes without potentially harming much of what makes iOS great for both users and developers. Judge Gonzalez Rogers got it right: we needed a minor course correction to address the most egregiously anticompetitive behavior, but most of the way Apple runs iOS is best left to Apple. If the South Korean law holds, IAP may not be required — but only in South Korea. With this exception, I expect the rest of these rules to be enforced the same way globally. ↩︎ Apple defines “reader” apps as “[allowing] a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video).” This includes many apps that Apple’s services compete with, such as Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle, that raise anticompetitive concerns among regulators and legislators when forced to give Apple 30%. ↩︎ App Review has higher-level queues for managerial review of controversial rules or edge cases, typically identifiable from the outside by an app stuck with “In Review” status for days or weeks, and often ending in a phone call from “Bill”. I’d expect any app offering external purchases to have a very high chance of being escalated to a slower, more pain-in-the-ass review process, possibly causing it not to be worthwhile for most small developers to deal with. I have no plans to add external purchases to Overcast for multiple reasons, including this — but mostly because, for my purposes, I’m satisfied with Apple’s IAP system. ↩︎",

    "description": "Apple’s leaders continue to deny developers of two obvious truths: That our apps provide substantial value to iOS beyond the purchase commissions collected by Apple. That any portion of our customers came to our apps from our own marketing or reputation, rather than the App Store. For Apple to continue to deny these is dishonest, factually wrong, and extremely insulting — not only to our efforts, but to the intelligence of all Apple developers and customers. This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%, or the prohibition of other payment systems, or the rules against telling our customers about our websites, or Apple’s many other restrictions. (Not today, at least.) It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work. *     *     * It isn’t the App Store’s responsibility to the rest of Apple to “pay its way” by leveraging hefty fees on certain types of transactions. Modern society has come to rely so heavily on mobile apps that any phone manufacturer must ensure that such a healthy ecosystem exists as table stakes for anyone to buy their phones. Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today. If Apple wishes to continue advancing bizarre corporate-accounting arguments, the massive profits from the hardware business are what therefore truly “pay the way” of the App Store, public APIs, developer tools, and other app-development resources, just as the hardware profits must fund the development of Apple’s own hardware, software, and services that make the iPhone appeal to customers. The forced App Store commissions, annual developer fees, and App Store Search Ads income are all just gravy. The “way” is already paid by the hardware — but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip. And that’s just business. Apple’s a lot of things, and “generous” isn’t one. But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting. *     *     * Apple further extends the value argument, and defends their justification for forced commissions, by claiming responsibility for and ownership of the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use. This argument only makes sense — and even then, only somewhat — when apps are installed by a customer browsing the App Store, finding an app they hadn’t previously heard of, and choosing to install it based on App Store influence alone. But in the common case — and for most app installations, the much more common case — of searching for a specific app by name or following a link or ad based on its developer’s own marketing or reputation, Apple has served no meaningful role in the customer acquisition and “deserves” nothing more from the transaction than what a CDN and commodity credit-card processor would charge. The idea that the App Store is responsible for most customers of any reasonably well-known app is a fantasy. It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS — it’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. For Apple to continue to claim otherwise is beyond insulting, and borders on delusion. *     *     * At WWDC next week, these same people are going to try to tell us a different story. They’re going to tell us how amazing we are, how important our work is, and how much they value us. And for thousands of Apple employees who’ve made the great products and platforms that we love, including the hundreds of engineers presenting the sessions and working the labs, it’ll be genuine and true. But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how much they value our work. Please forgive some sloppiness in my metaphors or phrasing — my writing skills are pretty rusty — and I’ll return the favor to anyone who responds.",

    "description": "A summary of today’s changes to 3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods: Your app must use Apple’s in-app-purchase (IAP) system for all purchases made in the app. Unless they’re purchases for goods or services that are consumed outside the app, in which case you are prohibited from using IAP. Unless those goods or services consumed outside the app are magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, in which case, you are required to use IAP. But if your app only “reads” previously purchased magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, and doesn’t mention the possibility of purchases anywhere in the app, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless you offer account creation, in which case, you are required to use IAP. Unless you only offer free account creation, in which case, you don’t need to use IAP. But if you offer paid upgrades from free accounts within the app, you are required to use IAP. Except for accounts that were created outside the app, which can offer paid account upgrades and don’t need to use IAP. If you’re selling “experiences” between people, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless those “experiences” include three or more people, or aren’t consumed live, in which case, you are required to use only IAP. If your purchase is for services, features, or game items, you are required to use only IAP. Unless you operate on multiple platforms, in which case, you can also offer purchasing outside the app. But you can’t tell anyone about it. Unless you get their contact info somewhere else, in which case, you can tell them about it, but not in the app. You are required to use IAP even if you sell your app or service directly to other people. Unless you only sell it to businesses or groups for their employees or students to use, in which case, you still must use IAP, but you can include your own payment method as well. Unless those groups are families, or unless those employees or students are somehow “consumers”, in which case, you must only use IAP. Do I have that right? *     *     * How about an alternative that’s clear, fair, reasonable, and consistently enforceable? Apps may offer other payment mechanisms in their app, as long as terms are clear and customers aren’t misled, and may or may not choose to implement in-app purchase based on its merits. In one stroke, antitrust and regulatory pressure disappear, developer relations are significantly repaired, and Apple can go back to spending its time, resources, PR, and political capital on making their products better and customers happier.",

    "title": "Introducing Voice Boost 2: Remaster your podcasts",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/31/voiceboost2",
    "description": "The latest update to Overcast includes a feature that I’m especially proud of that took over a year to build. Voice Boost 2 is an all-new audio engine that includes professional-grade, mastering-quality loudness normalization. When I first introduced Overcast in 2014, Voice Boost was one of its headlining features: Voice Boost is a combination of dynamic compression and equalization that can make many shows more listenable and normalize volume across all shows. This makes amateur-produced podcasts (including many of my favorites) more listenable in loud environments, like cars, where you’d otherwise need to crank the volume so loudly to hear the quiet parts that you’d blow your ears out when the loudest person spoke. Voice Boost 2 achieves the same goal as the original Voice Boost, but with dramatically more sophisticated methods, leading to more consistent results and much better sound quality. Goals When I wrote the original Voice Boost with only a rudimentary understanding of audio processing, it was a single configuration of Apple’s AudioUnits that applied a fixed set of parameters to all podcasts, regardless of their audio characteristics. It was an effective but blunt tool, relying on aggressive level compression and a strong EQ to make the compression less noticeable. Since then, I’ve edited over 500 podcasts, learned a lot more about how to master them properly, and developed a much better understanding of audio signal processing. I set out to develop a better, smarter, and more refined Voice Boost that took advantage of everything I’d learned, with these audio goals: The effect should be much more subtle: mostly just consistent volume, plus slightly smoother tone. It should analyze the input audio and apply just enough processing to achieve a consistent volume level, modifying already-good audio as little as possible. It should sound good, and consistent, regardless of the volume dynamics of its input. Quality should be so good that I can even play high-quality music through it1 and not notice any artifacts. And these technical goals: Like Smart Speed and the original Voice Boost, it had to work as a streaming process, easily toggled on and off at will, without needing to scan the entire file first or look very far ahead. The code had to be pure C, with highly optimized and vectorized code, so it wouldn’t be a major power drain on older phones and could potentially run on much lower-power devices as well. I had to write every component from scratch, without using AudioUnits, because I wanted to understand and control everything, ensure the highest performance and sound quality, and avoid Apple’s platform-specific API limits.2 It had to be modular and easily customizable, like a channel strip in an audio editor, so I could adjust the processing during development and testing, offer user customization down the road, and use the same engine to build myself a modular podcast-preproduction tool to save time in my weekly workflow (which I’ve been using for over a year).3 Live LUFS normalization Since Voice Boost is mostly about high-quality volume analysis and loudness normalization, I went straight to the top, implementing the ITU BS.1770–4 standard that gives us the LUFS measurement seen in high-end audio editors. Overcast now measures and adjusts podcast levels using this broadcast-standard perceptual loudness algorithm, at full quality, with no preprocessing. Voice Boost 2 normalizes all podcasts to –14 LUFS — a level I chose because it closely matches the volume of Siri and most iOS turn-by-turn navigation voices, so when you’re listening to a podcast while driving, navigation interruptions are less jarring. Most professionally produced podcasts are already mastered to similar volume levels, so Voice Boost 2 won’t overcompress them with aggressive processing — it’ll only apply as much correction as necessary to make them all the same volume. A brief tutorial on clipping and distortion This is about to get nerdier, but bear with me. (Yes, nerdier than ITU broadcast-loudness standards.) Given a loudness measurement for the incoming audio, quieter podcasts need to be amplified to reach the target. But perceived loudness isn’t the peak of the incoming audio stream — it’s more of an average. Quiet-sounding audio can still have brief moments of loud peaks. When increasing the volume of digital audio, the biggest challenge is not “clipping” during the peaks — not having any part of the signal pass above the volume ceiling of 0 dB. (It’s a negative scale. This is also why the LUFS value above, which is closely related to the decibel scale used here, is negative.) Here’s the highest the signal should go, showing the individual audio samples (green dots) that can be processed by a podcast app before the DAC transforms them into audio (smooth green line): It’ll sound right as long as the audio doesn’t cross above that top line (0 dB). Increase the volume even slightly too far, and some of the samples just slam into it and stay there, losing the tops of their smooth curves: And that sounds terrible. But I can’t just cap all the samples right below the limit and call it a day — that’s called a brickwall limiter — because then the shape of the audio line will actually represent different frequencies, telling the DAC to add noise that wasn’t really there. Here, the bottom of each image shows the frequency breakdown: The unclipped signal (left) shows only its original frequency of about 2100 Hz, but a basic brickwall limiter (right) results in the unwanted introduction of a bunch of extra frequencies. That’s distortion. (If this is interesting to you, learn more about audio sampling theory here.) Lookahead limiter Avoiding audible distortion requires a lookahead limiter, which looks… ahead (😎) at the audio coming down the pipeline, and smoothly ramps the volume amplification down as a loud peak is approaching, then back up again afterward, just enough to avoid clipping and audible distortion, but so quickly that you don’t notice.4 After Voice Boost 2’s complete 32-bit audio processing pipeline, the last stage is a lookahead limiter, configured such that it can’t clip, no matter what audio comes through. This gives vast flexibility in volume processing without sacrificing quality. Voice Boost 2 also incorporates a dynamics compressor, but over time, I’ve kept reducing its strength as I’ve found it less necessary. Proper LUFS processing with a great lookahead limiter provides excellent volume normalization with almost no compression needed afterward. True-peak detection There’s one more way to introduce clipping that needs to be guarded against. Digital audio is represented by samples that represent a point in time (green dots, again) on a sound wave (green line). But the sampled points don’t always land at the exact peaks of those waves: The most common way to measure the peak of a waveform is to find the greatest absolute sample value. By this method, the top waveform peaks here would measure about –6 dB and –1.5 dB, respectively. But the actual peak amplitudes of these waves is –1 dB! A simple limiter could still output clipped audio because it’s not seeing the true peaks. Voice Boost 2’s limiter performs true-peak detection, rather than simply measuring sample peaks, to avoid this type of clipping and further reduce distortion. Mastering-quality processing for everyone Voice Boost 2 is a mastering-quality audio-processing pipeline that applies broadcast-standard loudness normalization, light compression and EQ, and a true-peak lookahead limiter to your podcasts, in real time, without sacrificing quality or battery life. And it runs at less than 1% CPU usage on an iPhone SE.5 I intend to expose some of its customizability to customers in future updates, but I wanted to develop and ship the best default settings first to keep the app simple and usable to everyone. Now that it’s available to everyone, I may still subtly tweak the defaults in response to feedback. But as I’ve refined the settings during the beta period to be more universal, less customization has been necessary.6 Having achieved its goals of being more consistent and less aggressive, Voice Boost 2 is intentionally transparent. It’s not promoted more in the app or even labeled “Voice Boost 2”. It’s still Voice Boost — just better now. If I did my job well, you’ll hardly notice it at all. You’ll have no idea that your podcasts are being remastered in your pocket. But I’ll know. And the handful of you who really care will know. And that’s enough for me. Voice Boost 2 is in today’s update (2020.1), along with these new features: AirPlay 2: Overcast can now play to HomePods and other AirPlay 2 devices much more responsively, with full-blown Smart Speed and Voice Boost, on iOS 13.1 and above.7 Skip intros/outros: There’s a new per-podcast setting to skip a given number of seconds from the start and/or end of its episodes. Clip-sharing from private feeds. In retrospect, this restriction was unnecessary, so I lifted it. Restored iOS 12 compatibility. Going 13-only so soon was a mistake. Hear why on Under The Radar 181 and 183. As usual, all of this is free for everyone in Overcast. Those awesome Trey Anastasio acoustic shows are pretty quiet. ↩︎ Apple doesn’t make all of their audio APIs available on all platforms: some are Mac-only and never came to iOS, and watchOS has an even smaller subset than iOS. The more I can accomplish in my own code, the less I depend on Apple’s choices for which APIs they make available to developers. ↩︎ It’s just a command-line tool for now. You don’t want it. (But if you do… someday, maybe.) ↩︎ This all happens in milliseconds. ↩︎ At 1X, with Smart Speed enabled. Smart Speed was actually entirely rewritten as part of Voice Boost 2, but it’s less interesting. It performs the same job as before, but much more efficiently, and taking advantage of the measured loudness when Voice Boost is also enabled. ↩︎ For instance, I also built a de-esser into Voice Boost 2, but it slowly became unnecessary as I improved the other processing, so it’s not currently enabled. ↩︎ Smart Speed is a big deal here, I think — I’m not aware of any other podcast apps with silence-skipping over AirPlay 2. (Or LUFS normalization, or true-peak lookahead limiters.) ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode for Mac laptops: making the case again",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux",
    "description": "In light of today’s rumor that a Pro Mode may be coming that seems to offer benefits in the opposite direction,1 I wanted to re-make the case for a Low Power Mode on macOS — and explain why now is the time. Modern hardware constantly pushes thermal and power limits, trying to strike a balance that minimizes noise and heat while maximizing performance and battery life. Software also plays a role, trying to keep everything background-updated, content-indexed, and photo-analyzed so it’s ready for us when we want it, but not so aggressively that we notice any cost to performance or battery life. Apple’s customers don’t usually have control over these balances, and they’re usually fixed at design time with little opportunity to adapt to changing circumstances or customer priorities. The sole exception, Low Power Mode on iOS, seems to be a huge hit: by offering a single toggle that chooses a different balance, people are able to greatly extend their battery life when they know they’ll need it.2 Mac laptops need Low Power Mode, too. I believe so strongly in its potential because I’ve been using it on my laptops (in a way) for years, and it’s fantastic. I’ve been disabling Intel Turbo Boost on my laptops with Turbo Boost Switcher Pro most of the time since 2015. In 2018, I first argued for Low Power Mode on macOS with a list of possible tweaks, concluding that disabling Turbo Boost was still the best bang-for-the-buck tweak to improve battery life without a noticeable performance cost in most tasks.3 Recently, as Intel has crammed more cores and higher clocks into smaller form factors and pushed thermal limits to new extremes, the gains have become even more significant. Here’s some thermal testing from my 8-core 16-inch MacBook Pro: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 16-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2019, 2.4 GHz 8-core i9)   Power Temp. Geekbench 5 single/multi xcodebuild Normal 82W 90°C 1260/7386 39 sec. No Turbo 31W−62% 65°C 669/5206−46/29% 62 sec.+59% With Turbo Boost disabled, peak CPU power consumption drops by 62%, with a correspondingly huge reduction in temperature. This has two massive benefits: The fans never audibly spin up. When Turbo Boost is enabled, the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load. Disable it, and it’s almost impossible to get them to be audible. It runs significantly cooler. Turbo Boost lets laptops get too hot to comfortably hold in your lap, and so much heat radiates out that it can make hands sweaty. Disable it, and the laptop only gets moderately warm, not hot, and hands stay comfortably dry. I haven’t done formal battery testing on the 16-inch, since it’s so difficult and time-consuming to do in a controlled way that’s actually useful to people, but anecdotally, I’m seeing similar battery gains by disabling Turbo Boost that I’ve seen with previous laptops: significantly longer battery life that I’d estimate to be between 30–50%. This comes at a cost to performance, but: It’s not noticeable on most workloads. Parallel workloads are affected far less than single-threaded tasks, and most modern heavy workloads are parallelized. This is an 8-core laptop that’s competitive with my iMac Pro! It’s much faster than most people need (myself included) most of the time, so I can spare some performance to get other benefits. A fast laptop isn’t very useful if your hands are too sweaty to type, the battery dies in the middle of a flight, or the loud fans ruin your audio recording. When I really want to maximize performance, Turbo Boost Switcher Pro lets me quickly toggle it in the menu bar, so switching between modes is easy. The vast majority of the time I’m using it, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a much better laptop with Turbo Boost disabled. It’s still fast enough to do everything I need (including significant development with Xcode), while remaining silent and cool, with incredible battery life. But soon, I bet I won’t be able to do this anymore. Turbo Boost Switcher Pro relies on a kernel extension that’s grandfathered into Apple’s latest security requirements, but it can never be updated — and when macOS Catalina loads it for the first time, it warns that it’ll be “incompatible with a future version of macOS.” I suspect that this is the last year I’ll get to run the latest OS and be able to turn off Turbo Boost at will, making all of my future laptop usage significantly worse. Please, Apple, make this feature official: give us a Low Power Mode for macOS that disables Turbo Boost to keep our laptops cool, quiet, and long-lasting at times when those are more important to us than speed. My guess is that “Pro Mode” doesn’t raise the peak performance, but instead raises the fan speeds to allow longer sustained operation at high Turbo Boost speeds. ↩︎ Low Power Mode has been so successful on iOS that Apple also thought it worthwhile to add a Low Data Mode to iOS 13, offering similar control over data usage. (Mac owners can get similar functionality with the excellent TripMode.) ↩︎ As I wrote back then, disabling discrete GPUs and Photos analysis are other obvious contributors to a good Mac Low Power Mode. ↩︎",

    "title": "The 16-inch MacBook Pro",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16",
    "description": "After my first day with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, I’m very optimistic about it. 🎧  Hear more on today’s Accidental Tech Podcast! Two years ago, I wrote a wishlist to fix the MacBook Pro, and the 16-inch doesn’t actually deliver most of it. But time and technological progress are slowly getting Apple off the hook: The ports are unchanged. We’ll still need dongles. But USB-C is gradually becoming more common, and dongles are slowly — very slowly — getting less shitty. The Touch Bar isn’t optional. But a new hardware Esc key removes one of its biggest drawbacks, and accidental input should be reduced by the increased spacing between the Touch Bar and the top row of keys. The power brick still lacks its previous conveniences. There’s still no cable management, safety breakaway, or charging LED. But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps. The headphone jack is still on the right (wrong) side, despite most single-sided headphone cables entering the left earcup. But the need for wired headphones is decreasing over time. Addressing those would be nice, but as I wrote then, they paled in comparison to one huge issue: the butterfly keyboard. The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches. If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro, it should be this. It’s far more important than anything else on this list. […] The Magic Keyboard’s scissor switches feel similar, but with a bit more travel, and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations. […] The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro: returning to the “inverted-T” arrow-key arrangement by making the left- and right-arrow keys half-height again. This arrangement is much more natural and less error-prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the “T” shape, a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row. That’s exactly what they’ve done, and I couldn’t be happier. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a great computer in most other ways, but so were the MacBook Pros from the last few years. They were fast, powerful, capable workstations… but the butterfly keyboard took away from it all. Not anymore. I’m on cloud nine. Look at this glorious keyboard! An Esc key! Inverted-T arrow keys! A millimeter of key travel! Enough spacing between the keys for our fingers to accurately orient themselves! And keystrokes will probably work, 100% of the time, for years! Five years ago, nobody would’ve considered any of these noteworthy, and readers would’ve suspected you weren’t of sound mind if you included them in a review. Five years ago, laptop keyboards were fine. Everyone was pretty much satisfied with the ones they had, they worked, and we never had to talk or think about them. Today, finally, we begin heading back to that world. The butterfly keyboard was an anomaly — it was a huge departure from everything else we’d ever used, mostly not in good ways. The new keyboard is very similar to the recent desktop Magic Keyboard, and I expect it to have a wide appeal, just as the Magic Keyboard does. It has slightly less travel and spacing, but the overall feeling is very similar — and it’s nothing at all like the butterfly keyboard. I absolutely love it — not because it’s the most amazing keyboard in the world, but because it’s completely forgettable in the best possible way. It just feels normal again. There’s a lot more to love about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The screen and battery are bigger, but the size and weight barely increased. It’s almost as fast as my iMac Pro, and the new thermals can sustain higher performance. The speakers and microphone got huge, unexpected improvements. And I didn’t get everything I wanted. But many of my wishlist items fall outside of what Apple is likely to ever do, and all of them are much less important than making the computer’s primary input device functional, acceptable, and reliable. Now we have the luxury of being able to complain about less-urgent wishes. The biggest change is that I finally don’t feel like it’s constantly fighting me. Its design doesn’t feel spiteful. It’s a computer that doesn’t seem to hate being a computer. I’m not afraid to use it in the world, and I’m not avoiding using it because it’s unpleasant. The butterfly keyboard was the opposite, it never got better, I never got used to it, and good riddance to it. Following in the footsteps of the fantastic iMac Pro, updated Mac Mini, and upcoming Mac Pro, the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro ends a painful chapter of neglect and hubristic design of the Mac. Apple has finally turned the ship around. We haven’t had long enough to fully test it yet. There may be flaws or shortcomings discovered over time — there usually are (and always have been). But frankly, it could catch fire twice a week and it would still be my favorite laptop Apple has made since 2015. Fortunately, upon initial usage, nothing bad really jumps out. The new MacBook Pro has no massive asterisks or qualifications. It’s a great computer, period, and it feels so good to be able to say that again. For the first time in years, without any major exceptions, we can see that Apple loves computers as much as we do. 🎧  Much more detail and discussion in the podcast!",

    "title": "Overcast summer update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/07/21/overcast-summer-update",
    "description": "Today’s Overcast update (2019.6) brings some great new features. But first, I need to set low expectations for iOS 13, watchOS 6, and macOS Catalina updates this fall. Halfway through the summer, I’ve made much less progress than expected, having been overwhelmed by the required OS changes, my own technical and design debts, and unusually rough betas. Rather than shipping a big iOS update, a standalone Watch app, and a Mac app on day one, these will probably come incrementally over the next year. Fortunately, I haven’t stopped improving the app in the meantime. Per-podcast customization, longer clips You can now set download-vs.-stream and auto-delete behavior per podcast, one of the most frequently requested features over the last few years. (Sorry it took so long — it required a lot of server-side work for uninteresting reasons.) I’ve also raised the clip-sharing length limit to 90 seconds. When I debuted this feature, I had to guess how it would be used and received, and 60 seconds seemed like a good limit. In practice, that’s sometimes a bit too short to capture a complete thought. 90 seconds should be better — most clips won’t need to be that long, but it’ll be nice to have the headroom when you need it. “Suggestions for You” replacing Twitter Overcast has had a Twitter-powered social-recommendations feature since version 1.0 in 2014, which made sense at the time: I didn’t have any popularity data to generate recommendations from, and social networks were nicer places to be than they are today. But after five years, only 10% of active users have connected a Twitter account in Overcast, and only 0.2% of new podcast subscriptions have actually been added via Twitter recommendations. Not only was the feature not providing much value to the 10% of people who enabled it, but the other 90% of Overcast’s customers haven’t been getting personalized recommendations at all. In the meantime, I’ve accumulated five years of popularity data, so I tried writing my own recommendation engine. It worked — and it’s better. Overcast now offers its own data-driven recommendation engine, and I’ve removed Twitter integration entirely. Podcasts in the new “Suggestions for You” section of the Add Podcast screen are based on the shows you subscribe to, and what else their subscribers subscribe to, which gives much better recommendations without involving any social networks. Most importantly, it works for all of Overcast’s customers. *     *     * As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Give it a try.",

    "description": "Something big changed at Apple around the beginning of 2017. They had encountered significant turbulence in the product line over the preceding years, especially Macs. It was a rough time to be a pro Mac user. The “trash can” 2013 Mac Pro addressed only a fraction of the needs solved by the previous “cheese grater” towers, aged quickly without critical upgrade paths, and suffered from high GPU-failure rates from its cooling solution — all because its design prioritized size and appearance over performance and versatility in the one Mac model that should never make that tradeoff. Over the next few years, it became clear that the Mac Pro was an embarrassing, outdated flop that Apple seemed to have little intention of ever updating, leaving its customers feeling unheard and abandoned. I think Apple learned a small lesson from it, but they learned a much bigger one a few years later. The current MacBook Pro generation launched in late 2016, and I think Apple was truly caught completely by surprise when the new Touch Bar, sparse USB-C-only port offerings, high prices, and highly polarizing butterfly keyboard were met with harsh criticism, mixed reviews, and high failure rates. This one really hurt: while the Mac Pro is a niche machine for the highest-end and most-specialized needs, the popular MacBook Pro is the lifeblood of the Mac. By the end of 2016, in addition to the generally buggy, neglected state macOS seemed to be perpetually stuck in, Apple had replaced its entire “pro” Mac lineup with controversial, limiting products that seemed optimized to flex Apple’s industrial-design muscles rather than actually addressing their customers’ needs. The only company that can make computers for our OS seemed incapable of making good computers anymore. Each update threatened to remove or break things we needed or loved. Their newest designs felt punitive, rather than feeling like a celebration of computing. Then, in April 2017, out of nowhere, Apple held a Mac Pro roundtable discussion with the press to announce that they were in the early stages of completely redesigning the Mac Pro.1 The follow-up briefing a year later promised that the new Mac Pro would be released in 2019, and publicized the existence of a “Pro Workflow Team” of real pro users working inside Apple to inform the direction of their pro hardware and software. It sounded like they’d gone from not listening to their customers at all to an institutionalized process of listening. And the newly designed Macs released since then have been great.2 The late-2017 iMac Pro, which I’m using to write this, is the best Mac I’ve ever owned by far. It’s versatile, incredibly powerful, beautiful, and silent. It’s so good that I’ll probably never really need a Mac Pro again,3 and if this was the only new “Mac Pro”, I’d be mostly fine with that. The late-2018 Mac Mini replaced a pitiful, punitive, neglected relic with a practical, powerful mini-Mac-Pro. Apple could’ve let it die, or replaced it with a tiny, no-port marvel of uselessness, but instead, they made a computer so good that I started and ended a YouTube mini-career just to review it. And the 2019 Mac Pro, finally unveiled last week, looks to be absolutely killer — it’s the first true successor to the tower Mac Pro, which saw its last real update almost a decade ago in 2010.4 It’s big, bulky, ludicrously fast, and almost obscenely upgradeable — exactly what a Mac Pro needs to be, and far better than any of us expected. The new Mac Pro is, truly, a celebration of computing. Even more importantly than any hardware releases, macOS itself has also seen massive engineering effort recently. For the first time in a decade, the Mac was a major focus of WWDC, with great new APIs poised to usher in a huge wave of fresh software. To be fair, this story hasn’t ended yet. The Mac Pro isn’t actually out yet (and will be very expensive), they still need to resolve the problematic MacBook Pro with its next generation (rumors are promising), and the lack of standalone Apple displays under six thousand dollars really hurts the Mac Pro story.5 But I’m optimistic for the first time in years. It’s hard to tell when Apple is listening. They speak concisely, infrequently, and only when they’re ready, saying absolutely nothing in the meantime, even when we’re all screaming about a product line as if it’s on fire. They make great progress, but often with courageous losses that never get reversed, so an extended silence because we’re stuck with a change forever is indistinguishable from an extended silence because the fix isn’t ready yet. But there has clearly been a major shift in direction for the better since early 2017, and they couldn’t be more clear now: Apple is listening again, they’ve still got it, and the Mac is back. Based on what we’ve learned since, they had likely started the project a very short time before holding the roundtable. ↩︎ I’m excluding the 2018 MacBook Air because it feels like a stopgap that wasn’t originally planned to exist — the no-Touch-Bar 13” MacBook “Escape” seemed intended to replace it — that was rushed into the 2016-era generation mid-cycle, rather than being the first of a new design. Even so, with the large exception of the butterfly keyboard, it’s quite good. ↩︎ This doesn’t necessarily mean I won’t buy one. ↩︎ The 2010/“2012” Mac Pro was so good, and so upgradeable, that it’s still in surprisingly widespread use today for needs that weren’t possible or compelling on the “trashcan” successor. ↩︎ And the MacBook Pro. A very common setup for developers — Apple’s largest identified segment of pro users — is a 15” MacBook Pro connected to an external monitor, for which a good solution no longer exists. Developers would be much better served by a $1,500-ish standalone version of the iMac’s 5K display than a $6,000 XDR reference monitor for professional video colorists. ↩︎",

    "title": "Clip sharing with Overcast",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing",
    "description": "Sharing podcasts has never been easy, but I’ve always tried to lead the way with Overcast, with publicly shareable episode links and optional recommendations from your Twitter friends since version 1.0 in 2014. Podcast sharing has been limited to audio and links, but today’s social networks are more reliant on images and video, especially Instagram. Podcasts need video clips to be shared more easily today. I’ve seen some video clips from tools specific to certain podcast networks or hosts, but they were never available to everyone, or for every show. So people mostly just haven’t shared podcast clips, understandably, because it has been too hard. Not anymore. ▶️ ↩️ This remark on Unco by Stephen Hackett inspired me to finally solve this problem in a way that worked easily, for all podcasts, for both podcasters and listeners to use. With today’s 2019.4 update1, you can now share audio or video clips, up to a minute each, from any public podcast. Simply tap the share button in the upper-right corner. You can generate an audio clip, or portrait, landscape, or square video, using your current Overcast theme setting. In order to help spread podcasts further, I didn’t want to be heavy-handed in the Overcast branding — not everyone wants to advertise for one specific podcast app when promoting their shows. So the “Shared with Overcast” badge is optional, and if you’d like, you can also add an Apple Podcasts badge. Finally, I wanted to extend the same app-agnosticism to Overcast’s share links. While this design still needs a lot of modernization, I’ve done a small refresh: Now, for non-logged-in visitors, Overcast’s public sharing pages display badges for other podcast apps and the RSS feed for any podcast listed in Apple Podcasts. It’s important for me to promote other apps like this, and to make it easy even for other people’s customers to benefit from Overcast’s sharing features, because there are much bigger threats than letting other open-ecosystem podcast apps get a few more users. For podcasting to remain open and free, we must not leave major shortcomings for proprietary, locked-down services to exploit.2 Conversely, the more we strengthen the open podcast ecosystem with content, functionality, and ease of use, the larger the barrier becomes that any walled garden must overcome to be compelling. One of the most common shortcomings we hear is that podcasts are hard to share. Hopefully, Overcast’s new clip-sharing feature changes that, and other apps build similar features soon. So go get Overcast and start sharing your favorite moments. It’ll help me, of course, but more importantly, it’ll help your favorite shows gain listeners, and it’ll strengthen the amazing, open, standards-based world of podcasting. Like Slopes and Castro, I’ve changed to a date-based version-numbering scheme — 2019.4 is the fourth update released in 2019, the next version will be 2019.5, and so on — partly because version numbers don’t really matter anymore, but mostly because I no longer wanted to delay completed features until a major-version change or worry that I didn’t do enough to justify a certain number. ↩︎ YouTube was able to dominate video because it made everything easy in a medium that (at the time) was very hard to do elsewhere. If a proprietary service takes a very hard aspect of podcasting and makes it very easy, it may rapidly rise to prominence. Other major shortcomings I’m concerned about: the difficulty of getting sponsorships for small shows (“AdSense for podcasts”), and the complexity of creation and publishing (“Tumblr for podcasts”). This is probably why Spotify bought Anchor. ↩︎",

    "description": "▶️ The first thing someone does in a podcast app is add some podcasts, and most active Overcast users add at least two new podcasts each month. Over 80% of podcasts are added to Overcast by searching, with the vast majority as searches for a specific podcast by name (rather than searching for generic keywords, such as “business”). Good search is a critical, differentiating feature of any podcast app. I’m not satisfied if the podcast you’re looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list — I want it to be the first one, displayed quickly, after typing the fewest characters possible. I’ve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data. Instant Search is the next step in Overcast’s search evolution. It combines a small local cache with a highly optimized search service to give the most relevant results immediately as you type, even after only a single letter.1 It’s a dramatic, delightful improvement to a critical, frequently used feature. This was a lot of fun to build, and I’m proud of it. See for yourself! Overcast is free on the App Store. If Instant Search isn’t instant right after you update, the cache hasn’t fully downloaded yet. It’s downloaded weekly, only on Wi-Fi, and is less than 5 MB. ↩︎",

Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made. And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility. I don’t think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following four years that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard. Not anymore. The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and it’s spectacular. It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age. Ports! Glorious ports! Number one — and this is a big one these days, especially for this product — is that it’s not any less useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.2 It’s the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who don’t want it to get fewer ports or worse performance. The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs can’t with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.) The base price has increased to $800, and that’s not great. It’s partly justifiable because it’s much higher-end than before — the processors are much better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard — but it’s still an expensive product in absolute terms. Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review — 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD — which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This would’ve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when it’s specced up like this, it’s targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable. And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception. Benchmarks The big story to me is how incredibly fast this thing is. Granted, I’m testing the fastest CPU offered, but damn. Geekbench results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than every other Mac today (!) at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro. “Performance-competitive with pro Macs” was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are. As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years, Apple has found other ways to improve performance. The T2 is great for lots of security reasons — I wouldn’t buy a new Mac these days without it — but what you’re seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller. This Mac Mini builds my app, Overcast, much faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, it’s not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time — it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory — but the result is that it’s incredibly fast as a development machine. The Blackmagick Disk Speed Test shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date, and a huge improvement over the four-year-old Mac Mini. A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with ffmpeg. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both. But if an app supports the T2’s hardware HEVC encoder,3 it can go much faster. And since every T2 so far performs identically, all T2 machines — from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro — encode HEVC this way at the same speed, and all in complete silence because they’re barely touching the CPU. I wasn’t able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with x265 and the T2’s hardware acceleration. The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. It’s fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, you’re better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup. Many Mac lines rely on Intel’s integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs. We often blame Intel’s CPU roadmap (or Apple’s seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intel’s GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intel’s fault, but it’s Apple’s problem — and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers. But that’s it — aside from price, that’s the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome. If you don’t need a strong GPU — and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases don’t — this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and it’s more like a mini-Mac Pro. A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing Gruber’s format: It’s silent at idle. The i7’s fan noise does become clearly audible when it’s under heavy load: it’s in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter. Interestingly, I disabled Turbo Boost to simulate the base i3 model’s thermals, and couldn’t get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3. This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still don’t have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isn’t.) You can upgrade the RAM again! I never would’ve guessed this was coming, and I believe it’s the first time in a long time that an Apple product’s direct successor became more upgradeable and serviceable. I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, it’s back. (The security screws inside — TR6? — still need some iFixit tools to get past.) I Can’t Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Can’t Even Say “Again” Because It Never Was A new Mac Mini could’ve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive — a similar pattern to Apple’s other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops. Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect — a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better. We didn’t know until now whether the iMac Pro’s greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that they’re going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year. The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again. Of course, with Apple’s track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or it’s the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we’ll all be hoarding them in a few years. We can’t know yet. But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer. I do this via iSCSI, but I wouldn’t recommend it. It breaks and requires a new $200+ iSCSI initiator with almost every macOS update — which is why my Mac Mini still runs Sierra. In the near future, I’ll just directly attach some giant external hard drives to the Mac Mini and stop using the NAS. ↩︎ Unless you used optical audio, audio input, or the SD-card reader. (Shit, I use optical in and out.) ↩︎ ffmpeg can do it by specifying -c:v hevc_videotoolbox instead of -c:v x265. I also needed -vtag hvc1 for the output MP4s with either codec to be playable on macOS. Compressor uses the T2’s HEVC acceleration when encoding 8-bit HEVC, but not 10-bit. ↩︎",

If that took you a bit longer than usual to tell the time on the Apple Watch’s new default Infograph face, you’re not alone: John Gruber finds it “far too busy” Jason Snell finds it “pretty and packed with features”, but misses hour numerals Zac Hall removes almost everything to improve legibility David Smith wrote his own complications (!) to improve contrast I’ve configured mine acceptably, but Utility is still far more legible for telling the time at a quick glance: Infograph, Utility Infograph suffers from two major issues: The center complications reduce the contrast between the dial and hands, often making the hands hard to locate. This is avoidable with customization, although the defaults should be much more conservative. It takes too much cognitive effort (and therefore time) to distinguish the current hour. This is simply a flawed design. It’s faster and easier to read analog time with the 1–12 numerals displayed on a watch, but many people prefer the cleaner look of a watch that uses lines, dots, or other shapes as hour markers instead. (Watch people call these “indices”.) And it’s absolutely possible to design a highly legible dial with hour indices in many different styles. Here are some classics and modern takes:1 Across a wide variety of brands, styles, and price points, a few key design principles are clear: The hour markers for 12 (and often 3/6/9) are more prominent. The hour indices are much larger than the minute markings. The hour hands nearly touch the hour indices. These all improve legibility by making it as fast and easy as possible to know which hour is being indicated (and minimize the chance of an off-by-one error), first by orienting your eyes to the current rotation with the 12 marker, then by minimizing the distance between the hour hand and the indices it’s between. Apple Watch’s analog faces all fail to achieve these principles:2 Color, Simple, Explorer Color, Simple, and Explorer have easily distinguished hour markers, but Explorer’s are a bit too far from its hour hand. None of them have distinguished 12 markers to aid in orientation. While Explorer omits minute markings altogether, Simple bafflingly uses 30-second markings in place of its minute track, making time-telling even harder. I’ve never seen another watch with sub-minute markings identical to its minute markings. Activity Analog, Utility, and Infograph without most complications Activity Analog’s hour markers are faint and far from its hour hand, and the central activity rings quickly eliminate the hands’ contrast against the dial as they progress. Utility (when configured without numbers) improves legibility slightly with its bold hour indices, but they’re still too small and too far from its hour hand, and there’s no differentiation for the 12 index. Infograph is similar, but even worse: its hour indices are more faint, it uses 30-second markings instead of minute markings, and its default Calendar display wipes out the top three indices. (At least you can tell which way is up.) Even with almost no complications, the basic essence of the Infograph dial has poor time legibility. When it’s being used as Apple seems to intend, time-telling at a glance is so difficult that many people have actually suggested setting the digital time as the center complication, at which point the hands are just a nuisance and we should stop pretending it’s an analog face. It’s great for Apple to offer a wide variety of Apple Watch faces, but most of them are short-lived novelties at best. We’re three years and four generations into the Apple Watch, and almost every Watch owner I know still uses the same handful of “good” faces. If you want digital time with a good deal of complications, Modular is your only good choice (or Infograph Modular on the Series 4).3 If you want analog time with numerals, Utility is the only good option. If you want indices instead of numerals — probably the most popular analog watch style in the world — I don’t think there is a good option. By now, we’ve seen Apple’s design range that they’re willing to ship as Watch faces, and while it seems broad at first glance, it’s actually pretty narrow. And we’re restricted to the handful of good watch faces that Apple makes, because other developers aren’t allowed to make custom Watch faces. The Apple Watch is an amazing feat of technology. It’s a computer. It can display anything. With no mechanical or physical limitations to hold us back, any watch-face design from anyone could plausibly be built, enabling a range of creativity, style, and usefulness that no single company could ever design on its own. But they won’t let us. In a time when personal expression and innovation in watch fashion should be booming, they’re instead being eroded, as everyone in the room is increasingly wearing the same watch with the same two faces. Open this door, Apple. You can even see which model the Apple Watch’s hand shape comes from, which is not a coincidence. ↩︎ For Apple Watch faces offering multiple hour/minute styles, I selected the best one that didn’t have hour numerals, and most complications were disabled. ↩︎ Special shout-out to my favorite digital face, Solar. ↩︎",

    "description": "\u003c!-- .screenshot1 { border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width: 95%; } .screenshot3 { border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width: 30%; margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%; } small { opacity: 0.5; } p.screenshots { margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; } --\u003e I apologize for the low battery level. Busy day. It all started with the watchOS volume widget. You see, Overcast’s previous Apple Watch app really sucked. I did my best with the capabilities of watchOS 1–4, but I couldn’t give people what they really wanted: Standalone podcast playback on the Apple Watch without an iPhone. I briefly offered it through some bad hacks, but had to remove it. Volume control on the Watch, which is increasingly important with the popularity of AirPods. That’s why I nearly jumped for joy during the watchOS 5 announcement in June, when Apple unveiled most of my list of watchOS changes needed to make good podcast apps. After a very busy summer, standalone Apple Watch playback is back in Overcast, and it’s actually good this time! It’s not perfect: No cellular. Apple hasn’t released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS, and the bad ways wouldn’t be very useful. Sending podcasts to the Watch is slow. Overcast shrinks them to reduce the transfer time, but when (and how quickly) podcasts transfer is tightly controlled by watchOS to preserve battery life. Transfers still sometimes wait forever or silently fail. Programmers like me can’t accept that something is just slow, so I’ve decided to make transfer speed irrelevant. Nobody cares how slowly podcasts transfer if it happens while they’re asleep! Auto-Sync to Watch automatically tries to send your most recent podcasts to your Apple Watch whenever it gets a chance.1 You can still send episodes manually from the queue button on an episode (≡+), but in my testing, I never needed to. Just pick up your Watch and go, and it’ll already have plenty of podcasts for your outing, all without having to manually sync anything or wait for slow transfers. The Overcast 5.0.1 update, due out in a few days, makes Watch transfers even more reliable. (Sorry. Found a better way after 5.0 was approved.) And Watch-crown volume control! Finally, the best way to use Overcast from your Apple Watch isn’t to delete it, letting the Now Playing app show up instead. That’s where the other half of my summer workload began. The watchOS volume widget offers minimal customization: just the color of the circle. I couldn’t make the line width a little narrower to match the rest of Overcast’s thin-line aesthetic. But that iOS 7-era thin-line aesthetic looked dated, and I’d wanted a design refresh for a while. I decided to start modernizing the app’s design, screen by screen. I couldn’t do it all in one summer, so I started with the screen that needed the most help: Now Playing. The previous Now Playing screen in Overcast 4. The biggest problem of the previous design was the center artwork area, a scrollable set of “pages” that had speed and effects controls offscreen to the left, and the episode notes offscreen to the right. Nobody ever found them. I’ve been getting emails almost every day from people asking where the speed controls were because they set them once and couldn’t find them again, or saying how they’d really like my app more if it offered speed controls. The only indication in the interface was three “page dots” below the scrollable area, but that wasn’t enough. The new design maintains the same scrollable pages, but now as obvious, tactile cards. In my testing, everyone figured these out immediately. Put differently, it’s like you’re navigating this through a phone-shaped window in the middle: This design is not only more discoverable, but it allows me to fit more controls on screen, and in more reachable areas. Unlike the previous design, I can also fit the same controls on all devices, from the iPhone SE to the iPad Pro. Designing a good Now Playing screen for a music or podcast app that’s nice, clean, and highly discoverable is incredibly difficult. I think I’ve finally found a good balance. I’ve given chapters (when present) their own card with durations and inline progress bars. I’ve also finally revamped the sleep timer to ditch the ugly alert sheet, give it a proper UI for fast input, and show the remaining time in more useful ways: There are lots of other improvements throughout the app as well. Some of the highlights: Search your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen, or go into a podcast’s screen to search its entire archive. Refreshed the podcast screen a little. (More to come.) Siri Shortcuts support, of course. Plus smaller fixes and improvements: CarPlay performance is much better, especially for people with large collections. Podcasts now display their estimated release frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) if it can be inferred. Tap-to-load on images now loads all images from the same domain at once. Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements. Overcast 5 requires iOS 12 and watchOS 5, and as always, it’s free. Update your devices, then go get Overcast! Up to 20 episodes are auto-synced today. This number will change as I refine the balance of resource usage. Auto-Sync to Watch is on by default and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode on the Mac",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode",
    "description": "Laptop battery life is decreasingly relevant to me as more airplanes offer power outlets. But sometimes you lose that lottery, as I did on my latest 8-hour daytime flight. Apple’s “Up to 10 hours” claim doesn’t apply to my work,1 which is usually a mix of Xcode, web browsing, and social time-wasting, so I knew I’d have to seriously conserve power. Sometimes, you just need Low Power Mode: the switch added to iOS a few years ago to conserve battery life when you need it, at the expense of full performance and background tasks. There’s no such feature on Mac laptops, but there should be. It could: Disable the discrete GPU on 15-inch models unless required for hardware reasons2 Pause Photos syncing and analysis Pause Spotlight indexing Reduce the frequency of Time Machine backups Don’t download or install software updates Don’t download new content in iTunes Auto-dim the screen after a shorter time Let third-party apps detect Low Power Mode and reduce their background operations to only essential work And the big one: Reduce the processor’s maximum wattage or disable Turbo Boost Back in 2015, I experimented with disabling Turbo Boost and discovered that it reduced performance by about a third, but also boosted battery life by almost as much. Since then, I’ve been running Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to automatically disable Turbo Boost when I’m running on battery power, and it has been wonderful: I made it through that 8-hour flight only because Turbo Boost was off. Over the last few days, I’ve run battery tests on my 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro with the (awesome) 2.7 GHz i7 and my 2015 2.2 GHz 15-inch3 to see how far I could push the battery life using Volta, which can disable Turbo Boost and/or set wattage limits on the CPU. My test was based on the “Heavy” script from last time, but using xcodebuild every few minutes with Overcast’s current codebase (which is larger and includes some Swift). Improvements are in green and performance reductions are in red: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:36 3963/13864 43.9s No Turbo 5:06+42% 2796/9917−29/28% 63.4s+44% 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro (2.7 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:09 5412/18983 34.3s 28W 3:28+10% 5401/16326−0/14% 37.4s+9% 18W 4:05+29% 5248/14133−3/26% 43.5s+27% 12W 4:44+50% 4818/11835−11/38% 48.2s+41% No Turbo 5:05+61% 3624/13324−33/30% 48.9s+43% 6W 6:24+103% 4065/7596−25/60% 76.1s+121% It’s impressive how much faster this new 13-inch model is than the best laptop ever made due to significant CPU and SSD improvements. Dropping the wattage to 6W, the thermal limit of the fanless 12-inch MacBook, interestingly (but not surprisingly) makes it perform effectively identically to the best 12-inch MacBook in Geekbench. This is an extreme option, but one I’d occasionally take if offered. It roughly doubles compilation times, but also doubles the battery life. This ratio holds for most other configurations: the gain in battery life is about as large as the loss in heavy-workload performance. That’s a trade-off I’d gladly make when I need to maximize runtime. The best bang-for-the-buck option is still to just disable Turbo Boost. Single-threaded performance hurts more than with wattage-limiting, but it’s able to maintain better multi-threaded performance and more consistent thermals, and gets a larger battery gain relative to its performance loss. And Volta, which offers both wattage limits and Turbo disabling, requires disabling System Integrity Protection to install an unsigned kernel extension, which I really don’t recommend. Turbo Boost Switcher, which doesn’t offer wattage control, works with SIP using a signed extension and its Pro version has more convenient features for automatic toggling. For now, I’m going to continue to happily run Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to selectively give myself better battery life, and I recommend it for anyone else with the same need. But what I ultimately want is for a true Low Power Mode built into macOS that could provide this sort of CPU throttling and software changes, which would ultimately achieve even greater gains. Whose work does get 10 hours out of a MacBook Pro? None of the use-cases on the marketing page — Photography, Coding, Video Editing, 3D Graphics, and Gaming — are likely to achieve even half of that in practice. ↩︎ I’ve heard that 15-inch models are wired such that the discrete GPU is required when external displays are connected. Otherwise, whether it’s used or not is a software decision, and gfxCardStatus can override it in certain conditions. ↩︎ It’s not brand new, so it’s not a perfect comparison, but the battery only had 90 cycles before this test. ↩︎",

    "title": "Overcast 4.2: The privacy update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42",
    "description": "Overcast 4.2 is out now. It enhances privacy in two major areas: Anonymous sync by default Overcast has offered anonymous sync accounts since 2014. They’re fully functional, but they lack email addresses or passwords, so they can’t log into the website. A login token is stored in iCloud so the account can be accessed after a restore or upgrade, or from other devices you own. Previously, the login screen pushed email logins. But with four years of perspective, feedback, and usage data, I now think that’s the wrong move. Only a single-digit percentage of customers use the website, and the iCloud token-sync method solves cross-device logins for almost everyone. Your personal data isn’t my business — it’s a liability. I want as little as possible. I don’t even log IP addresses anymore. If I don’t need your email address, I really don’t want it. 68% of Overcast accounts have email addresses today. To reduce that as much as possible, I’ve made major changes to account handling: The previous login screen (left) and the new one. In Overcast 4.2, the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default. If you already have an account in iCloud, it’ll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it. And the first time you launch 4.2, people with email-based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts: The migration prompt that shows on the first run. Finally, you can now change your account between email-based and anonymous whenever you want. Blocking ad-tracking images In most podcast apps, podcasts are downloaded automatically in the background. The only data sent to a podcast’s publisher about you or your behavior is your IP address and the app’s name. The IP address lets them derive your approximate region, but not much else. They don’t know exactly who you are, whether you listened, when you listened, how far you listened, or whether you skipped certain parts. Some large podcast producers are trying very hard to change that. I’m not. Big data ruined the web, and I’m not going to help bring it to podcasts. Publishers already get enough from Apple to inform ad rates and make content decisions — they don’t need more data from my customers. Podcasting has thrived, grown, and made tons of money for tons of people under the current model for over a decade. We already have all the data we need. One of the ways publishers try to get around the limitations of the current model is by embedding remote images or invisible “tracking pixels” in each episode’s HTML show notes. When displayed in most apps, the images are automatically loaded from an analytics server, which can then record and track more information about you. In Overcast 4.2, much like Mail (and for the same reason), remote images don’t load by default. A tappable placeholder shows you where each image will load from, and you can decide whether to load it or not. I believe I’ve done this in the most secure way possible — I’m actually displaying the show notes using a strict Content Security Policy — and I would love to hear from anyone who finds a way to inject auto-loading remote images or execute arbitrary JavaScript in show notes. Bug fixes Overcast 4.2 also includes a bunch of minor fixes, and two big ones: Fixed the major slowdowns and high battery usage that resulted from extremely large podcast artwork. Password-protected episodes are now supported on password-protected feeds. Get it now in the App Store!",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/03/13/overcast41",
    "description": "Overcast 4.1 is now in the App Store with some small but nice new features. Smart Resume is actually two features: It jumps back by up to a few seconds after having been paused to help remind you of the conversation. It slightly adjusts resumes and seeks to fall in the silences between spoken words when reasonably possible. Both are subtle but noticeable benefits (my favorite kind), especially when you’re being interrupted a lot, such as while following turn-by-turn navigation directions. Smart Resume is on by default, and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. Delete episodes 24 hours after completion: Before, episodes could either be auto-deleted immediately upon completion, or not at all. There’s now a third option, auto-deleting 24 hours after completion, which will soon be the default for new accounts. The 24-hour threshold is only enforced after a successful sync, so it won’t auto-delete anything in the middle of an extended offline period, such as a long flight. Auto-deletion, either immediate or after 24 hours, also no longer applies to Premium subscribers’ Uploads. Password-protected podcasts: Some private podcast feeds, including many paid and members-only podcasts, require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth. You can now add these in the Add URL screen. Password-protected podcasts, and other private feeds such as Patreon bonus feeds and anything using the tag, do not show up in search or recommendations. Noteworthy bug fixes: Resuming playback after quitting in the background, especially on very long podcasts and/or when using AirPods, no longer occasionally results in glitchy noises and incorrect durations. Playback under certain conditions no longer stalls, requiring pausing and playing again. Downloads now fail less often. Playback controls no longer disappear occasionally. Smart Speed total savings now appear at the bottom of the Settings screen for locales that use commas as their decimal separator.1 Extremely large playlists now only show the most/least-recent 500 episodes to improve app performance for users with very high subscription counts. There’s also one removal: rotation support on iPhone. (The iPad app still rotates.) iPhone rotation has always been disabled by default, and had been buried in Nitpicky Details for a long time, so very few people have ever used it. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly difficult to support and maintain, especially with the modern complexities of rotation and the dramatically increased workload of supporting the iPhone X in landscape. iPhone rotation has simply proven far too costly to maintain for its extremely low usage, and it had to go to free up more of my time for more highly demanded features. I apologize to the few people who did use it, and I hope this isn’t too disruptive for you. The rest is all good news. Go get Overcast now! In the next update, I’ll be addressing the biggest design failure of Overcast 4: the non-discoverability of the Effects and Notes pages in the Now Playing screen. Expect the return of an ancient user-interface tool known as “buttons”. This was Overcast’s oldest known bug, which had been there since 1.0: some users, mostly in central Europe, wouldn’t see Smart Speed totals. It turned out to be one of the most interesting and obscure bugs I’ve seen. The total-time-saved value is stored on-device as it accumulates, then gets sent to the server to be combined with any listening you do on other devices. The overall total is read back from the server, and the local total is reset, on each sync. I was using an NSNumberFormatter to read the total value from Overcast’s server as a double. My server always sends values with U.S.-style number formatting, using a period as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234.5”). But by default, NSNumberFormatter uses the device’s locale, so in countries that use a comma as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234,5”), it was interpreting the server’s numbers with periods as invalid and returning zero. So the Settings screen thought they hadn’t saved any time, and hid the time-saved label. Fortunately, it was an easy fix: setting that NSNumberFormatter locale to en_US to match what the server was sending. And since the accumulated local totals were still being sent and added properly, the correct historical data is there — it just wasn’t being displayed correctly. ↩︎",
