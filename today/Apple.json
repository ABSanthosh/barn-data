    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

We’ll be updating the content below, so stay tuned for the best Amazon Prime Day Apple Watch deals! Amazon’s Prime Day sales event (which lasts two days, not just one!) is a fantastic opportunity to find a good deal on the Apple Watch, so if you were wondering if the Apple Watch will be on sale for Prime Day, wonder no more! We are seeing some great discounts on the Apple Watch for the Prime Day sale, which runs from Tuesday, October 8 to midnight on October 9. Here at Macworld, we know more than most about Apple’s range of products, and we can spot a bargain too, having compiled regular Apple deals roundups for years. We’re not likely to be fooled by the usual tricks, such as prices being raised just before a sales event so the discounts look bigger. We’ll make sure to steer you to the genuinely worthwhile deals. The Apple Watch models picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks.

    "description": "Macworld Wondering if AirPods will be on sale for Amazon’s October Prime Big Deal Days? Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or upgrading the trusty ‘buds you have used every day for years, Amazon’s big yearly Prime Day sale is a great time to look for a discount. Many Apple products are rarely on sale, and when they do go on sale they’re barely at a discount at all. AirPods are an exception: As long as they’re not a just-released model, they’re almost always available at a discount from the official retail price. And when big sales events come around, like Prime Day or Black Friday, you can often save 25 percent or more. Amazon is one of the best places to look for AirPods deals, and we are already seeing some excellent discounts during the Prime Day event which runs from October 8 to midnight on October 9. We’ll keep this article updated throughout Prime Day so you can quickly find the best deal. The AirPods picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/334296/the-best-iphone-for-kids.html",
    "description": "Macworld Let’s face it: Kids want iPhones. Their favorite celebrities use them, their parents use them, and some of their friends have them, too. But which iPhone is best for your kid? There are lots of factors to consider, not the least of which is the age of the child in question. When should a child be given their own iPhone? We’ll discuss that in a section below. For toddlers who need a simple device for watching parent-approved videos and playing some games or educational apps, we recommend avoiding iPhones altogether and getting a basic iPad. It’s affordable, you don’t have to worry about cellular connectivity, and the large size is easy for toddlers still working on their fine motor skills. You can check out our best iPad for kids guide to see if this would be a better fit for your child, and we recommend a look at our best iPad deals roundup so you can get the best prices. But, once a child gets old enough for phone connectivity to be useful (for mobile internet, texting friends, tracking and being contactable by you), it’s time to step up to a proper iPhone. Apple has just updated the iPhone for 2024, introducing the iPhone 16 series and reducing the prices of the current handsets. How does that change the landscape for the best iPhone for kids? Read on to find out and see our recommendations. Whatever iPhone you get, you should consider using Screen Time to manage their use. Built into iOS, Screen Time lets you set limits on how long your kid can use their phone, what apps they can download and use, and when they need to put it down for the night. It’s a great way for busy parents to keep tabs on what their kids are doing when they’re not within eyeshot, and ought to be the first thing you set up. Best iPhone for kids Below you will find our top choices for iPhones for children. We aren’t recommending the ultimate iPhones because we think that unless you have a money tree in the garden you won’t want to be spending a whole lot of money on a phone for a child who is just as likely to leave it on a bus or drop it. But if you’d like a wider range of iPhones to choose from read our iPhone buying guide and our iPhone comparison. Apple iPhone 14: Best iPhone for older kids Pros Price Display size Good battery life Decent camera Cons Older processor Price When Reviewed: £599 (was £699) Best Prices Today: $629 at Apple$829 at Visible Older kids (young teens and high school students) have demanding standards. An iPhone SE may serve them well, but that smaller screen is a little archaic and they’re going to want to look cool in front of their friends. More importantly, photo-taking and social media have started to become an important part of their social life. So if you’re willing to spend more on an iPhone with a more capable camera, Face ID, and a full-screen display, we recommend looking no further than the iPhone 14. With a 6.1-inch display, it’s considerably bigger than the iPhone SE, which older kids will appreciate, and it has a more modern design and features. The iPhone 14 will deliver, with battery life that will easily last a full day. You might be wondering why we picked the iPhone 14 over the iPhones 15 and 16. It’s cheaper, which is a good enough reason. But we also think that the iPhone 14 compares very favorably with the iPhone 15. Sure, you’re giving up some of the newer features, such as improvements to the camera, or the iPhone 15’s USB-C port instead of Lightning. The iPhone 14 still has a faster chips and excellent battery life. The iPhone 14 starts at $599/£599 for 128GB, you pay another $100/£100 for the iPhone 15 and yet another $100/£100 for the iPhone 16. Since your 9th grader is probably going to fill up the memory quickly making TikTok videos and taking selfies and pics for social media and texting with friends, we’d suggest that if you do have a bigger budget that the extra money is spent on increasing the storage in the iPhone 14 rather than the bells and whistles of the newer models. Read our full Apple iPhone 14 review Apple iPhone SE (2022): Best iPhone for younger kids Pros Price Small size Durability Cons No Face ID Older, less modern, design Price When Reviewed: $429 (64GB) | $479 (128GB) | $579 (256GB) Best Prices Today: $429 at Amazon$429 at Apple$429 at Apple United States If you have a kid at grade school/elementary/primary school who’s mature enough to handle their own phone, you should look no further than the iPhone SE. It’s got the same A15 processor used in the iPhone 13 range, so you know it’s going to perform well and get software updates for years. With a 4.7-inch screen, it’s also pretty small, which is good for younger kids’ hands and pockets. It’s a more than serviceable iPhone, and there’s really nothing your kid may want to do that they won’t be able to, outside of using features like Memoji or Animoji, which require the TrueDepth camera found in the Face ID-equipped higher-end iPhones. The best part is that it’s inexpensive (for an iPhone) at $429/£449, although that is for the 64GB version, which could fill up quickly if the child in question wants to download plenty of games and content to watch. Stepping up to the 128GB version ($479/£499) can alleviate this, but the price does start to creep up. Still, cutting back on features like the all-screen Liquid Retina display and dual cameras, and sporting Touch ID instead of Face ID saves a lot of cost, so the SE will still be cheaper than all the other iPhones. And since young kids tend to be rough on stuff, even with a good case and screen protector (which are highly recommended), you’re not going to want to risk putting a $700 phone in their hands. In truth, we don’t really recommend the iPhone SE (2022) for adults (although it can be ideal for the elderly), as in modern terms it seems a bit dated and limited, but for a kid’s first step into the Apple world it would be a great choice. Read our full Apple iPhone SE (2022) review Apple iPhone 16 (128GB): For kids who want everything Pros Latest iPhone Huge improvement in battery life Supports macro and spatial photography and video recording Cons Pricey Price When Reviewed: $799 Best Prices Today: $799 at Apple$829.99 at Best Buy There is of course a certain status that you can only get from having the latest iPhone, and kids certainly aren’t immune to that. There are a lot more reasons to buy the iPhone 16 than there were for the iPhone 15 in 2023, including the new Camera Control button and an improved camera that’s capable of taking macro and spatial photos. That might be handy if your child is often working on projects and wants to expand their artistic eye for the pictures they take. Perhaps the biggest change for 2024 though, is the huge improvement in battery life. In our tests, we saw a four-hour boost in battery life for the iPhone 16 over the iPhone 15. That’s a drastic improvement. Kids are never aware of the amount of battery their phone uses, so the iPhone 16’s battery life gives them even less to think about. We also recommend getting a case, see Best iPhone 16 cases. Read our full Apple iPhone 16 review iPhone 15: Best iPhone for kids who want higher-quality photos and video Pros 48MP sensor in the camera Cons iPhone 16 offers much better battery life Price When Reviewed: From $699 (Was $799) Best Prices Today: $729 at Apple$729.99 at Best Buy While the iPhone 16 is a better overall phone, the iPhone 15 is no slouch. It has a better camera than the iPhone 14, shooting at higher resolution to provide better quality. It also records excellent video that kids can use in presentations or social media. The main drawback to the iPhone 15 is its battery life–it’s actually very good but the iPhone 16 offers a dramatic improvement. But otherwise, the iPhone 15 is a top performer and can handle anything you child wants to do on it, including streaming videos, games, and a lot more. Read our full Apple iPhone 15 review iPhone 13 mini – Best value iPhone for kids Pros Fantastic size Lightweight Great cameras Cons Discontinued by Apple so harder to find Battery life isn’t amazing Price When Reviewed: Was $599 Best Prices Today: $643.07 at Walmart$729 at Amazon Apple has discontinued the iPhone 13 mini, but if you can get hold of one it is an excellent choice for youngsters with a small frame that is perfect for small hands. The device shares most of the attributes of its bigger brother the iPhone 13, including the processor and twin rear cameras. Somehow the engineers at Apple still managed to fit a 5.4-inch display into a device that’s smaller than the iPhone SE. One thing to bear in mind is that the smaller nature of the mini means that battery life can be a little lacking. So, if you’re expecting your kid to be on it all the time, especially when out and about, we’d suggest maybe picking up a portable power bank to top up the battery if things get low. As the iPhone 13 mini supports MagSage, you can choose one from our roundup of the best MagSafe portable battery packs and power banks. Read our full Apple iPhone 13 mini review Buy a refurbished iPhone Before you buy one of the phones mentioned above our advice is to explore the second-hand and refurbished market. Buying a second-hand or refurbished iPhone can save you a lot of money. Your first port of call should be Apple’s Refurbished store where Apple sells iPhones that have either been returned as faulty or unwanted. These iPhones (and other products) are fixed up so they are good as new and sold at around 15% off their normal price. There are various benefits to buying from Apple’s Refurbished Store in the U.S. or U.K., including the fact that all products in the Refurbished Store come with a one-year warranty. You may even be able to find an older iPhone model that Apple doesn’t sell anymore, such as the iPhone 12 mini or an iPhone 13 Pro in Apple’s refurbished store. But Apple’s not the only place that sells refurbished iPhones though; there are plenty of companies that make a living from refurbishing and selling iPhones. Check out our where to buy second-hand and refurbished iPhones guide for more details. musicMagpie musicMagpie musicMagpie There is a growing marketplace for older devices that are fixed up and sold on. Before you buy from one of these do check their policies regarding refurbishment and returns, and also we’d advise buying recent models of iPhones – some of these outlets have much older models. Consult How long does Apple support iPhones for more information about the handsets to avoid.

The Big Phone Store: Says it ensures refurb phones “are thoroughly tested, repaired, and cleaned before being sent out.” Backs this with a 12-month warranty. Laptops Direct: You get a 12-month warranty on parts and labor. Watch out for slightly confusing grading system: “A3,” for example, means “Average condition.” Back Market: You get 30 days to change your mind and a 12-month warranty… or occasionally more. Companies like musicMagpie (UK), Decluttr (US), Amazon and eBay are all now providing this service, along with one-year warranties and money-back guarantees if you’re not completely satisfied with your purchase. Of course, investing in older tech is also better for the environment, as it stops the iPhones from being thrown into landfills even though they are capable of providing years more service to a happy kid. So, they come with guarantees, save you money, and protect the planet. What’s not to love? Pass on an old iPhone to them Another route to explore is handing over your current iPhone and buying yourself a new one! If you’ve had yours for a while, then it may be out of its contract period, but if you bought it outright then all you need to do is get a new SIM card for your youngster, give them your handset, then head off to the Apple store to give yourself a present for being such a magnanimous parent. If you’re unsure what to treat yourself to, our best iPhone roundup should prove a helpful guide. Before you hand over your old iPhone make sure you set it up correctly for your child. Have a look at 5 things to do before giving an old iPhone or iPad to your kid, how to prepare an iPhone for sale, how to reset an iPhone and how to set up parental controls on iPad \u0026 iPhone. Should kids have iPhones? This is a huge question and a topic fraught with pros and cons. Everyone is different. There are still parents who don’t allow their kids to watch TV, let alone play computer games. Other parents don’t see any harm in letting their kids be familiar with technology. And others just need a few minutes of peace while they push a toddler around a supermarket, or something to stop the tweens fighting in the back of the car on a long journey. Surely allowing the kids a few minutes here and there with a mobile phone won’t damage their development. You could give them your own iPhone of course, but that depends on how prepared you are for the risk of them sending their favorite YouTube video to your manager at work. A better solution may be to give them an old iPhone or iPad: it can still be linked to your account so there is no need to pay for the apps you’ve already downloaded for them. Older kids will no doubt want a handset with a bit of credibility. It’s also at this age that the risks associated with mobile phone ownership become more prominent as concerns about their use of, and influence of, social media become apparent. You will want to familiarise yourself with Parental Controls and ensure that they are really mature enough to handle all that comes with this connection with the world and that they are able to avoid becoming addicted to their handsets. Apple founder Steve Jobs famously limited his kid’s use of technology, so maybe we should take a leaf out of his book. Or maybe we should accept that our kids are growing up in a world so immersed in technology that it is going to be a part of their lives whether we like it or not. We just need to control their access to it, rather than stop it altogether.",

    "description": "Macworld If you’re planning to buy an Apple product for a loved one this Christmas, you may want to start your shopping sooner than usual, because a perfect storm of logistical problems is likely to cause severe delays across the holiday season. In a detailed exploration of the factors, AppleInsider reports that Apple faces “giant challenges” marshalling its supply chain over the coming months. This could mean another delay-stricken Christmas, following problems in 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. As in 2021, multiple factors are combining to give Apple headaches–several of them, we should stress, causing far more serious harm to affected parties than merely slowing the distribution of smartphones. Hurricane Helene, for instance, has caused the closure of a quartz mine which is crucial to Apple’s semiconductor supply. A factory in India has been destroyed by fire, necessitating a shift in manufacturing. Dock workers in the U.S. have gone on strike, and this will have more effect than it would in previous years because of Apple’s push to become carbon neutral and use ocean shipping instead of air where possible. And worldwide economic conditions are uncertain, which could reduce the appetite for new iPhones (and ironically help Apple to cope with demand) but may also hamstring the company’s funding. Just one of these factors would make life difficult over the notoriously demanding holiday shopping period, which Apple’s product launch calendar is built around. But all of them together almost certainly means stock shortages and shipping delays. So it’s probably wise to buy sooner than later if you want an iPhone in time for Christmas.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2476121/subscription-free-microsoft-office-2024-for-mac-is-now-available.html",
    "description": "Macworld Microsoft has released Office 2024, the latest version in its suite of apps that includes Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. While the trend with software is to sell it on a subscription model, Microsoft offers customers the option to make a one-time purchase. Subscribers to Microsoft 365 automatically get the new version. Office 2024 has a new look, with “a more natural and consistent experience.” The new app-specific features include: Excel: Faster performance, new functions to use text and arrays, an IMAGE function to add images without changing formatting, and dynamic arrays in charts that automatically update. OneNote: Full-screen pen-focused view to use the entire screen for inking. Outlook: Search improvements, the ability to automatically check emails for accessibility issues, scheduled email sends, customizable swipe left and right gestures. PowerPoint: Ability to embed a live camera feed into slides, a recording studio for narrations, animation, transitions, and inking. Word: If the app closes unexpectedly, all the open documents that were open automatically reopen upon relaunching the app. Microsoft offers two versions of Office 2024. Office Home 2024 is $150 and includes one Mac license for the “classic” apps, which are Excel, Outlook, PwoerPoint, and Word. It does not include OneNote. The Office Home \u0026 Business 2024 suite is $250 for one Mac license and includes the classic apps as well as OneNote and it “Works with Teams.” For customers interested in buying more than a single Mac license, Microsoft offers Office LTSC 2024 volume licensing plans. Office 2024 runs on macOS Sequoia, Sonoma, and Ventura. It requires a Microsoft account and an internet connection. The Microsoft Office blog announcing Office 2024 does not state if or when the Office apps in Apple’s App Store have been or will be updated to the just-released versions. According to the App Store, the classic apps were updated a week ago with a fix for a sign-in issue.",

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros No storage limit. Comprehensive backups. Private Encryption options Cons Payment per machine Our Verdict Backblaze exists for a very specific purpose, and it does that job brilliantly – just don’t expect to share files with it. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$99 a year Best Prices Today: Backblaze Retailer Price Backblaze (yearly) $99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket When looking at the best cloud-based storage services for your Mac, there’s an important distinction to make. Offerings like OneDrive, Google Drive, and even Apple’s own iCloud Drive offer a cloud-based storage area that can also be used to share files between users, usually with a link to a specific spot. Others, like Backblaze, are a storage service in the strictest term – it takes your data, ferries it off-site, and keeps it under lock and key. It’s not for quickly sharing a document or collaborating on a piece of work, it’s for recovering data you may lose if something happens to your local machine. While you could share a file with Backblaze, doing so requires using Backblaze’s separate B2 Cloud Storage service which, admittedly, comes with flexible, pay-as-you-go options. It’s worth making that distinction because services like iDrive blur the lines a little, but Backblaze exists in a spot where it’s a tool you hope you never need to use, but you’ll be extremely glad to have in your corner. Backblaze defines itself as “backup for peace of mind”, and it’s hard to argue with that. You pay your fee, download the app, and it goes about its business in the background. At $99 per year, it’s pretty affordable, and there’s no storage limit – you can keep backing up and it’ll keep duplicating, and there’s no size limit on individual files. It’s worth noting that that’s $99 per computer, so you’ll be doubling that for two machines, but if you’re using just one machine it’s well worth looking into. You can set your own 2FA options and encryption keys to ensure your data stays secure, too, and the app is so lightweight and undemanding that I’ve not noticed any slowdown as it’s backed up my entire drive. So, while I can’t share my files as easily as I would with a cloud storage solution like Google Drive, my files are safer than they’ve ever been. First Impressions Backblaze recommends continuous backups, and it’s hard to argue. Backblaze recommends continuous backups, and it’s hard to argue.Foundry Backblaze recommends continuous backups, and it’s hard to argue.Foundry Foundry The magic of Backblaze is that it really doesn’t want you to have to open the app itself. Once it’s installed you can set options like backup schedules and a quick, glanceable look at how much you’ve uploaded (split up by file type, which is nifty), but for the most part I appreciate that it just kind of gets on with things. A menu bar item lets you quickly pause your current backup or get a status update on how it’s going, while the app offers three months of version history by default. At the time of writing, you can extend this to 12 months at no extra cost, which is welcome. Backblaze Features Backblaze can give you a look at what kind of files are being backed up. Backblaze can give you a look at what kind of files are being backed up.Foundry Backblaze can give you a look at what kind of files are being backed up.Foundry Foundry Backblaze essentially comes in two apps which are both installed at the same time. The first part is the backup app, which will continually run files to a cloud server as part of its processes. While you can set a schedule for these backups, Backblaze recommends the “Continuously” option which ensures if a meteor hits your Mac, everything you were currently working on will be held somewhere. The other app is the restore side of things, and I’m impressed by the granularity with which you can drill down into its file system. The app offers your backup as a list of nested folders, and you can work your way to whatever you need, or restore the whole thing. You can restore apps to the same place they were before, or dump the regenerated versions anywhere with custom file paths. I deleted a test file from deep within my Mac’s Library, then used the Restore app to drill down and have it restore it to my desktop, and it worked well. Uploads are relatively snappy for the backup side of things, too, keeping pace with similar options, and the option to get your data posted to you as a hard drive if all else fails could be a lifesaver. Backblaze Annoyances There’s a restore option for everyone. There’s a restore option for everyone.Foundry There’s a restore option for everyone.Foundry Foundry Less an annoyance given it’s not necessarily what Backblaze is designed for, but there’s no Finder window integration here, so you’ll be relying on the aforementioned duo of apps. That makes sense, since you can’t quickly ferry data and documents between users like you can with a more straightforward cloud storage app as we mentioned earlier. Should you buy Backblaze? Backblaze is a comprehensive cloud backup solution for anyone dealing with sensitive data that needs to be kept safe. While it operates on a different playing field to the likes of Google Drive, it might just be everything you need.

    "description": "Macworld A second Amazon Prime Day for 2024 is coming, with the Prime Big Deal Days sale now confirmed for October 8-9. We’ll be updating the content below, so stay tuned for the best Amazon Prime Day Apple deals! Everyone’s favorite non-denominational shopping holiday has arrived, again. A second Amazon Prime Day (technically called Prime Big Deals Days) will be held on October 8-9, and even with Black Friday just around the corner, we’re sure to see some excellent prices on Apple gear. The deals will be coming and going quickly, so be sure to bookmark this page so you can keep checking on the latest prices. If you are hoping to find some Apple products on sale on Amazon this Prime Day then look no further. In fact the deals have already started: Here are the best deals on Apple products we’ve found so far on iPads, Apple Watches, Macs, and everything else Apple sells, along with some tips for getting the best bargains: How to get Prime Day discounts Some of these discounts are available to everyone, but many items in the Amazon Prime Day Sale are only open to Prime members, so you’ll need to sign in with an active membership to purchase one of the deals. Prime memberships cost $139 / £95 / AUD$59 annually, or $14.99 / £8.99 / AUD$6.99 every month. New users can sign up for a 30-day free trial that can be canceled at any time during the trial window. You’ll also get free one or two-day delivery and access to Amazon Prime Video and all that content. The products picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. One tip: When you click on a good deal—even if it’s from a Macworld page—check that the product isn’t redirected to a refurbished model and that the current manufacturer’s price is listed, as that can make the price drop look a lot better than it is. And if a product here is sold out, we recommend checking back periodically as Amazon has been known to restock Prime Day deals throughout the sale. Prime Big Deals Days AirPods deals With Apple revamping the AirPods range in September 2024–with the introduction of the AirPods 4 and new colors and USB-C for the AirPods Max–we can expect to see some discounts on the older, now discontinued, models over Prime Day.

    "description": "Macworld Just weeks after the release of the iPhone 16, thoughts are already turning to the more affordable smartphone Apple plans to unveil early next year. In many ways this will be a far more interesting and radical launch. The iPhone SE is updated less frequently than the flagship models at the top of the iPhone range: the three models so far have arrived in 2016, 2020, and 2022, with the 4th-gen SE expected to debut in spring 2025. For this reason, it might be expected that these rarer events would be more substantive, but that wasn’t the case with the 3rd-gen SE, which was, in fact a disappointment. So Apple owes us big for the 4th-gen model–and it might actually deliver. The expectation is that we’re about to get a long-overdue design revamp, away from the iPhone 8 chassis used for the last two models and into something resembling a modern smartphone. Incredibly, it might leap all the way forward to an iPhone 16 shell, according to credible sources. And with the 9th-gen iPad discontinued earlier this year, this would represent the end of the Home button that was once such an iconic element of Apple’s mobile products. It’s been the consensus among pundits for some time that the 4th-gen SE will be a major step forward for the line, but Bloomberg leaker king Mark Gurman adds credibility and some additional detail to the rumors. Basing his pronouncements on the testimony of “people with knowledge of the matter… who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public,” Gurman claims the next model is codenamed V59 and is intended to help Apple compete with low-end Android phones in China. On the design front, Gurman suggests the new SE will use an iPhone 14 rather than an iPhone 16 shell. This would still be a significant step forward from the antiquated iPhone 8 chassis, of course, but would mean the inclusion of a notch: no Dynamic Island for SE buyers, unfortunately. But it did always seem ambitious that the SE would so closely match a flagship phone that will be only six months old when it comes out. Particularly as the 4th-gen SE will support one of the 16-series iPhones’ marquee features: Apple Intelligence. That likely means it will have an A18 processor with 8GB of RAM, one of the requirements for Apple Intelligence. As I’ve written elsewhere, this might just make it the perfect Apple Intelligence device, and it certainly suggests we can expect a state-of-the-art processor and respectable complement of RAM. In the past, the iPhone SE has offered up-to-date tech specs within an older design, and its appeal varied according to the precise age of that design: a chassis that will be 30 months old by next spring feels like a sensible compromise.

Cons No physical trackpad. Virtual trackpad feels a bit awkward. No charging cable included. Our Verdict The virtual trackpad feature isn’t entirely successful, but the Fusion Keyboard gets the basics right, with a firm, comfortable keyboard and cover at a competitive price. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$160 (currently reduced to $119.90) 11-inch iPad Pro; $175 (currently reduced to $139.90) 12.9-inch iPad Pro Best Prices Today: Mokibo Fusion Keyboard For iPad Pro Retailer Price Mokibo $119.90 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket There are several versions of Mokibo’s Fusion keyboard available, including one that’s designed for Windows and Android devices, but it also makes a couple of models that are specifically designed for use with iPads. The company’s website refers to these as the Fusion Keyboard For iPad Pro 11-inch and 12.9-inch, but they may also work with other models as well – for instance, the 12.9-inch Fusion Keyboard that we review here seemed to fit my new 13-inch iPad Air with no problems. Unfortunately, the information on Mokibo’s website is often vague and unclear, so you should pay close attention to the compatibility list that is provided for each version of the keyboard. A good example is the fact that the iPad version of the Fusion Keyboard acts as both a keyboard and a wrap-around cover – something that is barely mentioned in the product description. That’s a shame, as the Fusion Keyboard is actually well designed, and certainly more affordable than many rival keyboards from companies such as Logitech and Apple itself. Read our roundup of the best keyboards for iPad. It’s currently only available with U.S. or Korean keyboard layouts, and the models shown on Mokibo’s website are only in black, although the company tells us that there’s a white model coming soon as well. The 12.9-inch model that we tested weighs 665g (or 495g for the 11-inch model) and measures just 9.4mm thick when the case is folded over the keyboard, although that will be thicker when your iPad is inside the case. It’s sturdily built, despite the relatively low price, and the outer layers of the keyboard and case are made of a polyurethane-based artificial leather that feels soft and smooth, and is easy to wipe off if you spill your coffee. Unlike some iPad keyboards that draw power from the iPad itself, the Fusion Keyboard has its own built-in battery that lasts for around 60 hours on a fuill charge (although there’s no charging cable included, so you’ll need to provide that yourself). There’s no physical trackpad, but that leaves room for a spacious keyboard, with large keys that feel firm and responsive when typing. There’s a large space bar as well – although this is split into two parts, with a Smart button sitting in the middle, which can be used to perform a mouse-click. There’s also a row of Function keys running along the top of the keyboard, with controls such as a Home key, volume adjustment and F7 for taking screenshots. It’s also possible to pair the Fusion Keyboard with up to three different devices, and there’s a Function key that can be used to switch between operating systems – including macOS, iPadOS, Windows and Android – so that the various controls work as you’d expect for each operating system. However, the Fusion Keyboard’s most unusual feature isn’t immediately visible. As we’ve mentioned, the keyboard doesn’t include a trackpad – at least, not a conventional physical trackpad, as you’d find on some of Apple’s Magic Keyboards, or the Logitech Combo. It does, however, have a special sensor that sits beneath the keyboard and can detect the movement of your fingers. If you skim your fingers lightly over the surface of the keyboard – rather than actually pressing down on the keys – this sensor can follow the movement of your fingers and act like a kind of virtual trackpad. This is a bit of a mixed blessing, though. The virtual trackpad works quite well for basic gestures, such as simply moving the cursor around on screen, or using two fingers to scroll up and down through documents and web pages (and one nice touch is that it’s even possible to change the position of the virtual trackpad for left-handed and right-handed users). However, more complex gestures can be quite fiddly, and it’s odd that the commonly-used pinch-to-zoom gesture doesn’t seem to be supported on either the iPad or Android devices (although the manual does state that pinch-to-zoom works on Macs and Windows). Should you buy Mokibo Fusion Keyboard for iPad Pro? It’s tempting to suggest that people who want a trackpad should just buy a keyboard that has a conventional trackpad already built into it. However, keyboards with trackpads do tend to be fairly expensive, so the Fusion Keyboard can still provide a well-built keyboard and case at a competitive price – even if you don’t use the virtual trackpad feature very often.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2473371/these-mind-blowing-charts-show-how-much-the-iphones-battery-life-has-improved.html",
    "description": "Macworld Premium smartphone manufacturers have been steadily improving battery life for years, and Apple is no exception. In fact, if you only look at the improvement of the current iPhones compared to last year’s models, you may not realize just how far they’ve come. The battery in today’s new iPhones lasts several times longer than that of the iPhone X introduced just seven years ago! Fortunately, we have been testing iPhone battery life in the same way since then, so we wanted to illustrate just how much better iPhone battery life has become. iPhone battery life over the years We have tested battery life using the Geekbench 4 battery life test going all the way back to the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. We perform the test the same way each time, setting screen brightness to 200 nits and disabling all notifications and auto-brightness settings. We then run the test with the “dim screen” feature turned off to maintain consistent brightness. The Geekbench 4 battery test runs the Geekbench 4 benchmarks repeatedly on a loop until the battery dies, with a small break between runs. It’s a way to keep the screen active and the processor occupied in a consistent fashion over an extended period. It is, however, a little dated—the more modern Geekbench 5 and Geekbench 6 unfortunately did not include a battery benchmark. Here’s how long each of the regular iPhones lasted during this test. There are two tabs on this chart, one showing battery life (in minutes) and one showing the capacity of the battery (in milliamp hours). You can see a clear and impressive increase in battery life over time. Battery capacity has grown a lot, almost doubling from the iPhone 8 to the latest iPhone 16. But battery life has extended much more than that, with the iPhone 16 running this same test, at the same brightness, lasting over five times as long as the iPhone 8! Bear in mind that screen size has increased quite a bit over this time, too. Taking a look at the “large” model phones, we see a similar story: an increase in battery capacity, but a much bigger increase in battery life. There are fewer phones to consider here, as the iPhone XR and iPhone 11 had no larger variant, and the iPhone 12 and 13 had a “mini” model instead of a larger one. Pro iPhones shine even brighter The iPhone Pro models are known for often having slightly longer battery life, in part because they may use newer or more advanced components that are more efficient. Here’s how long the iPhone Pro models last, along with the battery capacity in mAh. While the iPhone X and XS don’t carry the “Pro” name, they’re included here as they were clearly the pro models of their release year. Starting with the iPhone XS, Apple produced a larger Max model that always had a larger display and a larger battery. Here’s how they compare. You can see only a modest increase in battery capacity over the last five years, but a more than doubling of battery life. Whether Pro or not, large or standard, Apple’s battery life gains have dramatically outpaced the bigger battery capacities. In other words, efficiency is going way up. iPhones are now more than twice as efficient We can easily derive a sort of basic “efficiency score” when we divide battery capacity (in milliamp-hours) by battery life (in minutes). The result is a mAh per minute score that lets you know how much battery is being used to run the phone for one minute during these tests: meaning, brightness stuck at 200 nits on a mostly-white screen (with a bit of colored and black text), running Geekbench 4 tests on a loop. For this value, lower scores are better, as it means less battery capacity is being used per minute. The iPhone Pro models are almost always just a touch more efficient than their non-pro siblings, with a notable exception of the iPhone XS being a little less efficient than the iPhone XR. But no matter how you slice it, iPhone power efficiency has become steadily better over time, even as performance has gone way up and displays have become larger and brighter. Now let’s take a look at the large-size phones. Again, the Pro phones are slightly more efficient than their non-Pro equivalents, but the big story is the absolutely huge improvement in overall power efficiency in the last seven years. What is the cause of this efficiency improvement? It’s undoubtedly difficult to pin down. There have been improvements in iOS over the years, but also in the low-level microcode that controls everything in your iPhone from USB and Lightning ports to haptics and NFC. Wireless radios have improved, from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth to 5G to NFC. Display technology keeps improving, offering not only better quality and higher brightness but also the ability to turn power into photons with greater efficiency. And of course, the main application processor and supporting chips continue to evolve not just to offer better performance but to use less power. That means A-series Apple Silicon, RAM, power regulation circuitry, and so on. The impressive and steady efficiency gains of the iPhone line over the least near-decade come in little drips and drops—a few percent here, a fraction of a percent there—until they all add up to a downpour. It’s the compound interest of mobile power efficiency, and we are all the beneficiaries of it. Still, we can’t help but notice the stark improvement in this year’s iPhones, even relative to just the year before. Not since the iPhone 11 to iPhone 12 generation has overall power efficiency improved this much in one year. But unlike that generational leap, where iPhone battery capacity went down, this year the efficiency leap was paired with larger batteries. No wonder the iPhone 16 line is delivering the longest battery life ever in an iPhone by such a wide margin.",

Before this release, choosing between the Pro and non-pro iPhones was a bit of a brain twister. The Pro has the fancier camera setup and you could convince yourself you don’t need it, but then you start to look at the other features that the Pros have (Action button, ProMotion, 5x zoom, newer chip). You could start to develop a Fear of Missing Out. With that in mind, there’s very good news with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus: Some of the major new features Apple introduced are on both the iPhone 16 and the 16 Pro, plus the 16 Pro’s features fill a high-end niche that most people aren’t going to care about. The FOMO is gone, and with the iPhone 16, Apple has a phone that will make a vast majority of its users very happy. This review takes a look at the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. The only difference between the two is the size; the chip, display technology, buttons, cameras, and just about everything else is the same. When I refer to the iPhone 16, I’m talking about both phones and I call out the iPhone 16 Plus specifically when necessary, such as with the battery.

It’s still on the iPhone 16 Pro but it’s now on the iPhone 16, too, so there’s one “pro” feature that made its way down the product line. By default, the Action button is set for mute to mimic the previous switch’s behavior, but it can be changed in iOS’s settings to activate Focus, the Camera, the Flashlight, Voice Memo, Shazam, Translate, Magnifier, a Control Center control, a Shortcut you’ve created, an Accessibility feature, or No Action. The Action Button is so easy to appreciate, especially if you’re tired of navigating through iOS to get to a feature or app you constantly use. I set mine to Flashlight and now it’s available at the push of a button instead of having to wake the phone and tap-and-hold the Flashlight icon on the Lock screen or access Control Center. The next time I travel to a non-English speaking country, I’ll set it to Translate and have quick access to the Translate app. If you want the Action button to do more than the provided options, you can create and assign it to a Shortcut–it sounds daunting, but it’s really not.

This button is placed below the power button on the lower right side, and when holding the iPhone 16 horizontally with the Camera Control on top, its placement is akin to the shutter button on a traditional camera. The button works regardless of how you hold the iPhone 16, but if you’re not comfortable with its placement, you can still use the Action button to launch Camera and you can turn off Camera Control completely–it can’t be reassigned to do a non-camera related task. By default, Camera Control is dedicated to the stock Camera app. You can change the Camera Control setting in the Camera settings so that it opens a third-party camera app such as Halide, Obscura, or Instagram, and it even works with Final Cut Camera. Apple has an API for Camera Control for third-party camera-centric apps, so if you don’t see your favorite app in the settings, be on the lookout for a future app update. Considering how often users access the camera, Camera Control is a great idea, though it has a steep learning curve for figuring out its nuances. For example, press it completely, and then upon release your camera app opens, but it doesn’t snap a picture. But once in the camera, the button acts as a shutter. You can also hold the button down to immediately begin recording a video but you’ll need to keep it pressed the whole time. As soon as you lift your finger, it stops recording. The Camera Capture button does more than shoot; it provides access to options like zoom, exposure, and styles. To get to those options takes a “double light-press” of the button, not a full press, but after a week I’m still mastering the timing and sensitivity of this action. Users can adjust the sensitivity and speed of pressing the button in Accessibility \u003e Camera Control, which I’ve found helpful in getting comfortable with Camera Control. Get all the details on how to adjust the Camera Control button. iPhone 16 and 16 Plus: Camera Apple continues to outfit the non-Pro iPhones with a dual camera system and the iPhone 16 has support for taking spatial photos–that’s why the cameras are now lined up in a row instead of diagonally. The main Fusion camera (as it’s now called) has a 48MP camera that includes support for 2x optical telephoto. Then there’s the 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that’s capable of taking macro shots–yet another feature that was previously only on the iPhone Pro. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus lack a dedicated telephoto lens.

The new macro ability allows users to find a creative outlet that wasn’t previously available in the non-Pro iPhone. Thankfully, the ultrawide camera is better in low-light situations. A new camera feature throughout the iPhone 16 lineup is the new Photographic Styles, which are basically a bunch of themed presets to give your photo a certain look. I’ve never been into photographic filters or tweaking settings in such a way to make a dramatic, artistic impression, but I like the way Photographic Style has been implemented in the Camera app. It uses an interface that looks like a scatter chart and you move the dot within it to tweak each style. It’s easy to use and previews are instant. Photographic Styles can be used to give your photos an artistic twist.

It offers three different ways to adjust the audio after you’ve captured the video. For anyone who does even a small amount of editing to recorded videos, Audio Mix provides flexibility for making your content sound how you want it to sound. It feels like a feature that Apple could’ve easily made exclusive to the iPhone 16 Pro, but again, it didn’t. iPhone 16 and 16 Plus: Display The display remains one of the major components separating the iPhone 16 from the 16 Pro. The iPhone 16 uses a display with a 60Hz refresh rate while ProMotion, which offers the ability to automatically adjust the refresh rate to a faster 120Hz when scrolling, remains a Pro feature. As someone who previously used an iPhone 14 Pro Max daily, the difference between the 60Hz and 120Hz rates is noticeable at times, but it’s more about nuance than practicality. There was never a point while using the iPhone 16 to play games, watch videos, web browsing, or any other everyday task where my experience felt lessened because of the 60Hz display. Most of the time I didn’t even notice. The iPhone 16 also lacks an always-on display, so when the phone sits idle or you turn off the display, the display goes dark. In my carrying experience, not having an always-on display didn’t bother me; I could just press the power button or tap the display to see notifications or the time. But when using the iPhone 16 in StandBy mode as a nightstand clock, the display also goes dark and to see the time you have to tap the screen, or trip the phone’s accelerometer by shaking the table or stand, or use Siri. That’s the most annoying part and if you use Standby Mode, consider a Pro model. iPhone 16 and 16 Plus: Performance The iPhones in recent history are more than fast enough for most people. However, Apple continues to improve performance with each new generation. To see how much of an improvement the new A18 offers, we ran a series of benchmarks, starting with Geekbench 6, which offers insight into general, all-around performance. Geekbench 6 CPU benchmark Geekbench 6 results are stated as scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. Since the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have the same A18 chip, the performance between the two is going to be practically identical. Compared to the iPhone 15’s A16 chip, the A18 posted Multi-core and Single-core results that were 27 percent and 30 percent faster, respectively. That’s a little better than the usual year-over-year boost, but remember, the iPhone 15 used an older-generation chip. 3DMark graphics tests Results are frames per second. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. The iPhone 16 offers a boost in graphics performance, too, so if you like to play graphic-intensive games, there’s an improvement. I should note that while the A18’s CPU is similar to the A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro, the graphics processor is what makes the chips different. The A18 Pro has one more GPU core and a bit more oomph than the A18. Geekbench AI test results Geekbench AI test using the Neural Engine. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. Apple’s big marketing push with the iPhone 16 is to tie it to Apple Intelligence. So, AI performance is now a thing to consider and to gauge AI performance, we use the Geekbench AI test. The results show dramatic improvement over the iPhone 15, as much as 107 percent. The results clearly reflect Apple’s decision to make the non-Pro iPhones capable of supporting its upcoming AI features–the iPhone 15 isn’t on the Apple Intelligence compatibility list, but the iPhone 16 is. (More on the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence below.) iPhone 16 and 16 Plus: Battery life One major change between the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus and the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus is that the new phones have larger batteries. Combine that with the improved efficiency of the A18 chip in these phones and that means longer battery life. The iPhone battery life has always been good, but now it’s even better. Way better. Battery life was tested using Geekbench 4’s battery test. It’s a more strenuous test compared to the ways Apple gauges battery life, so the numbers here should be taken within the context of our results, not versus Apple’s numbers. Geekbench 4 battery test Geekbench 4 battery test results are stated in minutes. Longer bars/higher results are better. These results are incredible. The iPhone 16’s improvement is nearly four hours longer than the iPhone 15 and two hours longer than the iPhone 15 Plus which has a larger battery. The iPhone 16 Plus can last over four hours longer than the iPhone 15 Plus. Under regular use, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are going to get you through the day and then some, and you can feel comfortable about doing something that will take its toll on the battery–you’re still going to have plenty of charge left over. iPhone 16 and 16 Plus: Apple Intelligence If you were convinced that the marquee feature of the iPhone 16 is Apple Intelligence, that’s probably because Apple is promoting it that way. But Apple Intelligence isn’t available yet. That new version of Siri you want to chat with? Doesn’t work yet. The clean-up tool for editing out that strange dude in the background of your photos? Can’t do it yet. The summary you’re looking for about the long email thread you’ve ignored? Sorry, you better start from the beginning. Apple will start rolling out Apple Intelligence features later this fall, starting with iOS 18.1. That will include a few features, and then later updates will gradually roll out more features. We have details of what’s coming and when. The iPhone 16 hardware is all ready to go with Apple Intelligence, and it could make your new phone feel even newer. Should you buy the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus? Almost everything the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus does, they do very well. It has all the features most people need every day and a few more that are usually reserved for Apple’s Pro lineup. The iPhone 16 Pro still has more features, but they’ve ventured into the niche arena, addressing the needs of high-end users, such as video producers and professional content creators. You should read our iPhone 16 Pro review to learn more–what you’ll probably figure out that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have all that you need.

    "description": "Macworld Plug your MacBook in and out of a multi-port docking station to swiftly add devices and external displays to your laptop. We tested a bunch to find the best Thunderbolt and USB-C docks available to owners of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Thunderbolt 3, 4, USB4 or USB-C The connectors all look the same (technically known as a “Type-C connector”), but there are significant differences, particularly on data-transfer speed—with USB-C maxing out at 10Gbps (usually 5Gbps) compared to the 40Gbps of Thunderbolt 3 and 4. More like Thunderbolt than USB-C, USB4 can be either 20Gbps or 40Gbps. That extra bandwidth allows not just for faster data transfer but higher frame rates to external displays, plus some other smart benefits. Of Apple’s current laptop range, the M1/M2/M3 MacBook Air and 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro feature two ports that Apple specifies as “Thunderbolt / USB 4” ports, while the 14in and 16in M1/M2/M3 Pro or M1/M2/M3 Max MacBook Pro models come with three Thunderbolt 4 (TB4) ports. Ignore Apple’s dual designation of non-4 Thunderbolt and USB4—it just means that the ports don’t certify as pure Thunderbolt 4, and that shouldn’t worry most users except for the number of external displays each supports. Apple’s older 12in MacBook features one 5Gbps Gen 1 USB-C port, while the later Intel MacBook Air (2018 and later) and MacBook Pro (from 2016) boast either two or four 40Gbps Thunderbolt 3 ports. If your MacBook is equipped with Thunderbolt 4, then you really should buy a TB4 dock if you need more ports than those 14/16in laptops already possess. USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 docks will work as Thunderbolt 4 is backwards compatible. Indeed, buying a Thunderbolt 4 dock is a wise decision for everyone, based on future-proofing even for owners of Thunderbolt 3 (TB3) Macs. That said, there are still some great—and often more affordable—TB3 and USB-C docks available, and most Apple users won’t see much difference between TB3 and TB4—the Thunderbolt 4 standard was mainly about getting Windows laptops up to speed, although there are technical benefits for MacBook Pro users, such as smarter daisy-chaining and faster PCI hard-drive connections. For more detail, read our Thunderbolt 4 vs Thunderbolt 3 vs USB4 explainer. We have included some cheaper (non-Thunderbolt) USB-C docks. If you don’t require the ultimate bandwidth for the fastest data transfer and best screen frame rates or resolutions, a USB-C dock might suit your purposes and save you money.  Add external displays to your MacBook If you use your laptop as your principal computer, you would do well to consider attaching at least one larger display to create a hybrid desktop/laptop setup (with a keyboard, mouse and printer all available via a single connection to your MacBook). You can turn that 13in laptop’s screen real-estate into an iMac-sized 27in or even larger monitor by adding an extra display—or connect two or even four large screens to extend your screen across your whole desk. Take a look at our recommended best monitors and displays for Mac. If you want to connect more than one external display to your MacBook without adding third-party software you’ll need a Thunderbolt dock, rather than a USB-C dock—unless you install third-party DisplayLink software. Natively over USB-C, Macs can only connect to one external display in Extended mode (where the screen extends beyond what you can see on the laptop screen, as opposed to Mirrored mode that replicates exactly what you get on the laptop screen) but you’ll get two Extended mode screens over a Thunderbolt connection. While Apple’s MacBooks featuring the company’s own M1/M2/M3 Silicon chip are super speedy compared to the models sporting Intel processors, models with plain (non-Pro or -Max) M1 and M2 and some M3 chips come with an incredible limitation: they don’t support more than one external display in Extended Mode even via their Thunderbolt ports. This limitation means that when using any docking station, M1 and M2 MacBook users cannot extend their desktop over two or more displays, and will be limited to either dual Mirrored displays or one external display—although adding third-party DisplayLink or InstantView software to the Mac and connecting to a dedicated USB-C dock will allow you to add more than one external monitor to an M1, M2 or M3 MacBook. Follow that link for our roundup of the best USB-C DisplayLink docks, and we’ve included our favorite in our roundup below. Apple has fixed this limitation with its latest M3 MacBook Air and Pro models—although it still requires you to close the MacBook’s lid to use a second external display. When using DisplayLink, you can leave the M3 MacBook’s lid open to give you a third (built-in) screen. Thankfully, the superior M1/M2/M3 Pro and M1/M2/M3 Max MacBook Pro models can support multiple displays. Below our list of the best MacBook docking stations, we’ve listed the native external display options for each MacBook. One dock supports up to four 6K displays if you own a Max MacBook Pro. While some docking stations promise support for 8K displays, Macs are limited to 6K support via the dock. Macs with an M2/M3 Pro or M2/M3 Max chip can support an 8K display at 60Hz but only when it is connected via the Mac’s own HDMI port and not any port on the dock. Do I need a docking station? All the latest MacBook Pro models boast a wider range of built-in ports, so lighter users might not need a docking station at all. Below the list of our recommended Mac docks is a detailed look at the ports that each recent MacBook includes as standard. With three TB4 and an HDMI port, a MacBook with a Max chip could connect to up to four external displays without the need for a dock, although such a power user would likely require extra Thunderbolt ports for other devices to make up for using all the laptop ports for multiple monitors. See below our list of recommended docking stations for more detail on the external display options with each recent MacBook. All docks come with a bunch of USB ports: some old-school USB-A and newer, more capable USB-C. MacBook Pros also have an SD card reader. Although this is rated as UHS-II (312MBps), Apple has pegged it back at 250MBps, so for the fastest speeds (and a microSD slot if you need one), a dock will likely be a better choice for memory-card use if it is rated at UHS-II rather than UHS-I (104MBps). MacBooks also lack wired Internet access via a Gigabit Ethernet port, so if you want to escape flaky Wi-Fi, buy a dock with at least Gigabit Ethernet, although you could add a Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter if you have a spare TB port. Some later docks include faster 2.5Gb Ethernet but you’ll need a 2.5GbE router or other device to get the benefit. As Gigabit Ethernet’s speed is 1Gbps, a cheaper 5Gbps USB-C to Ethernet adapter will work just as well. Dock or hub? If you just need a few extra ports, a USB-C hub or Thunderbolt 4 hub might be your best choice—see our roundup of the best USB-C and Thunderbolt hubs for Mac. However, if you require a bunch of fast ports including Gigabit (or faster) Ethernet and multiple video ports plus more powerful charging capability, then look for a full dock that fulfills your needs, and you are in exactly the right place to discover which dock is best for your and you MacBook. USB-C and Thunderbolt speeds Foundry Foundry Foundry Thunderbolt vs USB-C dock compatibility Plain USB-C runs at either 5Gbps or 10Gbps, while Thunderbolt (TB3 and TB4) hits speeds of 40Gbps. You can hook up a Thunderbolt laptop to a USB-C dock but you won’t access the faster speeds unless you buy a true Thunderbolt dock. (By the way, Thunderbolt 5, offering 80Gbps, won’t be seen on a Mac until well into 2024.) • USB and Thunderbolt speeds explained USB PD: Power Delivery for your laptop Look out for a dock with USB PD. The PD stands for Power Delivery.  Charging the laptop: The M1/M2/M3 MacBook Air requires a PD charger with at least 30W power, but you can fast-charge an M2 Air with a charger rated at over 70W. You’ll need 67W for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and 14-inch MBP (with 8-, 10- or 11-core CPU), 96W for 14-inch MBP (with 12-core CPU), and 96W (preferably 140W) for the 16-inch MBP. The older 15in MacBook Pro requires a 87W PD charger. An 85W/96W MacBook Pro can be charged by a 30W or 60W charger, but slower than it would be with its native charger. A larger MacBook with a heavy workload might start fading even while being charges on a lower wattage. If you own a larger MacBook Pro, buy a dock with a PD (Power Delivery) potential of at least 85W if you can. Portable hubs are usually rated at a lower power such as 60W. USB PD 3.0 maxes at 100W, while USB PD 3.1 can support up to 240W of power. The 16-inch MacBook Pro requires 140W to fast-charge via its MagSafe 3 cable, so owners of that laptop should look for a PD 3.1 charger. If you just need a spare charger, we’ve tested the best MacBook chargers for you. Dock, hub or dongle: Whole lotta ports You need one (“upstream”) Thunderbolt or USB-C port for connecting to and charging your laptop (although the 14/16in MacBooks can also power via the MagSafe port), and likely at least another (“downstream”) to attach further devices (hard drives, external display, and others). There are many inexpensive USB-C dongles/hubs that let you add more devices to a MacBook (see our roundup of the best USB-C adapters for Macs) or a Thunderbolt hub offering a few extra ports might be all your need, but for maximum flexibility check out a docking station that takes care of all your extra port requirements, and allows you to simply attach it to your laptop with just one cable when you get to the office or come home. Here we concentrate on Thunderbolt docks, but also include cheaper USB-C docks—which Thunderbolt MacBooks can use, but at the cost of reduced bandwidth and display limitations. We’ve also included our favorite Thunderbolt hubs for smaller and cheaper alternatives. For more non-Thunderbolt USB-C-only docks check out Tech Advisor’s roundup of the best USB-C docking stations for laptops. Tech Advisor also reviews all the available Thunderbolt 4 docks. Docks aren’t just for MacBooks. Mac mini (2018 and later) and iMac (2017 and later) owners may also consider expanding their ports with a Thunderbolt docking station. The inclusion of an SD or microSD card reader isn’t just for camera buffs. It’s a convenient and affordable way to add storage to your laptop setup. We found a 512GB Samsung Evo microSD card on Amazon for around $100 in the US and under £100 in the UK. That’s a very cheap way of adding half a terabyte of portable storage. For more details read up on our best microSD cards. Some of the docks reviewed below include an integrated SSD enclosure that lets you add up to 8TB of fast storage to your connected MacBook.

It has the most ports and equals the fastest ports seen in the market. Its nearest competitor is the excellent Caldigit TS4, reviewed below. Sonnet clearly targeted the TS4 and the specs are remarkably similar—but the cheaper Echo 20 has a useful SSD enclosure that means you can add up to 8TB of internal storage via the dock. If you don’t need this feature and prefer DisplayPort to HDMI, or you need the most powerful ports on offer, the TS4 is still a great contender, although it costs a fair amount more. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand, reviewed below, is a cheaper non-Thunderbolt option if the idea of an integrated SSD enclosure is appealing. Even if your MacBook is Thunderbolt 3, as a Thunderbolt 4 dock the Echo 20 is backwards compatible and will work with your next laptop when it’s time to upgrade. While you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays, Sonnet has swapped one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated HDMI port. You can add up to two 4K displays at 60Hz or a single 6K screen at 60Hz. Unless your second display can connect directly with its USB-C port, you’ll need a USB-C-to-DisplayPort or HDMI adapter cable to connect to one of the downstream TB4 ports. If you have the right router, you can take advantage of super-fast wired Internet access with the Echo 20’s 2.5GbE Gigabit Ethernet—2.5x faster than standard Gigabit Ethernet, with which it also works on standard networks.

Unlike the Thunderbolt 4 Sonnet Echo 20, reviewed above, this is a USB-C dock with a 10Gbps rather than 40Gbps bandwidth, but it’s significantly cheaper as a result. The MSRP of the Satechi Dual Dock Stand is $150, which is a very reasonable price for a dual 4K 60Hz USB-C docking station. With one DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports, you can connect up to two 4K displays in Extended mode at a decent 60Hz refresh rate. The Echo 20 has just one video port. Although that port is the superior HDMI 2.1, you have to add a second external screen via one of the Thunderbolt ports, which will require an adapter. The SSD enclosure is the star of the show. Placed on the underside of the dock, this is easily accessed and supports both NVMe and SATA SSDs. You need to buy the SSD separately. Amazon is selling NVME SSDs for around $50 (1TB), $80 (2TB) or $300 (4TB). One USB-C port is for passthrough PD power at up to 75W to the laptop, which is enough for all but the 16-inch MacBook Pro at full pelt. Even that model will charge fine—just slower than smaller MacBooks. Note that you will need to connect your own USB-C charger to the dock: check out our recommended MacBook chargers. If you use your MacBook’s own keyboard and desire up to two quality external displays, plus need to increase your base storage with fast SSD drives, the Satechi Dual Dock Stand is a neat, zero-footprint docking station that matches your MacBook for style and adds nine useful ports.

Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s an ultra-impressive dock. It compares well to the Sonnet Echo 20 with just one fewer port—the Echo 20’s integrated SSD enclosure. For port speeds the TS4 matches the Echo 20, and it boasts the highest power supply that we’ve seen on any dock that we’ve tested—a whopping 230W to be spread among the ports, including a front-mounted 20W USB-C that can fast-charge an iPhone and 98W laptop PD charging. We also love this dock’s flexible vertical or horizontal format. As with the Echo 20, while you can use Thunderbolt ports to add external displays. Caldigit swaps one of the downstream TB4 ports for a dedicated video port—in this case, DisplayPort. You’ll need an adapter if your monitor requires HDMI.

It can supply two external 4K displays at 60Hz or one 6K monitor but at 30Hz rather than 60Hz like the Caldigit TS4, so single-screen gamers should probably look elsewhere. At 180W, the power supply is higher than most docks tested here but not as great as found on the Caldigit TS4. It’s essential if you are powering multiple devices connected to the dock. And the On/Off power button (rare on docks) means you can give the laptop battery’s rest when you’re away. There are useful lights telling you when the dock is powered and when it’s connected.

No other dock can match it for number of Thunderbolt ports and its ability to host multiple monitors. Packing two Thunderbolt chips gives the FusionDock Max 1 the ability to double up on video-capable ports. Connected to a MacBook Pro with an M1 Max, M2 Max or M3 Max processor it can handle up to four 6K displays at 60Hz using both its Thunderbolt 4 chipsets. It costs more than any other docking station but it’s a unique dual-Thunderbolt 4 system that answers the dreams of multi-screen Mac professionals. It doesn’t work with Intel Macs or even any Windows computer. This is a dock built for the top-end MacBook Pro Max. Macs with Pro rather than Max processors can connect to two 4K displays at 60Hz. While that would lose the display benefit this is still is good choice as you could have up to four 40Gbps downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports at your disposal. Its other ports are plenty and top-end, too. We’re not sure who needs six USB-A ports these days, but they are there and all are rated at 10Gbps. We would have preferred more USB-C than USB-A, but one of the Type C ports included boasts 30W device charging power. On top of all that you get 2.5Gb Ethernet and two fast UHS-II SD card readers.

Using DisplayLink software, it enables M1/M2/M3 Pro MacBook Pro and M3 MacBook Air users to connect up to four 4K displays, and even plain M1/M2 MacBooks—normally limited to just one monitor—will support three external displays. Aside from the mighty iVanky dock reviewed above, it’s the only dock available with three downstream speedy 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 ports and two HDMI 2.0 ports—all of which can connect to an external display, although four is the maximum. Freely downloadable DisplayLink software is required to make the HDMI ports work. While the $500 iVanky supports four 6K displays, the $299 Satechi can still support four 4K screens at 60Hz. For three displays, you can get one 6K at 60Hz and the other two 4K/60Hz. It lacks spare USB-C ports but the three TB4 ports are backwards compatible, and can each offer 15W power output (although only two at one time). The two USB-A ports are fast but offer little device charging power. The SD card reader is fast, and will accept MicroSD cards with an adapter. If you want handfuls of USB ports and 2.5Gb Ethernet, there are other docks in your future, but this dock is close to perfect for non-Max M-series users who want multiple monitors. Even Max owners can use this dock to give them four displays and leave their MacBook’s built-in ports free for other devices, as well as save money on the pricier iVanky alternative.

Its compact shape and 15 ports made it our favorite top-end Thunderbolt 3 docking station for its sheer functional flexibility and power at a great price. Other docks boast faster USB ports, but few have seven like the TS3 Plus—except its successor, the TS4, which makes even the TS3 Plus look underpowered. if you can afford the extra, we recommend the TS4. It’s a better choice than the Anker 577 dock as it works with all modern Macs that use M1/M2/M3 chips. The TS3 Plus isn’t unsuitable for non-Thunderbolt laptops—but as most MacBooks have at least TB3, that shouldn’t matter unless you work in a mixed Mac/Windows environment. And while Thunderbolt 4 is the latest connection standard, its top-end benefits won’t be noticed by most MacBook owners as TB3 matches TB4 on data-transfer speed. To add the second external display you will require an HDMI or DisplayPort USB-C video adapter to run from the USB-C port unless you have a USB-C monitor. To avoid this need for an adapter, look for a dock with two video ports.  Both connected displays can run 4K displays at 60Hz. You could also run one 5K display at the same frame rate. The TS3 Plus’s digital audio ports set it apart from most other Thunderbolt docks. It charges your laptop at 87W so makes it a great companion to Apple’s larger MacBook Pro models. This dock is dinky so won’t take up too much space on your desk. Available in Silver and Space Gray, it matches the colors of Apple’s laptops.  One Thunderbolt 3 upstream port (40Gbps, 87W PD) One Thunderbolt 3 downstream port (40Gbps, 15W) DisplayPort 1.2 port  Five USB-A ports (5Gbps, 7.5W) One USB-C (10Gbps) port One USB-C (5Gbps) port SD Card Reader (SD 4.0 UHS-II, 312MBps) Gigabit Ethernet port Front-facing 3.5mm Audio In \u0026 Out ports One Digital Optical Audio (S/PDIF) port 180W power supply Read our full CalDigit Thunderbolt Station 3 Plus (TS3 Plus) review Alogic DX3 Triple 4K Display Universal Docking Station – Best USB-C display dock for Macs Pros 12 ports 100W PD laptop charging Triple 5K displays Cons USB-C not Thunderbolt Requires DisplayLink software Price When Reviewed: $299.99 Best Prices Today: $234.15 at Amazon$299.99 at Alogic Type: 10Gbps USB-C Dock Ports: 12 Power: 100W PD 3.0; 135W max External displays: 3x 5K at 60Hz This Alogic DisplayLink docking station is a USB-C rather than Thunderbolt docking station, so lacks the data-transfer bandwidth you’d get from a TB dock. However, with the addition of third-party DisplayLink software, this dock can support up to three external 4K 60Hz displays even on a limited plain M1/M2/M3 MacBook. The video ports are all top-end DP. 1.4. If your monitor is HDMI instead of DisplayPort, you’ll need to add an adapter between dock and display—but you’d need to buy video cables anyway. If HDMI is all you need, consider the Satechi Triple 4K dock. It also packs a bunch of non-display ports, such as three USB-A and a spare downstream USB-C port, plus fast SD and MicroSD card readers and Gigabit Ethernet. It can power the connected laptop at 100W and has a decent 135W external power supply so doesn’t require an extra USB-C charger like many DisplayLink USB-C docks do.

But it boasts so many top-end Thunderbolt and USB ports that you can customize it to your every desire. There are four TB4 ports (one upstream to your computer placed handily on the side, and three downstream to other devices) and four fast 10Gbps USB-A ports. You can use two of the three downstream TB4 ports to connect directly to USB-C-equipped monitors or HDMI or DisplayPort screens using inexpensive adapters. It can handle two 6K displays at 60Hz or one 6K monitor at the same refresh rate. That still leave you a spare TB4 port and the four USB-A ports to add further devices, such as an adapter for Gigabit Ethernet and/or SD card reader, SSDs, memory sticks and so on as your requirements demand, so there is no port wastage. As a hub rather than a dock, its 60W laptop charger is a little underpowered for larger laptops, but the overall 150W power supply will help with all the hub’s ports. Owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro will probbaly still reply on the laptop’s own 140W charger via MagSafe. None of the other docks tested here can supply the 140W required for 16in MBP fast-charging so it’s not as big a limitation as first appears.

Plainer USB-C docks can handle two 4K displays, but only at 30Hz, and only one Extended. Its downside is a lack of power supply (which it draws from the host laptop), so you’ll need to power your laptop via another port, and the USB ports certainly aren’t for fast-charging purposes. No power supply means it’s super portable but a passthrough power port would have been preferred.

The compact USB-C dock (3.34-x-6.3-x-5.18 inches) will fit neatly on your desk alongside your Mac’s display. The Logi Dock’s chunky power adaptor means that this is very much a dock that’s designed to stay on your desk the whole time.

Significantly, you can only connect one 4K display if you’re using Extended mode, although you can connect two 4K displays in Mirrored mode. The Logi Dock can work as a speaker for voice and video calls, or you can just listen to some music while you’re working using either the USB-C connection with your Mac, or using Bluetooth to connect to your mobile devices.

Principally, it features super-fast 10Gb Ethernet rather than the standard 1Gb (Gigabit) connection found on the other docking stations reviewed here. The Caldigit TS4 features 2.5Gb Ethernet. To get the most from this level of Ethernet you need to have compatible network devices. It also features a CFast 2.0 card reader for people still using CompactFlash in its latest version.  There are Thunderbolt docking stations with more ports and beefier chargers, but none have 10Gb Ethernet or CFast 2.0. You can add these to other docks via dedicated adapters, but the Pro Dock has it all built-in, plus a really secure power-supply connection in case it’s used on a pro DIT cart.

The five USB-A ports are all 5Gbps, and there’s a 10Gbps Gen 2 USB-C port on the front of the latest 14-port model, which not many Thunderbolt docks have. The curiously old-fashioned choice of Mini DisplayPort over DisplayPort isn’t a technical hurdle but you will require adapters for adding external displays.

    "description": "Macworld Achievement badges are a funny thing. You know they’re just a simple little bit of visual flair, they don’t even do anything, and yet for some reason you just have to collect them. Gamification can be a great motivator, and the achievement badges for the activity tracking on the Apple Watch have inspired many users to get more exercise. If you want to maximize your badge count, you’re going to want to chase down as many activity achievements as you can. Most are available year-round, but there are also some time-limited special events to grab, too. Here’s a list of all the activity achievements for the Apple Watch and how to unlock them. Updated October 1, 2024: The next limited activity badge you can get is on October 10 for Mental Health Day. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm) Price When Reviewed: $399 Best Prices Today: $384.99 at Amazon | $385.99 at Walmart Electronics | 399 at Apple Standard achievements Most of the achievements can be earned year-round. If you open the Activity app on your iPhone, then head over to the Achievements tab, you’ll see some of them listed even before you earn them (in which case they will be represented by a grey outline). However, there are some achievements that are not shown until you earn them. Past and future monthly challenges, for example, won’t show up, nor do all the various individual exercise workouts. Here is a list of all the standard badges you can get. First [exercise] Workout The first time you perform a new exercise for at least 5 minutes, you’ll get a achievement badge. Every workout type that does not fall under the “Other” category is eligible for this badge: from walking to yoga to HIIT to hiking and more. Activities with both indoor and outdoor variants, like Cycling and Walking, are bundled together; you can do either activity to get the badge, and can only get it once. [exercise] Workout Record Every time you beat your previous best record for calories burned in any of the exercises listed above, you get this badge. There is one caveat: You must complete five workouts of that type first. If you want to game the system, make sure your first four workouts of each type are short and easy, so it won’t take much effort to beat them. You get a badge the first time you do each major exercise type, and when you break a record. You get a badge the first time you do each major exercise type, and when you break a record. You get a badge the first time you do each major exercise type, and when you break a record. 7-Workout Week Simply complete any workout of at least 15 minutes every day of the week. Note that the week is Monday-Sunday, and you have to do a workout on each of those days (you can’t simply do any seven days in a row). If you start a walking workout whenever you walk outside, you can achieve this easily. New Move Record Any day that your Move ring goes further than ever before (meaning you burned more calories in a day), you’ll earn this award. There’s one catch: you have to use your Apple Watch for 10 days before you can complete this. New Exercise Record This is just like the Move Record achievement, only for the green ring. This one is based on minutes of exercise, not calories burned, so it’s really easy to get. Just like the Move Record achievement, you have to use your Apple Watch for 10 days first. Move Goal 200%, 300%, 400% You earn this when you exceed your calorie target (the red Move ring) by 2x, 3x, or 4x, respectively. In other words, it’s given for making the red activity ring go around two, three, or four times in a day. It’s easy to get if you just set your Move goal very low. Double, triple, and quadruple your Move ring goal. Reduce your goal if you’re having trouble. Double, triple, and quadruple your Move ring goal. Reduce your goal if you’re having trouble. Double, triple, and quadruple your Move ring goal. Reduce your goal if you’re having trouble. New Move Goal Every time you change your daily Move goal, and then exceed that new goal, you get this achievement. You can change your Move goal by opening the Activity app on your Apple Watch and force-pressing the screen. Longest Move Streak When you hit your Move goal (close the red ring) several days in a row, that’s a “streak.” You get this award when your streak finally ends, if it’s longer than your previous best streak. Perfect Week This is given out for four categories: Move, Exercise, Stand, and All Activity. For the first three, simply close the rings (red, green, or blue) every day of the week. To get the Perfect Week (All Activity) badge, close all three rings every day for an entire week. You can earn this multiple times, though it only shows one badge. Remember, one week in the Activity app is from Monday-Sunday! Close those rings every day from Monday to Sunday to earn a handful of badges. Close those rings every day from Monday to Sunday to earn a handful of badges. Close those rings every day from Monday to Sunday to earn a handful of badges. Perfect Month Unlike Perfect Week, there are not multiple different Perfect Month badges for the different color rings. The lone Perfect Month achievement is for closing the red Move ring every day of the month. There’s a separate Perfect Month badge for every month and every year, though. So you can earn this in February and again in March, and again in February in the next year. Monthly Challenge Each month has its own unique fitness challenge. If you have notifications set for the Activity app on our Apple Watch, you’ll see the goal presented at the beginning of the month, but you’ll also see the current month’s challenge in the Achievements tab of the Activity app on your iPhone. It will be a grey outline before it’s completed, but you can tap on it to see what the challenge entails. The monthly challenge may task you with burning a specific number of calories, working out a number of times, or traveling a certain distance. There’s no telling what each new month will bring, you just have to look! There’s a different challenge every month, so check your Activity app. There’s a different challenge every month, so check your Activity app. There’s a different challenge every month, so check your Activity app. 100, 365, 500, 1,000 Move Goals When you hit your daily Move goal (close the red ring) 100 times, you get an achievement badge. You get another for hitting it 365 times, 500 times, and 1,000 times. These do not need to be in a row; it’s just the total number of times you’ve ever hit the goal. Close the Move ring often to unlock a series of badges. Set the Move goal low if you want to make it easier. Close the Move ring often to unlock a series of badges.

    "description": "Macworld As a long-time iPhone mini fan (insert your own “THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!” gif here, I’m too bitter to find one), I have sat out a number of new iPhone purchasing opportunities over the last few years. The rent it too high, the phones are too big. This year, however, knowing that I would have to eventually give in to Big Phone™, and the addition of the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 got me. I ordered an iPhone 16. It’s nice. I like it. Is it too big? Yes, it’s too big. It’s also not the most exciting thing I bought that came out of Apple’s September event. Now hear this The other thing I bought was the jauntily named AirPods 4 with ANC. (What’s wrong with AirPods 4+, Apple?) These new devices don’t do anything the AirPods Pro didn’t already do–they do less–but there are two types of ears in this world: ones that can handle plug-style earphones and ones that can’t, and mine cannot. The AirPods 4 with ANC are AirPods Pro for the rest of us. EarPods were fine but Apple knew that a wireless future was coming. EarPods were fine but Apple knew that a wireless future was coming.Foundry EarPods were fine but Apple knew that a wireless future was coming.Foundry Foundry Remember EarPods? Sure you do, you have a drawer full of them. They worked and they worked fine. Some people still use them. The world could have continued spinning with Apple including EarPods with every iPhone, and people who wanted to go wireless had to buy unreliable Bluetooth headphones until the heat death of the universe. The Verge certainly seemed to want to do that. But Apple then decided to do away with the headphone jack on iPhones, which shoved us into a certain direction that just happened to make the company more money. Funny that. But it was also a direction in which we have more functionality, accessibility options, and just general enjoyment. Big things in small packages AirPods are a classic Apple product. They’re often annoying and sometimes do things you don’t want them to do that can make you want to scream, but what they do right is so magical when it happens you forgive them for all their flaws. I can’t imagine living without them now. Yes, sometimes they switch to a different device just to play an alert sound, even if I was listening to something on the first device. Sometimes they don’t switch to a device I clearly want them to switch to even when it seems clear I’m shifting focus. Some people find them easy to lose (mine are always in that little pocket in my jeans I never previously had a use for). The batteries are a long-term problem without an easy solution. Apple does a pretty good job of demonstrating a commitment to making AirPods a great product. Apple does a pretty good job of demonstrating a commitment to making AirPods a great product.Lewis Painter / Foundry Apple does a pretty good job of demonstrating a commitment to making AirPods a great product.Lewis Painter / Foundry Lewis Painter / Foundry But Apple has relentlessly added features to AirPods over their eight years in existence. The original AirPods were wireless headphones with easy-to-use controls that simply paired easier and worked more consistently than other Bluetooth headphones. And that was enough. AirPods Pro came three years later, bringing active noise cancellation, transparency mode, wireless charging, and other features. Now Apple has pushed those premium features back down the line into the non-Pro AirPods, added other features like being able to shake or nod your head to answer Siri, all for just $20 more than the original version. And the AirPods Pro? It made them hearing aids. Just, you know, because. Apple has shown that it is seriously committed to making AirPods a great product and a continuing part of its lineup. It’s the little things Apple gets plenty of credit for AirPods on its quarterly conference calls with analysts, but otherwise they’re not a silent hit but certainly one on which the noise has been canceled. (See what I did there? Yeah, you see it.) Tim Cook often gets chastised for not producing products as life-changing as those Apple shipped under Steve Jobs. But AirPods and the Apple Watch are huge successes on a level comparable to the iPod or iPad, if just not the iPhone. Apple’s wearables revenue in the second calendar quarter of 2024 was $8.1 billion. That’s as big as Visa, Air France, Subaru, or Heineken (all of which together sound like a rich’s kid’s spring break toolkit). So, it’s not making AirPods great out of the kindness of its heart. But it didn’t make the Mac out of the kindness of its heart, either. Sometimes is nice when one of Apple’s best products is also one of it’s smallest and least expensive.",

And if you’ve been drooling over it, now’s the time to buy: You can get it for $732.89 at Amazon, down from its $799 MSRP. The 49mm black titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2 was only introduced a few weeks ago, but it’s definitely a model that we love because it looks stunning, no matter what color band you get. When we reviewed the natural titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2, we gave it a 4-star rating and appreciated the bright screen and the operating system that goes with it. The rugged watch is great for tracking sports and workouts. “Apple has broadened the variety of sports, and it’s possible to customize each one with the particular goals you want to achieve. And you can start a workout quickly by pressing the Action button if you’ve set it to do that. It all works brilliantly, especially for running, walking and cycling. The only criticism, really, is that not every kind of workout records your route using the built-in GPS,” our review reads. Of course, there’s more to this smartwatch. When you’re hiking, the Compass app helps you navigate any terrain. When you’re running, you get detailed metrics. If you want to work out, the watch can guide you through warmups, recovery intervals, and cool-downs. It’s also got incredible battery life that can stretch to 36 hours.

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Antivirus protections. Lots of tools are available, including Cloud Backup and Password Manager. Email tracking quarantine is an eye-opener. Cons Slower than rival VPNs. Inflexible payment options. Our Verdict Norton Ultra VPN is a solid offering from a company dedicated to securing your tech, but its pricing structure, lack of browser integration and slower speeds make it hard to recommend over others. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When ReviewedFirst year is from $39.99 Norton Secure VPN; $49.99 Norton Ultra VPN; $59.99 Norton Ultra VPN Plus. Renews at a higher price of $79.99/$109.99/$129.99. Best Prices Today: Norton Ultra VPN Retailer Price Norton (first year) $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Norton is likely a brand that needs no introduction, with decades of experience protecting devices from cyber threats (read our review of Norton 360). That means there’s plenty of cache in the name, and the company’s VPN service wisely leans on that pedigree. Norton’s VPN plans are, outside of the basic tier, tied into its security software to help offer real-time protection from bad actors. It comes with a password manager, dark web monitor, and cloud storage, but the VPN side of things is a little lacking. Perhaps it’s from testing so many of the best VPN services that we’ve grown used to a certain set of non-negotiables. Chief among them is browser extension options to allow for quick switching, but at the time of writing, there’s no such offering from Norton. Then there’s the option to pay monthly, but Norton demands an annual fee. While it’s a smaller amount than many charge, there’s a caveat that while Norton Secure VPN (one device) is $39.99/£19.99 for the first year, it then renews at $79.99/£39.99, and other plans only get more egregious – the Norton Ultra VPN (five devices) $49.99/£24.99 plan rises to $109.99/£79.99 for a second year, while the $59.99/£29.99 Norton Ultra VPN Plus family plan (ten devices) jumps to $129.99/£94.99. With better, and, crucially, faster options, available, it’s hard to escape the feeling Norton’s VPN offering needs some retooling. Still, if you’re looking for real-time protection it remains a good security-focused option, but with geoblocking being inconsistent in our testing, you might want to look elsewhere for your international Netflix fix. Take a look at our round-up of the Best VPNs for Mac. Features \u0026 Apps Norton monitors your app activity. Norton monitors your app activity.Foundry Norton monitors your app activity.Foundry Foundry As mentioned above, Norton’s VPN does include plenty of accouterments that other VPNs either don’t have or charge extra for. You can install the app on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and all three platforms have apps that work well and run nicely in the background. Despite the lack of a browser extension or plugin, Norton’s solution is a menu for Browser Protection, which scans sites as you browse. That means it’s not as easy to switch one browser to one region (perhaps for site testing), but does mean you get the benefit of real-time detection alerts if a site might be unsafe. The same goes for downloads, with Norton scanning files before they land on your device. It worked well in my testing, and barely added any additional time to the length of downloads. Norton’s VPN can track for a whole host of information types on the Dark Web. Norton’s VPN can track for a whole host of information types on the Dark Web.Foundry Norton’s VPN can track for a whole host of information types on the Dark Web.Foundry Foundry One thing that was interesting was how it monitors trackers on emails. As a journalist, I receive a lot of press releases and pitches, and while I’ve always assumed many of them use some kind of tracking to see when they’re opened, Norton offered to quarantine so many that I was quite taken aback. Whether it’s a little over-enthusiastic or well within its rights will depend on how much you value your inbox’s privacy, but it did well to work with third-party apps like Outlook and Spark. There’s also a password manager if you’re not already using Apple’s new Passwords app, but most of these features are tied to the middle subscription tier and above. The basic tier, simply dubbed Norton Secure VPN, will only protect one device, block ads and offers VPN functionality, but it’s a little more barebones. Considering that second-year price hike, that’s something to consider despite the low price right now. Performance Norton does a great job of offering real-time threat reporting and download scanning. Norton does a great job of offering real-time threat reporting and download scanning.Foundry Norton does a great job of offering real-time threat reporting and download scanning.Foundry Foundry VPNs naturally decrease your internet speeds as your signal is fired across the globe, and Norton has servers in 32 countries – a steep drop from the 111 in NordVPN’s portfolio – but it does offer four protocols to choose from. IKEv2, OpenVPN and WireGuard are pretty commonly found across the board of rivals, but Norton has its own Mimic protocol which is intended to be ideal for unblocking international streaming services. Sadly, testing on a 70 Mbps connection saw a consistent speed drop-off. For context, NordVPN and ExpressVPN dropped 12 and 13 percent of speeds when using them in our tests, while Norton’s offering dropped closer to 25% lower in download speeds. That’s not ideal, but not lagging behind some rivals. It just underlines how far ahead some VPNs are, and it’s worth considering when you’re locked in for a year, or plotting an expensive renewal. As for Mimic, Norton’s own VPN protocol, I was disappointed to find some international streaming services simply weren’t able to be unblocked with it. With that said, I did have more luck with more standardized protocols, and I’m pleased to see Norton at least give the option to shift between them. Privacy \u0026 Security VPNs worth their salt should always focus on privacy as their primary concern, and in this instance, Norton does a good job. While it remains a curious thing to prove a company has a “no logs” policy (where users and their session data aren’t logged), Norton underwent an audit from VerSprite, a security firm, just a few months ago. The 2024 audit passed Norton’s VPN, although, unlike some companies, it’s not necessarily easy to find the audit’s conclusions online (although that could be an indictment on the current state of Google search at the time of writing). Still, the company’s privacy policy has a dedicated VPN section that confirms what kind of data is included. Should you buy Norton Ultra VPN? Here’s the rub with Norton’s VPN offering. If the price was static year-on-year, I think I’d be inclined to recommend it more wholeheartedly. It’s not a bad VPN, and if you’re looking for an option that packs a whole host of cyber-security tools into one easy-to-use package, the $49.99/£24.99 a year deal is an easy sell. That hefty second-year price jump is always coming around the bend, though, and for that reason, I’d consider signing up for a year and potentially canceling to see if there’s a new customer deal after twelve months. As impressive as the security-minded tech behind Norton’s VPN is, whether it’s worth the trade-off of inflexible payment options and a decrease in speed will be down to you as the end user.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2474221/new-iphones-charge-faster-but-nowhere-near-45w.html",
    "description": "Macworld When the iPhone 16 handsets were unveiled last month, there weren’t many surprises. Most of the upgrades had been leaked long before, or accurately guessed by well-informed analysts. But not everything we heard before the event proved to be correct. One theory, supported by seemingly robust evidence, was that the new phones would bring a substantial increase in wired charging speed, all the way up to 45W if the power brick and other accessories supported it. (The 15-series iPhones deliver wired charging up to 29W.) This claim was made by a credible leaker and based on a Chinese regulatory filing. Technically, the pre-event rumor was that the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max would support 40W wired charging, but this was extended to an apparent 45W across both Pro and non-Pro models when the filing was spotted a few days after the phones had been announced and before they had been tested by reviewers. Now that independent testing has been conducted, however, it’s emerged that even the iPhone 16 Pro Max cannot deliver such charging speeds in practice. Chargerlab, which includes detailed charging tests in its review of the new premium handset, reports a maximum sustained speed of 30-31W even when using adapters as powerful as 140W. As MacRumors notes, Chargerlab’s photos appear to show the phone running at 37.06W with Apple’s own 140W charger, but it wasn’t able to sustain this speed and the site’s results suggest it didn’t manage it for long. In other words, the new iPhones deliver slightly faster (and perhaps on occasion substantially faster) wired charging than the previous generation, but in reality they don’t come close to the 45W that was expected. For a detailed analysis and testing of the new handsets, read our iPhone 16 Pro review.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2303108/m4-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs-rumors.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple’s M3-series MacBook Pro was released in the fall of 2023, but Apple has seemingly put the laptop on a more frequent update cycle, with reports of an M4 MacBook Pro coming before the end of 2024 hitting the rumor mill. In this article, we are keeping track of all the rumors about the M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. MacBook Pro M4 Release date: When will Apple update the MacBook Pro? Possible launch at an October Apple event. It’s only been a year since the M3-series MacBook Pro were introduced in October 2024, but it looks like Apple is getting ready to update them again, despite the fact that the company seems to have forgotten to update many desktop Macs to run on the M3 series chips. With the arrival of the M4 in the iPad Pro back in May it looks like the company has already done the groundwork, so surely an M4 Mac will arrive soon. All the signs indicate that Apple will launch new M4-powered Macs before the end of the year. It seems we can expect a new Mac mini, a new iMac, and new MacBook Pro models. In a mid-September 2024 newsletter Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggested that Apple will release Macs with the M4 chip “in the coming weeks.” Gurman has been making predictions about the introduction of Macs with M4 chips for some time. Back in April, he wrote that the M4 rollout would begin later in 2024 and continue throughout 2025. His prediction at that time was that in late 2024 we will see the following: Entry-level MacBook Pro, M4, 14-inch: Late 2024 iMac, M4, 24-inch: Late 2024 MacBook Pro, M4 Pro/M4 Max, 14-inch and 16-inch: Late 2024/Early 2025 Mac mini M4/M4 Pro: Late 2024/Early 2025 We could see just the entry-level MacBook Pro in October, but we think that separating the launch of the entry-level MacBook Pro from the higher-end models would be a curious move, so we expect to see the whole range of MacBook Pro, including the M4 Pro and M4 Max launched at the same time. Alternatively, Apple may want to stagger the chips and separate the M4 Pro/Max from the M4 to give the higher-end machines their own spotlight. Of course, only Apple knows what the plans are at this point. There is one indication that all three MacBook Pro types are due to be updated sooner rather than later. In June, analyst Ross Young posted (subscription required) that display panel shipments for a new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro are scheduled for Q3 2024, which could mean that a new MacBook Pro with M4-series chips may happen by the end of the year. New Apple products launch throughout the year, read: when is the next Apple event to learn more about the company’s product launch plans. MacBook Pro M4 Price: What will the new MacBook Pro cost? We don’t expect that the prices of the MacBook Pro range will change when the M4 models are introduced. Here’s how much they cost right now in the U.S. and U.K: 14-inch MacBook Pro $1,599/£1,699: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 512GB SSD $1,799/£1,899: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 1TB SSD $1,999/£2,099: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 16GB unified memory; 1TB SSD $1,999/£2,099: M3 Pro with 11-core CPU, 14-core GPU; 18GB unified memory; 512GB SSD $2,399/£2,499: M3 Pro with 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU; 18GB unified memory; 1TB SSD 3,199/£3,299: M3 Max with 14-core CPU, 30-core GPU; 36GB unified memory, 1TB SSD 16-inch MacBook Pro $2,499/£2,599: M3 Pro with 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU; 18GB unified memory; 512GB SSD $2,899/£2,999: M3 Pro with 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU; 36GB unified memory; 512GB SSD $3,499/£3,599: M3 Max with 14-core CPU, 30-core GPU; 36GB unified memory; 1TB SSD $3,999/£4,099: M3 Max with 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU; 48GB unified memory; 1TB SSD Apple will likely offer similar configurations and it remains to be seen if the prices will increase or not. MacBook Pro M4 Specs: How much better will the M4 MacBook be? Thiago Trevisan Thiago Trevisan Thiago Trevisan The AI market is sizzling hot right now so you can be sure Apple wants to make a big impression. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman back in April 2024, Apple wants to make a big splash with the M4 chip, which will have big AI enhancements. We already know some of what to expect from the M4 chip because it has already made an appearance in the iPad Pro, which faired even better than the M3 MacBook Pro in some of our tests. We know to expect a 20 percent multi-core CPU boost over the M3 (when comparing 10-core CPUs), for example. The entry-level MacBook Pro could be the one getting the biggest generational changes, with some updates addressing the disadvantages of the M3 MacBook Pro. The new entry-level model could increase the standard 8GB RAM to 16GB RAM, add more Thunderbolt ports and introduce Space Black as a color option. A leaked image propertied to be from the box for the new M4 model shows that the model will have 16GB RAM as standard, three Thunderbolt ports, and a Space Black color option. The M3 Pro model currently ships with 18GB RAM as standard. The M4 Pro and M4 Max will be variants of the base M4, implementing more CPU and GPU cores and more unified memory. Mark Gurman reported in April that Apple may increase the upper memory limit of its high-end desktop Macs. He didn’t say anything about MacBooks, but it’s not a reach to conclude that the M4 and its enhanced AI capabilities could lead to more RAM on the chip for MacBooks, too. However, design constraints could prevent the MacBooks from having an upper limit increase as big as on desktop Macs. Wi-Fi 7 support may be added now that the Wi-Fi Alliance has made the standard official. Another feature that could change is battery life. The M4 could be more efficient, or it could be more power-hungry, affecting battery life. On the basis that the A17 chips in the iPhoen 16-series brought with them better battery life we hope to see the same effects on battery life with the M4 series. MacBook Pro M4 Design: Will Apple update the design of the MacBook Pro? The M4 upgrade would be the fourth generation of this particular MacBook Pro design, first introduced in 2021. Apple isn’t expected to change it at all, so the 2024 release will likely be a chip upgrade only. As mentioned above, it looks like the Space Black color option may be available for the entry-level MacBook Pro. With the M3 model only silver or Space Grey is available. That entry-level model may also get more ports: it’s currently limited to two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, an HDMI port and SDXC card slot, headphone jack and MagSafe 3 port for charging, while the other MacBook Pro get three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port and SDXC card slot, headphone jack and MagSafe 3 port. Space Black made its debut with the M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro last fall. Space Black made its debut with the M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro last fall.Foundry Space Black made its debut with the M3 Pro/Max MacBook Pro last fall.Foundry Foundry MacBook Pro M4 Screen: Will the new MacBook Pro have a better screen? Apple increased the display brightness from 500 to 600 nits with the M3 MacBook Pro, so this probably won’t change with the M4. The size, weight, camera, mics, speakers, ports, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are likely to stay the same. Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina XDR display. Analyst Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants tweeted in August on X that display panel shipments for the MacBook Pro “are starting in July/August.” A report by Omdia states that Apple is likely to use OLED displays in the MacBook Pro, but not until 2026.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Losing Steve affected me more than it probably should have, given that I never met him or had any correspondence with him. But losing him was devastating — not just to my world, but the world. He was a sort of virtual father figure: I was always hoping that maybe Steve would notice something I did. We all wanted his attention and approval, and that drove us to do better work — even those of us who never worked at Apple. Nobody replaced him in this role. Nobody can. But as an outsider who had no personal relationship with him to mourn, it has been most depressing to consider how much of his work the world missed out on. He wasn’t taken from us after a long, complete life — he was taken in his prime. He had so much more to offer the world.",

    "description": "After the dust settles from the developer class-action settlement, the South Korean law, the JFTC announcement, and the Apple v. Epic decision, I think the most likely long-term outcome isn’t very different from the status quo — and that’s a good thing. Allowing external purchases Here’s what I think we’ll end up with: Apple will still require apps to use their IAP system for any qualifying purchases that occur in the apps themselves. All app types will be allowed to link out to a browser for other purchase methods. Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods.1 Only “Reader apps” will be exempt from this requirement.2 Apple will have many rules regarding the display, descriptions, and behavior of external purchases, many of which will be unpublished and ever-changing. App Review will be extremely harsh, inconsistent, capricious, petty, and punitive with their enforcement.3 Apple won’t require price-matching between IAP and external purchases. These few but important corrections reduce Apple’s worst behavior and should relieve most regulatory pressure. The result won’t look much different than the status quo: Most big media apps (qualifying as “reader” apps) won’t offer IAP, but will finally be allowed to link to their websites from their apps and offer purchases there. Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children (commissions from which have been the largest portion of Apple’s “services revenue” to date). Most importantly, many products, services, and business models will become possible that previously weren’t, leading to more apps, more competition, and more money going to more places. External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP (especially if Apple Pay is permitted in this context), and payment processors will reduce the burden of manual credit-card entry with shared credentials available across multiple apps. The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won’t happen, in part because App Review will prevent most obvious cases, but also because parents don’t typically offer their credit cards to untrustworthy children; and for buyers of all ages, most credit cards themselves provide stronger fraud prevention and easier recourse from unwanted charges than the App Store ever has. No side-loading I don’t expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I’m relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS. When evaluating such ideas, I merely ask myself: “What would Facebook do?” Facebook owns four of the top ten apps in the world. If side-loading became possible, Facebook could remove Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger from Apple’s App Store, requiring customers to install these extremely popular apps directly from Facebook via side-loading. And everyone would. Most people use a Facebook-owned app not because it’s a good app, but because it’s a means to an important end in their life. Social pressure, family pressure, and network lock-in prevent most users from seeking meaningful alternatives. People would jump through a few hoops if they had to. Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world. Technical limitations of the OS would prevent the most egregious abuses, but there’s a lot they could still do. We don’t need to do much imagining — they already have attempted multiple hacks, workarounds, privacy invasions, and other unscrupulous and technically invasive behavior with their apps over time to surveil user behavior outside of their app and stay running longer in the background than users intend or expect. The OS could evolve over time to reduce some of these vulnerabilities, but technical measures alone cannot address all of them. Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook’s apps would become even more monstrous than they already are. As a user and a fan of iOS, I don’t want any part of that. No alternative app stores Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store. Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger could all be available exclusively there. The majority of iOS users in the world would soon install it, and Facebook would start using leverage in other areas — apps’ social accounts, stats packages, app-install ads, ad-attribution requirements — to heavily incentivize (and likely strong-arm) a huge number of developers to offer their apps in the Facebook App Store, likely in addition to Apple’s. Maybe I’d be required to add the Facebook SDK to my app in order to be in their store, which they would then use to surveil my users. Maybe I’d need to buy app-install ads to show up in search there at all. Maybe I’d need to pay Facebook to “promote” each app update to reach more than a tiny percentage of my existing customers. And Facebook wouldn’t even be the only app store likely to become a large player on iOS. Amazon would almost certainly bring their garbage “Appstore” to iOS, but at least that one probably wouldn’t go anywhere. Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app and further marginalizing native apps when they’re already hurting. Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps. Running your own store means you can promote all of your own apps as much as you want. What giant corporation would resist? Don’t forget games! Epic and Steam would come to iOS with their own game stores. Maybe Microsoft and Nintendo, too. Maybe you’d need to install seven different app stores on your iPhone just to get the apps and games you already use — and all without App Review to keep them in check. Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews. As a user, a multiple-app-store world sounds like an annoying mess; as a developer, it terrifies me. Apple’s App Store is the devil we know. The most viable alternatives that would crop up would be far worse. Course correction The way Apple runs its business isn’t perfect, but it’s also not a democracy. I loved this part of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ decision in Apple v. Epic, as quoted by Ben Thompson’s excellent article that you should read: Apple has not offered any justification for the actions other than to argue entitlement. Where its actions harm competition and result in supracompetitive pricing and profits, Apple is wrong. I interpret “entitlement” without a negative connotation here — Apple is entitled to run their platform mostly as they wish, with governmental interference only warranted to fix market-scale issues that harm large segments of commerce or society. As a developer, I’d love to see more changes to Apple’s control over iOS. But it’s hard to make larger changes without potentially harming much of what makes iOS great for both users and developers. Judge Gonzalez Rogers got it right: we needed a minor course correction to address the most egregiously anticompetitive behavior, but most of the way Apple runs iOS is best left to Apple. If the South Korean law holds, IAP may not be required — but only in South Korea. With this exception, I expect the rest of these rules to be enforced the same way globally. ↩︎ Apple defines “reader” apps as “[allowing] a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video).” This includes many apps that Apple’s services compete with, such as Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle, that raise anticompetitive concerns among regulators and legislators when forced to give Apple 30%. ↩︎ App Review has higher-level queues for managerial review of controversial rules or edge cases, typically identifiable from the outside by an app stuck with “In Review” status for days or weeks, and often ending in a phone call from “Bill”. I’d expect any app offering external purchases to have a very high chance of being escalated to a slower, more pain-in-the-ass review process, possibly causing it not to be worthwhile for most small developers to deal with. I have no plans to add external purchases to Overcast for multiple reasons, including this — but mostly because, for my purposes, I’m satisfied with Apple’s IAP system. ↩︎",

    "description": "Apple’s leaders continue to deny developers of two obvious truths: That our apps provide substantial value to iOS beyond the purchase commissions collected by Apple. That any portion of our customers came to our apps from our own marketing or reputation, rather than the App Store. For Apple to continue to deny these is dishonest, factually wrong, and extremely insulting — not only to our efforts, but to the intelligence of all Apple developers and customers. This isn’t about the 30%, or the 15%, or the prohibition of other payment systems, or the rules against telling our customers about our websites, or Apple’s many other restrictions. (Not today, at least.) It’s about what Apple’s leadership thinks of us and our work. *     *     * It isn’t the App Store’s responsibility to the rest of Apple to “pay its way” by leveraging hefty fees on certain types of transactions. Modern society has come to rely so heavily on mobile apps that any phone manufacturer must ensure that such a healthy ecosystem exists as table stakes for anyone to buy their phones. Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today. If Apple wishes to continue advancing bizarre corporate-accounting arguments, the massive profits from the hardware business are what therefore truly “pay the way” of the App Store, public APIs, developer tools, and other app-development resources, just as the hardware profits must fund the development of Apple’s own hardware, software, and services that make the iPhone appeal to customers. The forced App Store commissions, annual developer fees, and App Store Search Ads income are all just gravy. The “way” is already paid by the hardware — but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip. And that’s just business. Apple’s a lot of things, and “generous” isn’t one. But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting. *     *     * Apple further extends the value argument, and defends their justification for forced commissions, by claiming responsibility for and ownership of the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use. This argument only makes sense — and even then, only somewhat — when apps are installed by a customer browsing the App Store, finding an app they hadn’t previously heard of, and choosing to install it based on App Store influence alone. But in the common case — and for most app installations, the much more common case — of searching for a specific app by name or following a link or ad based on its developer’s own marketing or reputation, Apple has served no meaningful role in the customer acquisition and “deserves” nothing more from the transaction than what a CDN and commodity credit-card processor would charge. The idea that the App Store is responsible for most customers of any reasonably well-known app is a fantasy. It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS — it’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. For Apple to continue to claim otherwise is beyond insulting, and borders on delusion. *     *     * At WWDC next week, these same people are going to try to tell us a different story. They’re going to tell us how amazing we are, how important our work is, and how much they value us. And for thousands of Apple employees who’ve made the great products and platforms that we love, including the hundreds of engineers presenting the sessions and working the labs, it’ll be genuine and true. But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how much they value our work. Please forgive some sloppiness in my metaphors or phrasing — my writing skills are pretty rusty — and I’ll return the favor to anyone who responds.",

    "description": "A summary of today’s changes to 3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods: Your app must use Apple’s in-app-purchase (IAP) system for all purchases made in the app. Unless they’re purchases for goods or services that are consumed outside the app, in which case you are prohibited from using IAP. Unless those goods or services consumed outside the app are magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, in which case, you are required to use IAP. But if your app only “reads” previously purchased magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, and doesn’t mention the possibility of purchases anywhere in the app, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless you offer account creation, in which case, you are required to use IAP. Unless you only offer free account creation, in which case, you don’t need to use IAP. But if you offer paid upgrades from free accounts within the app, you are required to use IAP. Except for accounts that were created outside the app, which can offer paid account upgrades and don’t need to use IAP. If you’re selling “experiences” between people, you don’t need to use IAP. Unless those “experiences” include three or more people, or aren’t consumed live, in which case, you are required to use only IAP. If your purchase is for services, features, or game items, you are required to use only IAP. Unless you operate on multiple platforms, in which case, you can also offer purchasing outside the app. But you can’t tell anyone about it. Unless you get their contact info somewhere else, in which case, you can tell them about it, but not in the app. You are required to use IAP even if you sell your app or service directly to other people. Unless you only sell it to businesses or groups for their employees or students to use, in which case, you still must use IAP, but you can include your own payment method as well. Unless those groups are families, or unless those employees or students are somehow “consumers”, in which case, you must only use IAP. Do I have that right? *     *     * How about an alternative that’s clear, fair, reasonable, and consistently enforceable? Apps may offer other payment mechanisms in their app, as long as terms are clear and customers aren’t misled, and may or may not choose to implement in-app purchase based on its merits. In one stroke, antitrust and regulatory pressure disappear, developer relations are significantly repaired, and Apple can go back to spending its time, resources, PR, and political capital on making their products better and customers happier.",

    "title": "Introducing Voice Boost 2: Remaster your podcasts",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/31/voiceboost2",
    "description": "The latest update to Overcast includes a feature that I’m especially proud of that took over a year to build. Voice Boost 2 is an all-new audio engine that includes professional-grade, mastering-quality loudness normalization. When I first introduced Overcast in 2014, Voice Boost was one of its headlining features: Voice Boost is a combination of dynamic compression and equalization that can make many shows more listenable and normalize volume across all shows. This makes amateur-produced podcasts (including many of my favorites) more listenable in loud environments, like cars, where you’d otherwise need to crank the volume so loudly to hear the quiet parts that you’d blow your ears out when the loudest person spoke. Voice Boost 2 achieves the same goal as the original Voice Boost, but with dramatically more sophisticated methods, leading to more consistent results and much better sound quality. Goals When I wrote the original Voice Boost with only a rudimentary understanding of audio processing, it was a single configuration of Apple’s AudioUnits that applied a fixed set of parameters to all podcasts, regardless of their audio characteristics. It was an effective but blunt tool, relying on aggressive level compression and a strong EQ to make the compression less noticeable. Since then, I’ve edited over 500 podcasts, learned a lot more about how to master them properly, and developed a much better understanding of audio signal processing. I set out to develop a better, smarter, and more refined Voice Boost that took advantage of everything I’d learned, with these audio goals: The effect should be much more subtle: mostly just consistent volume, plus slightly smoother tone. It should analyze the input audio and apply just enough processing to achieve a consistent volume level, modifying already-good audio as little as possible. It should sound good, and consistent, regardless of the volume dynamics of its input. Quality should be so good that I can even play high-quality music through it1 and not notice any artifacts. And these technical goals: Like Smart Speed and the original Voice Boost, it had to work as a streaming process, easily toggled on and off at will, without needing to scan the entire file first or look very far ahead. The code had to be pure C, with highly optimized and vectorized code, so it wouldn’t be a major power drain on older phones and could potentially run on much lower-power devices as well. I had to write every component from scratch, without using AudioUnits, because I wanted to understand and control everything, ensure the highest performance and sound quality, and avoid Apple’s platform-specific API limits.2 It had to be modular and easily customizable, like a channel strip in an audio editor, so I could adjust the processing during development and testing, offer user customization down the road, and use the same engine to build myself a modular podcast-preproduction tool to save time in my weekly workflow (which I’ve been using for over a year).3 Live LUFS normalization Since Voice Boost is mostly about high-quality volume analysis and loudness normalization, I went straight to the top, implementing the ITU BS.1770–4 standard that gives us the LUFS measurement seen in high-end audio editors. Overcast now measures and adjusts podcast levels using this broadcast-standard perceptual loudness algorithm, at full quality, with no preprocessing. Voice Boost 2 normalizes all podcasts to –14 LUFS — a level I chose because it closely matches the volume of Siri and most iOS turn-by-turn navigation voices, so when you’re listening to a podcast while driving, navigation interruptions are less jarring. Most professionally produced podcasts are already mastered to similar volume levels, so Voice Boost 2 won’t overcompress them with aggressive processing — it’ll only apply as much correction as necessary to make them all the same volume. A brief tutorial on clipping and distortion This is about to get nerdier, but bear with me. (Yes, nerdier than ITU broadcast-loudness standards.) Given a loudness measurement for the incoming audio, quieter podcasts need to be amplified to reach the target. But perceived loudness isn’t the peak of the incoming audio stream — it’s more of an average. Quiet-sounding audio can still have brief moments of loud peaks. When increasing the volume of digital audio, the biggest challenge is not “clipping” during the peaks — not having any part of the signal pass above the volume ceiling of 0 dB. (It’s a negative scale. This is also why the LUFS value above, which is closely related to the decibel scale used here, is negative.) Here’s the highest the signal should go, showing the individual audio samples (green dots) that can be processed by a podcast app before the DAC transforms them into audio (smooth green line): It’ll sound right as long as the audio doesn’t cross above that top line (0 dB). Increase the volume even slightly too far, and some of the samples just slam into it and stay there, losing the tops of their smooth curves: And that sounds terrible. But I can’t just cap all the samples right below the limit and call it a day — that’s called a brickwall limiter — because then the shape of the audio line will actually represent different frequencies, telling the DAC to add noise that wasn’t really there. Here, the bottom of each image shows the frequency breakdown: The unclipped signal (left) shows only its original frequency of about 2100 Hz, but a basic brickwall limiter (right) results in the unwanted introduction of a bunch of extra frequencies. That’s distortion. (If this is interesting to you, learn more about audio sampling theory here.) Lookahead limiter Avoiding audible distortion requires a lookahead limiter, which looks… ahead (😎) at the audio coming down the pipeline, and smoothly ramps the volume amplification down as a loud peak is approaching, then back up again afterward, just enough to avoid clipping and audible distortion, but so quickly that you don’t notice.4 After Voice Boost 2’s complete 32-bit audio processing pipeline, the last stage is a lookahead limiter, configured such that it can’t clip, no matter what audio comes through. This gives vast flexibility in volume processing without sacrificing quality. Voice Boost 2 also incorporates a dynamics compressor, but over time, I’ve kept reducing its strength as I’ve found it less necessary. Proper LUFS processing with a great lookahead limiter provides excellent volume normalization with almost no compression needed afterward. True-peak detection There’s one more way to introduce clipping that needs to be guarded against. Digital audio is represented by samples that represent a point in time (green dots, again) on a sound wave (green line). But the sampled points don’t always land at the exact peaks of those waves: The most common way to measure the peak of a waveform is to find the greatest absolute sample value. By this method, the top waveform peaks here would measure about –6 dB and –1.5 dB, respectively. But the actual peak amplitudes of these waves is –1 dB! A simple limiter could still output clipped audio because it’s not seeing the true peaks. Voice Boost 2’s limiter performs true-peak detection, rather than simply measuring sample peaks, to avoid this type of clipping and further reduce distortion. Mastering-quality processing for everyone Voice Boost 2 is a mastering-quality audio-processing pipeline that applies broadcast-standard loudness normalization, light compression and EQ, and a true-peak lookahead limiter to your podcasts, in real time, without sacrificing quality or battery life. And it runs at less than 1% CPU usage on an iPhone SE.5 I intend to expose some of its customizability to customers in future updates, but I wanted to develop and ship the best default settings first to keep the app simple and usable to everyone. Now that it’s available to everyone, I may still subtly tweak the defaults in response to feedback. But as I’ve refined the settings during the beta period to be more universal, less customization has been necessary.6 Having achieved its goals of being more consistent and less aggressive, Voice Boost 2 is intentionally transparent. It’s not promoted more in the app or even labeled “Voice Boost 2”. It’s still Voice Boost — just better now. If I did my job well, you’ll hardly notice it at all. You’ll have no idea that your podcasts are being remastered in your pocket. But I’ll know. And the handful of you who really care will know. And that’s enough for me. Voice Boost 2 is in today’s update (2020.1), along with these new features: AirPlay 2: Overcast can now play to HomePods and other AirPlay 2 devices much more responsively, with full-blown Smart Speed and Voice Boost, on iOS 13.1 and above.7 Skip intros/outros: There’s a new per-podcast setting to skip a given number of seconds from the start and/or end of its episodes. Clip-sharing from private feeds. In retrospect, this restriction was unnecessary, so I lifted it. Restored iOS 12 compatibility. Going 13-only so soon was a mistake. Hear why on Under The Radar 181 and 183. As usual, all of this is free for everyone in Overcast. Those awesome Trey Anastasio acoustic shows are pretty quiet. ↩︎ Apple doesn’t make all of their audio APIs available on all platforms: some are Mac-only and never came to iOS, and watchOS has an even smaller subset than iOS. The more I can accomplish in my own code, the less I depend on Apple’s choices for which APIs they make available to developers. ↩︎ It’s just a command-line tool for now. You don’t want it. (But if you do… someday, maybe.) ↩︎ This all happens in milliseconds. ↩︎ At 1X, with Smart Speed enabled. Smart Speed was actually entirely rewritten as part of Voice Boost 2, but it’s less interesting. It performs the same job as before, but much more efficiently, and taking advantage of the measured loudness when Voice Boost is also enabled. ↩︎ For instance, I also built a de-esser into Voice Boost 2, but it slowly became unnecessary as I improved the other processing, so it’s not currently enabled. ↩︎ Smart Speed is a big deal here, I think — I’m not aware of any other podcast apps with silence-skipping over AirPlay 2. (Or LUFS normalization, or true-peak lookahead limiters.) ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode for Mac laptops: making the case again",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux",
    "description": "In light of today’s rumor that a Pro Mode may be coming that seems to offer benefits in the opposite direction,1 I wanted to re-make the case for a Low Power Mode on macOS — and explain why now is the time. Modern hardware constantly pushes thermal and power limits, trying to strike a balance that minimizes noise and heat while maximizing performance and battery life. Software also plays a role, trying to keep everything background-updated, content-indexed, and photo-analyzed so it’s ready for us when we want it, but not so aggressively that we notice any cost to performance or battery life. Apple’s customers don’t usually have control over these balances, and they’re usually fixed at design time with little opportunity to adapt to changing circumstances or customer priorities. The sole exception, Low Power Mode on iOS, seems to be a huge hit: by offering a single toggle that chooses a different balance, people are able to greatly extend their battery life when they know they’ll need it.2 Mac laptops need Low Power Mode, too. I believe so strongly in its potential because I’ve been using it on my laptops (in a way) for years, and it’s fantastic. I’ve been disabling Intel Turbo Boost on my laptops with Turbo Boost Switcher Pro most of the time since 2015. In 2018, I first argued for Low Power Mode on macOS with a list of possible tweaks, concluding that disabling Turbo Boost was still the best bang-for-the-buck tweak to improve battery life without a noticeable performance cost in most tasks.3 Recently, as Intel has crammed more cores and higher clocks into smaller form factors and pushed thermal limits to new extremes, the gains have become even more significant. Here’s some thermal testing from my 8-core 16-inch MacBook Pro: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 16-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2019, 2.4 GHz 8-core i9)   Power Temp. Geekbench 5 single/multi xcodebuild Normal 82W 90°C 1260/7386 39 sec. No Turbo 31W−62% 65°C 669/5206−46/29% 62 sec.+59% With Turbo Boost disabled, peak CPU power consumption drops by 62%, with a correspondingly huge reduction in temperature. This has two massive benefits: The fans never audibly spin up. When Turbo Boost is enabled, the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load. Disable it, and it’s almost impossible to get them to be audible. It runs significantly cooler. Turbo Boost lets laptops get too hot to comfortably hold in your lap, and so much heat radiates out that it can make hands sweaty. Disable it, and the laptop only gets moderately warm, not hot, and hands stay comfortably dry. I haven’t done formal battery testing on the 16-inch, since it’s so difficult and time-consuming to do in a controlled way that’s actually useful to people, but anecdotally, I’m seeing similar battery gains by disabling Turbo Boost that I’ve seen with previous laptops: significantly longer battery life that I’d estimate to be between 30–50%. This comes at a cost to performance, but: It’s not noticeable on most workloads. Parallel workloads are affected far less than single-threaded tasks, and most modern heavy workloads are parallelized. This is an 8-core laptop that’s competitive with my iMac Pro! It’s much faster than most people need (myself included) most of the time, so I can spare some performance to get other benefits. A fast laptop isn’t very useful if your hands are too sweaty to type, the battery dies in the middle of a flight, or the loud fans ruin your audio recording. When I really want to maximize performance, Turbo Boost Switcher Pro lets me quickly toggle it in the menu bar, so switching between modes is easy. The vast majority of the time I’m using it, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a much better laptop with Turbo Boost disabled. It’s still fast enough to do everything I need (including significant development with Xcode), while remaining silent and cool, with incredible battery life. But soon, I bet I won’t be able to do this anymore. Turbo Boost Switcher Pro relies on a kernel extension that’s grandfathered into Apple’s latest security requirements, but it can never be updated — and when macOS Catalina loads it for the first time, it warns that it’ll be “incompatible with a future version of macOS.” I suspect that this is the last year I’ll get to run the latest OS and be able to turn off Turbo Boost at will, making all of my future laptop usage significantly worse. Please, Apple, make this feature official: give us a Low Power Mode for macOS that disables Turbo Boost to keep our laptops cool, quiet, and long-lasting at times when those are more important to us than speed. My guess is that “Pro Mode” doesn’t raise the peak performance, but instead raises the fan speeds to allow longer sustained operation at high Turbo Boost speeds. ↩︎ Low Power Mode has been so successful on iOS that Apple also thought it worthwhile to add a Low Data Mode to iOS 13, offering similar control over data usage. (Mac owners can get similar functionality with the excellent TripMode.) ↩︎ As I wrote back then, disabling discrete GPUs and Photos analysis are other obvious contributors to a good Mac Low Power Mode. ↩︎",

    "title": "The 16-inch MacBook Pro",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16",
    "description": "After my first day with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, I’m very optimistic about it. 🎧  Hear more on today’s Accidental Tech Podcast! Two years ago, I wrote a wishlist to fix the MacBook Pro, and the 16-inch doesn’t actually deliver most of it. But time and technological progress are slowly getting Apple off the hook: The ports are unchanged. We’ll still need dongles. But USB-C is gradually becoming more common, and dongles are slowly — very slowly — getting less shitty. The Touch Bar isn’t optional. But a new hardware Esc key removes one of its biggest drawbacks, and accidental input should be reduced by the increased spacing between the Touch Bar and the top row of keys. The power brick still lacks its previous conveniences. There’s still no cable management, safety breakaway, or charging LED. But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps. The headphone jack is still on the right (wrong) side, despite most single-sided headphone cables entering the left earcup. But the need for wired headphones is decreasing over time. Addressing those would be nice, but as I wrote then, they paled in comparison to one huge issue: the butterfly keyboard. The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches. If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro, it should be this. It’s far more important than anything else on this list. […] The Magic Keyboard’s scissor switches feel similar, but with a bit more travel, and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations. […] The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro: returning to the “inverted-T” arrow-key arrangement by making the left- and right-arrow keys half-height again. This arrangement is much more natural and less error-prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the “T” shape, a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row. That’s exactly what they’ve done, and I couldn’t be happier. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a great computer in most other ways, but so were the MacBook Pros from the last few years. They were fast, powerful, capable workstations… but the butterfly keyboard took away from it all. Not anymore. I’m on cloud nine. Look at this glorious keyboard! An Esc key! Inverted-T arrow keys! A millimeter of key travel! Enough spacing between the keys for our fingers to accurately orient themselves! And keystrokes will probably work, 100% of the time, for years! Five years ago, nobody would’ve considered any of these noteworthy, and readers would’ve suspected you weren’t of sound mind if you included them in a review. Five years ago, laptop keyboards were fine. Everyone was pretty much satisfied with the ones they had, they worked, and we never had to talk or think about them. Today, finally, we begin heading back to that world. The butterfly keyboard was an anomaly — it was a huge departure from everything else we’d ever used, mostly not in good ways. The new keyboard is very similar to the recent desktop Magic Keyboard, and I expect it to have a wide appeal, just as the Magic Keyboard does. It has slightly less travel and spacing, but the overall feeling is very similar — and it’s nothing at all like the butterfly keyboard. I absolutely love it — not because it’s the most amazing keyboard in the world, but because it’s completely forgettable in the best possible way. It just feels normal again. There’s a lot more to love about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The screen and battery are bigger, but the size and weight barely increased. It’s almost as fast as my iMac Pro, and the new thermals can sustain higher performance. The speakers and microphone got huge, unexpected improvements. And I didn’t get everything I wanted. But many of my wishlist items fall outside of what Apple is likely to ever do, and all of them are much less important than making the computer’s primary input device functional, acceptable, and reliable. Now we have the luxury of being able to complain about less-urgent wishes. The biggest change is that I finally don’t feel like it’s constantly fighting me. Its design doesn’t feel spiteful. It’s a computer that doesn’t seem to hate being a computer. I’m not afraid to use it in the world, and I’m not avoiding using it because it’s unpleasant. The butterfly keyboard was the opposite, it never got better, I never got used to it, and good riddance to it. Following in the footsteps of the fantastic iMac Pro, updated Mac Mini, and upcoming Mac Pro, the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro ends a painful chapter of neglect and hubristic design of the Mac. Apple has finally turned the ship around. We haven’t had long enough to fully test it yet. There may be flaws or shortcomings discovered over time — there usually are (and always have been). But frankly, it could catch fire twice a week and it would still be my favorite laptop Apple has made since 2015. Fortunately, upon initial usage, nothing bad really jumps out. The new MacBook Pro has no massive asterisks or qualifications. It’s a great computer, period, and it feels so good to be able to say that again. For the first time in years, without any major exceptions, we can see that Apple loves computers as much as we do. 🎧  Much more detail and discussion in the podcast!",

    "title": "Overcast summer update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/07/21/overcast-summer-update",
    "description": "Today’s Overcast update (2019.6) brings some great new features. But first, I need to set low expectations for iOS 13, watchOS 6, and macOS Catalina updates this fall. Halfway through the summer, I’ve made much less progress than expected, having been overwhelmed by the required OS changes, my own technical and design debts, and unusually rough betas. Rather than shipping a big iOS update, a standalone Watch app, and a Mac app on day one, these will probably come incrementally over the next year. Fortunately, I haven’t stopped improving the app in the meantime. Per-podcast customization, longer clips You can now set download-vs.-stream and auto-delete behavior per podcast, one of the most frequently requested features over the last few years. (Sorry it took so long — it required a lot of server-side work for uninteresting reasons.) I’ve also raised the clip-sharing length limit to 90 seconds. When I debuted this feature, I had to guess how it would be used and received, and 60 seconds seemed like a good limit. In practice, that’s sometimes a bit too short to capture a complete thought. 90 seconds should be better — most clips won’t need to be that long, but it’ll be nice to have the headroom when you need it. “Suggestions for You” replacing Twitter Overcast has had a Twitter-powered social-recommendations feature since version 1.0 in 2014, which made sense at the time: I didn’t have any popularity data to generate recommendations from, and social networks were nicer places to be than they are today. But after five years, only 10% of active users have connected a Twitter account in Overcast, and only 0.2% of new podcast subscriptions have actually been added via Twitter recommendations. Not only was the feature not providing much value to the 10% of people who enabled it, but the other 90% of Overcast’s customers haven’t been getting personalized recommendations at all. In the meantime, I’ve accumulated five years of popularity data, so I tried writing my own recommendation engine. It worked — and it’s better. Overcast now offers its own data-driven recommendation engine, and I’ve removed Twitter integration entirely. Podcasts in the new “Suggestions for You” section of the Add Podcast screen are based on the shows you subscribe to, and what else their subscribers subscribe to, which gives much better recommendations without involving any social networks. Most importantly, it works for all of Overcast’s customers. *     *     * As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Give it a try.",

    "title": "Apple is Listening",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/06/09/apple-is-listening",
    "description": "Something big changed at Apple around the beginning of 2017. They had encountered significant turbulence in the product line over the preceding years, especially Macs. It was a rough time to be a pro Mac user. The “trash can” 2013 Mac Pro addressed only a fraction of the needs solved by the previous “cheese grater” towers, aged quickly without critical upgrade paths, and suffered from high GPU-failure rates from its cooling solution — all because its design prioritized size and appearance over performance and versatility in the one Mac model that should never make that tradeoff. Over the next few years, it became clear that the Mac Pro was an embarrassing, outdated flop that Apple seemed to have little intention of ever updating, leaving its customers feeling unheard and abandoned. I think Apple learned a small lesson from it, but they learned a much bigger one a few years later. The current MacBook Pro generation launched in late 2016, and I think Apple was truly caught completely by surprise when the new Touch Bar, sparse USB-C-only port offerings, high prices, and highly polarizing butterfly keyboard were met with harsh criticism, mixed reviews, and high failure rates. This one really hurt: while the Mac Pro is a niche machine for the highest-end and most-specialized needs, the popular MacBook Pro is the lifeblood of the Mac. By the end of 2016, in addition to the generally buggy, neglected state macOS seemed to be perpetually stuck in, Apple had replaced its entire “pro” Mac lineup with controversial, limiting products that seemed optimized to flex Apple’s industrial-design muscles rather than actually addressing their customers’ needs. The only company that can make computers for our OS seemed incapable of making good computers anymore. Each update threatened to remove or break things we needed or loved. Their newest designs felt punitive, rather than feeling like a celebration of computing. Then, in April 2017, out of nowhere, Apple held a Mac Pro roundtable discussion with the press to announce that they were in the early stages of completely redesigning the Mac Pro.1 The follow-up briefing a year later promised that the new Mac Pro would be released in 2019, and publicized the existence of a “Pro Workflow Team” of real pro users working inside Apple to inform the direction of their pro hardware and software. It sounded like they’d gone from not listening to their customers at all to an institutionalized process of listening. And the newly designed Macs released since then have been great.2 The late-2017 iMac Pro, which I’m using to write this, is the best Mac I’ve ever owned by far. It’s versatile, incredibly powerful, beautiful, and silent. It’s so good that I’ll probably never really need a Mac Pro again,3 and if this was the only new “Mac Pro”, I’d be mostly fine with that. The late-2018 Mac Mini replaced a pitiful, punitive, neglected relic with a practical, powerful mini-Mac-Pro. Apple could’ve let it die, or replaced it with a tiny, no-port marvel of uselessness, but instead, they made a computer so good that I started and ended a YouTube mini-career just to review it. And the 2019 Mac Pro, finally unveiled last week, looks to be absolutely killer — it’s the first true successor to the tower Mac Pro, which saw its last real update almost a decade ago in 2010.4 It’s big, bulky, ludicrously fast, and almost obscenely upgradeable — exactly what a Mac Pro needs to be, and far better than any of us expected. The new Mac Pro is, truly, a celebration of computing. Even more importantly than any hardware releases, macOS itself has also seen massive engineering effort recently. For the first time in a decade, the Mac was a major focus of WWDC, with great new APIs poised to usher in a huge wave of fresh software. To be fair, this story hasn’t ended yet. The Mac Pro isn’t actually out yet (and will be very expensive), they still need to resolve the problematic MacBook Pro with its next generation (rumors are promising), and the lack of standalone Apple displays under six thousand dollars really hurts the Mac Pro story.5 But I’m optimistic for the first time in years. It’s hard to tell when Apple is listening. They speak concisely, infrequently, and only when they’re ready, saying absolutely nothing in the meantime, even when we’re all screaming about a product line as if it’s on fire. They make great progress, but often with courageous losses that never get reversed, so an extended silence because we’re stuck with a change forever is indistinguishable from an extended silence because the fix isn’t ready yet. But there has clearly been a major shift in direction for the better since early 2017, and they couldn’t be more clear now: Apple is listening again, they’ve still got it, and the Mac is back. Based on what we’ve learned since, they had likely started the project a very short time before holding the roundtable. ↩︎ I’m excluding the 2018 MacBook Air because it feels like a stopgap that wasn’t originally planned to exist — the no-Touch-Bar 13” MacBook “Escape” seemed intended to replace it — that was rushed into the 2016-era generation mid-cycle, rather than being the first of a new design. Even so, with the large exception of the butterfly keyboard, it’s quite good. ↩︎ This doesn’t necessarily mean I won’t buy one. ↩︎ The 2010/“2012” Mac Pro was so good, and so upgradeable, that it’s still in surprisingly widespread use today for needs that weren’t possible or compelling on the “trashcan” successor. ↩︎ And the MacBook Pro. A very common setup for developers — Apple’s largest identified segment of pro users — is a 15” MacBook Pro connected to an external monitor, for which a good solution no longer exists. Developers would be much better served by a $1,500-ish standalone version of the iMac’s 5K display than a $6,000 XDR reference monitor for professional video colorists. ↩︎",

    "title": "Clip sharing with Overcast",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/04/27/overcast-clip-sharing",
    "description": "Sharing podcasts has never been easy, but I’ve always tried to lead the way with Overcast, with publicly shareable episode links and optional recommendations from your Twitter friends since version 1.0 in 2014. Podcast sharing has been limited to audio and links, but today’s social networks are more reliant on images and video, especially Instagram. Podcasts need video clips to be shared more easily today. I’ve seen some video clips from tools specific to certain podcast networks or hosts, but they were never available to everyone, or for every show. So people mostly just haven’t shared podcast clips, understandably, because it has been too hard. Not anymore. ▶️ ↩️ This remark on Unco by Stephen Hackett inspired me to finally solve this problem in a way that worked easily, for all podcasts, for both podcasters and listeners to use. With today’s 2019.4 update1, you can now share audio or video clips, up to a minute each, from any public podcast. Simply tap the share button in the upper-right corner. You can generate an audio clip, or portrait, landscape, or square video, using your current Overcast theme setting. In order to help spread podcasts further, I didn’t want to be heavy-handed in the Overcast branding — not everyone wants to advertise for one specific podcast app when promoting their shows. So the “Shared with Overcast” badge is optional, and if you’d like, you can also add an Apple Podcasts badge. Finally, I wanted to extend the same app-agnosticism to Overcast’s share links. While this design still needs a lot of modernization, I’ve done a small refresh: Now, for non-logged-in visitors, Overcast’s public sharing pages display badges for other podcast apps and the RSS feed for any podcast listed in Apple Podcasts. It’s important for me to promote other apps like this, and to make it easy even for other people’s customers to benefit from Overcast’s sharing features, because there are much bigger threats than letting other open-ecosystem podcast apps get a few more users. For podcasting to remain open and free, we must not leave major shortcomings for proprietary, locked-down services to exploit.2 Conversely, the more we strengthen the open podcast ecosystem with content, functionality, and ease of use, the larger the barrier becomes that any walled garden must overcome to be compelling. One of the most common shortcomings we hear is that podcasts are hard to share. Hopefully, Overcast’s new clip-sharing feature changes that, and other apps build similar features soon. So go get Overcast and start sharing your favorite moments. It’ll help me, of course, but more importantly, it’ll help your favorite shows gain listeners, and it’ll strengthen the amazing, open, standards-based world of podcasting. Like Slopes and Castro, I’ve changed to a date-based version-numbering scheme — 2019.4 is the fourth update released in 2019, the next version will be 2019.5, and so on — partly because version numbers don’t really matter anymore, but mostly because I no longer wanted to delay completed features until a major-version change or worry that I didn’t do enough to justify a certain number. ↩︎ YouTube was able to dominate video because it made everything easy in a medium that (at the time) was very hard to do elsewhere. If a proprietary service takes a very hard aspect of podcasting and makes it very easy, it may rapidly rise to prominence. Other major shortcomings I’m concerned about: the difficulty of getting sponsorships for small shows (“AdSense for podcasts”), and the complexity of creation and publishing (“Tumblr for podcasts”). This is probably why Spotify bought Anchor. ↩︎",

    "description": "▶️ The first thing someone does in a podcast app is add some podcasts, and most active Overcast users add at least two new podcasts each month. Over 80% of podcasts are added to Overcast by searching, with the vast majority as searches for a specific podcast by name (rather than searching for generic keywords, such as “business”). Good search is a critical, differentiating feature of any podcast app. I’m not satisfied if the podcast you’re looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list — I want it to be the first one, displayed quickly, after typing the fewest characters possible. I’ve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data. Instant Search is the next step in Overcast’s search evolution. It combines a small local cache with a highly optimized search service to give the most relevant results immediately as you type, even after only a single letter.1 It’s a dramatic, delightful improvement to a critical, frequently used feature. This was a lot of fun to build, and I’m proud of it. See for yourself! Overcast is free on the App Store. If Instant Search isn’t instant right after you update, the cache hasn’t fully downloaded yet. It’s downloaded weekly, only on Wi-Fi, and is less than 5 MB. ↩︎",

Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made. And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility. I don’t think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following four years that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard. Not anymore. The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and it’s spectacular. It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age. Ports! Glorious ports! Number one — and this is a big one these days, especially for this product — is that it’s not any less useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.2 It’s the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who don’t want it to get fewer ports or worse performance. The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs can’t with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.) The base price has increased to $800, and that’s not great. It’s partly justifiable because it’s much higher-end than before — the processors are much better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard — but it’s still an expensive product in absolute terms. Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review — 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD — which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This would’ve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when it’s specced up like this, it’s targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable. And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception. Benchmarks The big story to me is how incredibly fast this thing is. Granted, I’m testing the fastest CPU offered, but damn. Geekbench results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than every other Mac today (!) at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro. “Performance-competitive with pro Macs” was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are. As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years, Apple has found other ways to improve performance. The T2 is great for lots of security reasons — I wouldn’t buy a new Mac these days without it — but what you’re seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller. This Mac Mini builds my app, Overcast, much faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, it’s not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time — it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory — but the result is that it’s incredibly fast as a development machine. The Blackmagick Disk Speed Test shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date, and a huge improvement over the four-year-old Mac Mini. A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with ffmpeg. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both. But if an app supports the T2’s hardware HEVC encoder,3 it can go much faster. And since every T2 so far performs identically, all T2 machines — from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro — encode HEVC this way at the same speed, and all in complete silence because they’re barely touching the CPU. I wasn’t able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with x265 and the T2’s hardware acceleration. The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. It’s fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, you’re better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup. Many Mac lines rely on Intel’s integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs. We often blame Intel’s CPU roadmap (or Apple’s seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intel’s GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intel’s fault, but it’s Apple’s problem — and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers. But that’s it — aside from price, that’s the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome. If you don’t need a strong GPU — and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases don’t — this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and it’s more like a mini-Mac Pro. A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing Gruber’s format: It’s silent at idle. The i7’s fan noise does become clearly audible when it’s under heavy load: it’s in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter. Interestingly, I disabled Turbo Boost to simulate the base i3 model’s thermals, and couldn’t get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3. This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still don’t have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isn’t.) You can upgrade the RAM again! I never would’ve guessed this was coming, and I believe it’s the first time in a long time that an Apple product’s direct successor became more upgradeable and serviceable. I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, it’s back. (The security screws inside — TR6? — still need some iFixit tools to get past.) I Can’t Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Can’t Even Say “Again” Because It Never Was A new Mac Mini could’ve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive — a similar pattern to Apple’s other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops. Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect — a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better. We didn’t know until now whether the iMac Pro’s greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that they’re going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year. The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again. Of course, with Apple’s track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or it’s the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we’ll all be hoarding them in a few years. We can’t know yet. But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer. I do this via iSCSI, but I wouldn’t recommend it. It breaks and requires a new $200+ iSCSI initiator with almost every macOS update — which is why my Mac Mini still runs Sierra. In the near future, I’ll just directly attach some giant external hard drives to the Mac Mini and stop using the NAS. ↩︎ Unless you used optical audio, audio input, or the SD-card reader. (Shit, I use optical in and out.) ↩︎ ffmpeg can do it by specifying -c:v hevc_videotoolbox instead of -c:v x265. I also needed -vtag hvc1 for the output MP4s with either codec to be playable on macOS. Compressor uses the T2’s HEVC acceleration when encoding 8-bit HEVC, but not 10-bit. ↩︎",

If that took you a bit longer than usual to tell the time on the Apple Watch’s new default Infograph face, you’re not alone: John Gruber finds it “far too busy” Jason Snell finds it “pretty and packed with features”, but misses hour numerals Zac Hall removes almost everything to improve legibility David Smith wrote his own complications (!) to improve contrast I’ve configured mine acceptably, but Utility is still far more legible for telling the time at a quick glance: Infograph, Utility Infograph suffers from two major issues: The center complications reduce the contrast between the dial and hands, often making the hands hard to locate. This is avoidable with customization, although the defaults should be much more conservative. It takes too much cognitive effort (and therefore time) to distinguish the current hour. This is simply a flawed design. It’s faster and easier to read analog time with the 1–12 numerals displayed on a watch, but many people prefer the cleaner look of a watch that uses lines, dots, or other shapes as hour markers instead. (Watch people call these “indices”.) And it’s absolutely possible to design a highly legible dial with hour indices in many different styles. Here are some classics and modern takes:1 Across a wide variety of brands, styles, and price points, a few key design principles are clear: The hour markers for 12 (and often 3/6/9) are more prominent. The hour indices are much larger than the minute markings. The hour hands nearly touch the hour indices. These all improve legibility by making it as fast and easy as possible to know which hour is being indicated (and minimize the chance of an off-by-one error), first by orienting your eyes to the current rotation with the 12 marker, then by minimizing the distance between the hour hand and the indices it’s between. Apple Watch’s analog faces all fail to achieve these principles:2 Color, Simple, Explorer Color, Simple, and Explorer have easily distinguished hour markers, but Explorer’s are a bit too far from its hour hand. None of them have distinguished 12 markers to aid in orientation. While Explorer omits minute markings altogether, Simple bafflingly uses 30-second markings in place of its minute track, making time-telling even harder. I’ve never seen another watch with sub-minute markings identical to its minute markings. Activity Analog, Utility, and Infograph without most complications Activity Analog’s hour markers are faint and far from its hour hand, and the central activity rings quickly eliminate the hands’ contrast against the dial as they progress. Utility (when configured without numbers) improves legibility slightly with its bold hour indices, but they’re still too small and too far from its hour hand, and there’s no differentiation for the 12 index. Infograph is similar, but even worse: its hour indices are more faint, it uses 30-second markings instead of minute markings, and its default Calendar display wipes out the top three indices. (At least you can tell which way is up.) Even with almost no complications, the basic essence of the Infograph dial has poor time legibility. When it’s being used as Apple seems to intend, time-telling at a glance is so difficult that many people have actually suggested setting the digital time as the center complication, at which point the hands are just a nuisance and we should stop pretending it’s an analog face. It’s great for Apple to offer a wide variety of Apple Watch faces, but most of them are short-lived novelties at best. We’re three years and four generations into the Apple Watch, and almost every Watch owner I know still uses the same handful of “good” faces. If you want digital time with a good deal of complications, Modular is your only good choice (or Infograph Modular on the Series 4).3 If you want analog time with numerals, Utility is the only good option. If you want indices instead of numerals — probably the most popular analog watch style in the world — I don’t think there is a good option. By now, we’ve seen Apple’s design range that they’re willing to ship as Watch faces, and while it seems broad at first glance, it’s actually pretty narrow. And we’re restricted to the handful of good watch faces that Apple makes, because other developers aren’t allowed to make custom Watch faces. The Apple Watch is an amazing feat of technology. It’s a computer. It can display anything. With no mechanical or physical limitations to hold us back, any watch-face design from anyone could plausibly be built, enabling a range of creativity, style, and usefulness that no single company could ever design on its own. But they won’t let us. In a time when personal expression and innovation in watch fashion should be booming, they’re instead being eroded, as everyone in the room is increasingly wearing the same watch with the same two faces. Open this door, Apple. You can even see which model the Apple Watch’s hand shape comes from, which is not a coincidence. ↩︎ For Apple Watch faces offering multiple hour/minute styles, I selected the best one that didn’t have hour numerals, and most complications were disabled. ↩︎ Special shout-out to my favorite digital face, Solar. ↩︎",

    "description": "\u003c!-- .screenshot1 { border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width: 95%; } .screenshot3 { border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width: 30%; margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%; } small { opacity: 0.5; } p.screenshots { margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; } --\u003e I apologize for the low battery level. Busy day. It all started with the watchOS volume widget. You see, Overcast’s previous Apple Watch app really sucked. I did my best with the capabilities of watchOS 1–4, but I couldn’t give people what they really wanted: Standalone podcast playback on the Apple Watch without an iPhone. I briefly offered it through some bad hacks, but had to remove it. Volume control on the Watch, which is increasingly important with the popularity of AirPods. That’s why I nearly jumped for joy during the watchOS 5 announcement in June, when Apple unveiled most of my list of watchOS changes needed to make good podcast apps. After a very busy summer, standalone Apple Watch playback is back in Overcast, and it’s actually good this time! It’s not perfect: No cellular. Apple hasn’t released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS, and the bad ways wouldn’t be very useful. Sending podcasts to the Watch is slow. Overcast shrinks them to reduce the transfer time, but when (and how quickly) podcasts transfer is tightly controlled by watchOS to preserve battery life. Transfers still sometimes wait forever or silently fail. Programmers like me can’t accept that something is just slow, so I’ve decided to make transfer speed irrelevant. Nobody cares how slowly podcasts transfer if it happens while they’re asleep! Auto-Sync to Watch automatically tries to send your most recent podcasts to your Apple Watch whenever it gets a chance.1 You can still send episodes manually from the queue button on an episode (≡+), but in my testing, I never needed to. Just pick up your Watch and go, and it’ll already have plenty of podcasts for your outing, all without having to manually sync anything or wait for slow transfers. The Overcast 5.0.1 update, due out in a few days, makes Watch transfers even more reliable. (Sorry. Found a better way after 5.0 was approved.) And Watch-crown volume control! Finally, the best way to use Overcast from your Apple Watch isn’t to delete it, letting the Now Playing app show up instead. That’s where the other half of my summer workload began. The watchOS volume widget offers minimal customization: just the color of the circle. I couldn’t make the line width a little narrower to match the rest of Overcast’s thin-line aesthetic. But that iOS 7-era thin-line aesthetic looked dated, and I’d wanted a design refresh for a while. I decided to start modernizing the app’s design, screen by screen. I couldn’t do it all in one summer, so I started with the screen that needed the most help: Now Playing. The previous Now Playing screen in Overcast 4. The biggest problem of the previous design was the center artwork area, a scrollable set of “pages” that had speed and effects controls offscreen to the left, and the episode notes offscreen to the right. Nobody ever found them. I’ve been getting emails almost every day from people asking where the speed controls were because they set them once and couldn’t find them again, or saying how they’d really like my app more if it offered speed controls. The only indication in the interface was three “page dots” below the scrollable area, but that wasn’t enough. The new design maintains the same scrollable pages, but now as obvious, tactile cards. In my testing, everyone figured these out immediately. Put differently, it’s like you’re navigating this through a phone-shaped window in the middle: This design is not only more discoverable, but it allows me to fit more controls on screen, and in more reachable areas. Unlike the previous design, I can also fit the same controls on all devices, from the iPhone SE to the iPad Pro. Designing a good Now Playing screen for a music or podcast app that’s nice, clean, and highly discoverable is incredibly difficult. I think I’ve finally found a good balance. I’ve given chapters (when present) their own card with durations and inline progress bars. I’ve also finally revamped the sleep timer to ditch the ugly alert sheet, give it a proper UI for fast input, and show the remaining time in more useful ways: There are lots of other improvements throughout the app as well. Some of the highlights: Search your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen, or go into a podcast’s screen to search its entire archive. Refreshed the podcast screen a little. (More to come.) Siri Shortcuts support, of course. Plus smaller fixes and improvements: CarPlay performance is much better, especially for people with large collections. Podcasts now display their estimated release frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) if it can be inferred. Tap-to-load on images now loads all images from the same domain at once. Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements. Overcast 5 requires iOS 12 and watchOS 5, and as always, it’s free. Update your devices, then go get Overcast! Up to 20 episodes are auto-synced today. This number will change as I refine the balance of resource usage. Auto-Sync to Watch is on by default and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. ↩︎",

    "title": "Low Power Mode on the Mac",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode",
    "description": "Laptop battery life is decreasingly relevant to me as more airplanes offer power outlets. But sometimes you lose that lottery, as I did on my latest 8-hour daytime flight. Apple’s “Up to 10 hours” claim doesn’t apply to my work,1 which is usually a mix of Xcode, web browsing, and social time-wasting, so I knew I’d have to seriously conserve power. Sometimes, you just need Low Power Mode: the switch added to iOS a few years ago to conserve battery life when you need it, at the expense of full performance and background tasks. There’s no such feature on Mac laptops, but there should be. It could: Disable the discrete GPU on 15-inch models unless required for hardware reasons2 Pause Photos syncing and analysis Pause Spotlight indexing Reduce the frequency of Time Machine backups Don’t download or install software updates Don’t download new content in iTunes Auto-dim the screen after a shorter time Let third-party apps detect Low Power Mode and reduce their background operations to only essential work And the big one: Reduce the processor’s maximum wattage or disable Turbo Boost Back in 2015, I experimented with disabling Turbo Boost and discovered that it reduced performance by about a third, but also boosted battery life by almost as much. Since then, I’ve been running Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to automatically disable Turbo Boost when I’m running on battery power, and it has been wonderful: I made it through that 8-hour flight only because Turbo Boost was off. Over the last few days, I’ve run battery tests on my 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro with the (awesome) 2.7 GHz i7 and my 2015 2.2 GHz 15-inch3 to see how far I could push the battery life using Volta, which can disable Turbo Boost and/or set wattage limits on the CPU. My test was based on the “Heavy” script from last time, but using xcodebuild every few minutes with Overcast’s current codebase (which is larger and includes some Swift). Improvements are in green and performance reductions are in red: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:36 3963/13864 43.9s No Turbo 5:06+42% 2796/9917−29/28% 63.4s+44% 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro (2.7 GHz quad-core i7)   Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:09 5412/18983 34.3s 28W 3:28+10% 5401/16326−0/14% 37.4s+9% 18W 4:05+29% 5248/14133−3/26% 43.5s+27% 12W 4:44+50% 4818/11835−11/38% 48.2s+41% No Turbo 5:05+61% 3624/13324−33/30% 48.9s+43% 6W 6:24+103% 4065/7596−25/60% 76.1s+121% It’s impressive how much faster this new 13-inch model is than the best laptop ever made due to significant CPU and SSD improvements. Dropping the wattage to 6W, the thermal limit of the fanless 12-inch MacBook, interestingly (but not surprisingly) makes it perform effectively identically to the best 12-inch MacBook in Geekbench. This is an extreme option, but one I’d occasionally take if offered. It roughly doubles compilation times, but also doubles the battery life. This ratio holds for most other configurations: the gain in battery life is about as large as the loss in heavy-workload performance. That’s a trade-off I’d gladly make when I need to maximize runtime. The best bang-for-the-buck option is still to just disable Turbo Boost. Single-threaded performance hurts more than with wattage-limiting, but it’s able to maintain better multi-threaded performance and more consistent thermals, and gets a larger battery gain relative to its performance loss. And Volta, which offers both wattage limits and Turbo disabling, requires disabling System Integrity Protection to install an unsigned kernel extension, which I really don’t recommend. Turbo Boost Switcher, which doesn’t offer wattage control, works with SIP using a signed extension and its Pro version has more convenient features for automatic toggling. For now, I’m going to continue to happily run Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to selectively give myself better battery life, and I recommend it for anyone else with the same need. But what I ultimately want is for a true Low Power Mode built into macOS that could provide this sort of CPU throttling and software changes, which would ultimately achieve even greater gains. Whose work does get 10 hours out of a MacBook Pro? None of the use-cases on the marketing page — Photography, Coding, Video Editing, 3D Graphics, and Gaming — are likely to achieve even half of that in practice. ↩︎ I’ve heard that 15-inch models are wired such that the discrete GPU is required when external displays are connected. Otherwise, whether it’s used or not is a software decision, and gfxCardStatus can override it in certain conditions. ↩︎ It’s not brand new, so it’s not a perfect comparison, but the battery only had 90 cycles before this test. ↩︎",

    "title": "Overcast 4.2: The privacy update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42",
    "description": "Overcast 4.2 is out now. It enhances privacy in two major areas: Anonymous sync by default Overcast has offered anonymous sync accounts since 2014. They’re fully functional, but they lack email addresses or passwords, so they can’t log into the website. A login token is stored in iCloud so the account can be accessed after a restore or upgrade, or from other devices you own. Previously, the login screen pushed email logins. But with four years of perspective, feedback, and usage data, I now think that’s the wrong move. Only a single-digit percentage of customers use the website, and the iCloud token-sync method solves cross-device logins for almost everyone. Your personal data isn’t my business — it’s a liability. I want as little as possible. I don’t even log IP addresses anymore. If I don’t need your email address, I really don’t want it. 68% of Overcast accounts have email addresses today. To reduce that as much as possible, I’ve made major changes to account handling: The previous login screen (left) and the new one. In Overcast 4.2, the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default. If you already have an account in iCloud, it’ll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it. And the first time you launch 4.2, people with email-based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts: The migration prompt that shows on the first run. Finally, you can now change your account between email-based and anonymous whenever you want. Blocking ad-tracking images In most podcast apps, podcasts are downloaded automatically in the background. The only data sent to a podcast’s publisher about you or your behavior is your IP address and the app’s name. The IP address lets them derive your approximate region, but not much else. They don’t know exactly who you are, whether you listened, when you listened, how far you listened, or whether you skipped certain parts. Some large podcast producers are trying very hard to change that. I’m not. Big data ruined the web, and I’m not going to help bring it to podcasts. Publishers already get enough from Apple to inform ad rates and make content decisions — they don’t need more data from my customers. Podcasting has thrived, grown, and made tons of money for tons of people under the current model for over a decade. We already have all the data we need. One of the ways publishers try to get around the limitations of the current model is by embedding remote images or invisible “tracking pixels” in each episode’s HTML show notes. When displayed in most apps, the images are automatically loaded from an analytics server, which can then record and track more information about you. In Overcast 4.2, much like Mail (and for the same reason), remote images don’t load by default. A tappable placeholder shows you where each image will load from, and you can decide whether to load it or not. I believe I’ve done this in the most secure way possible — I’m actually displaying the show notes using a strict Content Security Policy — and I would love to hear from anyone who finds a way to inject auto-loading remote images or execute arbitrary JavaScript in show notes. Bug fixes Overcast 4.2 also includes a bunch of minor fixes, and two big ones: Fixed the major slowdowns and high battery usage that resulted from extremely large podcast artwork. Password-protected episodes are now supported on password-protected feeds. Get it now in the App Store!",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/03/13/overcast41",
    "description": "Overcast 4.1 is now in the App Store with some small but nice new features. Smart Resume is actually two features: It jumps back by up to a few seconds after having been paused to help remind you of the conversation. It slightly adjusts resumes and seeks to fall in the silences between spoken words when reasonably possible. Both are subtle but noticeable benefits (my favorite kind), especially when you’re being interrupted a lot, such as while following turn-by-turn navigation directions. Smart Resume is on by default, and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. Delete episodes 24 hours after completion: Before, episodes could either be auto-deleted immediately upon completion, or not at all. There’s now a third option, auto-deleting 24 hours after completion, which will soon be the default for new accounts. The 24-hour threshold is only enforced after a successful sync, so it won’t auto-delete anything in the middle of an extended offline period, such as a long flight. Auto-deletion, either immediate or after 24 hours, also no longer applies to Premium subscribers’ Uploads. Password-protected podcasts: Some private podcast feeds, including many paid and members-only podcasts, require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth. You can now add these in the Add URL screen. Password-protected podcasts, and other private feeds such as Patreon bonus feeds and anything using the tag, do not show up in search or recommendations. Noteworthy bug fixes: Resuming playback after quitting in the background, especially on very long podcasts and/or when using AirPods, no longer occasionally results in glitchy noises and incorrect durations. Playback under certain conditions no longer stalls, requiring pausing and playing again. Downloads now fail less often. Playback controls no longer disappear occasionally. Smart Speed total savings now appear at the bottom of the Settings screen for locales that use commas as their decimal separator.1 Extremely large playlists now only show the most/least-recent 500 episodes to improve app performance for users with very high subscription counts. There’s also one removal: rotation support on iPhone. (The iPad app still rotates.) iPhone rotation has always been disabled by default, and had been buried in Nitpicky Details for a long time, so very few people have ever used it. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly difficult to support and maintain, especially with the modern complexities of rotation and the dramatically increased workload of supporting the iPhone X in landscape. iPhone rotation has simply proven far too costly to maintain for its extremely low usage, and it had to go to free up more of my time for more highly demanded features. I apologize to the few people who did use it, and I hope this isn’t too disruptive for you. The rest is all good news. Go get Overcast now! In the next update, I’ll be addressing the biggest design failure of Overcast 4: the non-discoverability of the Effects and Notes pages in the Now Playing screen. Expect the return of an ancient user-interface tool known as “buttons”. This was Overcast’s oldest known bug, which had been there since 1.0: some users, mostly in central Europe, wouldn’t see Smart Speed totals. It turned out to be one of the most interesting and obscure bugs I’ve seen. The total-time-saved value is stored on-device as it accumulates, then gets sent to the server to be combined with any listening you do on other devices. The overall total is read back from the server, and the local total is reset, on each sync. I was using an NSNumberFormatter to read the total value from Overcast’s server as a double. My server always sends values with U.S.-style number formatting, using a period as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234.5”). But by default, NSNumberFormatter uses the device’s locale, so in countries that use a comma as the decimal separator (e.g. “1234,5”), it was interpreting the server’s numbers with periods as invalid and returning zero. So the Settings screen thought they hadn’t saved any time, and hid the time-saved label. Fortunately, it was an easy fix: setting that NSNumberFormatter locale to en_US to match what the server was sending. And since the accumulated local totals were still being sent and added properly, the correct historical data is there — it just wasn’t being displayed correctly. ↩︎",
