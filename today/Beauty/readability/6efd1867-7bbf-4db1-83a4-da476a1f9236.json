  "description": "Amid the rise of the Italian summer manicure trend, which champions cute green olives, juicy oranges, and lemon motifs, it’s no surprise that sardines are having a moment, too. We’re seeing the cute silver fish on keychains, jewelry, and kitsch beaded bags, proving that they aren’t just a salty snack — they also make some seriously fun accessories. It was only a matter of time before we started to spot them on nails. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nails by koda✨💕 (@polishedpinkbykoda) Sardine-inspired manicures are everywhere this summer — just take a look at this set by @polishedpinkbykoda — and they’re so versatile. Blending bright hues, eye-catching silver flecks, artistic patterns, and 3D decals, there are endless ways to incorporate sardines into your next set. Think beach nails complete with shell textures and classic French tips. Anything goes. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝑪𝑰𝑻𝑹𝑬 (@_citre) Who knew adding a dainty fish to your fingertips could be such a great beauty moment? Scroll on to see 10 of the best sardine-inspired nail art ideas to help you live out your best European summer, wherever you are in the world.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Seaside Sardines View this post on Instagram A post shared by SMITH⚡️(Official) (@b_l_o_n_d_i_e_s) A classic color combo, this red and blue set feels like the perfect manicure for an ocean getaway. Salon @b_l_o_n_d_i_e_s nails this color palette using contrasting shades, striking stripes, and scalloped edges. Getting the hues just right is the trick here; we love Essie Nail Polish in Not Red-y For Bed $10 — a pillarbox red — with Essie in New Day New Me, $9.99, but you could even go even brighter in the blue.  Sardines In Detail View this post on Instagram A post shared by @selfmademars_ On the surface, this appears to be a simple set thanks to the soft, nude base, and delicate, hand-painted sardines. But for the real magic, zoom in to see the impressive detail of these little (and adorable) fish created by @selfmademars_. Neon Sardines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kathryn 💅🏼 Chicago Suburb Nail Artist (@naillabbykathryn) Nothing says vacation nails quite like a neon set — with an accent sardine tin, of course. Take inspiration from nail artist Kathryn and use a bright, magenta for the base (we like Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in, $12.99). For the accent nails, a contrasting blue like OPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Never Leavin’ Blue, $14.49, works beautifully.   Sardine Snack View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nails by Dayi (@nailsby_dayii) A little sardine doesn’t have to be the main event; it can be part of a cute, summery set. With vibrant colors and cool 3D olive detail, nail tech Dayii has got this design so right. Featuring neon yellow, orange, and bright blue hues, this is sure to inject joy into your everyday. You can play around with this one, taking inspiration from the color theme and adding your favourite elements of summer.  Sardines \u0026 Friends View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hadley Dunn (@donebyhadleydunn) There’s something about the combination of pink and red that’ll always stand out, and this manicure is no different. Each nail on this manicure, created by Hadley Dunn, has an epic amount of detail with a tiny chrome sardine tin, blooming gel flower, and blue striped detail. The best part is that, alongside the sardines, you’ll find perhaps the cutest shrimp and lobster we’ve ever seen.  Sunshine Sardines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tempe Licensed Nail Tech (@setsbyjaquelin) This design, created by nail artist Jacquelin has everything going on. Sardines (of course), oranges complete with 3D juicy droplets, blue French tips, and orange stripes. Skittle Sardines View this post on Instagram A post shared by @fullsetsbyspens Created by nail artist @fullsetsbyspens, the aim of the game with this manicure is color — and lots of it. With a different shade on each finger and a contrasting sardine over the top, this is the definition of sparking joy. If you want to try it at home, we love the shades Wisteria, $14, Candy, $14, Gold Button, $14, and Riviera, $14, from Manucurist.  Valentine’s Sardines View this post on Instagram A post shared by Electric Panther Nails (@electricpanthernails) Sure, it’s a bit early to be thinking about our February 14th manicure, but when they’re this cute, can you blame us? This creative manicure by Electric Pather Nails features sardines holding hands, one diving head-first into a martini glass, and some olives as a garnish. You’ll want a hand-painting nail art specialist for this design. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?
