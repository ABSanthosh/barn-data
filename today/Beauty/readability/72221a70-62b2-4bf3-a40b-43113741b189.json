But don’t eat your cosmetics! Question 2 –  Charolette – 1. Hair washing – Is dry shampoo worse for your hair than washing your hair? Is it equally bad for your scalp? 2. Should you cut your split ends? Is it beneficial or is that a myth? 3. Ordinary hair serum – Does this work? What’s the science behind it?” -REDENSYL™ *(Givaudan): Targets stem cells and human fibroblasts from the dermal papilla to improve hair density. -Procapil™ (Sederma Inc.): Increases blood flow in the scalp which allows the hair to be well nourished, resulting in appearance of thicker hair. -BAICAPIL™ (Provital, S.A): Increases hair density.

Question 3 – Christine – Hello Beauty Brains. Recently I came upon this product called L’Oreal Paris Elvive 8 second Wonder Water.
