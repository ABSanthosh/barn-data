  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Very few cult-favorite beauty products have brought me as much joy as the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ($24). Ever since laying my hands on a little tub of it for the first time years ago, it's remained a staple on my bedside table, in my handbag, and on my work desk, just to name a few spots I have them stashed. (Yes, I proudly own several flavors.) I'm obsessed with everything about this lip mask, from its pretty pink packaging to its hydrating, nonsticky texture. The lip mask is available in classic flavors like Berry and Vanilla, but occasionally, Laneige throws a limited-edition one into the mix. They unveiled Pink Lemonade Swirl in May 2022 (and fans are begging for its return now that it's unavailable). Luckily, the brand just released its 2024 holiday flavors: Candy Cane Swirl and Eggnog Latte. Image Source: Sephora With a reputation as one of the best lip masks on the market, the product has become a viral sensation - PS editors love it, beauty influencers love it, and the hydrating product even boasts a few celebrity fans. Charli XCX called it one of her everyday essentials in an interview with British GQ - perfect for brat summer and beyond - and Ashley Park named it her sleeping must have in an interview with PS. As you might guess, I wasted no time in getting my hands on these tubs, and I can confidently say that they have become new staples in my everyday routine. Ahead, you can read my full review of the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, and see why it's worth the hype. About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask The formula first made its debut in the US in 2015 with its bestselling flavor, Berry. Each mask is formulated with hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisture-locking glycerin, and skin-protecting antioxidants. It comes in four core flavors: the original Berry, Sweet Candy, Vanilla, and Gummy Bear. But, the brand releases limited edition seasonal flavors, like Watermelon Pop and Mango for the summer, and Candy Cane Swirl and Eggnog Latte for the winter. What I Like About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy I've always been the type of person who reaches for fruity scents over the sweet ones, and Pink Lemonade Swirl and Mango were just as delectably summery as I had hoped. The Mango flavor captures the fruit's smell perfectly and the Pink Lemonade Swirl is like sipping on a refreshing glass of the real deal. (I know this sounds annoyingly cliché, but I'm telling it like it is - I swear.) As for what it looks and feels like: it's a lusciously thick formula with a silky-soft texture and a glossy finish. I agree with our former content director, Macy Cate Williams, who reviewed the original Berry formula and said: \"This lip mask isn't sticky or uncomfortable - it glides on smoothly and feels very soothing on my lips.\" Like her, I'm also a fan of using it instead of a regular lip balm throughout the day. The tiniest amount goes a long way, so even with multiple applications daily, it lasts a while. What to Consider Before Buying Laneige Lip Sleeping Masks When considering Laneige's lip sleeping masks, one important factor to keep in mind is the cost. At $24, this balm comes with a higher price tag, and it's worth noting that there are comparable products available at a lower cost. However, the masks' sleek and visually appealing packaging, which has gained significant attention on TikTok with over 250 million views (!) for videos tagged with #laneigelipmask, likely contributes to their premium price point. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding whether the investment is worthwhile. While I don't make it a habit to purchase these on a regular basis, I do treat myself to one occasionally as a special indulgence - and I urge you to do so, too. Where Are Laneige's New Lip Sleeping Masks Available? Laneige's new Lip Sleeping Masks are available direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, as well as at Amazon and Sephora.

The tiniest amount goes a long way, so even with multiple applications daily, it lasts a while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Buying Laneige Lip Sleeping Masks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eWhen considering Laneige\u0026#39;s lip sleeping masks, one important factor to keep in mind is the cost. At $24, this balm comes with a higher price tag, and it\u0026#39;s worth noting that there are comparable products available at a lower cost. However, the masks\u0026#39; sleek and visually appealing packaging, which has gained significant attention on TikTok with over 250 million views (!) for videos tagged with #laneigelipmask, likely contributes to their premium price point. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eIt ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding whether the investment is worthwhile. While I don\u0026#39;t make it a habit to purchase these on a regular basis, I do treat myself to one occasionally as a special indulgence — and I urge you to do so, too. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Are Laneige\u0026#39;s New Lip Sleeping Masks Available?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eLaneige\u0026#39;s new Lip Sleeping Masks are available direct-to-consumer from \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.laneige.com%2F\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_48879903__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003ethe brand\u0026#39;s website\u003c/a\u003e, as well as at \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Laneige-Sleeping-Berry/dp/B07XXPHQZK?tag=popsugarshopx-20\u0026amp;asc_source=network-newsletter\u0026amp;asc_campaign=feed\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/laneige-lip-sleeping-mask-review-48879903\u0026amp;ascsubtag=___psv__p_48879903__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM\u0026amp;mid=2417\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Flip-sleeping-mask-P420652\u0026amp;u1=___psv__p_48879903__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eSephora\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e ★★★★★ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/marisa-petrarca\"\u003eMarisa Petrarca\u003c/a\u003e is a contributing editor for PS Shopping and has more than five years of experience writing and editing beauty, fashion, and lifestyle content.
