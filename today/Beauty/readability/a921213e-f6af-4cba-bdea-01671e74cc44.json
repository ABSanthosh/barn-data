  "text": "When Lindsay Lohan pops on my computer screen, the first thing I notice is her hair. It’s waist-length, perfectly coiffed, and…blonde? The iconic redhead assures me that she hasn’t ditched her roots. “It’s strawberry blonde,” she says with a laugh. “It looks really blonde in this light. It’s not that light in person.”Regardless of the color, there’s no denying that Lohan has some seriously good hair. And no, to quote one of her movies, it’s not because it’s full of secrets—but it might have something to do with Nexxus. In a new campaign with the hair brand, the actress revisits two more of her familiar roles: Hallie Parker and Annie James from The Parent Trap. In the campaign, Lohan styles her hair to become each character (well, 26 years later), from a sleek ponytail for Annie to bouncy waves for Hallie, and eventually lands on a sophisticated style reminiscent of Meredith Blake, the antagonist stepmother that’s recently had something of a redemption arc on TikTok (not unlike Lohan herself). While in Paris for fashion week, Lohan spoke with ELLE about the new campaign, her favorite hair eras, working with Jamie Lee Curtis, and more.What’s your current hair care routine and how has it changed over the years?I’ve always kept my hair care routine pretty much the same. I don’t wash my hair every day of the week or every other day. I try to just do it twice a week, because it tends to get kind of brittle otherwise. I love the Nexxus hair oil. That’s one of my favorites, because I like how it feels silky and smooth and nice after, like it’s been hydrated. But usually, I’m pretty simple with my hair. If I don’t have to go to anything or go to dinner or something, then I’ll just let it dry naturally. I try not to over-process it if I don’t have to. I just treat it with love.That’s a good approach. Do you have a favorite hair era or a specific movie that you loved your hair in?Oooh. I think when I did this movie, Just My Luck, I loved it because it was just red and vibrant, pretty, and shiny. Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, when I did that, I was going through a phase of wanting it to be lighter. I’ll never forget that.What do you love most about being a redhead?It’s just me. Redheads are unique, and their hair is beautiful. It’s a special color. As you get older in life, you learn to appreciate the natural beauty that you have. It took me a long time, because when I was a kid, it wasn’t cool to have red hair. [I] kind of felt like an outcast when I was young, but that’s changed so much. Now I really embrace my red hair. What was it like revisiting your Parent Trap role for the Nexxus campaign? It was fun. We weren’t planning on having an accent for Annie. And then I was like, “Okay, let me just do the British accent.” And then it made it all more fun. It needed [the accent].Courtesy of NexxusAgreed. I know you’re also returning to your role in Freaky Friday in the upcoming sequel, Freakier Friday. Can you share any details?There’s a lot of fun fashion in the movie, which is exciting. There are a lot of different, new, really exciting, fun aspects to this one. I think people are really going to enjoy it. It’s a really fun movie, and we had a lot of fun making it.It feels like you and Jamie Lee Curtis have maintained a good relationship over the years. How does it feel to work with her again?You feel so lucky when you get to work with someone that’s also your friend. It makes such a difference on set, because then it doesn’t feel so much like going to work every day. I love Jamie. She’s such a great person to have on set. She’s just a great human being in general. So, we were really excited to be able to work together.She strikes me as someone would be really wise. Has she ever given you any really good advice?She’s always coming up with new words of wisdom. I can’t even think of one, because there are so many. I think we are constantly going through advice with each other, [on] life and growing and how things change over the years and how we evolve. It’s just an ongoing conversation.Courtesy of NexxusSwitching gears, what’s your wellness routine like? Do you have one?I always have my little rituals that I do, especially when I’m traveling so much. It’s important that I set up my counter with my products [for my] skin care routine and regimens and hair products in the shower. I always need everything [to be] where it needs to be, and that just starts my wellness routine. Mainly it’s always staying super hydrated, and eating pretty clean and healthy with the occasional fun meals. I try to keep a nice, clean diet. That’s a big thing for me. And doing Pilates is a lifesaver, just to keep me active and my mind active. I want to put things into my body that keep me feeling great, mentally.What’s your favorite fun meal?There are lot. One is Joe’s Pizza when I go to New York. Once in a blue moon, a McDonald’s cheeseburger Happy Meal. If you smell the fries, you need them.Do you have any favorite spots in Paris when you’re there?I love Hotel Costes. [Going] at least once is nice for dinner or lunch. Now there are new spots, because there are places I want to take my son, so we’re discovering new places and gardens and things like that for the baby. In Paris, it’s just always nice to walk up to any random café and sit and just feel Parisian.It’s the best place to people-watch. Since you’ve been there for fashion week, do you have a personal fashion philosophy that you follow?I usually won’t wear anything that I’m not comfortable in. For fashion week specifically, I’ll push it to something that I feel a little uncomfortable in. If it’s beautiful and it’s gonna make a statement, I want to make it work. But for me, comfort is key. I want to wear the outfit, I don’t want it to wear me.If you could give any advice to your younger self, what would it be?Everything happens the way it’s meant to. And to never stop loving yourself. You always have to love yourself. I think that’s a really important thing. And [don’t] be hard on yourself.Lindsay Lohan’s Favorite Nexxus ProductsNexxus Slick Stick Strong Hold Hair WaxNexxus Repair \u0026 Nourish Ultra Lightweight Hair OilNow 18% OffNexxus XXL Volume Medium Hold HairsprayThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Katie Berohn is ELLE’s beauty editor.
