  "description": "Unless you have a short bob or a pixie cut, it's safe to say that you should consider adding a few updo styles into your hair rotation - and what's better than classic messy bun hairstyles? They'll keep your hair off your neck and out of your face, especially if you're dealing with dirty hair that hasn't seen a shampoo bottle in over a week. While you can always go for a ponytail, braid, or even half-up, half-down style, we love the simplicity of a messy bun hairstyle. The messy bun hairstyle trend offers a lot of versatility and can be worn for a variety of occasions, whether it's a wedding or a night in with friends. Despite having the word \"messy\" in the name, these styles look anything but unkempt. For a slightly more polished look, you can grab some gel, slick back your hair, and go for a low messy bun. On the other hand, a high messy bun is cute and flirty and can similarly be dressed up or down (just look at Pamela Anderson's style). Another reason to love this low-maintenance style is that you can easily sweep hair up and out of the way without using any heat styling tools or a copious number of styling products. You can get away with a few flyaways here and there, drastically cutting down the time you spend standing in front of a mirror. This updo can be achieved on all hair types, meaning you can find a messy bun tutorial for all textures and lengths. To help you gather some hair-bun inspiration, keep scrolling to see messy buns for long hair, curly hair, and more.",
