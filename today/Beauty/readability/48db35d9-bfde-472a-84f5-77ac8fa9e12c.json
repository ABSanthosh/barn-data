  "description": "Keke Palmer is switching things up, and we're taking notes. The actress, whose new movie \"One of Them Days\" hits theaters on January 17, was recently seen doing press for the film while sporting an entirely new look. Not only did Palmer go ultra-short with a chin-grazing bob haircut, but she also went bold with the color, opting for a fun \"cowboy copper\" shade. Palmer has been favoring longer styles and muted hues lately, so this dramatic chop and color refresh is a noticeable shift. Last year, plenty of celebrities took cowboy copper for a spin, including Riley Keough, Tessa Thompson, and Megan Fox. With Palmer on board, it's clear that the hair-color trend is going to stay at the top of the charts in 2025. Why? Well, for starters, it's more subtle than your typical copper hue; it's natural and uses your unique undertone to mellow out the look. \"Because this color generally has a natural background tone to it, a person's natural color can be the background tone, giving the shade a very customized, skin-tone-flattering tone,\" LA-based celebrity hairstylist Cherilyn Farris says. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kira Dior (@kiradiorhairco) If you're considering testing out the trend for yourself, know that it does come with some upkeep and will require regular salon visits as frequently as every six weeks to keep it fresh, depending on your natural hair color. However, you can keep your hair looking vibrant at home with the right mix of products, like color-depositing hair masks and hydrating shampoos and conditioners. If Palmer's new look has inspired you to take the plunge and book an appointment with your colorist, make sure you arrive with inspiration photos in hand. Personally, we'd suggest a screenshot straight from Palmer's latest Instagram post. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
