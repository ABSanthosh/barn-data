Shop our full coverage of the event here — or, dive directly into the deals here. Crest Whitestrips are the unofficial (but nevertheless uncontested) star deal of Prime Days past — and for good reason. The highly rated teeth-whitening system rarely gets more than a paltry discount; however, Prime Big Deal Days is the rare occasion when Crest Whitestrips reliably go for $30 — a serious steal if you ask us. And now that October’s Prime Big Deal Days are finally here, Crest Whitestrips are (spoiler alert) part of the drill. In addition to various Whitestrips kit options, you can save big on other oral care essentials like toothpaste, electric toothbrushes, floss, and more. Perhaps the most widely-carted item from the bunch is Crest’s 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects, marked down to $29.99 from $45.99, which boasts over 89,000 reviews as of press time. Another popular choice is the Crest 3D Whitestrips Radiant Express which one reviewer has dubbed “as you can get without going to a dentist.” And speaking of, if you want to more closely mimic the professional teeth-whitening experience you’d get at the dentist, there is the Crest 3D Whitestrips with Light Whitening Kit, to help achieve your brightest pearly whites ever by enhancing the effects of the brightening gel via LED light.  Ahead, peruse every Crest Whitestrips kit on sale for Prime Big Deal Days and shop the smile-worthy deals below.
