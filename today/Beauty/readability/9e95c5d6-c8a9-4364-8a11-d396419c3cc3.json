  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.With our Halloween outfits and vampy makeup locked away for another year, our heads are now firmly turning towards the practical parts of our wardrobe that work for all weather eventualities. Think striped sweaters, blanket scarves, and heavy-duty boots. But staying warm doesn’t mean dressing like you’re about to climb a mountain.This season, plenty of It Girls are inspiring our freezing fashion looks for the winter months ahead. For those seeking a chic and refined look, the Olsen twins remain superior thanks to their arsenal of tailored coats, turtlenecks, and classic loafers. If you want a cozier option, Katie Holmes is an ideal reference point for slouchy cardigans, well-fitting jeans, and low-heeled leather boots. A more elevated approach would be Taylor Russell, our inspo for all-out cold-girl glamor with caramel-colored coats, faux fur scarves, and gold statement jewelry. Then there’s makeup, and it’s safe to say that we’re embracing all things warm and glossy. Hailey Bieber is leading the mood board with a pumpkin spice-inspired lip and glowy peach cheeks. And for hair makeovers, we can’t take our eyes off Rihanna’s curls, dyed a very seasonal shade of autumn leaf. To uncover all the new fashion and beauty launches that are giving us even more inspiration this November, click through the slideshow ahead…Tanya Taylor Launches DelphineAcclaimed New York-based designer Tanya Taylor, known for her 10-year-old eponymous label, has debuted a new brand called Delphine. It serves as an alter-ego to Taylor, and is inspired by the glam NYC nightlife aesthetic that cool girls embody — meaning: the elegant woman who’s as likely to be sipping on a martini at Bemelmans Bar as she is sitting on a fire escape in kitten heels. The first Delphine collection is available now, and borrows design cues from vintage red carpets, with peplums, trains, voluminous sleeves, and a palette of rich jewel tones. Find one-shoulder and off-the-shoulder mini dresses, draped midis with square necklines, occasion-worthy gowns, and more. Prices range from $895 to $2,195.Shop now at Delphine  Delphine Cleo Mini, $, available at DelphineDisney x Lululemon Good vibes await courtesy of the new Disney x Lululemon collab, which finds your favorite comfy pieces from the activewear brand adorned with playful Mickey Mouse motifs.

Rhode made its name with hydrating milks and peptide lip balms and now the brand has launched its thickest formula yet in the form of the Barrier Butter. An intensive moisturizer, the balm-like formula provides deep hydration for plump and glowing skin. Containing hyaluronic and polyglutamic acid, the buttery nighttime cream is all about locking in moisture and improving barrier function — perfect for chapped winter skin.Shop now at RhodeRhode Barrier Butter, $, available at RhodeCarolina Herrera x FrameThe new collaboration between Carolina Herrera and Frame started with a simple question: What would the chic women who gravitate toward the fashion house wear when they’re not wearing its gowns? The answer: feminine, tailored denim that plays with proportions and color. The resulting capsule — Carolina Herrera’s first denim collection — debuted on the brand’s Resort 2025 runway show in Mexico City earlier this month, and includes pieces such as a voluminous denim maxi skirt, tapered jeans, and cropped jackets in red, white, yellow, and baby blue.

This offers fans an opportunity to shop the collection early, while the brand gets an idea of how many of each style it needs to produce based, helping limit waste. Shop now at Larroudé Larroudé Dew Drop Mule, $, available at LarroudéFree People x Yellowstone With the Western trend still going strong, it only makes sense that Free People has partnered with the hit TV show Yellowstone for a limited-edition collection.

For the collection, the Noah team dug into Barbour’s archives and reimagined popular styles from the ’80s. There’s the unisex Wool Bedale Jacket, which features a corduroy collar and is made with Casentino wool (a fuzzy fabric dating back to the 14th century); the Cotton Bedale, with the same silhouette but in a salt-washed cotton canvas; and the Border Jacket, a longer tweed style. “For this season’s Barbour collection, we stuck to the classic jacket shapes we’ve always loved from them,” Noah founder Brendon Babenzien said in a press release. “Barbour jackets, more than any other, have a timeless quality that allows them to get passed down from one generation to the next.” The Noah x Barbour collab is available to shop now.Shop now at Noah and BarbourNoah x Barbour Wool Teddy Bedale Jacket, $, available at NoahRixo Launches HomewareKnown for its retro aesthetic and vintage-inspired prints, fashion brand Rixo is taking the next step in its stylistic journey with the launch of its homeware range, Casa Rixo.

Announced as the brand’s last foray into big eyeshadow palettes, the shades include a mix of mauve alongside a gunmetal glitter, pink shimmer and a snow-white matte. Branching beyond palettes, the collection also includes three new Faux Filter lipglosses (including an icy iridescent clear) and a ‘frostbitten’ face gloss that changes color with the pH of the skin. If frosty hues aren’t your thing, you can warm up with two new Blush Filters in deep Coco Loco and Latte.Shop now at Huda Beauty Huda Beauty Icy Nude Eyeshadow Palette, $, available at Huda BeautyHaider Ackermann Releases First Canada Goose CollectionAfter being announced as the first creative director of Canada Goose earlier this year, designer Haider Ackermann has just dropped his first collection with the outerwear brand with a campaign starring actor Ethan Hawke. Called “Snow Goose,” the capsule is inspired by the outdoors — the type of environment best suited for the brand's outerwear. “Being surrounded by nature allows one to be connected with oneself — it reflects, it inspires, it provokes. It is in this rhythm and energy that we designed this capsule,” Ackermann said in a press release. The collection includes new spins on the brand’s archival pieces, such as the Rider Parker, a utilitarian slouchy jacket inspired by the ’90s-era Peacekeeper Parka, as well as apparel, like an oversized graphic sweater and a thin, layerable turtleneck. Moving forward, Ackermann will drop seasonal collections twice a year under the Snow Goose name, which was the brand's heritage label back in the ’90s.

Taking inspiration from the original Wizard of Oz, the collection includes totes, handbags and wallets with stills from the iconic movie, including imagery of the famed yellow brick road. For the biggest Dorothy fans around, the main event is a pair of diamanté-encrusted, crimson Mary Janes with a vertigo-inducing platform heel that makes the original ruby slippers look like running shoes.Shop now at Marc JacobsMarc Jacobs x The Wizard of Oz The Friends of Dorothy Leather Mini Compact Wallet, $, available at Marc JacobsLike what you see?
