  "description": "Hi, my name is Michelle, and I'm afraid of powder foundation. No, really, I'm someone with incredibly dry skin and, therefore, avoid powder foundation like it's the plague. That's because most formulas cling to my dry patches, feel heavy, and accentuate my fine lines, pores, and texture. The good news? I'm obsessed with product testing, which means sometimes I'm exposed to formulas that completely change my mind about an entire category of products. Enter the E.l.f. Halow Glow Powder Filter ($14); I recently tried this new launch and was taken aback by how incredible my skin looked - not a cakey spot in sight. Read on to learn how this powder works wonders for my skin. About the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter The formula comes in 12 flexible shades that include cool, neutral, and warm undertones, and fair, light, medium, tan, deep, and rich shades. The compact includes a velour puff and mirror for on-the-go application. The pressed powder formula can be used on its own as a foundation, on top of makeup for more coverage, or to touch up. It delivers a blurred, soft-focus glow. The formula is vegan and cruelty-free. What I Like About the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter As someone with dry skin who tends to avoid powder complexion products, E.l.f. managed to make me a convert with this finely-milled formula. While I typically rely on a pore-blurring primer before my foundation application, I don't need to wear one underneath this powder. It blurs the look of my pores and any uneven texture effortlessly, yielding a truly filtered, flawless look that I usually can only achieve with a liquid formula. While most powders cling onto dry patches (particularly on my chin and the sides of my nose), this one glosses right over them with no issue. Comfort-wise, it has a velvety finish that feels weightless on the skin - a tough feat for most powder formulas. How to Use the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter The beauty of this powder is that there are several ways to use it: on days I want all-over coverage, I use it on its own with powder blush and bronzer layered on top. Other formulas layer nicely on top without skipping, and I like that I can apply a light layer for every day or build it up for more glamorous looks. If you need your makeup to last, you can layer the powder on top of a liquid foundation - this helps control any oil that may pop up throughout the day. Finally - and perhaps my absolute favorite way to use this powder - is to take a big fluffy face brush and use circular motions to apply a light dusting onto my cheeks after I've finished my blush and bronzer. This instantly nixes any harsh lines and helps fuse all of my other products together for a seamless, blended finish. What to Consider Before Trying the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter One thing to note is that this powder has a soft focus glow, so if you're someone with oily skin, consider if your skin will mesh well with this type of finish. It also makes no claim on staying power, so if you tend to get greasy quickly, it may be wise to take the compact with you for touch-ups throughout the day. Where Is the E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter Available? The E.l.f. Halo Glow Powder Filter is available at E.l.f. Cosmetics, Ulta, Target, and Amazon.
