  "text": "“I’m not sure how I came across Tatti Lashes, but I have been a customer of theirs since 2018. Last year they called and said they wanted to work with me. I was already a fan, so I was like, ‘Wait, what?!’ It was serendipitous and I am so honored because I try to only align myself with brands that I sincerely use or that I believe in. No shade or disrespect to anybody, but there are so many people out there promoting things that they don’t even know about. I can’t say I never did that back in the day; I was so excited that someone wanted to give me $5 for anything. [Laughs] But the older I got and the more my platform grew, I realized that responsibility was on me. I have sensitive eyes, and in the past, I’ve worn lashes that made me look half asleep on a red carpet. Tatti’s are so light, so they don't weigh your eyes down. Together, we created a strip lash that’s more of a cat eye. I love the drama of a cat eye with winged liner, especially for a red carpet or a night that I want to be a little more glam. Then we also made an individual day-to-night lash duo, a set of two lash clusters, which I wear the most. I feel like I have more control that way. You can put them on with our long lasting adhesive, which will last up to seven days, so you can get the effect of eyelash extensions without the commitment. Oh, and they’re easy to apply, too. I have long nails, and I can function and do everything with them, but I have big finger pads, so I can’t get in the little areas. Our curved lash applicator helps you be very precise. It’s pretty foolproof. If you’re not the best at putting on lashes, I would try the clusters first. I, for the life of me, could not put on strip lashes for years. I get my makeup done, so plenty of people would show me, but I just couldn’t get it. Then I tried clusters, and once you get the hang of it, you’re like, ‘OK, I’m brave enough to try the strips now.’ You have to work your way up—at least I did. Also, here’s a tip: I always apply my mascara first and then I go in with my false lashes. It makes it look seamless, like your natural and false lashes are ‘glued’ together. For that, I love the Lancôme Hypnôse mascara. When it comes to eyeshadow, I know my colors. Burgundy, brick, and terracotta really make my eyes pop. Even if I’m doing a brown smoky eye, I will put a burgundy shade in the waterline. Purple is a really big color to make green eyes pop, too, and there’s a way to do purple so it’s not so theatrical and cuckoo. I love Kylie’s gel pencil in Shimmery Purple. Sometimes I’ll use a pen for my eyeliner, but mostly, I like an eyeliner pot, like Inglot’s AMC eyeliner gel. I don’t get a lot of transfer to my lid. If some of the color does come off on my eyelash curler, I might go over it with a pen like Tatti’s Double Trouble liner. And I love a brow pencil if I have a bald spot, but then I also love a good eyebrow gel, just a clear one that holds them in place. No color. I love Kylie’s Kybrow gel. At the end of the night, when I’m removing my makeup, I’m really nuts about my eyelashes and my eyes. Our adhesive comes with a Rose Oil Infused Lash Remover that’s really gentle. I use the oil to remove everything, wash my face, but then I’ll take the oil again and keep it on my eyes. I think it helps with wrinkles and just hydrates my eyelashes. I don’t use a dedicated eye cream, but I wear Vaseline or Aquaphor on my eyes every single night.” —As told to Daise Bedolla Photographed by Greg Swales, courtesy of Tatti Lashes",
