  "text": "In ELLE.com’s series Office Hours, we ask people in powerful positions to take us through their first jobs, worst jobs, and everything in between. This month, we spoke with Sabrina Elba, a model, entrepreneur, and Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development. Elba works with IFAD in African countries like Kenya, Zambia, and Egypt, helping farmers, combating hunger, and working on climate change initiatives. She also owns S’Able Labs, a skin care company, and recently partnered with Calvin Klein for their Eternity Amber Essence campaign, where she posed alongside her husband, Idris Elba. Here, she talks about her experience shooting that campaign (featuring the first fragrance she ever bought), how her mom has influenced her advocacy work, and why she’s looking forward to someday becoming a mother herself.My first jobI got approached [by law enforcement] when I was 15 to go to gas stations and ask for cigarettes. If they would sell them to me—illegally, because I was younger—they’d be in trouble. So I was keeping the streets safe for my fellow young people. They wouldn’t be able to buy cigarettes. I’ve always looked a bit older, because I’m tall, so I got away with it really easily. I remember thinking, “Oh, I could be a detective. I’m really good at getting people.”My best jobI never thought I would get into entrepreneurship when I was younger. I am thankful that I’ve married someone who’s opened my blinders a bit and shown me a wider view of what I could do. Starting a beauty business has been such a fruitful thing for me over the past couple of years. One of the reasons I was excited to work with Calvin Klein is because I’m getting to learn so much about the beauty industry. It has been like a master class to see the brand maintain an iconic fragrance by [remaining ] genuine and true to its original roots.My worst jobWhen I moved to London, I took up a job in public relations. It was purpose PR, so we were doing PR for NGOs and charities. As an activist, it was great to see what other NGOs were doing in terms of strategy. But I did not enjoy sitting in an office for that long. I like a more dynamic work-life balance—being able to work while I’m away, while I travel, taking a laptop and going. When I was in PR, I was stuck in the office 9-5 every day.The dream job I haven’t done yetI’m really excited about motherhood. My mom was a stay-at-home mom, and I watched in awe as she raised five kids as a single mother. I think motherhood is something that should be taken seriously. I’m really excited to embark on that journey. It’s not necessarily a job, but that’s something I’m excited to do in terms of a life change. The advice I give to young foundersYou need to understand every part of your business. For me, numbers aren’t necessarily my thing, and trying to understand [that] side of the business wasn’t fun, but I’m glad that I approached it with curiosity.The best career advice I’ve receivedDo not be afraid to ask questions. I’m so thankful there’s no such thing as a stupid question. Ask, ask, ask. It’s really important to make sure that you ask if you don’t understand something. The worst career advice I’ve receivedFake it till you make it. I need to understand. I need to learn. I’m a trained esthetician now, so I understand skin better. I’m not a “fake it till you make it” person. I would literally pass out from anxiety. Ian Forsyth//Getty ImagesElba at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change ConferenceWhy I’m so committed to agricultural developmentMy mom is a big part of the reason I do advocacy. She left Somalia when she was quite young and watched her home country fall apart on TV. It was a super frustrating and vulnerable position to be in, to feel like she couldn’t help. She always told us, “Africa is this amazing place. I need to go back and try to repair things.” She’s had a “give back” mentality that has bled into everything I do. Agriculture is a great way to uplift rural people through investment, not aid. It’s about giving them a means to take care of themselves and a path of economic independence. It allows people to fight back against failed states, climate conflicts, or climate change. In general, [it also helps people] be able to make ends meet, and resist. I’m always trying to make the world a better place for the little girl my mom was.What it was like to shoot the Calvin Klein Eternity campaign with my husbandTo able to work with a fragrance that’s so nostalgic for me—it’s the first fragrance I purchased, and I watched Christy [Turlington] be the face of it growing up—is an absolute honor. One thing I’ve always loved about Calvin Klein is they’re not afraid to show every kind of love. Being able to show our authentic connection in that shoot was such a beautiful experience. It wasn’t asking us to be anything but ourselves. It’s really nice to see Black love showcased the way that Calvin Klein has done it. Calvin KleinMy morning routineI wake up early. I call my family who live on the west coast of Canada. I love to work out with my husband, and do my skin care routine. Getting dressed is a huge part of my day. It just sets my mood. I love fashion. I love accessories. Fragrance really sets my mood, too. I’m someone who has quite an extensive morning routine, so I wake up early to get in all the things that I want. As soon as it’s 8 P.M., I’m not doing anything, so I’ve got to get it all done in the morning.The truth about whether women can “have it all”There’s a bit of a false narrative around telling young women that they can do it all. You should try to do it all, but that involves sacrifice. I’ve had to accept that in my life. I’ve taken a step back from that pressure of trying to do it all. If I can’t get everything done, I can’t, but I try to prioritize and take things day by day. Being this busy means that I’ve had to make some sacrifices along the way.
