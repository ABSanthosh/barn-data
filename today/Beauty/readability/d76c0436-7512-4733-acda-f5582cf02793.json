  "description": "Unless there's a special occasion, I don't usually reach for a full-coverage foundation. More often than not, I finish off my skin-care routine with a tinted SPF, cover any noticeable breakouts with some concealer, and call it a day. But recently, I've been dealing with lingering dark spots and redness - on top of the dryness that I've come to expect each winter. On the hunt for something that evens out my skin tone and brightens my complexion, I picked up the new Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint ($36). What stood out to me about the Super Boost Skin Tint is that it's a makeup product with skin-care benefits. The product is said to provide light-to-medium coverage - which definitely appealed to me, since I like to keep my makeup as lightweight as possible. But it doesn't hurt that the hydrating and plumping skin tint also has ingredients that can help improve the texture and appearance of your complexion right away (and over time). With all that in mind, I decided to put the skin tint to the test and see if it actually makes my skin look better immediately after application. Keep reading for my honest thoughts on the Make Up Forever Super Boost Skin Tint ahead. About the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint According to the brand, the product is a lightweight, moisturizing skin tint with \"buildable, sheer to medium coverage\" that gives skin a long-lasting boost. The Super Boost Skin Tint's unique push-to-dispense tube offers customizable coverage with more control. It's formulated with hydrating and plumping ingredients like polyglutamic and hyaluronic acids, plus grapefruit extract that can help with skin texture and hyperpigmentation. The skin tint is available in 18 different shades. What I Like About the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint One thing I noticed when I first used the skin tint was how unique the packaging was. The Super Boost Skin Tint is dispensed in a tube that looks like a syringe, so if you press lightly on the end, only a small amount comes out. If you press the button down with more force, you end up with more product. My biggest pet peeve is wasting product, which happens often with foundations that don't have a pump, so I love the level of control I have while using this. When it was finally time to apply the tint, it immediately melted into my skin and blended in seamlessly. It had a gel-like texture and barely-there feel. Admittedly, one layer of product felt too sheer on me but still managed to give my skin a more even look and lessen the appearance of dark spots and redness. I don't like covering my freckles, so I appreciated that they were still visible under the tint as well. For more coverage, I could add on another layer, but more often than not I found that one was enough to achieve that \"no makeup\" makeup look. When it comes to wear time, I found that this holds up pretty well on its own and lasts throughout the day. But I prefer to maximize the product's wear time by using it with a light finishing powder. (I use Glossier Wowder, which isn't heavy duty, so it's truly a testament to the tint's staying power.) The skin tint has a radiant finish that leaves skin looking fresh and glowy, but never oily. How to Use the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint For sheer coverage, press down on the end of the tube once. For more coverage, press until you get the desired amount. The brand recommends using your fingers to apply the product to your face and neck. You can use a sponge, but I found that the fingers work better as the sponge soaks up more of the product than I'd like. What to Consider Before Trying the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint The Super Boost Skin Tint is definitely on the lighter side when it comes to coverage, so if you prefer a full-coverage foundation, this probably won't be the best fit for you. Who the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint Is Best For This skin tint is perfect for anyone who wants more coverage than, say, a tinted moisturizer or SPF, but not as much as a typical foundation. If you're also someone who likes seeing skin-loving ingredients in your makeup, the Super Boost Skin Tint may be right up your alley. Where Is the Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint Available? The Make Up For Ever Super Boost Skin Tint is available for purchase at Sephora and Make Up For Ever.
