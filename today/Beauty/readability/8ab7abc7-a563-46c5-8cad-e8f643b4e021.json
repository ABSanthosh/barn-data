In fact, I’ve done everything I can to preserve them into adulthood. Recently, however, I noticed that my face had some unwanted guests, in the form of dark spots. These stubborn sun spots weren’t budging with my usual skin-care routine, so I decided it was time to seek out a product specifically formulated for the job. That’s when Eucerin Radiant Tone Dual Serum landed at my desk.Eucerin Radiant Tone Dual SerumAs a beauty editor, I get introduced to new products all the time. Many of them carry lofty claims, but few truly deliver with results. Still with its unique formula enriched with Thiamidol, Radiant Tone Dual Serum seemed promising. Eucerin spent 10 years researching and testing thousands of formulations to achieve a formula that could effectively reduce the look of dark spots and, with the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen, prevent dark-spot reappearance. I’m a fan of an easy skin-care routine—most days and nights after washing my face, I just opt for moisturizer and an eye cream (plus a sunscreen in the a.m.). The Dual Serum fits nicely into this routine. It has a bouncy gel-cream texture that seeps into skin immediately and feels super-lightweight. Upon first use, I noticed that it gave my skin an instant glow.Courtesy of Katie BerohnBeforeCourtesy of Katie BerohnAfterThough these immediate effects were nice, patience is required when tackling dark spots, so I gave it 12 weeks to do its thing. Throughout this period, I watched my skin transform. My visible dark spots slowly began to fade, and my skin looked more and more even. I also couldn’t believe how much brighter it looked—now my skin looks lit-from-within all the time, like I just got a facial.Dark spots are notoriously difficult to address, and sometimes it’s even more difficult to find products that actually work to keep them at bay long-term. This serum with Thiamidol is one of those formulas that feels like catching lightning in a bottle—it really delivers. Eucerin’s Radiant Tone collection is perfect for anyone else looking to finally show those spots the door and achieve even-looking skin. And the fact that it costs under $40 makes trying it a no-brainer.",
