I picked up the new Pillow Talk Beautyverse Love Palette along with a few other things I restocked. The Charlotte Tilbury team gifted one of their Advent Calendars and it is so cute. I shared an unboxing on reels but thought I’d share swatches of the beauty items here. Advent Calendar \u0026 Gift Sets There are two major gift sets this year from Charlotte Tilbury and I think either would make for the ultimate beauty gift. I was gifted the Treasure Chest of Love 12 Door Beauty Advent Calendar ($220, Charlotte Tilbury, Kohl’s x Sephora, Beautylish and Revolve) and it comes in an impressive heart shaped box with drawers. The handles are shaped like jewels and it really is just so beautiful. It has a good mix of skincare and makeup. I swatched the makeup items below which include the Lip Cheat in Pillow Talk (mini), Matte Revolution Lipstick in Pillow Talk (mini), Hyaluronic Happikiss in Pillow Talk (full size), Eyeliner in Pillow Talk (mini), Beauty Icon Lipstick in Vixen (mini) and the Beauty Light Wand in Pinkgasm (full size). Charlotte Tilbury Hyaluronic Happikiss in Pillow Talk Also wearing: Unreal Skin Sheer Glow Tint Foundation Stick in Shade 7.5, Beautiful Skin Foundation in Shade 6, Airbrush Flawless Finish Powder in Medium, Hollywood Glow Glide Blush/Highligher Duo Light/Medium, Pillow Talk Beautyverse Eyeshadow Palette, Nail Polish Hermes Rouge H, Sweater Madewell Pillow Talk Lip Cheat + Matte Revolution Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Icon Lipstick in Vixen There is another gift set called the Pillow Talk Dreams Come True Makeup Kit ($390, available at Charlotte Tilbury, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, Kohl’s x Sephora). It’s quite the splurge but looks incredibly beautiful in the quilted pink case and compartments filled with 13 full-sized items from the Pillow Talk lineup. Pillow Talk Beautyverse Love Palette The Pillow Talk Beautyverse Love Palette ($69, Nordstrom, Sephora, Bloomingdale’s) is a nine-pan palette with pink, cranberry and fuschia tones. It pulls very berry-like on the eyes and I thought there might be a chance it wouldn’t work for me but the sparkles were SO pretty I decided to give it a try. It has 3 different finishes among the shadows. The mattes are super smooth and have an almost creamy cushiony texture. There are some very sparkly toppers and then a couple shades that have a more refined shimmer. I think it’s beautiful. I don’t think the tones will be for everyone but I think it gives a very pretty holiday glam look. I really hope they make another palette with this formula and texture in a neutral version in the future. Hollywood Blush and Glow Glide Palette I purchased the Hollywood Blush and Glow Glide Palette ($29, Sephora and Nordstrom) and love it. The pink blush is very soft and has a medium neutral undertone. I really love the highlighter because it’s ultra smooth, isn’t too sharp in the shimmer and has a really pretty finish. Although I will say that it’s nearly identical to the Hollywood Glow Glide Face Architect Highlighter in Pillow Talk Glow. I added some more swatches to her Matte Beauty Blush Wands, Beauty Light Wands and Cheek to Chic blushes in pink tones for comparison. Unreal Skin Sheer Glow Tint Foundation Stick I picked up the Unreal Skin Sheer Glow Tint Foundation Stick ($46, picked mine from Sephora) based on the feedback and recommendation from many of you. I had shared some initial thoughts in a shopping story a while back and thought it was going to be too dewy and glowy to wear, even as just a highlight. Most of you also said you passed but a few told me to give it a second chance. Many of you wear it as a glowy base just on a few areas on the face underneath regular foundation much like the Hollywood Flawless Filter but the stick isn’t as shimmery and has a slightly more sheer/balmy finish. Many of my dry-skin readers said it added the perfect amount of glow and hydration and when blended it actually did not look as dewy or shiny as they expected. I am glad I gave it a chance. I ended up picking Shade 7.5. I don’t know that I could wear this come spring or summer in Florida, but it has been exceptionally dry this winter which means it’s more like regular weather that most of you experience. My skin has been very dry lately and it has been LOVING all kinds of cream products and extra rich moisturizers. I have been wearing it as a base all over. Sometimes I’ll just add concealer on areas I need more coverage and set with a powder. Other times I’ll layer my regular foundation on top (I recently repurchased her Beautiful Skin Foundation in Shade 6). I really love it. It’s unlike any other foundation stick I’ve tried and for me it has the perfect amount of glow without being overdone and it does not accentuate fine lines or pores. Overall I give the Foundation Stick a solid 10/10. I do love the Blush Duo although I do think you could dupe the colors with other products. I ended up really liking the Pillow Talk Beautyverse Palette but if you can’t wear berry or pink tones on the eyes then I’d say skip it and opt for something different. You can find all of these still available now. Many retailers are still offering holiday promos so you may want to shop around for an extra discount. Sephora has their Gift For All Event with 20% off using code HAVEITALL (one time use, ends 12/15) Ulta Beauty has 20% off (some exclusions apply) – check your email if you have a Members account for your personal online code (runs through 12/24) and they just added a 20% off deal on 190 brands when you buy online and pick up in store with code HOLIDAY24 Bloomingdale’s has their Beauty Treats Event, take $25 off every $150 you spend on almost all beauty (ends 12/17)",

It pulls very berry-like on the eyes and I thought there might be a chance it wouldn’t work for me but the sparkles were SO pretty I decided to give it a try. It has 3 different finishes among the shadows. The mattes are super smooth and have an almost creamy cushiony texture. There are some very sparkly toppers and then a couple shades that have a more refined shimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it’s beautiful.

Many of you wear it as a glowy base just on a few areas on the face underneath regular foundation much like the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/48mVhi4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHollywood Flawless Filter\u003c/a\u003e but the stick isn’t as shimmery and has a slightly more sheer/balmy finish. Many of my dry-skin readers said it added the perfect amount of glow and hydration and when blended it actually did not look as dewy or shiny as they expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am glad I gave it a chance. I ended up picking Shade 7.5. I don’t know that I could wear this come spring or summer in Florida, but it has been exceptionally dry this winter which means it’s more like regular weather that most of you experience. My skin has been very dry lately and it has been LOVING all kinds of cream products and extra rich moisturizers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been wearing it as a base all over. Sometimes I’ll just add concealer on areas I need more coverage and set with a powder. Other times I’ll layer my regular foundation on top (I recently repurchased her \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3nd1poq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eBeautiful Skin Foundation\u003c/a\u003e in Shade 6). I really love it. It’s unlike any other foundation stick I’ve tried and for me it has the perfect amount of glow without being overdone and it does not accentuate fine lines or pores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall I give the Foundation Stick a solid 10/10. I do love the Blush Duo although I do think you could dupe the colors with other products. I ended up really liking the Pillow Talk Beautyverse Palette but if you can’t wear berry or pink tones on the eyes then I’d say skip it and opt for something different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Charlotte-Tilbury-beautylookbook-haul.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Charlotte-Tilbury-beautylookbook-haul-1440x2160.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Tilbury Haul Beauty Lookbook Picks\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1620\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"Charlotte Tilbury haul picks.
