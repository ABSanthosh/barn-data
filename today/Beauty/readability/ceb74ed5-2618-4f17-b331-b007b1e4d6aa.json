When my friends matured from beauty supply store lip gloss to luxury beauty brands, I remained loyal to my glossy formulas. And when TikTok convinced the world to buy Saie’s Glowy Super Gel, I decided to be glow-free. But scrolling through countless videos of shimmering gel eventually broke through my rebel spirit. I had to try it.Saie’s illuminator feels like it was designed for someone like me: a reformed glow-skeptic with acne-prone skin. For the uninitiated, the brand prides itself on what it calls “Saie Science,” a formula infused with skin-loving, non-comedogenic ingredients that nourish as they enhance. The gel boasts a mix of hydrating rosehip oil and antioxidant-packed papaya seed oil to brighten skin, but the real star is its fatty acid complex, featuring glycerin and squalane. This combination delivers a fast-absorbing, non-greasy finish perfect for year-round wear.Saie Glowy Super Gel Lightweight Dewy Multipurpose IlluminatorAvailable in three shades—Starglow, Sunglow, and the new Roseglow, all priced at $28—the Glowy Super Gel was my indulgence this past summer. Initially, I hesitated to use Roseglow, as I’ve always found illuminating products greasy or glitter-heavy, and they often sit awkwardly on my skin. So naturally, it stayed tucked away on my vanity for weeks, only surfacing when I wanted a soft gilded backing to boost my full-glam looks. I was cautious at first—one pump seemed intimidating; two pumps, indulgent. I rationed each one out of fear of having Edward Cullen-like shimmery skin. As someone with skin that naturally produces a lot of oil, the last thing I wanted was to be shiny and glittery. But to my surprise, the formula was featherlight, almost like water, and melted into my skin with no greasiness at all. The result? A soft, natural glimmer that’s buildable without any hint of sparkle overload—no vampire glow in sight. But as the days grow shorter and the chillier months approach, I find myself reaching for this liquid glow more frequently. I’ve come to see the Glowy Super Gel as my little bottle of sunshine—the perfect way to hold on to summer until the warmer months arrive.When used underneath my makeup, the Glowy Super Gel creates a light, I-woke-up-like-this film on the skin, reminiscent of the one you get after hours in the sun on a tropical vacation. Unlike other formulas that focus more on a glittery finish than a seamless, natural one, Saie’s iteration is basically your favorite lightweight, hydrating serum with a hint of shimmer. The radiance intensifies when mixed with your favorite foundation or skin tint, especially formulas on the lighter, breathable side. However, if you prefer your glow without layers of foundation, blush, or powders, the Super Glowy Gel is also designed to be mixed in with your daily moisturizer. I love a multipurpose product, and the Glowy Super Gel takes on many forms in my beauty routine. In addition to adding subtle sheen to my full-glam base, it’s versatile enough to top my cheeks, the tip of my nose, and Cupid’s bow for an added glow without disrupting any products settled on my face. The gel also works as a body illuminator for my décolletage, shoulders, and neck, too. Ahead of sunnier days and warmer nights, I find comfort in knowing that any time I need a boost of sunshine, Saie’s Glowy Super Gel will deliver that warmth and radiance in just a few pumps.Nerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.
