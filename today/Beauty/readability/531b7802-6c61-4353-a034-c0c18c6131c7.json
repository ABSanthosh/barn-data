  "description": "I don't care what anyone says, TikTok is a treasure. Over the years, the app has introduced me to new ways to wear my hair in a claw clip, a blush makeup hack that made my life infinitely easier, and new relationship advice. What more could someone want? I'm constantly scrolling for beauty tips, especially when it comes to my hair. I have fine hair, and it can look exceptionally flat at the roots when it's dirty. Plus, I only wash it twice a week, so it's actually dirty more often than it's clean. When I saw a video from TikTok user Kaelyn Emily showcasing how a root-thickening spray gave her dirty hair new life, I knew I had to test it out for myself. So, does the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray ($17, originally $24) live up to the hype? Spoiler alert: it does, and it's worth hitting the \"add to cart button,\" especially while it's currently on sale during Amazon's October Prime Day. However, act fast, because the sale ends Oct. 9. Keep scrolling to read my full review and see before and after photos. About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray This liquid formula is made with proprietary elastomers that promise to add volume to the roots of the hair. It can be applied wet or dry and works for all hair types, but it's ideal for thin, fine, or limp hair. It also doubles as a heat protectant, and it's paraben, sulfate, and gluten-free. @kaetheblondie Wait whatttttttt #hairstylistlife #hairstylistsoftiktok #volume #hairtok #flathair #hairhack #hairtips ♬ original sound - Kae What I Like About the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray I've used this product quite a few times since my first trial, and it's become one of my go-to tools for giving my hair volume. Now that I know it works well on dirty and dry hair, it's practically replaced my need for dry shampoo entirely. I've also used it on damp, clean hair, and it's my favorite product for making sure my volume lasts all night long. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness, and there's no visible residue that I often see when using dry shampoos. How to Use the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray The brand recommends applying the product to damp or dry hair, concentrating on the roots, and then styling as desired. In the video I saw on TikTok, the woman applied the product to dirty hair, which is how I initially decided to test it out. I was on day four of not washing, so I wasn't entirely sure whether or not it would work for me as well as it had for her. To try it out, I started out by sectioning off the top of my hair and spraying a generous amount of the product in each section. Then, I took my Dyson Airwrap dryer attachment and soaked up some of the excess product. From there, I took the Dyson round brush attachment and began blowdrying and styling. When I was finished getting everything smooth and dry, I was shocked to see that my hair not only had tons of volume at the roots but also looked like it had been freshly washed. What to Consider Before Trying the ColorWow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray One thing to note about this product is that, unlike dry shampoo, it does require the extra step of styling with a blow dryer or dryer brush. If you're someone who likes a quick fix, this might not be the product for you. However, I think the extra step is worth it based on the results. Also, I have noticed that the product can smell a little bit like alcohol when you first apply it, and although it quickly fades, it can be a little off-putting at first. Where Is the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray Available? The Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray is available on Amazon, as well as the brand's website and Sephora.

If you\u0026#39;re someone who likes a quick fix, this might not be the product for you. However, I think the extra step is worth it based on the results. Also, I have noticed that the product can smell a little bit like alcohol when you first apply it, and although it quickly fades, it can be a little off-putting at first. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Is the Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray Available? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eThe Color Wow Raise the Root Thicken and Lift Spray is available on Amazon, as well as the \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolorwowhair.com%2Fproducts%2Fraise-the-root\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49060256__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003ebrand\u0026#39;s website\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM\u0026amp;mid=2417\u0026amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcolor-wow-raise-root-thicken-lift-spray-P469149%3Fcountry_switch%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26skuId%3D2446714\u0026amp;u1=___psv__p_49060256__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eSephora\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003e★★★★★ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"7\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/renee-rodriguez\"\u003eRenee Rodriguez\u003c/a\u003e is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
