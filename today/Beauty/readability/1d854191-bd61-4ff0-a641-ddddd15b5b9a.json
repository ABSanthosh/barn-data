  "description": "Welcome to Show the Receipts, a new series where we ask interesting people to share exactly how much it costs to get shit done. No matter the task, we're tracking every last dollar from start to finish. Up next: a Met Gala manicure. Julie Kandalec is one of New York City's top manicurists. With celebrity clients like Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain, and Viola Davis, she's on the award-show circuit and regularly on call for fashion's biggest night of the year: the 2025 Met Gala. At this year's Met Gala, themed \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" Kandalec was hired by a brand-new client: Isha Ambani, an Indian business leader from Mumbai. They were connected over Instagram in the days leading up to the Met Gala. \"Her team reached out to me directly on Instagram, proving that social media works,\" says Kandalec. The bespoke nail-design process followed shortly thereafter. \"Not including prepping or packing my kit, I spent about eight hours swatching colors and going over designs with Isha's creative team,\" Kandalec says. They landed on a gorgeous nude manicure with graphic black accents, which ended up being perfectly on-theme with the french manicures with a twist that were all over the red carpet. Here, Kandalec breaks down everything she packed in her Met Gala nail kit - and the associated costs. Keep reading to be shocked. Here's the full breakdown. Task: Met Gala manicure Occupation: Celebrity nail artist Location: New York, New York Timeline: Approximately three days of event prep (although this kit has been developed through Kandalec's many years of experience; it's not a starter pack) The Receipts The kit: $1,403 for a rolling suitcase, a backpack, and a stool to sit on Basics: $488 for toe separators, gel removal foils, acetone, buffers, towels, gloves, and one-time use files Nail tools: $720 for an e-file, e-file bits, diamond nail files, nippers, and nail clipper Skin care: $1,236 for lotions, hand oils, and cuticle oils Nail art supplies: $1,949 for nail art brushes, gems, crystals, and a palette Tech: $573 for an LED lamp, dust collector, light to see, and extension cord Nail polish: $3,348 for 150 gel polishes and between 75-100 of regular polish Enhancements: $638 for builder gels, prep products, lap table for gel lamp, and gel brushes Pedicure tools: $371 pedi bowl, pedi files, and scrubs Ubers: $333 Total Cost: $11,059 How I Did It A seasoned pro, Kandalec has been developing her kit for years and regularly restocks on her essentials. To prep for the 2025 Met Gala, she began shopping three days before the big night. PS: What does the day of the Met Gala look like for you? JK: The day of, we had a later call time of 2 pm, so I blew out my hair and packed my kit in the morning. My light, e-file, and dust collector need to be charged. I make sure my towels are washed. Plus, of course, I disinfect my tools and triple-check that I have everything I need. Nails are so highly chemistry-based that leaving one thing at home will throw off the whole service - and you don't have time to run to the store. This year, it was raining - plus they moved the call time up 30 minutes - so getting there on time was going to be close. But I made it right on time with hair and makeup. We set up in the hotel suite and began glam. I always start with a pedicure, so they have more time to dry before putting on shoes. After glam is done, it's time to get dressed and see the whole look put together. I was able to snag a BTS pic of her nails and jewelry. Then I rush home to watch the rest of the red carpet and see the rest of the looks, and of course, share the team's work on socials. PS: What is the most surprising expense incurred during the Met Gala manicure process? JK: Uber messengers. I am friends with many nail artists, and they know I have a gigantic arsenal: floor-to-ceiling cabinets plus an entire bedroom and my atelier. I'm happy to messenger supplies to anyone who forgot something in L.A. PS: Where do you cut costs and budget for a big event manicure like the Met Gala? JK: I'm not much of a cost-cutter, especially during awards season and Met. It's a huge event, and I want to be prepared and feel confident. I might do the opposite and splurge on a nice massage after, like I plan on doing in Bali this weekend, on a cliffside massage at Alila Villas in Uluwatu. PS: What is an expense that is absolutely worth the splurge when it comes to a Met Gala manicure? JK: My kit has gotten so heavy - 70 pounds, sometimes more - and lifting it in and out of Ubers and up stairs became so difficult that I needed to split the weight. Rolling around two suitcases is cumbersome and takes up too much space in tiny NYC hotel rooms. I had a gift card to TUMI and spotted this backpack ($750). It opens like a suitcase but looks like a backpack. I put most of my polish in here and carry it on my back now, or I can slide it over the handle of my suitcase and roll it. It's a huge splurge, but worth it to not have to lift a 70-pound suitcase anymore. PS: Any tips for a beginner nail artist building a kit for an event like the Met Gala and trying to stay on a budget? JK: Art gels - they're extra pigmented and come in a pot vs. a bottle - are amazing because you can mix so many colors without having to carry around a ton of bottles. Mia Secret ($9) makes nice ones. They're a staple in my kit. Final Thoughts Kandalec admits to being a \"maximalist\" when it comes to her nail kit. But it's a compilation of years of work experience, global travel, and personal curation. \"I just got back from Tokyo and brought back a ton of new gel colors and gems,\" she says. \"I just like to have options. So please don't look at the number and think that's what you must spend. This is a result of years of curating my kit.\" Related: \"Dollop\" Bangs Are the Celebrity-Loved Trend Taking Over Award Season Megan Decker is a freelance writer and editor based in New York City.
