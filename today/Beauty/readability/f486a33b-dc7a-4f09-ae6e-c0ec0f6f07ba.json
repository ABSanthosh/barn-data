  "description": "The 2025 Golden Globes will officially kick off award show season on January 5, 2025, so prepare to see some of Hollywood's biggest stars churn out a seemingly never-ending stream of jaw-dropping hair, makeup, and nail moments in the upcoming weeks. If you're like us, you're not only waiting to devour every single detail of your favorite celebrities's looks, but you may also be a little curious about what exactly goes into those mysterious gift bags that are constantly referenced in postshow interviews. Luckily, we got the inside scoop on what is going to be in the 82nd annual show's bag, and let's just say each attendee is about to have a beauty routine fit for royalty. While not every attendee will receive each item, the total cost of everything included is valued at well over one million dollars. For starters, each gift bag will come with a one-night stay in a Beverly Hills suite at the L'Ermitage Beverly Hills, valued at over $1,500. Not interested in jetting off to Beverly Hills? No worries, they'll also receive a five-night stay in a Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman Resort, which is valued at $55,000. The bags will also be filled with hundreds of dollars worth of beauty products from prestige brands such as La Prairie and Perfumehead. If that wasn't sweet enough, there are also treatments to win (and they're very, very good). If you still want to know more, keep reading to discover the beauty products in the 2025 Golden Globe Awards gift bag.",
