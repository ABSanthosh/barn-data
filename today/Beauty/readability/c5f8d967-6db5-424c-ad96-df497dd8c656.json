  "description": "While I write about makeup nearly every day, I'm still a beginner. I can confidently say that I've mastered my base, which consists of my trusted foundation and concealer. Being that I've gotten so used to this combination, I've never thought of switching out my beloved foundations for another product - until now. In all my years of wearing makeup, I've always used foundation. But on warm days, the staple doesn't always prove to be the best option - especially since I have normal to oily skin. Sure, I've tried sweat-proof foundations and some of the best setting powders on the market, but the formula would still feel heavy after a few hours. Fortunately, I've found the perfect base product to help me solve this problem without compromising on coverage: Milk Makeup's Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint ($36). As someone with sensitive skin, I often return to the phrase \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\" when it comes to my routine. In other words, once I find a product that works well for me, I'm sticking with it. While every beauty aficionado I knew was going wild for skin tints, I stuck with my foundation. Yet, Milk's managed to win me over with its coverage, thanks to its impressive formula and second-skin feel. Keep reading my full review of the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint, and find out why it's well worth the TikTok hype. About the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint It's packed with skin-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide that improve skin texture and boost hydration. You can get up to 12 hours of wear without experiencing any fading, caking, or settling into fine lines. It comes in 15 shades from neutral to cool undertones. The gel formula is safe for acne-prone and sensitive skin. What I Like About the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint Immediately, I fell in love with the Hydro Grip tint's texture. Admittedly, I went a little heavy with the application initially, but after using the brand's blending brush, the tint instantly absorbed into my skin - similar to how water saturates a sponge. I also loved how it didn't crease over time, so I didn't have to go back in with a setting powder to eliminate any lines. You'd truly have to try it to understand. How to Use the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint The Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint comes in a handy tube that you can easily squeeze onto the back of your hand for application. After applying a few dabs on the desired parts of your face, you can blend it with your fingers, a beauty sponge, or a blending brush if you want that extra seamless finish. Take the dewy look a step further with the Hydro Grip Set + Refresh Spray ($38). What to Consider Before Trying the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint This product is a tint, so if you're looking for more coverage, you can pair it with your concealer to get rid of any unwanted blemishes. Also, its texture is pretty dewy, so be sure to pair it with a trusted setting powder or spray. Where Is the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint Available? You can purchase the Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Skin Tint on the brand's website, Sephora, and Kohl's.
