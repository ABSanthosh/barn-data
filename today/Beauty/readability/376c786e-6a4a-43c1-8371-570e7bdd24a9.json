From simple makeup hacks that can create a \"false-lash effect\" or the illusion of fuller lips to a chic manicure and a \"no-filler\" filler, this list is editor-approved. Give your beauty routine a much-needed revamp and try the below trends out for yourself. POPSUGAR Photography | Jessica HarringtonUpside-Down Hair-Washing TrickAfter stumbling across TikTok videos sharing the benefits of upside-down hair washing, PS Senior Beauty Editor Jessica Harrington decided to shampoo and condition her hair with her head flipped upside down. The trick promised to help add volume and body to any hair type, but particularly fine hair. While she admitted washing her hair upside down took longer and even required a detachable shower head, the result was \"magic.\" The hack gave her fine hair \"next-level body,\" especially at the roots, and when it came to curling her hair, it retained its volume and had much more bounce than usual. Read more about her upside-down hair-washing experiment here.POPSUGAR Photography | Renee RodriguezHair DetoxSkip the body detox and opt for a hair detox instead. Inspired by another TikTok scroll, PS Staff Writer and Social Producer Renee Rodriguez gave her scalp's natural oils a reset by forgoing all hair products for a full seven days. After a week, she used a clarifying shampoo to remove any dirt and excess buildup. Though she was nervous about not washing her hair for that long, she said her hair \"felt amazing\" afterward. \"It was super light and bouncy and ultimately felt cleaner than it had in years,\" she wrote — so much so that she's now added a hair detox to her monthly routine. For more details and photos, read about her full hair-detoxing experience.POPSUGAR Photography | Ariel Baker\"Overlip\"-Lining HackFor a simpler makeup hack, PS Assistant Beauty Editor Ariel Baker tested out the \"overlip\"-lining technique. To re-create the K-beauty trend recently popularized on TikTok, she used a neutral lip pencil shade to overextend her natural lip shape. Using her fingers, she blurred the lip pencil before adding a glossy lip balm on top. Not only did the look give her a \"my lips but infinitely better\" effect, but she said it was so quick and easy to achieve, she wondered why she hadn't thought of it before. Get more details on the \"overlip\"-lining hack for faking fuller lips.POPSUGAR Photography | Renee RodriguezNo-Powder Concealer HackIf, like Rodriguez, you're intrigued by the thought of a brighter, creaseless, and concealed undereye area, look no further. Originally shared by makeup artist Vincent Ford, this viral no-powder concealer trick calls for dabbing a concealer brush sprayed with setting spray under the eye before applying product, then repeating the technique with concealer and blending the product into the undereye area. Rodriguez tested the hack for a night out at a concert, and upon seeing how her concealer stayed in place and creased minimally, it \"completely changed\" the way she did her makeup. Read more about how she implemented the trick in her no-powder concealer experiment.POPSUGAR Photography | Jessica Harrington\"False-Lash Effect\" HackCreate the illusion of falsies with the \"false-lash effect\" developed by celebrity makeup artist Erin Parsons. Her method involves first curling the lashes, tight lining the upper waterline with black waterproof eyeliner, applying a coat of mascara, and then combing the lashes to remove clumps. She then repeats the process two more times. Harrington put the hack to the test, and she was \"instantly blown away.\" While it took her the longest amount of time she'd ever spent on mascara alone, the effect gave her incredibly long, curled, and full lashes that \"definitely still looked like [her] eyelashes.\" Read more about why she's adding the \"false-lash effect\" trick to her daily routine.POPSUGAR Photography | Ariel BakerBrush-Priming HackAfter seeing how \"brush priming\" divided TikTok, Baker had to try it for herself. It all started when celebrity makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes recommended that her followers \"prime\" their brushes with foundation by coating the bristles with the formula before applying directly onto the face for smoother application. Though Baker was skeptical at first, after getting used to the application, she saw that the hack gave her skin a smooth, even finish. In fact, she decided to incorporate the technique into her own routine to give herself the effortless, skin-like makeup Hughes is known for. For more details and product recommendations for brush priming, read Baker's full editor experiment.POPSUGAR Photography | Renee Rodriguez\"Sandwich\" Method to Cover PimplesStart covering your pimples like a pro with the \"sandwich\" method, approved by Rodriguez. The viral TikTok technique essentially \"works backward\" and \"sandwiches\" your concealer with setting spray and powder to hide large blemishes. Rodriguez applied setting spray, translucent powder, then concealer on her zit and repeated the powder and setting spray processes again. Afterward, she noticed that while her pimple was still there, it was way less red and noticeable than before. \"If you didn't know it was there, I don't think you'd even notice it,\" she wrote. Learn more about how she used the \"sandwich\" method to cover her blemishes.POPSUGAR Photography | Jessica Harrington\"Bubble Bath\" NailsWhat better time than the new year to experiment with a fresh manicure? Neutral nails were all the rage in 2023, and according to the industry's top manicurists, they'll continue to be everywhere in 2024. \"Bubble bath\" nails — a chic, cloudy-pink shade — are easy to achieve and only cost one editor, Harrington, $12. She described the color as \"my natural nails but better\" and fielded compliments for weeks on end — because the manicure still looked that great long after her appointment. For more details and photos, read her review of her bubble-bath nails in full.POPSUGAR Photography | Kelsey CastañonEphemeral \"Made to Fade\" TattoosThinking about fresh ink in the new year? Consider trying out a semipermanent, \"made to fade\" tattoo. PS senior content director Kelsey Castañon tried out the commitment-free ink, which is designed to slowly break down over time and fully disappear after 10 months to a year. In Castañon's experience, getting an ephemeral tattoo was more painful than a regular one, and she noticed her design started to fade after the six-month mark. But because she had chosen the tattoo as a \"trial run\" for one she already wanted, she ultimately loved the idea of getting to experiment \"without any fear of consequences.\" Read more about her journey to getting a \"made to fade\" tattoo.POPSUGAR Photography | Hannah CassidySkinvive \"No-Filler\" FillerIf you're looking for a minimally invasive treatment that delivers \"compliment-worthy skin,\" check out Skinvive, a new hyaluronic-acid injectable filler that offers a post-facial glow for up to nine months. PS contributor Hannah Cassidy recently gave the buzzy treatment a try, and she can't recommend it enough. As someone with skin that has a predisposition to dryness, she hoped for hydrated skin that she \"could feel so comfortable in\" that she wouldn't even reach for foundation. With a low risk of unintended outcomes, little downtime, and minimal pain, Skinvive is an ideal, unintimidating treatment, particularly for those new to injectables. \"I was having 'good skin days' essentially every day,\" Cassidy said of her results. See more photos and details from her Skinvive experiment.",
