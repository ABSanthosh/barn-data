  "description": "A few weeks ago, I found myself Googling \"salmon sperm face mask.\" I immediately took a second to stop and ask myself, Has my love of beauty gone too far? I wasn't always this way. In fact, just a handful of years ago, I had a minimal skin-care routine that consisted of tap water and a moisturizer my mom introduced me to when I was 13. Back then, I had no idea how to do winged eyeliner (to be honest, I still kind of suck at it), and if you had rattled off the names of five of the most popular beauty brands, I probably wouldn't have recognized a single one. My, how things have changed. These days, I'll do practically anything in the name of good skin, whether it's taking an oral medication, getting beauty treatments like microneedling, or testing out face masks made out of - yep, you guessed it - the sperm of salmon. As in, like, the fish. Have I had sperm on my face one or two times in the past? Sure. But this was an entirely different (and much better, IMO) experience. I'm talking about the viral Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask ($19 for 4). Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask and find out how it worked for me. About the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask It's a color-changing jelly mask that starts pink and becomes transparent. It's made for all skin types. The key ingredients include salmon PRDRN (DNA extracted from salmon sperm) to improve skin's appearance, hydrolyzed collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines, and niacinamide to brighten and reduce irritation. What I Like About the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask First of all, you're probably wondering what on earth salmon PDRN actually is. Let me explain. Salmon PDRN, or polydeoxyribonucleotides, is a DNA extracted from salmon sperm that's sometimes used in skin-care treatments. You can actually get it injected into your face in the form of a salmon sperm facial - a treatment Jennifer Aniston has road-tested - but I haven't gone quite that far. . . yet. This mask, in particular, is great because of how brightening and hydrating it is. I noticed immediately after my first use that my skin looked more luminous and it felt a lot more moisturized, which is something I'm in desperate need of 24/7 because I'm always battling dry flakes around my nose. How to Use the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask The brand says the mask can be used either overnight or during the day. If you want to use it during the day, apply it after using a toner or a serum, and leave it on for three to four hours or until the mask becomes transparent. If you opt to use it overnight, the brand recommends applying the mask at the end of your nighttime skin-care routine and then sleeping with it on. In the morning, take it off and complete your normal steps. I'm a back sleeper, so using it at night isn't a big deal for me; however, if you toss and turn in your sleep, you may have trouble with it falling off. I've used the mask both ways and saw similarly good results. What to Consider Before Trying the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask One thing to note is that this isn't the type of mask you throw on for 15 minutes before hopping in the shower or leaving for a night out. To get the full benefits, you need to wait until it becomes transparent, which takes a minimum of two hours from my experience. If you don't want to sleep in it, prepare to wear it for a good three to four hours during the day. It's also important to note that while I'm totally obsessed with this mask, it won't actually stimulate collagen production (nor will any other topical skin-care product, for that matter). This is because the molecular weight of collagen is too high to be absorbed by the skin. Hydration, on the other hand? It definitely helps with that.
