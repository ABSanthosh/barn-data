  "description": "If there’s one thing OPI knows, it’s how to nail a trend — literally. Whenever we stumble across a viral nail polish video on TikTok, nine times out of 10 it’s an OPI shade swatch. We still remember when our feeds were taken over by one viral Hailey Bieber manicure after another, from vanilla chrome nails (that’s OPI in the shade Funny Bunny, in case you’re wondering) to the more Y2K-inspired digital lavender.OPI has always been ahead of the curve, even before the days of social media. OPI cofounder Suzi Weiss-Fischmann is the mastermind behind various tongue-in-cheek names that made many of its offerings instant classics, like I'm Not Really a Waitress and Don't Bossa Nova Me Around. And let’s not forget fan favorites like Big Apple Red or Lincoln Park After Dark, which have been trademarked due to their universal popularity.We’ve tapped Lia Smith, OPI’s brand education manager, to help us pick out a list of bestselling shades the internet just can’t get enough of.

This white shade formed the backbone of Hailey Bieber’s vanilla chrome manicure, and Sofia Richie Grange also famously wore it to her wedding rehearsal dinner. It’s a lovely sheer cream that turns milky white when you pile on a second coat.Shop UltaOPI Infinite Shine Funny Bunny, $, available at UltaGot The Blues For Red“Rich wine tones are having a moment,” says Smith. “We’ve been seeing a lot of shades that evoke mellow red wine and sumptuous burgundy reds.” Case in point: this TikTok on Got The Blues For Red, a cool-toned dark red, that has received over 330K likes. It’s the kind of jewel tone that we want to peeking from our sweater sleeves as soon as there’s a hint of chill in the air.Shop UltaOPI Got The Blues For Red, $, available at UltaNot Afraid Of The DarkCall it the Espresso effect, but we’re all about brown nail colors lately.
