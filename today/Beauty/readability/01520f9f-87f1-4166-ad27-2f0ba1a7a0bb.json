Looking back at the last 12 months, there have been some major fashion and beauty moments. Who could forget Zendaya arriving at the Dune 2 London premiere in a vintage Mugler robot suit, or Tyla taking to the Met Gala red carpet in her sand-sculpted gown and matching hourglass handbag? Then there was Beyoncé leading the charge for the Western style revival with Cowboy Carter and, most recently, Alex Consani making history at the 2024 Fashion Awards (while wearing Dilara Findikoglu).On the beauty front, Pat McGrath took glass skin to a whole new level at the Maison Margiela artisanal show with a porcelain doll-inspired look, Ariana Grande sold the world on pearlized beauty when she accessorized her Loewe gown with 3D crystallized fairy wings on each eye, and Hailey Bieber sent everyone running for deep blushes when she set off yet another makeup trend.As we prepare to welcome new fashion must-haves and viral makeup looks into our lives in 2025, we’re leaving a little room for one last great 2024 discovery. There’s plenty of newness coming our way this month — see our favorite December drops in the slideshow ahead.Tibi x L.L.Bean L.L.Bean’s iconic Boat and Tote just got a high-fashion twist courtesy of Tibi.

The Tibi x L.L.Bean Boat and Tote is made from 100 percent cotton and features an easy-to-access key ring and bottom handle so it can also be held as a clutch. The pièce de résistance? The leather belt that tops the style.Shop at Tibi Tibi x L.L.Bean The Re-imagined Boat and Tote, $, available at TibiRhode Peppermint Glaze Peptide Lip TreatmentThe virality of Hailey Bieber’s lip products cannot be understated. The nourishing balms are at the heart of her brand, Rhode. This month, Bieber is launching a new, festive flavor: peppermint.

The capsule offers everything from a long-sleeved mesh shirt to a cream collared cardigan emblazoned with balloons.

The brand has heard the cries of KP (keratosis pilaris) sufferers everywhere and launched a body treatment aimed at soothing inflamed bumps, body breakouts, and even pesky ingrown hairs. Providing mild exfoliation, the pads use a combination of azelaic, salicylic, and glycolic acids to calm aggravated skin and even skin tone with prolonged use. They also treat facial marks, like post-pimple-popping stains and dark spots.Murad Retexturizing Body Pads, $, available at MuradCOS x Chris PeraniCalifornia macro-photographer Chris Perani grew up surrounded by forests and marshlands, and it has greatly informed his work.

Take your pick from 10 pigmented shades — our favorites include Ice Sparkle (a slick silver) and Foil Copper (a warm burnt orange). If you prefer a more subtle look, why not grab one of the hydrating matte shades? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShop now at \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.lorealparisusa.com/makeup/eye/eye-shadow/paradise-le-shadow-stick\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eL\u0026#39;Oréal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e7 of 9\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.maison-alaia.com/us/handbag_cod45894809bg.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlaïa Le Teckel Clutch\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eICYMI, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/east-west-handbag-trend\"\u003eeast-west handbag\u003c/a\u003e has been the accessory of the year. Named after its long, sleek shape, the must-have style is Alaïa’s Le Teckel Clutch, the latest iteration of which swaps out the long straps for small tubular handles, reimagining the silhouette as an evening clutch. Available in black goatskin leather with silver hardware, oxblood suede, or black suede with gold hardware, it’s about to be the under-the-arm bag of the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShop now at \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.maison-alaia.com/us/handbag_cod45894809bg.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlaïa\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e8 of 9\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.sephora.com/product/kayali-by-huda-yum-boujee-marshmallow-81-eau-de-parfum-intense-P512856?skuId=2804813\u0026amp;icid2=products%20grid:p512856:product\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKayali Yum Boujeee Marshmallow\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr/\u003eKayali might be known for its woody, oud-forward scents but its Yum collection is serving the sweet-toothed among us. The latest perfume in the range is built around fluffy pink marshmallow, with top notes of fruity apple, lemon, and nectarine blossom. The middle notes stay sweet with coconut flakes and strawberry, and the scent is topped off with dry notes of whipped vanilla and raspberry sugar. Encased in the classic, diamond-shaped bottle (this time in a warm baby pink), this candy-colored creation is seriously delectable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShop now at \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.sephora.com/product/kayali-by-huda-yum-boujee-marshmallow-81-eau-de-parfum-intense-P512856?skuId=2804813\u0026amp;icid2=products%20grid:p512856:product\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSephora\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e9 of 9\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://farmrio.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFarm Rio\u0026#39;s Ski Collection\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eYou might not think of Farm Rio as a winter brand but it has some great cold-weather attire.
