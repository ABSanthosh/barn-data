  "description": "Succeeding as a professional tennis player is no mean feat - but it's one that Alycia Parks already has well in hand. So much so that she's now balancing her Grand Slam dreams with one other major life goal: achieving the perfect face of makeup. Parks admits that her introduction to the world of beauty came \"a little late\" in life because she was banned from wearing makeup for much of her younger years, particularly while she was training. But from the first moment she laid her hands on an eyebrow pencil, she says it was love at first sight - and it's a passion that she's pursuing with aplomb, both on and off the court. \"[Beauty] was definitely a later in life thing for me, because I wasn't allowed to wear makeup when I was younger,\" she says. \"But I'm trying to become a makeup girlie and really learn how to do makeup. Now I do everything. From prepping the face to foundation, concealer, eyebrows, contour. Now, I'm [all about] full-on beauty.\" Parks's beauty journey has come a long way since she was a 19-year-old experimenting with eyeliner for the first time, leading her to another defining moment in her career: a major beauty campaign. The tennis pro has now joined the likes of pop star Jennifer Lopez and Olympic gold medalist Lydia Jacoby by becoming a spokesperson for Gillette Venus, a role that she says has been years in the making. \"I have always used the razors, so it was a fun surprise for me to start working with them,\" she says. Through her work with Venus, Parks is helping to amplify her own personal ethos about self-love and care, particularly when it comes to embracing the most important thing about beauty: how it makes you feel. \"Love yourself first and don't pay attention to what other people think or feel about you,\" she says of her own mindset when it comes to experimenting. \"It doesn't matter what other people think or so, because they can never be you.\" Indeed, far from being just a playful hobby, Parks' love of makeup has helped to serve up a major confidence boost on the court - but not because she wants to look a certain way to appease any naysayers. Instead, Parks says her love of beauty and her focus on her appearance are motivated by one thing: \"If you look good, you play good.\" \"I like to look a certain way on the court,\" she says. \"But I'm not really worried about other people judging me, I just do it for myself.\" Beauty also provides Parks with a fun distraction from the rigamarole of her intensive training schedule, which she readily concedes \"gets kind of boring.\" She is quick to list off the top products she has on-hand anytime she heads to a game or training session in order to ensure she looks and feels her best: Vaseline Lip Therapy ($4), Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 59 Delícia Drench Body Mist ($38), and her Venus MoistureGlide Razor ($18). But it's off the court where she likes to shake things up and experiment with her products and looks. \"I feel like you can do more off the court,\" she says. \"Especially when there are events away from tennis, where you can dress up. I like [going to those] because it means I can attempt to do my makeup again, it gives me a reason to do it.\" Charlie Lankston is a freelance beauty, fashion, and lifestyle writer and media strategist based in New York City, having relocated to the US in 2014 from her home in London.
