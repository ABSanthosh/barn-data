  "text": "Very few people can say they were as busy as Tracey Cunningham last week. Leading up to the Academy Awards, the celebrity colorist worked with 20 clients in a five day sprint. There was Amy Poehler, who walked the Oscars’ stage in a Cunningham dye-job as she presented two Academy Awards. There was also Emma Stone, who got a last-minute touch-up in her hotel room the night before. In between, Cunningham visited Kris Jenner, J.Lo, Lindsay Lohan, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The Mèche Salon founder and Omi chief innovation officer took us through her whirlwind week—from her many appointments, Erewhon pitstops, and the coffee combo that powered her 4AM wake-up calls, below. Wednesday, February 26 Some mornings are meant for slow, luxurious wake-ups. This was not one of them. My alarm went off at 7AM—later than usual, but justifiable. The night before, I’d been at Nicole Richie’s for a house call, which meant I allowed myself the rare indulgence of sleeping in. But now I needed coffee, so I made my usual: Danger coffee (organic and mold-free) laced with Garden of Life MCT oil (for brain health). At 9AM sharp, my assistant Burke arrived ready for the day ahead. We picked up Ashley, my other assistant, at the Calabasas Erewhon, where I ordered a Brainstorm smoothie with extra protein. Because mornings should always come with a little kick, I added a shot of espresso. Then we were off. Destination: Montecito, to see the one and only Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Highlights, lowlights, base. Afterward, she suggested Bettina for lunch, but life had other plans in the form of a “Closed” sign. Before heading to Merci, we made a quick stop at Doên, where I fell in love with (and obviously bought) the most perfect navy blue cashmere sweater. There’s something about a good cashmere sweater that makes the day feel instantly better. At Merci, I had the most perfect red lentil soup, chicken, and chicory salad. And because I am who I am, I also had an iced matcha, no milk. After I ate, I took my Omi hair growth peptide capsules because if I’m committed to anything, it’s good hair. They’ve given me stronger, healthier, and fuller hair since I started taking them a few months ago. We arrived at Anastasia Soare’s house at 6:15PM. Yes, that’s the eyebrow queen herself. Everything about her home was effortlessly elegant, as you’d expect. She made delicious decaffeinated tea and served it in Hermès teacups. Her Shark Speed Style caught my eye, and because Anastasia is Anastasia, she simply handed me an extra one. Our last stop of the day was with Jennifer Lopez. We did her base and then balayage highlights—just enough to brighten up her signature honey-dark locks. After we rinsed, I applied Olaplex No. 4 shampoo and No. 1 Bond Multiplier [Ed. note: only sold to salons for professional use! No. 3 is similar and formulated for at-home use] and she hopped in the shower. Just like that, our job was done. By 10, I was home. No scrolling. No late-night distractions. Just bed. Because at 4AM, my alarm would go off again, and at 6AM, Kris Jenner would be waiting. Thursday, February 27 There’s something about waking up before the world does that feels almost cinematic—if only I weren’t so groggy when it happened. I made my Danger coffee with a dash of OMI Skin Matrix peptides [Ed. note: not available yet] because collagen doesn’t maintain itself, and another splash of my MCT oil. Feeling a little depleted before the day had even begun, I took a salt bath with Saint Jane Deep Sleep bath salts and a generous pour of Kneipp arnica bath oil—it does wonders. Then, at precisely 5AM, Burke arrived, and off we went to Calabasas to see Kris. She got Schwarzkopf Igora Royal at the base and Vibrance on the ends. And then Kris got a blowout, as always, with the Olaplex blow dry mist. Afterwards, while making our way to Mèche, we made the mandatory pilgrimage to the Beverly Hills Erewhon. I ordered my usual—a Brainstorm Smoothie with extra protein and an espresso shot because, well, it was early. We arrived at the salon right on time—9:45—and I walked into a full day of clients. The Highlights, literally and figuratively: —Ashley Tisdale came in looking effortlessly cool as always. We did a full head of highlights, an Olaplex treatment and a 4-in-1 moisture mask [Ed. note: this is only available to hair professionals] to keep her hair healthy and luminous. —Maria Bakalova arrived to get ready for her Oscar parties. We did a soft smudge, which is a delicate way of breaking the base, using Schwarzkopf Igora Royal 9-1 with 30 volume, followed by 8-11 with 20 volume at the roots. We left it on for six minutes—enough to lift the color without making it obvious. Then, we made it a little lighter with an Olaplex treatment and then finished with a Olaplex deep conditioner. The result? Ethereal. —Amy Poehler stopped by because, you know, Oscars. We made sure her blonde was Oscars-ready with Schwarzkopf BlondMe and an Olaplex treatment. A little polish, a little strength—exactly what a big night like this calls for. —Shiri Appleby was looking for a richer color. We used Schwarzkopf Igora at the root and Vibrance on the ends. It’s a subtle shift but the kind that makes all the difference. —Becki Newton, who is currently filming season 4 of The Lincoln Lawyer (one of my favorites!), came in for a quick smudge—enough to keep everything seamless on camera—using Schwarzkopf Igora Royal. At some point between foils and finishing sprays, we ordered lunch from Leora. I had the tuna sandwich—simple, perfect, satisfying, my favorite. It’s the kind of sandwich that reminds you that life’s little pleasures are often the best ones. Then I took my Omi peptides because, if I’m going to keep everyone else’s hair in top shape, I should probably start with my own. By 6PM, it was time to step out of the salon and into something a little more celebratory. Naomi Whittel, the founder of Omi, and I headed to Chez Mia for a dinner honoring a longevity doctor—because who doesn’t want to live forever, or at least look like they do? It was one of those whirlwind days. Friday, February 28 I woke up at 7AM, which, for me, is practically sleeping in. Coffee. Always coffee. I decided to go with the Hiker vanilla and added a generous pour of my MCT oil, because that’s who I am now. And because every good morning ritual should come with a beauty boost, I took one scoop of my Omi Skin Matrix peptides, too. I ordered breakfast on the way to work, but, in classic me fashion, I didn’t touch it for hours. Cold eggs, room-temp avocado toast… Delicious. Next was Zoey Deutch, who was ready for some fresh color. We went with Schwarzkopf Igora Vibrance Rich, the kind of shade that turns heads. Then, Kyle MacLachlan came in, looking every bit the leading man. He’s filming season 2 of Fallout, the post-apocalyptic series that took everyone by surprise last year. The first season was a massive hit, blending dark humor with sci-fi elements, a bit like Twin Peaks meets Wasteland. We touched up his hair, keeping it effortlessly rugged for the role. Up next: Lindsay Lohan. She was in the mood for a little glow-up. First, we smudged her roots to soften her base, added highlights, and finished with an Olaplex 4-in-1 deep conditioning treatment to keep her hair healthy and luminous. Sophie Thatcher was next. She’s been making waves with her roles in Yellowjackets and Companion. She came in blonde but left with a deep auburn. I then sent her off to get a facial with Athena Hewett, the founder of Monastery Skincare who was in town for Oscars weekend. Then it was Melanie Griffith’s turn to sit in the chair. We kept her her classic blonde. I also had Mona May, the brilliant costume designer behind Clueless. Nearly 30 years later, they’re adapting the movie into a stage musical set to debut in the West End. I can’t wait. Once I got home, I applied my Olaplex No. 5 scalp treatment and added the No. 3 Hair Perfector on my ends. I braided my hair, had a nice long soak in the bathtub, and went to bed. Saturday, March 1 I woke up, made my special coffee blend, and took my supplements because consistency is key. Then I fed my four cats, who acted like they hadn’t eaten in days. I got a workout in, just enough to feel accomplished. Then Ashley picked me up and we headed to Emma Stone’s hotel to color her hair: 20 minutes with Schwarzkopf Igora Vibrance followed by a rinse with Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance shampoo and a little Olaplex No. 5 leave-in to finish. (The night of, Mara Roszak did her hair and Rachel Goodwin was on makeup duty. See below.) One house call, and I was done. I went to a birthday party in Santa Monica with a few friends later that night. It was fun until my friend broke her toe, so we called it early. I came home, got cozy, and rewatched the second season of The White Lotus. It was the perfect ending to a quiet day. Sunday, March 2 Some Sundays are full of plans and some are about settling in. Today was the latter. I spent the morning with Maya Rudolph, which is always a good way to begin the day. After that, I got a workout in, and then I came home, turned on the TV, and let the hours pass, waiting for the Oscars. I, like everyone else, watched half-invested in the speeches, fully invested in the gowns. A good Sunday. Simple, easy, and just the way I like it.
