  "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/soap-nails-49426649",
  "description": "Minimalists, if you've been looking for a new nail trend to try, you're going to want to pay attention. The latest manicure taking over our social media feeds is called \"soap nails,\" and it's perfect for fans of \"rich-girl\" nails and \"bubble-bath\" nails. Plus, it's already celebrity-approved by none other than the queen of minimalist manicures herself, Hailey Bieber. Not only did she basically invent the glazed-doughnut manicure, but she's also been the cover girl of many other nail trends, including maple-syrup nails, cinnamon-roll nails, and plenty more. Typically, you can find Bieber with a long, almond-shaped nail, but recently, in a photo teasing her new Rhode lip liners, she opted for short nails in a square shape with a sheer, soapy-pink polish. Plus, Selena Gomez and Kylie Jenner were also seen testing out the popular manicure recently as well. We're predicting the soap nails trend is only going to get more popular in the coming months now that it's been given the stamp of approval by some of our favorite celebrities. Ahead, experts share how to get the look at home, and more. Experts Featured in This Article Elle Gerstein is a celebrity nail artist based in New York City. Olivia Van Iderstine is nail brand Olive and June's manicure trend expert. Thea Green is the founder of nail-care brand Nails Inc. What Are Soap Nails? \"Soap nails are a trend characterized by a soft, translucent, and glossy finish that mimics the smooth, slightly sheer look of a bar of soap,\" Thea Green says. \"Soap nails and milky nails are both trends featuring soft, semi-opaque, and glossy finishes, but they have subtle differences in their aesthetic.\" Another key aspect of soap nails is the shine. The point is to almost make the nail look wet, as though your hands have just come out of a bath. \"Because soap nails are so neutral, they truly work and look amazing on every nail shape and length,\" Olivia Van Iderstine says. \"For a super fresh and easy look, we love them on shorter nails, but you truly can't go wrong.\" How to Get Soap Nails If you're heading to the salon, the easiest thing to do is bring a reference photo with you. \"Ask for a neutral sheer polish without too much pink pigment in it,\" Van Iderstine says. \"The look is milky, so look for shades that have a touch of white. The rest is totally up to you - choose from milky peach, pink, white, or a touch of beige.\" If you want to re-create the look at home, nail prep is key. \"Ensure your nail plate is nice and clean to begin, with your cuticles pushed back and buffed away,\" Van Iderstine says. \"Smooth the nail plate with a soft buffer to ensure your surface is sleek.\" You'll want to start off with a long-lasting top coat, like the Nails Inc. Get Hard Nail Treatment ($9). From there, use a sheer or jelly-like polish, like the Olive and June The Queen Takes Her Tea With Milk ($10) or the OPI Nail Lacquer Nail Polish in Bubble Bath ($23). Top everything off with a cuticle oil or serum. To go the extra mile, make sure your hands look their best as well. The finishing touch on soap nails is plump skin that looks healthy and glowy without the grease. \"To get glowy skin, think of treating your hands and nails just like your face with skin care,\" celebrity manicurist Elle Gerstein says. Gerstein recommends using a hand cream with arnica, like the Seaweed Bath Co. Ultra Hydrating Hand Cream ($10). Keep scrolling to take a look at some soap nail inspiration you can bring with you to your next salon appointment.",
