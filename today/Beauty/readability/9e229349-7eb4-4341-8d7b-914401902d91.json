  "description": "As I watched Suzanne Lambert's now-viral video \"doing makeup like the gorg MAGA girls,\" I started to cringe. With each passing observation - not doing any skin prep so that makeup \"clings\" to dry spots, not using contour or bronzer for a \"matte and flat\" look, applying blush too low, so \"it kind of looks like everything is drooping\" - I cringed harder. While I'm strongly not in support of anything MAGA-related, I'm guilty of a lot of the things Lambert pointed out. I felt ashamed, embarrassed, and deflated - and like I needed to start wearing a sign when I went out that reads \"I'm not MAGA, I just don't know how to do my makeup.\" I like wearing a little glam, but it's never been a serious interest of mine. I wasn't the girl to steal her mom's lipstick growing up or to use my babysitting money on a haul of drugstore products to try. I've leaned on makeup artists in department stores to refresh my look every couple of years and just blindly accepted their advice, as I get overwhelmed walking into Sephora or trying to pick a YouTube makeup video tutorial. Determined to remove any trace of the \"conservative girl\" makeup trend, I reached out to Samara Perchick, a local makeup artist I'd seen on Instagram, for help. Perchick runs what she calls her Natural Glow Academy, a two-hour session meant to help people learn how to apply natural-looking makeup properly. She listened as I walked her through my current routine and product lineup. The verdict? She confirmed (very nicely and gently, I might add) the mistakes I knew I was already making, like using a foundation that was too yellow for my skin tone and mascara that is definitely dry. After that, Perchick got to work, walking me through each step of the process, transforming me from a mistaken MAGA girlie to someone Lambert might be proud of. She gave me a lot of tips, but here are five easy swaps she suggested that will really make a difference in your final look (just in case you, too, are afraid you've fallen victim to the ways of \"Republican\" makeup). Tip 1: A Little Concealer Does the Trick Just like in Lambert's video, I was painting my concealer on. I thought the more I used it, the better I'd be able to hide the dark circles under my eyes. But the volume I was using, combined with the fact that I was doing no skin prep with moisturizer, meant I always ended up with visible creases under my eyes. Instead, Perchick suggests making a small upside-down V-shape under the inner corner of each eye and an upward line at the outer corners. To blend, don't swipe the product all over the undereye. \"Any concealer is going to spread,\" she says. \"This area is prone to creasing, and we don't want to overload it with product.\" By just putting a bit at each corner of my eye, she showed me how I'll be able to blend the product out and still conceal the entire area without setting myself up for heavy creasing. Product used: Benefit Cosmetics Cakeless Concealer ($28) Tip 2: Contour Is a Must Before this little experiment, I had never contoured before. I'd seen videos of people using a bronzing stick but was always scared that I'd mess up the application and end up looking like I had a dirty face. \"No contour on the face is going to leave you looking just flat and unnatural,\" says Perchick, noting that if you're going to use foundation, you need to add dimension back in because \"nobody without makeup is one flat shade of color.\" Perchick recommends making a fishy face to guide the application of your contour stick, placing lines under your cheekbones, jawline, and around the forehead. I could see an instant difference in my face - it really gave me some definition instead of looking matte and flat like before. Product used: Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Biscuit ($26) Tip 3: Apply Blush Above Your Cheeks I really thought blush went right on the apple of your cheeks; it's something I've been doing for the past 25 years or so. I also wasn't blending my blush well, which made for a distinct block of color that didn't look very natural. Perchick refers to her blush guide as her \"Batman mask technique.\" Imagine wearing a Batman mask - that's where you want to apply your product to get a lifted effect. She starts by applying blush on the outer edge of the \"mask,\" and it's only after she's happy with the amount of coverage that she puts a \"super light\" amount on the apples. She also let me know that blush is the first thing that fades in a makeup look, so it's not a bad idea to put on slightly more blush than you think you should to account for that and to lock it in with a powder blush on top. Products used: Merit Beauty Flush Brush in Beverly Hills and Archival ($30) and Makeup by Mario SoftPop Powder Blush in Mellow Mauve ($30) Tip 4: Avoid Mascara Mishaps By Looking Down Another one of Lambert's callouts is getting mascara on your eyelids and not wiping it off - something I've definitely been a repeat offender of doing. In addition to swapping out my dry mascara (it was over a year old, oops) for something new, she also gave me a hack for avoiding this common problem. Using a handheld mirror, look down while applying your mascara. (Just a warning that the angle is absolutely horrific, but if you can stomach it, you'll be able to successfully apply mascara without getting any on your eyelids.) Product used: Maybelline Lash Sensational Sky High Waterproof Mascara ($13) Tip 5: Lip Liner Will Add Definition My 4-year-old wears more lipstick than I do and has started to call me out for leaving the house without any on. Like contouring, I've never used lip liner and I feel similarly intimidated by the idea of it. \"I always blend in the lip liner so it's not as harsh,\" Perchick says while outlining my lips. As she saw my eyes light up in fear, she told me to trust the process. \"It's not going to look right until you have lipstick on.\" And she was right. Using the liner gave my lips a bit more definition, and paired with the lipstick and gloss she chose for me, really tied together the look. Products used: Makeup by Mario Sculpting Lip Pencil in Lauren ($26), Charlotte Tilbury Hyaluronic Happikiss Lipstick Balm in Enchanting Kiss ($35), and Tower28 Beauty ShineOn Jelly Lip Gloss in Sesame ($16) My Final Thoughts My makeup routine was long overdue for an overhaul, so even though I'm still a little hurt about Lambert's sweeping generalizations, her video was the push I needed to get a makeup lesson. In the end, a few easy changes went a long way, and I have to admit, it's quite fun to play around with all of my new products. Is this what most teenage girls feel like? I test-drove my new look for my husband's birthday party, and quite a few people told me they liked my makeup despite not knowing I'd taken a lesson, which felt validating as I've never been told that before. I'm not sure I'll ever be a makeup devotee girlie, but who knows? Maybe you'll find me in a Sephora every once in a while with my newfound confidence.

push I needed to get a makeup lesson. In the end, a few easy changes went a long way, and I have to admit, it\u0026#39;s quite fun to play around with all of my new products. Is this what most teenage girls feel like? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eI test-drove my new look for my husband\u0026#39;s birthday party, and quite a few people told me they liked my makeup despite not knowing I\u0026#39;d taken a lesson, which felt validating as I\u0026#39;ve never been told that before. I\u0026#39;m not sure I\u0026#39;ll ever be a makeup devotee girlie, but who knows? Maybe you\u0026#39;ll find me in a Sephora every once in a while with my newfound confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/Elliott-Harrell\"\u003eElliott Harrell\u003c/a\u003e is a Raleigh, NC-based freelance writer with two little girls who runs a sales team by day and writes about things she\u0026#39;s passionate about, like women\u0026#39;s health, parenting, and food, at night.
