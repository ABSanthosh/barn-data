  "text": "In ELLE’s series Office Hours, we ask people in powerful positions to take us through their first jobs, worst jobs, and everything in between. This month, we spoke with Paris Hilton. You may know her from the early aughts reality show The Simple Life and coining iconic phrases like “That’s hot,” but Hilton is also a mother, entrepreneur, and child’s rights advocate through her nonprofit organization, 11:11 Media Impact. While the world once watched her quit a job by saying, “Bye gorgeous,” the multi-hyphenate is now dispensing her actual best (and worst) career advice, plus the impetus behind her new skin care line, Parívie, launching May 19.My first jobI moved to New York City as a teenager and was a model. I loved walking in all the runway shows, shooting campaigns, and meeting people like David LaChapelle and creating incredible art with him. It was just so much fun to move from LA, where I had lived this very sheltered life, to New York City to follow my dreams.My best jobBeing a mom. I’ve done and accomplished so much in my life that I’m proud of, but being a mom is the most fulfilling job that there is.My worst jobOn The Simple Life, when Nicole [Richie] and I worked at this dairy farm. It was the first job that we had when we moved to Arkansas for the show. It was really a lot. It made me never want to drink milk again. Getting the milk from cows is pretty gross, so that’s why I drink oat milk.My dream jobAn art teacher. I love art, so I think that it would be a lot of fun to teach an arts and crafts class. I guess I do already. It’s not like a school, but when the kids come over with their cousins, I’ll do art days. We’ll paint together, glue little cute things, and make collages. I just love being around kids, and I love art.ParívieThe best career advice I’ve ever gottenMy grandmother always instilled so much confidence in me and made me believe in myself. She told me to never dim my sparkle, to always go for my dreams, and to work hard. Being around her made me the woman that I am today.The worst career advice I’ve ever gottenMy mom told me not to do The Simple Life. My parents and Nicole’s parents both told us not to do it. It was like the first reality show, so she didn’t know what to expect. Then the night after the show ran, my mom called me and said, “You know, I’m never wrong, but [I was]. The show is the most hilarious and amazing [thing] I’ve ever watched. I’m so proud of you girls.”Why I created my own skin care brand, ParívieI have always been obsessed with skin care. I’ve tried every single type of product. I wanted to create something that really worked, that had a whole system with incredible ingredients, perfect texture, but was also backed by science with amazing results. In my career, I’ve always been 10 steps ahead, so I wanted to put all of that into creating the skin care line of my dreams.My wellness routineI built a spa in my house called the Sliving Spa. I have all of the most high-end, medical-grade equipment like hyperbaric chambers, cryotherapy chambers, red light therapy beds, and Hydrafacial machines. It’s epic, and it’s all pink. Then we have Parívie all over as well. It’s a place that I love to go to relax and just get ready, because I’m constantly on and working every single day.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
