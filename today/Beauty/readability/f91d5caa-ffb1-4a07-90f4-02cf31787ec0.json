  "text": "You guys know I've been a huge fan of the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale for the last 6 or so years so I have a bit of experience under my belt of navigating the #Nsale. In case you didn't already know, Nordstrom does a massive sale discounting brand new Fall merchandise before the season begins and after the sale the items will go back up to full price. Yeah. To put it lightly, it's become a really big deal and I usually save up to splurge during the event since I can stock up my wardrobe for the the next half a year with high-quality pieces that are discounted. Key dates to remember: Nordstrom Cardmembers can begin shopping July 12 The sale opens to the public July 19th Many pieces will get restocked as the sale goes on, but not always and many popular items tend to sell out quickly so if you see something you like it's best to grab it ASAP to mitigate the risk of remorse. If I'm on the fence about something I usually buy it first since I can return it if it's not quite the right fit/look which is especially true if you order online. Ok, now down to the good stuff. I've pulled the items into easy-to-navigate categories so you know what's up. Right off the bat I want to share my most-loved items that you've probably seen me wear or pick up from the past. These are fantastic pieces that are definitely worth the purchase and will get a lot of love over time too. Cashmere Sweater Suede Moto Jacket Striped Tee Stuart Weitzman OTK Boot Faux Leather Leggings Longchamp Expandable Tote Black Leather Booties I'm always on the hunt for a good price on cashmere sweaters and I love the colors this one comes in and it's only $64.90 down from $98. BlankNYC also has fantastic moto jackets each year for a great price as well and I love this tan suede version which also comes in grey. And I'm still obsessed with these SPANX faux leather-look leggings because, to put it plainly, they make your butt look awesome. It just sucks everything in and smooths everything out and elevates any casual look. The Longchamp Le Pliage expandable tote is an item that I bought (shown in this haul video) and love so much because of how versatile it is for travel. The bag itself is waterproof with leather handles and is super duper lightweight. It comes in several colors this year including the classics and this gorgeous rust shade. Literally as I was making my order today a lot of these items were selling out so if you really want it, I would bookmark it and check the item out periodically to see if it was restocked. A key restocking time would be right at the beginning of public access on the 19th. If you can't tell, some of the hottest pieces that are a high risk for selling out are ANIMAL print! Whew. (If that's not a huge indicator of a major trend this Fall, I don't know what is.) The Barefoot Dreams circle cardigan is an item that is always so coveted every Nordstrom Anni sale because it feels like a cloud to wear because it's SO SOFT, plus it's machine washable to boot. I absolutely live in mine and gave one to my sister for Christmas last year and all she did was rave about it too. I picked it up in the pewter because the pale grey color is so pretty! I've also been on the hunt for a great leopard cardigan and I like the pattern and price of this one, plus reviewers say it's very soft as well. I'm a big fan of athletic wear, not only for working out but also fulfilling my duties of crawling after a baby and toddler which often requires a lot of flexibility and lower belly compression which high-waisted yoga pants are perfect for. ;) I also have found a new love of Alo Yoga brand since it has smaller sizing (down to xxs) and looks great in and out of the gym because of their cuts and colors. First of all this bra is literally my favorite sports bra (I own it in a couple colors already) because it fits really well if you are smaller-busted. It comes with removable cups to prevent nipplage and I adore this dusty lavender shade, plus the mesh of the long-line part looks very chic. The moto pants are also super stylish for running errands and fit well if you are on the smaller side. I own these in classic black (not on sale) but I'm a bit obsessed with this soft grey situation. AND obviously we cannot forget about beauty! YSL Balm \u0026 Care Lip Duo Dior Addicted To Glow Set Clinique Take The Day Off Set (This is my go-to dual phase eye makeup remover \u0026 cleansing balm!) Big Genius, Little Genius: Dramatically Different Oil-Control Gel Duo Sunday Riley Sunday's Essentials Set Stila Eyeliner \u0026 Liquid Shadow Set I'm someone who finds something I love with beauty and sticks with it so it's a great time to stock up on basics that will definitely get a ton of use like these easy-to-toss-in-your-purse lippies from YSL and Dior and this waterproof eyeliner that works well on hooded eyes. And I somehow always turn to Sunday Riley when I want a little treat for my skin and Good Genes is one of my favorite mild exfoliating serums I've tried which is also ok to use while pregnant and breastfeeding. Once I get my order in I'm planning on doing a try-on haul so subscribe to my Youtube Channel and be sure to turn on the notification bell so you don't miss when it's posted!",
