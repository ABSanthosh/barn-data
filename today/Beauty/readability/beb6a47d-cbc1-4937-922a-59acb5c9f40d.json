  "description": "Building a collection of great makeup products is only half the battle, while the other is finding the best makeup brushes to make application a breeze. When searching for the best face makeup brushes, it's important to keep one thing in mind: the tool that you use to apply your makeup is just as important as the powders, liquids, and creams themselves. That's why when we find a makeup brush we like, we stick to it. While many of us typically search beauty retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty for new makeup brushes to try, some of the best drugstore makeup brushes can be found at the likes of Target, CVS, and Amazon. On the list ahead, we've rounded up our favorite brushes of all time - ones that have earned that title not only for their ability to seamlessly apply our beauty products but also for their ultrasoft bristles, not-so-hefty price tags, and durability. Some are new to the market, while others have been our editors' go-tos for years. Whether it's a buffing foundation brush that pairs beautifully with all formulas and gives skin an airbrushed finish, a dense eyeshadow brush to pack on the pigment from your favorite palette, or a travel-friendly kabuki brush you'll want to bring with you everywhere, we've included them all. Check out our editors' favorite makeup brushes ahead.",
