  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes If you know me, you probably know I love being tan (maybe a little too much - especially when I was 15). Now that I'm nearly 30, I've learned a thing or two about sun exposure and the not-so-great effects of tanning. The result? A less tan version of me - but you'd never know it. I fake it 'til I make it. One brand I've been loving lately is Lux Unfiltered, created by digital creator Sivan Ayla (who I've followed for years). Her products are non-toxic, super hydrating, and - most importantly - they actually work. You've probably heard of the viral No. 32 Gradual Self-Tanning Cream (our editors are also fans of the No. 12 Bronzing Face Drops). But to give even more love to Lux Unfiltered's standout lineup, I'm here to say: the No. 18 Illuminating Beauty Balm Sticks ($34) are my secret weapon to a year-round glow. About Lux Unfiltered No.18 Illuminating Beauty Balm Sticks No.18 is fragrance-free and made with non-toxic ingredients. It comes in four shades: Chili (a spicy red), Salty (a glossy bronze), Sunset (a sun-kissed pink), and Tropics (a tan, bronzy hue). Each stick contains 0.5 oz of product. The key ingredient? Mango butter for a creamy, hydrating finish. What I Like About Lux Unfiltered No.18 Beauty Balm Sticks Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes I've owned the Chili and Tropics shades of these sticks for about three months now, and the difference in compliments I get is palpable. The combo gives me that lit-from-within, sun-kissed, bronzy glow - without any actual sun time. And it's so easy to wear. I use it on both makeup days and no-makeup days; it just makes me look healthy and alive. Even when my skin isn't feeling 100 percent in the dead of winter, it looks like it is. The formula is incredibly hydrating and practically melts into my skin. Honestly, I don't even need moisturizer when I use it - that's how glowy it is. And because it's so nourishing, it blends like a dream. I just use my fingers, and I love the result. At this point, I even keep a few in my purse (as you can tell from how beat up they are - I use them for everything). How to Use Lux Unfiltered No.18 Beauty Balm Sticks Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes The product is pretty versatile - the brand even notes on its website that you can use it on your cheekbones, temples, nose, or \"anywhere you wish to illuminate.\" I've even used it on my lips, and it worked beautifully, adding the perfect pop of color. Personally, I usually apply it to my cheeks, nose, and forehead for a natural wash of color, then blend it out with either my fingers or a blush brush. The formula is definitely pigmented, but once blended, it gives a soft, natural-looking flush. And if you want more intensity, it layers really well without looking cakey. What to Consider Before Trying Lux Unfiltered No.18 Beauty Balm Sticks One thing to note before purchasing this product is that it's quite creamy. If it's delivered in a warm environment, it's recommended that you pop it in the fridge before opening. This helps the product maintain its shape and prevents it from getting damaged in the process. I definitely made this mistake, and it affected the shape of my balm sticks - so take my advice and refrigerate it first, just in case!
