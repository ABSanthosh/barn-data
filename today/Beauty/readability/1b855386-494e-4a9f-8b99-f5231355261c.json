  "description": "As a curly girl with coarse, dry, 3C strands, I always struggled to find products that did anything positive for my hair. Trust me, the Mufasa mane was real any time I would try your typical run-of-the-mill salon brand — it just didn’t work. Unfortunately, many other Black women tell me they’ve had similar experiences and that it’s frustrating trying to find what truly works for coarser hair textures. Enter: SheaMoisture. I’d honestly given up hope until I wandered into my local Target one day and decided to pick up a few products from the brand. I’d heard only positive things about it from my fellow curlies because it’s affordable and the formulas *actually* work. SheaMoisture products are designed with my hair type in mind — curly and coily textures that need more hydration than average to remain soft, frizz-free, and easy to manage.Another thing you should know about my hair is that I have a lot of it, so if I use the wrong products, things can go south very quickly. This made me skeptical at first to try anything new, but I decided to give the brand’s Manuka Honey \u0026 Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Treatment a go along with the leave-in. I was impressed. The two treatments are staples of mine to this day and I use them weekly. They both keep my hair so soft, tangle-free, shiny, and hydrated. I couldn’t ask for a better duo.Needless to say, I’d finally found relief and now that the holiday season has rolled around, I can now share this gift of next-level hair with someone else. If you have a friend or family member with a similar hair type, I’m here to provide your SheaMoisture gift guide featuring every key product they’ll love. Anyone whose hair is their pride and glory won’t be disappointed — including yourself if you’re looking to snag yourself a holiday treat. For everything I’m gifting from the brand this season, take a look ahead.Bond Repair Leave-In ConditionerFor anyone on your list who’s dealing with dryness, split ends, breakage, or chemical damage, SheaMoisture’s Bond Repair Leave-In Conditioner is just the ticket. It’s infused with amla oil, a restorative HydroPlex infusion, shea butter, and an amino acid blend that provides some serious TLC when it comes to hydration. On wet hair, it provides 12 times more moisture than normal and eight times more on dry hair. Detangling and smoothing curly and coily textures is a breeze when you use it and it even assists with humidity control.SheaMoisture Bond Repair Leave-In Conditioner, $, available at WalmartBonding OilIf your best friend happens to heat style daily, then this Bonding Oil is a must. It’s super lightweight but contains hydration heavy-hitters similar to the leave-in (shea butter and amla oil). The addition of sunflower, castor, and grapeseed oils in this formula, though, really helps lock in moisture and seal the hair cuticle against styling damage. Flyaways are also no match for it with 24-hour frizz control.SheaMoisture Bonding Oil, $, available at WalmartBond Repair ShampooOkay — you caught me. I’ll be buying this Bond Repair Shampoo for myself because it’s perfect for my hair type. It’s formulated for curl and coil types three and four and contains the brand’s unique amino acid blend. This ensures that the hair retains 60% more moisture and removes buildup without stripping it of its natural oils. SheaMoisture Bond Repair Shampoo, $, available at WalmartBond Repair ConditionerI have several family members who relaxed their hair recently and didn’t love the results (it left their strands damaged), so I know this conditioner will be perfect for them. It’s part of the brand’s four-step repair system along with the other Bond Repair collection items I mentioned. It really adds that extra moisture and softness to strands that are coarse or brittle while working to repair broken hair bonds. As a bonus, it’s also great for protective styles.SheaMoisture Bond Repair Conditioner, $, available at WalmartCoconut \u0026 Hibiscus Curl-Enhancing SmoothieThis is a classic SheaMoisture favorite that I loved when I started my natural hair journey because it’s perfect for leaving my thick curls defined. If you have a sibling with a similar hair type as you, don’t hesitate to buy it for them this holiday season. It’s packed with super hydrators like neem oil, coconut oil, and silk protein — a winning trio for dry, coarse curl types.SheaMoisture Coconut \u0026 Hibiscus Curl-Enhancing Smoothie, $, available at WalmartCoconut \u0026 Hibiscus Frizz-Free Curl MousseI know you have curly-haired friends who complain about the crunchiness that comes with using gel for definition.
