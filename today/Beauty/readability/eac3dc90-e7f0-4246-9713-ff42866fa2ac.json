  "description": "Boldness was calling. My long blond ends were my hair default, my security blanket since 2019. At that point, I'd been planning my upcoming nuptials - focused more on my bridal beauty look than my crumbling relationship. My Pinterest boards overflowed with \"retro regal\" inspiration - a lemony Grace Kelly bun that morphed into a Bardot ponytail. Fast forward to 2025, six years later: That wedding never happened, yet I still clung to the credence that long hair meant variety; long hair meant sexy. You can pile it high into a Dolce \u0026 Gabbana updo or slick it into a Hailey Bieber bun. I felt that way until a week before my 40th birthday this past February when I saw a photo of myself. The broken hair was obvious. My strands bore the scars of six years of bleach. It was doing nothing for me - not flattering a single feature, it was just . . . there. That's when the vision struck – what about a chin-grazing chop? A quantum beauty leap into a \"short hair, don't care\" decade. I began my research, overwhelmed by the bob-ptions - there's the \"baroque\" bob, the \"Prada\" bob, and even the floppy \"cowgirl bob.\" How short do you go? Experts Featured in This Article Julien Farel is a celebrity hairstylist and CEO and chairman of the Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa in New York City and Palm Beach. Raphael Mauriello is the senior colorist at Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa. What Is a \"Princess\" Bob Haircut? I knew who to turn to for my transformation: the visionary French hair architect Julien Farel, CEO and chairman of the Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa in New York City and Palm Beach. Farel, an undeniable icon himself (yes, Martha Stewart has sat in his chair), is renowned for conjuring up new identities with a pair of scissors. With my heart set on a bob that would reign supreme, I settled in his chair at his bustling Park Avenue salon armed with inspo. He quickly eyed my references and said, \"Shorter than these photos. A sur mesure 'princess bob' for you - just below the ears. Polished, elegant, and sophisticated. The length is very important to capture your sharp jawline.\" But what makes a princess bob a princess bob, you ask? Inspired by one of its most popular wearers, royal 'it' girl Princess Olympia of Greece, Farel says the princess look is a chic, short bob haircut with an invisible layer to add movement, keeping the look super blunt. Worn parted down the middle, you might as well add a royal title to your bio. My Princess Bob Transformation Shorter? The haircut anxiety hit me as I wondered if I had enough time to bolt. Just as I contemplated my escape, Farel snipped off the first chunk of hair and handed it to me - a reminder of my past \"look\" akin to barn hay. I exhaled and already felt better. After I got shampooed, scalp massaged, and conditioned, I was ready for Farel, the master of makeovers, to work his enchantment. As he masterfully shaped and angled what felt like every single strand, we discussed what a new haircut can do for one's confidence. \"We are the cheapest surgeons,\" Farel said. \"You can completely change how someone looks by adjusting the volume of their hair to suit their face shape.\" When I asked about the bespoke bob he was creating for me, he said, \"This is tailored to your face and lifestyle. I want you to be able to wear it and style it any way you want - straight, sleek, wavy, curly, bouncy.\" After a whirlwind of snipping, feathering, flipping, and blow drying, I turned to the mirror, stunned by my new look. Who was this chic - and dare I say, regal - version of me? Farel smiled and said, \"When you walked in here, your hair was making you tired. It was draining your energy. I had to lift you up. I had a vision for you: You look fresh, sexy, and glam, and your hair texture looks and feels healthy again.\" He finished with, \"Next up . . . blonder. Come back for a lighter platinum look in a few days.\" Those few days with my new cut were filled with compliments and confidence overload. While on 59th Street, I snapped a selfie to share with my friends, and a stranger chimed in, \"Don't worry. You look hot.\" I was giddy. When my boyfriend saw me, he twirled me around and put his hands around my waist. \"You look younger. I can see your face.\" I walked with a new swagger. I even scored free matcha cookies while picking up my Bondi Sushi order. Next on the agenda was the color, and for any blond, nothing turns us on more than the word \"blonder.\" I returned to Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa and met with senior colorist Raphael Mauriello to make the leap to platinum. \"Platinum is timeless and harmonizes beautifully with your coloring and short hair,\" Mauriello said. \"From Marilyn Monroe to Madonna and Kim Kardashian, platinum signifies both power and softness.\" As he painted my hair with a bowl of lavender cream, he continued, \"Platinum is perfect for you because it thrives with frequent trims, minimizing damage.\" He added, \"It also complements your vibrant personality.\" After the blond was fully baked, I enjoyed a lavish hot towel treatment to lock in moisture and got a beachy, piecey blowout. I glided through the salon, which now felt like my place of rebirth, fully reveling in my results. Princess, queen, your royal highness - whatever crowned title was bestowed on this bob felt irrelevant. I was me, just better.

While on 59th Street, I snapped a selfie to share with my friends, and a stranger chimed in, \u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t worry. You look hot.\u0026#34; I was giddy. When my boyfriend saw me, he twirled me around and put his hands around my waist. \u0026#34;You look younger. I can see your face.\u0026#34; I walked with a new swagger. I even scored free matcha cookies while picking up my Bondi Sushi order. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eNext on the agenda was the color, and for any blond, nothing turns us on more than the word \u0026#34;blonder.\u0026#34; I returned to Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026amp; Spa and met with senior colorist Raphael Mauriello to make the leap to \u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Platinum-Blonde-Hair-Color-Ideas-43642527\"\u003eplatinum\u003c/a\u003e. \u0026#34;Platinum is timeless and harmonizes beautifully with your coloring and short hair,\u0026#34; Mauriello said. \u0026#34;From Marilyn Monroe to Madonna and Kim Kardashian, platinum signifies both power and softness.\u0026#34; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eAs he painted my hair with a bowl of lavender cream, he continued, \u0026#34;Platinum is perfect for you because it thrives with frequent trims, minimizing damage.\u0026#34; He added, \u0026#34;It also complements your vibrant personality.\u0026#34; After the blond was fully baked, I enjoyed a lavish hot towel treatment to lock in moisture and got a beachy, piecey blowout. I glided through the salon, which now felt like my place of rebirth, fully reveling in my results. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003ePrincess, queen, your royal highness — whatever crowned title was bestowed on this bob felt irrelevant.
