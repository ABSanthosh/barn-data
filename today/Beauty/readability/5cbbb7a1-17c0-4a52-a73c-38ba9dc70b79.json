  "description": "If I had to pick one category of beauty products to invest in, I'd go with beauty gadgets. Whether it's LED masks, microcurrent devices, or tools geared toward sculpting and snatching, I'm always game to try them. Recently, Higher Dose just launched a tool that combines multiple different types of beauty technologies in one - and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it to try it. The brand is best known for its red light products (one of our editors is obsessed with the hair-growth hat), and the latest product combines red light, microcurrent, and lymphatic drainage. The main tool in the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set ($399) looks kind of like a mini boomerang (yeah, those things you throw), but what it actually does is a lot more interesting. No, it won't make its way back to you if you throw it, but it will help improve skin texture, increase blood flow, and ease your sore muscles. Sounds pretty good, right? Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set. About the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set It's a body sculpting tool that uses microccurent and red light therapy. It features 14 dual-chip LEDs. It helps support the body post-workout, offers temporary pain relief, boosts circulation, and enhances muscle tone. The set comes with a body sculptor, a sculpting activator gel, a transdermal magnesium spray, a carrying case, and a charger. Treatment time is 10 minutes per session. The battery takes three hours to charge, and lasts for 60 minutes. What I Like About the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set One of my favorite things about the Higher Dose Body Sculptor is that it's small and compact. I know that might seem like a tiny detail, but trust me when I say I own a lot of beauty gadgets, and most of them are ginormous and don't easily fit in a suitcase, let alone a purse. This product is sleek, and it's easy to stick in my overnight bag if I'm heading on a trip. Although it does require a tiny bit of elbow grease to use, it's one of the more fun - and relaxing - beauty rituals I do every week. It's especially nice to use on my calves post-workout, and it's also great for whenever I'm feeling bloated or swollen. I'm hoping that with continued use, I'll see an improvement in the cellulite on the backs of my legs. How to Use the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set This product can be used for fascia release, lymphatic drainage, and muscle activation. The brand recommends starting out with clean, dry skin, and then prepping with the Sculpting Activator Gel. You can also opt to layer with the Transdermal Magnesium Spray. Next, power on the device and select the mode you want to use. The red light only mode will power on automatically, but if you want to use the microcurrent, press and hold the button to turn it on and then select your intensity level. For the next ten minutes, begin by gliding the device over the skin in upward strokes slowly for one to five minutes per area. If your goal is to sculpt and firm, you can use firmer strokes and a higher microcurrent intensity level. If your goal is for lymph drainage, the brand recommends using light pressure and moving toward the lymph nodes. However - it's not recommended for us on the neck or thyroid glands. The brand suggests using the tool five times per week for the first six weeks, and then you can drop down to two to three times per week. It can be used on the stomach, butt, thighs, arms, and legs, or other external surfaces below the neck and chest. I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I prefer to use it after working out to help massage my legs and arms. I typically do a 10-minute session before I get in the shower at the end of the night, or immediately after a workout. What to Consider Before Trying the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set One thing to note about this product is although it's currently only available as a set, you will be able to purchase the Transdermal Magnesium Spray and Sculpting Activator Gel separately if you need refills. One other thing to note is that while this product is easy to use on yourself - it feels even better if you can get someone else to do it for you. On that note - I'm looking for a boyfriend. Any takers? Where the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set Is Available The Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set is available directly on a brand's website.

The brand recommends starting out with clean, dry skin, and then prepping with the Sculpting Activator Gel. You can also opt to layer with the Transdermal Magnesium Spray. Next, power on the device and select the mode you want to use. The red light only mode will power on automatically, but if you want to use the microcurrent, press and hold the button to turn it on and then select your intensity level.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eFor the next ten minutes, begin by gliding the device over the skin in upward strokes slowly for one to five minutes per area. If your goal is to sculpt and firm, you can use firmer strokes and a higher microcurrent intensity level. If your goal is for lymph drainage, the brand recommends using light pressure and moving toward the lymph nodes. However — it\u0026#39;s not recommended for us on the neck or thyroid glands. The brand suggests using the tool five times per week for the first six weeks, and then you can drop down to two to three times per week. It can be used on the stomach, butt, thighs, arms, and legs, or other external surfaces below the neck and chest.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eI\u0026#39;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and I prefer to use it after working out to help massage my legs and arms. I typically do a 10-minute session before I get in the shower at the end of the night, or immediately after a workout.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Trying the Higher Dose Body Sculptor Ritual Set\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eOne thing to note about this product is although it\u0026#39;s currently only available as a set, you will be able to purchase the Transdermal Magnesium Spray and Sculpting Activator Gel separately if you need refills.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eOne other thing to note is that while this product is easy to use on yourself — it feels even better if you can get someone else to do it for you. On that note — I\u0026#39;m looking for a boyfriend.
