  "description": "Lizzo just took the cat-eye nail trend on vacation. While partying at Hi Ibiza, a disco club in Spain, with Grammy-winning music producer Kaytranada, the singer showed off a fresh set on Instagram of silver cat-eye nails paired with head-turning, Game of Thrones-inspired icy blond curls. Lizzo's nails feature a chrome-silver base with a soft diagonal stripe of light - the telltale sign of a cat-eye manicure. The effect comes from a magnetic polish laced with iron particles, which shift when a magnet is held over the nail, creating a glowing, dimensional finish. The result is like a cross between velvet, shimmer, and molten metal - similar to the reflective surface of an actual cat's eye. Originally popular in the early 2010s, cat-eye nails have returned with a modern twist, thanks to a new wave of celebrity fans like Jenna Dewan, Sydney Sweeney, and Ashley Tisdale. While the look works in nearly every color, Lizzo's silver take feels equal parts mermaidcore and sci-fi. Image Source: Instagram user lizzobeeating Want to try it at home? All you need is a magnetic cat-eye polish or a silver glitter, like the Manicurist Nail Polish in Disco ($14) or the Cirque Colors Magnetic Nail Polish in Starry Eyed ($17). Whether you're headed to Ibiza or just want something eye-catching for the weekend, silver cat-eye nails might be your next move.
