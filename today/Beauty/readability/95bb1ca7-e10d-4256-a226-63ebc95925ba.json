  "text": "“I grew up in Australia, but I moved to LA two and a half years ago with my husband, Cody. The first few months that we were setting up our house in LA, everything—like talking to the plumber and the insurance companies—fell on me because I was only doing a little bit of modeling and content creation at the time. At a certain point, I remember thinking, ‘I’m up until 10PM every night on my laptop, but for what?’ I’d been watching my husband build his business for years, and I decided that I should build my own, too. My mind immediately went to jewelry. I’ve always been a jewelry girl—everyone always asks me where my stuff is from—but I also didn’t have a lot of money to invest in the business at the beginning since it was all tied up in our house. The most I could really put into it was $900, which I used to cover things like packaging materials from Amazon, a Shopify subscription, and of course, materials, like sourcing vintage pendants at flea markets. That’s how Heaven Mayhem was born. For the first six months or so, it really was just me sitting on my bedroom floor cutting out cord and hand-making necklaces. Of course, I wore my own pieces, and then a couple of big influencers posted about them and the business grew from there. We launched belts and earrings last year, and we launched amazing bean pebble necklaces in June and our watches and broaches in July. SKINCARE Sharlena Hassani, the founder of Artisan of Skin, does Kourtney Kardashian’s skin, and she transformed Kylie Jenner’s skin, too. I met her at a Poosh event, and I told her about these two or three pimples I always tend to get. She invited me to come in, but I waited a year and a half because I knew it was a pricey facial. But when I did go, she redid my entire skincare routine with a lot of Jan Marini products. I always cleanse with Image’s Ormedic cleanser in the morning and follow it up with Jan Marini’s C-ESTA serum, which is pretty life-changing to be honest. My skin is so much brighter and smooth when I use it. I love both the Hyla3D and Transformation cream and will often use both, followed by my holy grail Antioxidant SPF 33. It goes on so smoothly, and it’s one of the few sunscreens I’ve tried that doesn’t leave a film behind. I can just put it on and go on with my day if I want to. Every other night, I cleanse with Jan Marini’s Bioglycolic cleanser, but my skin can get a little sensitive with it so I like to alternate it with Image’s Ormedic. I dry my skin with Clean Skin Club’s face towels and then use my Dr. Dennis Gross LED mask for six minutes—three minutes with the red light and three minutes with the purple light. I pick my skin and using it has been a great way to calm down my breakouts before I can get to them. Sharlena told me Jan Marini’s Regeneration serum would dramatically change my skin, so I use it every night. Then I apply a tiny layer of the Bioclear serum, which is glycolic acid-based, and my Transformation cream. If I have a pimple, I might spot treat it with her benzoyl peroxide lotion. If not, I’ll swipe on Rhode’s lip treatment and go straight to bed. MAKEUP I have one makeup look. [Laughs] I always start off with a thick moisturizer for my base. Augustinus Bader’s Rich Cream is so good, but I also love the Magic Cream from Charlotte Tilbury. I do a layer with a glowy primer, like Saie’s Glowy Super Gel or Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Filter. Recently, I’ve been loving Make Up For Ever HD Skin foundation in 2Y20. It’s pretty light. I tried Kylie Cosmetics’s skin tint in 4.8N and I actually love it, but I use it more during the day. Kosas’ Revealer concealer in 5N is my favorite. Actually, I just ran out, and will be ordering three more tubes. It doesn’t crease and has great coverage. I have so many blushes, but I really love Rhode’s in Freckle and Westman Atelier’s in Petal. They’re both so creamy and blend out nicely. I think you get a lot of use of them, too. I used the same Westman Atelier tube from February 2022 to June 2023—and I use blush every single day. I set it with Hourglass’ Sublime Flush blush. I’m not the best at eye makeup, but I find Charlotte Tilbury’s Super Nude palette really easy to use. I use it every single day, and I love that it’s small so I can take it everywhere with me pretty easily. I don’t like volumizing mascaras—I just want an extra dose of color on my lashes. Merit and Glossier both have good ones. My brows are actually quite light and I don’t like them to look too filled in, so I usually go for the lightest shade of blonde I can find in a pencil. I top them off with the brow gel from Kosas. Oh, and I love brown eyeliner. Right now, I’m using the Barbarella Brow Rock 'N' Kohl pencil from Charlotte Tilbury. People always ask me, ‘You have amazing skin. What’s on it?’ A part of it is the powders that I use. People never believe me because they say I don’t look like I’m wearing powder, but I think that proves how good Hourglass’ Ambient Lighting palette in Volume II is. I brush through the colors a couple of times with my Hourglass Veil powder brush and dab it all over my face. It not only sets the makeup, but it makes you look so glowy, too. I got lip filler once and I absolutely hated how I looked. For six months, I felt sick when I looked in the mirror. But I started getting my lips blushed a couple of months ago. I go to Erin Skipley at Contour + Ink in Beverly HIlls. She’s so talented. The color looks much darker at first but then settles with time. It wasn’t super painful—I mean, it stings because you’re there for an hour—but the thing is, I have a pretty high pain tolerance if I know what the issue is. If I cut my leg, I’m all good. If I have a pain inside my body, like an ear infection, it’s over for me. Even with blushed lips, I don’t feel like myself without lip liner. I have a lot of them, and they’re all over the place—around the house, in my purses, you name it. They’re almost all in the same color family though. [Laughs] Make Up For Ever’s Anywhere Caffeine is among the darker ones in my collection. Charlotte Tilbury’s Pillow Talk is a bit more pink. Refy’s Rosewood is great, too. I don’t use a ton of lipstick. I also don’t use a lot of gloss because I don’t want my lips to look shiny. I’m happy just lining my lips and throwing on Summer Fridays lip balm in Vanilla or Rhode’s lip treatment in Salted Caramel. If I do want a tiny bit of color, Merit’s tinted lip oil in Marrakech, a soft peach, is the best. HAIR I have a rule when it comes to my hair: I can only dye it twice a year. That’s it. When I see Travis Ogletree, the founder of Treehouse Hair, I get the softest little highlights and I always tell him that I want them to look so natural so they grow out nicely. He really makes it last. I do see him every three months for haircuts though. In between visits, I love Crown Affair’s Ritual shampoo and conditioner. Their leave-in-conditioner is so good, too. I like to put it in my hair and let it sit for 20 minutes before I go in with the Oribe Gold Lust spray and Dyson Air Wrap. My hair gets weighed down if I add in other products. If I wear a slick bun, I run Emi Jay’s Angelstick through my hair and then brush through it with a Mason Pearson brush. NAILS I get hard gel manicures at Color Coat. I usually don’t get nail extensions, but I also don’t like short or squared nails because they make my fingers look like they’ve been chopped off. I go for long and almond-shaped. Usually, I do one coat of Bubble Bath and one coat of Put It In Neutral from OPI in the summer months. In the winter, I love wearing We The Female, a burgundy red, from OPI. It’s a classic.” —As told to Daise Bedolla Photographed by Brittany Bravo in Los Angeles on August 8, 2024",
