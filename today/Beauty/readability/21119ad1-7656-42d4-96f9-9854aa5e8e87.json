I’ll let you in on something I share with top dermatologists, Hailey Bieber, and Drew Barrymore (to name a few fans): We all love EltaMD’s UV Clear sunscreen. The brand specializes in skin-friendly, elegantly formulated sunscreen. Aside from regularly being name-dropped by celebs and beauty editors, EltaMD is a rather unlikely viral beauty hit. For starters, at $44, it faces stiff competition from drugstore juggernauts that clock in at half the price; and it boasts a prescription-quality packaging – and I say this with love — that doesn’t necessarily scream “luxe.” But perhaps that unique cosmeceutical crunchiness is part of its draw — after all, it’s what’s inside that counts. Ahead, I tried the mystical bottle for myself on my acne-prone skin to see if it could be my sunscreen dreams come true. DashDividers_1_500x100 EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, $44 First Impressions I’ve tried a ton of sunscreens in my career as a beauty writer, so I have a pretty good idea of whether or not something will break me out, and EltaMD’s UV Clear sunscreen was love at first pump. The texture was lightweight but silky — my oily skin drank it right up and immediately felt hydrated and bouncy. It dispenses as a white lotion, but blended in completely clear on my olive skin. (I also tried the popular tinted version, which is available in two shades and offers sheer coverage.) Wearing It Out After wearing it on and off for years, it still has yet to break me out ever — which for my finicky complexion, is no small feat. I added some foundation and concealer over the sunscreen to see if it could compare to the makeup grippiness of Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen. It was pretty good, but I did add some loose powder to set and absorb shine. This step is very optional, but when you’re as oily as I am, there’s a fine line between dewy and greasy. Final Thoughts While $44 ($46 for the tinted versions) is not exactly cheap for a single bottle of sunscreen, EltaMD’s UV Clear is a definite upgrade from the drugstore aisle — it just feels expensive. Plus, while the UV Clear is a fan-fave, the brand has a veritable coterie of SPF; there’s the aforementioned tinted one if you crave light coverage, hydrating formulas spiked with hyaluronic acid, and a just-launched green-tinted one to counteract redness, as well.
