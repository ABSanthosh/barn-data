  "description": "Image Source: Monica Schipper/Getty Images Taylor Frankie Paul of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" was 15 years old when she moved to Utah from Colorado and experienced the culture shock of the state's seemingly \"perfect\" beauty standards. But that doesn't mean she didn't fit in instantly. \"The beauty culture here [is about looking] well kept because everyone else is,\" Paul says. \"You feel this obligation.\" Some of the trademarks of \"Mormon Wives\" on Hulu include Botox (season one showed the moms getting laughing gas at their injectable appointments), boob jobs (Paul and a few of her costars have them), spray tans, and, of course, hair extensions to keep their renowned Utah curls looking perfect. But Paul, who began injectables two years ago at age 28, doesn't see herself as a beauty or fashion influencer. \"I'm pretty much the Adam Sandler of the group,\" she says. \"If I could show up in sweats every day, every scene, I would.\" If you've already binged season two, you may have noticed a more relaxed, comfier vibe from Paul all around (save for the Halloween party when she showed up as cat-suit Gretchen Wieners and gave her exes a piece of her mind), but one thing you won't see her with is boring hair. Her secret to her perfect waves? \"Just dirty hair,\" she says. \"I go probably four to five days without washing it.\" Ahead, Paul reveals her beauty essentials for filming, what shocked her most about sharing her story with the world, and the manifestations she has on deck for 2025. Taylor Frankie Paul's Beauty Favorites Paul starts out each shoot day with the MCoBeauty Makeup Grip Primer ($12), and if you think the packaging looks familiar, you're not wrong. \"They do dupes, or dupés is what they call it,\" says Paul of MCo and her partnership with the brand. \"I love that they're affordable and it's the same thing, if not better.\" For extra-long filming days that bleed into the night, she also reaches for the MCoBeauty Miracle Flawless Setting Spray ($12). If Paul is low on time and can only reach for one makeup product before heading out the door, she prioritizes her face base over anything else. She doesn't need to waste time with mascara because she has her lashes done. \"I actually do all my own makeup for all filming, and then I'll get touchups for interview days,\" she says. \"I use the Makeup by Mario Hydrating Foundation [$44] every day.\" When it comes to SPF, Paul actually layers it on top of her foundation, a trick she's picked up to combat the dry air of Utah. She's a fan of Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen ($15). \"I put it on after makeup, and everything's done and it makes you glow,\" she says. The Most Surprising Thing About Fan Reactions Sure, \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" has the drama, the beauty treatments, and endless dirty soda bars, but what the show really offers viewers is a deep dive into a pocket of culture they likely haven't experienced before. \"I did not think [the show] would do as well as it did,\" says Paul. \"When it popped off, it was all over, especially on social media where we do our job. So to me, I was like, 'What in the heck is going on that people are liking this?' I didn't think the soda would be a big deal with anyone. I feel like everyone outside of Utah drinks coffee or tea or alcohol. People are getting curious [with dirty sodas] and I know they're opening up more places now, which I didn't think would ever survive in another state besides Utah.\" In season two, we saw a more understanding version of Paul, especially when it came to letting former MomTok rival Whitney Leavitt back into the group. Even Paul was surprised by this version of herself. \"I'm more forgiving than I thought I was,\" she says. \"I definitely thought I held grudges, which obviously I think I have in the past, but over time, I'm very forgiving and I can let things go. And I think the more I grow and do therapy work, the more I've been able to tolerate and let things go quicker.\" What's to Come - Treatments and Otherwise As Paul says, Mormons aim for perfection, and this is certainly seen in the cast of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\" who visit med spas together and document their plastic surgeries online. \"I want to eventually get a nose job,\" Paul says. \"It's just a time thing. I also get fearful, to be honest, of changing my face. It can be scary.\" After all of the success that Paul has found over the last few years, you might expect her to say she's ready to go into acting, modeling, or something else to push her even further into the limelight, but she has a different idea for her future. \"I have just been manifesting some peace,\" she says. \"My life has been in adrenaline rush for three years nonstop.\" What's not on her vision board is rekindling her relationship with her \"baby daddy,\" as she calls him, Dakota. \"I don't really want a relationship,\" she says. \"I'm usually very codependent and I want to just be on my own for a little bit and grow and enjoy my own company. I'm manifesting to learn how to do that.\" Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.
