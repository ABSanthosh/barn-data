  "description": "With an impressive IMDB page touting numerous blockbuster movies, Ryan Reynolds is one of Hollywood's most celebrated actors and producers. Despite his public persona (and incredible social media trolling), some aspects of the \"Deadpool\" star's life are lesser known, including his considerably sizable yet obscure ink collection. The Canadian native has at least eight tattoo pieces to his name, most of which are located on his legs, in addition to the two wrist designs. Given their concealed location, it's unsurprising that many people aren't aware of Reynolds's tattoos. After committing to ink at a young age, the actor has experienced a love-hate relationship with his tattoos: \"I hate them all,\" he quipped about his body artwork in 2015. Naturally, he has considered tattoo removal, especially since many of his onscreen jobs require him to spend hours in the makeup chair to conceal his ink. However, the potential pain of undergoing the laser removal procedure has made him hesitant to proceed. \"I'd get them all lasered off if it wasn't hours and hours of brutal pain,\" he told The New Yorker. In the same interview, Reynolds humorously mentioned that his wife, Blake Lively, insists that he \"should keep them; keep a record of the choices [he's] made.\" Fans of the actor might have noticed a glimpse of his tattoos in his 2015 drama-comedy, \"Mississippi Grind.\" His leg tattoos - including a Six of Hearts card - are on full display during one of his scenes. If you're curious to see and learn more, we've outlined most of Reynolds's tattoos, along with their meanings, ahead.",
