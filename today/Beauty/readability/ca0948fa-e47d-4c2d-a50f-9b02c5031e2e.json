There’s something about the deep berry shade that makes my lips look full and juicy. One swipe lends a just-bitten effect with a hint of gloss — never heavy or sticky — and you can easily build it up for more intensity. Even better, it doubles as a nourishing lip balm, packed with ingredients that actually do something. First up: peptides, which help strengthen and repair damaged lips. Then there’s shea butter, the ultra-moisturizing staple found in all the best balms. It keeps my lips hydrated (and they get seriously dry) without the color pooling in my lip lines. I carry it everywhere with me.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorRhode Peptide Lip Tint, $, available at RhodePhoto: Courtesy of Jacqueline Kilikita.e.l.f. Cosmetics Glow Reviver Melting Lip Balm (in Toffee), $9“Whoever named this product deserves a raise, because it truly lives up to what you would expect from something called ‘glow reviving’ and ‘melting’. It’s decadent and glossy, but not sticky in the slightest. I think it’s an extremely good dupe for the Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm (which I love, for the record), but at a fraction of the price. I tried the shade Toffee, which tasted like a caramel dessert and had a sheer, warm brown tint. Like all e.l.f. products, the accessible price point is truly impressive, and I’d happily recommend it to anyone looking to try the glossy lip balm trend.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writere.l.f. Cosmetics Glow Reviver Melting Lip Balm, $, available at e.l.f. CosmeticsPhoto: Courtesy of Karina Hoshikawa.Laneige Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum (in Blueberry Jelly), $22“Already a huge fan of Laneige’s lip products, I knew there was a good chance I’d like this tinted lip serum. The formula is super hydrating and non-greasy, with the perfect amount of color payoff. I love a berry-toned lip, so the shade Blueberry Jelly was right up my street. After seeing how good it looked on influencer Golloria, I had a feeling it would complement my deep skin tone, and I was right.“I find a lot of food-inspired beauty products too sweet and off-putting, but this one is pleasantly subtle; the unique doughnut-shaped applicator makes application even easier. The shine does fade after eating and drinking, but you’re still left with a soft wash of color that doesn’t disappear completely. On days when I left it untouched, it lasted a couple of hours.” — Vanese Maddix, beauty contributing writerLaneige Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum, $, available at SephoraPhoto: Courtesy of Vanese Maddix.Sofia Coppola x Augustinus Bader The Tinted Lip Balm (in Shade 1), $46“My lips are hypersensitive to seasonal changes and always get extra parched and flaky between spring and summer. This is the product I turn to whenever I’m in this rough patch. Created in collaboration with Sofia Coppola, this tinted lip balm is packed with TCF8, Augustinus Bader’s patented ingredient that promotes skin cell renewal.“I can feel the nourishment penetrating my skin barrier as soon as I apply it, and my lips get gradually softer throughout the day. My favorite is Shade 1 Raspberry, a lovely reddish pink that looks good even when I go bare-faced. At $46, the hefty price tag does give me pause. But this one is, bar none, the most conditioning lip balm you can find, especially if you struggle with dry, irritated lips.” — Venus Wong, senior writerAugustinus Bader x Sofia Coppola The Tinted Lip Balm, $, available at NordstromPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Violette Bisou Balm (in Bonbon Myrtille), $29“I’m a sucker for easy, effortlessly chic French girl beauty, and love the idea of a lip balm designed to have a subtle blurring effect for a ‘just-been-kissed’ look (bisou means ‘kisses’ in French). You can swipe the Bisou Balm for a subtle look, or build it up (as I have here) to make that color payoff known. I’m not typically a lipstick person, and I’m always tapping it on or blotting it off to achieve this blurred, stained effect, so this is perfect. Plus, the color is long-lasting.“As someone with dry lips, the matte, creamy formula feels uncomfortable, and so I layer it with another moisturizing product, which kind of defeats the purpose of this balm. However, dry-lipped girlies like me might have better luck with Bisou Jelly, which features the same pigmented, creamy, matte color wrapped in a jelly layer packed with emollients (vitamin E, castor seed oil) for extra hydration.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writerViolette_Fr Bisou Balm, $, available at SephoraPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm (in Iced Coffee), $24“The other day on my commute, I saw two women bonding over using the same lip balm — Summer Fridays Butter Balm. This is usually unheard of, as no one ever strikes up a conversation on the London Underground, but this balm is clearly worth breaking the silence for. I realized it myself as soon as I got my hands on it. It’s probably the most intensely moisturizing tinted balm I’ve tried, packed with shea butter, oils, and waxes. The flavors? Unreal. Here, I’m wearing Hot Cocoa, which is a limited edition shade that I hope will become permanent — it’s so moreish and I have to stop myself from eating it off! While the tint is subtle, you’ll get more color payoff from shades like Cherry or Brown Sugar. If you’re sold on Hot Cocoa but you’re struggling to get your hands on it, Iced Coffee is incredibly similar. I love wearing these balms over lip liner for a bit of extra polish.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorSummer Fridays Lip Butter Balm, $, available at SephoraPhoto: Courtesy of Jacqueline Kilikita.REFY Lip Blush (in Cinnamon), $24“This isn’t like any lip balm I’ve ever tried Refy’s Lip Blush has the lightest, softest texture and is still hydrating despite its blurred-matte finish (hydrating and matte is hard to get right!). The effect is so pretty, and the shade Cinnamon is a peachy terracotta that really wakes up my complexion. It glides on so smoothly, just like a buttery crayon. I even dotted it onto my cheeks and blended it out for a diffused flush of color — and loved the result. It’s very pigmented, so a little goes a long way. I’m really impressed with the unique formula.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerREFY Lip Blush, $, available at SephoraPhoto: Courtesy of Karina Hoshikawa.Fenty Gloss Bomb Stix High-Shimmer Gloss Stick (in Icy Amethyst), $25“Oh, how I’ve missed fun and innovative lip products. My younger self would be ecstatic to see high-quality shimmery sticks making a comeback, and the Fenty Gloss Bomb Stix, with its new shade expansion, is a highly anticipated one. The formula is the ideal mix of glossy, hydrating, and lightweight, with a standout dose of shimmer that really catches the light. I tried Icy Amethyst, a unique, shimmering lavender. I’d describe it as more of a fun, Y2K-inspired shade for a fun night out, rather than an everyday go-to. For everyday, Fu$$y or Hot Chocolit would be more my style. Still, the wear time and comfort are seriously impressive. It feels like a gloss and wears like a balm. Dare I say this might be one of my favorite lip launches of 2025?” — Vanese Maddix, beauty contributing writerFenty Gloss Bomb Stix High-Shimmer Gloss Stick, $, available at UltaPhoto: Courtesy of Vanese Maddix.Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Shine (in Raspberry Kiss), $48“I love a good fuchsia lip — it really makes a summer outfit pop — but I always find it a touch too intense in a liquid lipstick. This new shade of Coco Baume Shine is the perfect lip color to experiment with. Raspberry Kiss adds a cool-toned pink sheen to my lips; the pigment is very buildable, so I can always amp up the color without feeling intimidated at first swipe. Featuring shea butter and nourishing oil from olives. The formula is both conditioning and shine-enhancing without feeling greasy or sticky. I like going in with two coats to achieve that ‘your lips, but better’ effect with a hint of ‘80s-inspired nostalgia (but never too much).” — Venus Wong, senior writerChanel Rouge Coco Baume Shine, $, available at ChanelPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.MAC Cosmetics Glow Play Tendertalk Lip Balm (in Banter), $26 $19.50“This formula is ultra hydrating, leaving my lips feeling and looking soft and glossy for hours after application, like a true balm. The pigment does lean on the sheer side, but it’s designed to be layered, meaning you can opt for a simple wash of pigment, or build it up like I have done here with the shade Banter, a bright, reddish pink. As someone who usually hates the feeling of lipstick, this is the perfect alternative, especially on days I want to rock a red lip.“These balms are great for layering on top of other lip products. I’ve found that my dream lip combo is another Glow Play shade (Introvert, a light, nudish pink) paired with my favorite MAC lip pencil (Cool Spice, a warm mauve brown). It creates the perfect nude, pinky-brown, ‘my lips but better’ look for everyday.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writerMAC Cosmetics Glow Play Tendertalk Lip Balm, $, available at MAC CosmeticsPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Dior Addict Lip Glow Balm (in Candy), $40“Candy is Dior’s newest take on the classic Lip Glow, and it’s better suited to those with warmer undertones. The original — designed to react with your skin’s pH and create a ‘custom’ color — leans a bit too pink for my light olive skin, but this one’s just right. I especially love the bursts of shimmer that catch the light as you apply, boosting the gloss effect. It’s not just a pretty face, either. The formula means serious business for dry lips, with nourishing cherry oil and shea butter. I feel like the chicest version of myself when I swipe it on the go.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorDior Addict Lip Glow Balm, $, available at UltaPhoto: Courtesy of Jacqueline Kilikita.Burt's Bees Tinted Lip Balm (in Red Dahlia), $9.99“Burt’s Bees’ tinted balm, specifically in the shade Red Dahlia, has been compared to Clinique’s iconic Almost Lipstick in Black Honey, and I can see why; both have a muted, moody cherry color, which imparts a sort of bitten look on lips like you’ve just housed a bowl of fresh berries. However, I was left wanting more from the Burt’s Bees in terms of pigment; the shade is truly gorgeous, but I find myself laying it on to see it appear. That said, in terms of a lip balm, the formula is a tried and true winner in my book, and can’t be beat in terms of price.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerBurt's Bees Tinted Lip Balm, $, available at AmazonPhoto: Courtesy of Karina Hoshikawa.Kosas Wet Stick Moisture Lip Shine (in Sunset Simmer), $24“Kosas knows how to make a good lip product, so I had high hopes for the Wet Stick. The formula didn’t disappoint: it’s incredibly hydrating and moisturizing, thanks to a slew of conditioning ingredients like squalane, ceramides, and peptides. It feels comfortable on the lips, without any grittiness or dryness; just a smooth, nourishing finish. That said, I found shade Sunset Simmer quite different from the warm, rosy brown described on the site. On me, it leaned much more pink, which unfortunately didn’t complement my skin tone. That said, the formula alone makes this product worth exploring. With a wide range of shades available, I’m sure I’ll find one that suits me.” — Vanese Maddix, beauty contributing writerKosas Wet Stick Moisturizing Lip Shine, $, available at SephoraPhoto: Courtesy of Vanese Maddix.rom\u0026nd Glasting Melting Balm (in Hippie Berry), $19 $12“It’d be remiss of me to write a whole roundup on tinted lip balms without including a K-beauty option, as they are often unparalleled in offering innovative formulas at an approachable price point. I picked up this rom\u0026nd option during my trip to Seoul last year; the brand is a household name in South Korea and coined the word ‘glasting’, in reference to the watery, long-lasting shine its tinted lip balms impart on the lips.“This claim is definitely valid. My lips look incredibly juicy and alluring whenever I wear this, with a light-reflecting shine that can be spotted from a distance. It wins me boatloads of compliments — even on Zoom calls. However, I don’t reach for it as often as I’d like for one reason: I find the formula too sticky and drying. I have to heavily prep my lips beforehand, which kind of defeats the core purpose of a lip balm. However, I’m willing to be patient with this one, purely due to the sheer amount of praise it wins me.” — Venus Wong, senior writerrom\u0026nd Glasting Melting Balm, $, available at AmazonPhoto: Courtesy of Venus Wong.Naturium Phyto Glow Lip Balm (in Latte), $9.99“Latte offers a barely-there tint that’s pretty close to my natural lip color, but on no-makeup days, it’s my go-to. The texture is a bit stickier than others I’ve tried, but that just means it lasts longer. It’s packed with moisturizing shea butter and squalane, which helps lock in hydration — exactly what my often-parched lips need. I also love the curved applicator, which makes light work of applying a generous amount of product without the need for a mirror.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorNaturium Phyto Glow Lip Balm, $, available at UltaPhoto: Courtesy of Jacqueline Kilikita.Lanolips Tinted Balm SPF 30 (in Rhubarb), $13.50“This lip balm is the most moisturizing of the three balms I’ve tried, and it has seen my dry lips through the depths of winter. The formula contains vitamin E, shea butter, and lanolin, an oil derived from sheep's wool post-shearing (so it causes no harm to the animal), and it mimics skin oils to restore moisture; plus, the SPF 30 protection is great for summer. “Thanks to this hydrating power trio, my lips feel plumped, juicy, and glossy for hours. I’ll put this on when I sit down at my desk early in the morning, and still feel the benefit at lunchtime. After a while, this thick formula can become gloopy and get stuck in the tube, so you might have to apply it with your fingers instead of directly. I used the shade rhubarb, a warm, dusky pink, and the perfect everyday shade, with a strong color payoff. However, I will warn anyone that hates scented products that this does have a sweet, cookie-like fragrance.” — Esther Newman, affiliate writerLanolips Tinted Balm SPF 30, $, available at UltaPhoto: Courtesy of Esther Newman.Like what you see?

That said, I found shade Sunset Simmer quite different from the warm, rosy brown described on the site. On me, it leaned much more pink, which unfortunately didn’t complement my skin tone.
