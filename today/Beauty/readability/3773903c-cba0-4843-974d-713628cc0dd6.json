  "description": "Another Coachella season is officially underway, and from it, we've had no shortage of fresh and inspiring beauty looks to take in. For starters, we saw Blackpink's Lisa's dramatic hair transformation to \"mushroom\" blond ahead of her first Coachella solo performance. The queen of the \"clean-girl aesthetic,\" Hailey Bieber, also had some fun with her nail art as she rocked hot pink \"lava nails\" that matched her outfit. But aside from those looks, we saw another trend emerge amongst the celebrities in attendance this year: every shade of red hair under the sun. The desert sun might have reached triple-digit temperatures over the weekend, but it still didn't compare to these hot, fiery looks. Megan Thee Stallion, Emma Roberts, Bea Miller, and Heeseung all jumped on the trend with their own unique twist. \"Copper cowgirl,\" \"cherry-cola,\" and \"calico\" are just a few of the variations we spotted. If you're considering going red for the first time, it's best to seek some help from a salon professional to ensure your big change leaves you feeling your best. In the meantime, let these celebrity red hair looks at Coachella inspire you. We recommend saving them as inspiration the next time you're itching for something new.",

The red and orange color feels very on-brand for Coachella.Getty/Frazer HarrisonHeeseung of ENHYPEN's Red Hair ColorK-pop star Heeseung of the boy band ENHYPEN showed off his firetruck-red hair color on day two of Coachella.
