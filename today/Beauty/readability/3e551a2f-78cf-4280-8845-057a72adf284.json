  "description": "Being a self-proclaimed skin-care connoisseur, I've tried my fair share of eye masks. From topicals to TikTok's favorite Grace \u0026 Stella patches, I can confidently say I know a thing or two about them. Being that beauty's entered this era of undereye patches, there's a new girl on the block who's gunning to be our favorite yet - The Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches ($24). The newest addition to the cult-favorite brand's hero line launched recently, and it's already approved by beauty lovers all over, so naturally I had to see what the hype was about.Since I've tried so many eye masks on the market, I've experienced everything from purchases that are absolutely worth it to results that brought utter disappointment (one even darkened my undereye area as opposed to brightening it). But after trying this one from Summer Fridays, I can assure you that it's one of those products that doesn't disappoint. Although I used it only once, within just 10 minutes, my eyes were super hydrated and brightened. Keep reading for my full review and find out why these masks are pushing me to retire my go-to concealer and mascara routine for a while. About the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches They're made with ingredients like caffeine, cucumber extract, peptides, and a humectant blend of glycerin and hyaluronic acid to refresh, soothe, and de-puff the appearance of tired eyes. They're vegan, cruelty-free, and non-comedogenic. Each box comes with six pairs of patches. You typically see results within 10 to 15 minutes. You can subscribe to receive them monthly, bi-monthly, or tri-monthly, and save 15 percent each time. What I Like About the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches What I love most about Summer Fridays's patches is that they don't slip off my face. I've experienced slipping within five minutes of applying other masks, but this product is made with nonslip hydrogel, allowing me to see real results because they actually stay on the whole time. When I first put them on, I felt a hydrating sensation that instantly absorbed into my skin, which was especially impressive being that my undereye area tends to get dry from time to time. And while wearing them didn't totally eliminate my dark circles, my eyes looked noticeably brighter and refreshed - even though I didn't get eight hours of sleep. I can tell that if I incorporated these into my daily regimen, I'd see even more of a significant difference with my undereyes. Plus, the patches are super chic and make you feel like you're getting the experience of a luxurious facial right at home. How to Use the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches After washing your face, apply the Jet Lag patches and leave them on for 10 minutes (your undereyes must be dry first). When time is up, you can discard them and pat the remaining serum into the skin before completing your routine with your go-to moisturizer and sunscreen. In case your skin needs maximum hydration, follow up with the Jet Lag Soothing Hydration Mist ($21) and Deep Hydration Serum ($44) after using the masks. What to Consider Before Trying the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches While these patches are a great addition to your routine, there are only six of them in each pack, so you might want to take the subscribe and save route. Also, if you have sensitive skin, it's best to do a patch test first. They contain harsh ingredients like caffeine that can cause skin irritation so it's best to be on the safe side. Where Are the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Eye Patches Available? The Jet Lag patches are available on the brand's website, at Sephora, and Revolve.
