  "description": "Every year, it's natural to look for new ways to add some excitement to your life. Instead of jumping out of a plane or traveling to the farthest country you can think of, what easier (and more low-stakes) way to inject some fun into your life than dusting off your \"haircut ideas\" board on Pinterest? Keeping up-to-date on the latest haircut styles allows you to keep tabs on what's new in the space, and over the next few months, it'll be all about having fun with your look. As Jae-Manuel Cardenas, a hairstylist at Sally Hershberger NoMad in New York City, put it: \"This year is all about texture and movement. I love to give hair a refresh by adding fresh, choppy layers. Hair [will] look sexy and undone.\" That's not all. There will be cool shorter cuts and haircut ideas for medium length (plus those in between lengths), but each one follows three common denominators: they are fresh, fun, and anything but boring - and isn't that what everybody wants when they go in for a makeover? From the bold \"jellyfish\" cut to the more subtly layered shag, there are enough hair ideas to fill an entire inspiration board. Don't just take our word for it. We've asked a handful of experts to break down the hottest looks you should know about, including haircuts for curly hair and all other hair types. Get loads of inspiration photos on how to wear them and learn insider techniques to level up your look - that you'll want to bring to your next salon appointment, so you can kick off the new season right.
