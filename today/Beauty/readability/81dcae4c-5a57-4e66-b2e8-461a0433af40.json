  "text": "Fresh off of celebrating her 30th birthday, Gigi Hadid has landed at the 2025 Met Gala. Though the model has had a slew of iconic Met Gala beauty looks over the years (who could forget her red Jessica Rabbit-esque ’do in 2021?), this one might be her best yet. For this year’s theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” Hadid showed up in a custom Miu Miu gilded halter gown. But the real showstopper was her hair. “Gigi’s custom gold Miu Miu dress was so elegant and striking, and I wanted to complement it with something timeless,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist Dimitris Giannetos. “We landed on ‘boudoir curls’ or ‘victory rolls’ inspired by the 1940s that felt both glamorous and modern.”Giannetos created the big, structured curls that draped around Hadid’s shoulders using hair rollers to evoke old Hollywood glamour. From there, he sculpted sleek rosettes at her crown. “To create the ‘boudoir curls,’ I took sections from the front, rolled them neatly, and secured them with pins for a structured and soft vintage feel. I finished the look with plenty of hairspray for a strong hold, definition, and to tame frizz all night since rainy NYC weather came out to play.” To complete the look, Hadid sported a dusty-rose lip, brushed-up soap brows, and a slight cat eye. The overall effect was regal, and perfectly tailored for Hadid. Michael Buckner//Getty ImagesThis is Hadid’s 10th Met Gala. She made her initial debut in 2015 alongside her sister Bella. For Gigi’s 30th birthday last week, Bella shared a sweet tribute where she called Gigi her “built in best friend.” The two then celebrated at a birthday party alongside Gigi’s boyfriend, Bradley Cooper.A source told People that Gigi and Cooper “were very cute” at her birthday soirée. “They mingled and had fun, but also kissed every time they got near each other. It was clear that she had a beautiful celebration. And it was even clearer that she’s incredibly happy with where her life is right now, especially with Bradley by her side.”",
