  "description": "In the lead-up to my wedding, there are several beauty treatments I've either already outsourced or plan to indulge in before the big day. From acrylic nails to a natural-looking spray tan and even laser hair removal, there's no doubt I'm holding back. However, there was one treatment I couldn't bring myself to undergo professionally: teeth whitening. The intense post-treatment discomfort during my first attempt years ago left me determined to explore other options. So, here I am now, typing this with my top and bottom teeth sandwiched in Crest 3D Whitestrips ($30, originally $46) opting for an at-home solution that suits me better. While experiences vary, this is officially my chosen method to achieve a brighter smile, and I plan on stocking up since they're currently on sale for Amazon's October Prime Day, which ends Oct. 9. Ahead, I break down more details about them. Keep reading for my full review and to see my before-and-after photos. About Crest 3D Whitestrips Crest Whitestrips have been around since 2001. It comes with a total of 44 strips (22 upper and 22 lower): 20 Professional Effects Treatments and two One-Hour Express Treatments. The American Dental Association (ADA) Crest 3D Whitestrips recognizes Crest Whitestrips as a safe and effective method for teeth whitening. For best results, the brand recommends using them once a day for 30 minutes. What I Like About Crest 3D Whitestrips What truly impresses me about Crest 3D Whitestrips is how effective they are. Even though it had been well over a decade since I last used them, I couldn't resist trying them again and added them to my virtual Amazon shopping cart. The box boldly claimed they could \"remove over 15 years of stains in three days,\" which initially made me a bit skeptical. However, the results speak for themselves. Crest 3D Whitestrips Before and After After just four treatments, the difference is already remarkable. The \"before\" image on the left and the \"after\" image on the right clearly shows the noticeable change. And I've barely made a dent in the box with plenty of treatments left. How to Use Crest 3D Whitestrips Using Crest 3D Whitestrips is a straightforward process. Within a box containing 20 treatments, each strip is individually wrapped for convenience, which makes them travel-friendly. To use them, you simply peel open the packaging using the tear notch and then place the longer strip on the front of your upper teeth and the shorter strip on your lower teeth. As you do this, try to aim to align the straight edge of the strip with your gumline and then fold over the back side of your teeth to secure it in place. Leave the strips on for 30 minutes, and then remove them. I always brush my teeth afterward to get rid of the peroxide taste, but that's ultimately a personal preference. It's important to note that perfecting the application process may require some trial and error. I found that the grippy texture of the whitening strips worked really well on my top teeth but not as effectively on my bottom teeth. Toward the end of the 30 minutes, I noticed that the bottom strip tended to slide off, resulting in a gap in coverage. Similar experiences have been shared by other shoppers. One satisfied Amazon customer, who rated them five stars and considered them worth the money, mentioned that \"the bottom strips seemed to not stick properly but other than that they work FANTASTICALLY!!\" Another equally impressed shopper agreed, stating, \"I found the bottom is a bit harder to stay on, but other than that, they work well!\" What to Consider Before Trying Teeth Whitening Strips Before trying teeth whitening strips, it's important to be aware of the potential for irritation. I experienced soreness and had to take a Tylenol to alleviate the sensitivity, which persisted throughout the day. As a result, I decided to skip a day to avoid dealing with the discomfort again. However, when I resumed using them, I didn't experience any pain and have been using them nightly ever since. When deciding on a teeth whitening method, it's essential to consider if whitening strips are the best fit for you. As someone who values the convenience of whitening my teeth at home, saving money, and being able to multitask, the strips have become my preferred option over professional treatments. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are alternative options available, such as toothpastes and gels that can be directly applied to your teeth or via a tray that fits in your mouth. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), in-office teeth whitening treatments may have stronger effects, which aligns with my experience of feeling significant discomfort afterward. The ADA states: \"Bleaching compounds in over-the-counter whitening products are typically peroxide-based and contain carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide at lower concentrations compared to in-office or dentist-prescribed, at-home bleaching techniques.\" Nonetheless, I'm cool with sticking with my whitestrips, especially since the results are top-notch. And finally, Crest recommends a few maintenance tips to get the most out of your whitestrips. \"If you drink cola drinks, sip them through a straw to minimize the contact of the drink with your white teeth,\" the brand states on its website. Likewise, they advise you \"rinse your mouth as soon as possible to minimize the risk of stains if you drink coffee, tea, red wine, or cola, or eat foods that are likely to stain your white teeth.\" As an avid coffee drinker, I've been making a point to rinse with Crest Whitening Rinse Fresh Mint Mouthwash ($26) after getting my coffee fix.

I experienced soreness and had to take a Tylenol to alleviate the sensitivity, which persisted throughout the day. As a result, I decided to skip a day to avoid dealing with the discomfort again. However, when I resumed using them, I didn\u0026#39;t experience any pain and have been using them nightly ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eWhen deciding on a teeth whitening method, it\u0026#39;s essential to consider if whitening strips are the best fit for you. As someone who values the convenience of whitening my teeth at home, saving money, and being able to multitask, the strips have become my preferred option over professional treatments. However, it\u0026#39;s important to acknowledge that there are alternative options available, such as toothpastes and gels that can be directly applied to your teeth or via a tray that fits in your mouth. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/q0V_8NQkxn2YSteAdRbDAEXeUSQ=/fit-in/792x982/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/07/10/852/n/1922153/tmp_o6qWx6_f6d9db7090d96ad5_whitestrips.jpg\" width=\"792\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/q0V_8NQkxn2YSteAdRbDAEXeUSQ=/fit-in/792x982/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/07/10/852/n/1922153/tmp_o6qWx6_f6d9db7090d96ad5_whitestrips.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/TVGVPo2WboLy2gvjOwSKeQKOgcE=/fit-in/1584x1964/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/07/10/852/n/1922153/tmp_o6qWx6_f6d9db7090d96ad5_whitestrips.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Marisa Petrarca\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\"\u003eAccording to the American Dental Association (ADA), in-office teeth whitening treatments may have stronger effects, which aligns with my experience of feeling significant discomfort afterward.
