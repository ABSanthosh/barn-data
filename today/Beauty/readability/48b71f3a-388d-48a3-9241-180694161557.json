  "text": "A monogrammed Louis Vuitton cosmetic pouch has long been the height of luxury, but today, the brand announced that its foray into beauty will go beyond bags: La Beauté Louis Vuitton, a line of luxury makeup, is debuting this fall. In keeping with Louis Vuitton’s commitment to excellence, the house has tapped makeup artist Dame Pat McGrath (who runs her own eponymous brand and has touched Taylor Swift’s face) for creative director. She joins Jacques Cavallier-Belletrud, the master perfumer for the brand’s existing fragrance line. It’s a natural match, as McGrath has created looks for Louis Vuitton runway shows for years. Who can forget the red flames adorned with black roses that McGrath painted on models’ foreheads at Vuitton Cruise in 2019? “Working backstage for over 20 years at Louis Vuitton fashion shows, I am thrilled to now play such a key role in the launch of La Beauté Louis Vuitton, which is the result of extraordinary craftsmanship, creativity, and innovation,” McGrath said in a press release.Back in the 1920s, the brand designed powder compacts, mirrors, and brushes. Now, you won’t have to visit the archives to imagine what Vuitton might do with makeup. More information on the product offerings will be available soon, but in the meantime, we can only guess what’s in store. Sumptuous red lipsticks embossed with the iconic Vuitton monogram? Eye shadows as velvety as the brand’s leather?One thing is for sure—with McGrath at the helm, the brand will push boundaries in cosmetics. “The beauty universe is about so much more than just product, and what we are creating here will unlock a new level in luxury beauty,” McGrath said. Bring it on.",
