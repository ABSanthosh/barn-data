  "description": "I first heard about Aescape, an AI-powered, fully automated massage, via a TikTok ad. I was immediately intrigued. Can a robot really deliver an effective massage? Where does the AI come in? After the ad appeared on my FYP several more times, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided I had to try the experience for myself. Aescape is currently being offered at select spas, massage studios, and Equinox locations in New York City and Miami. You don't have to be a member of the gym to book. Simply head to the Aescape location finder, select your preferred location, click through to book your preferred date and time, and pay the $60 to $75 fee. I tried it out at a nearby Equinox. Going in, I was cautiously optimistic, figuring it could very well be more novelty than recovery tool. And while I don't think Aescape can replace a traditional massage experience, I came away from my session a believer in the benefits of the robot massage. Here, my honest review. What Is Aescape's AI Robot Massage Like? When I arrived at Equinox to check in, they had me sign some paperwork, then handed me a pair of gray Aescape leggings and a long-sleeve workout top, which you're meant to wear during the massage, and directed me upstairs to the spa, where I got my first look at my robotic masseuse. The Aescape machine looks like a regular, albeit oversized, massage table. But by the head are two large, white robotic arms. Under the headrest, which has a cutout for your face, is an interactive screen that lets you control the massage, choose your pressure preferences, indicate when you love a certain technique, or pausing the massage if you need a break. The AI massage started with a body scan, and then the massage began. I have to admit, when I saw the reflection of those large robot arms descending toward my back in the touchscreen, I felt a moment of trepidation. The feeling intensified during the first few strokes. I kept thinking about HAL 9000, the murderous robot in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" What was keeping the Aescape arms from pushing just a little too hard, pinning me to the table, and refusing to let me up? I pushed those thoughts from my mind and tried to focus on the massage. The screen showed a timeline of the 30-minute session, including how much time it would spend on each area of your back, which I loved. As Aescape began to really dig into the knots and pressure points of my upper back, I relaxed for real. This was actually a really good massage. The Aescape arms were heated (to 95 degrees, according to the Aescape site), which helped me get over the images of cold, unfeeling robots that had flitted through my head. It was also able to replicate some aspects of a human massage, especially by altering its touch sensors (Aerpoints), using both flatter and pointed edges to deliver the feel of different hand, finger, or arm positions. At one point, I could have sworn it was an elbow leaning into my shoulder blade. The massage was very thorough, going over my upper, mid, and lower back as well as my glutes and hips. The strokes were deliberate and always felt completely on target - I never got the sense that the body scan had missed the mark and the robot was operating an inch away from its intended points. Per Aescape, the scan \"captures 1.2 million data points, precisely mapping your body's muscle structure to create a unique blueprint for a highly personalized massage experience.\" At one point, I moved my arm to my lower back. I wanted to check to make sure my shirt was still tucked in, and the massage immediately stopped, and the robot arms lifted clear off my body. A message on the screen let me know that the massage would only resume once I was back in safe positioning. Although I'd already forgotten my visions of HAL 9000, that made me feel extremely safe. When my 30 minutes were up, I felt loose and relaxed, the same way I feel after a great nail salon massage or foam rolling session. If I worked out in that Equinox regularly, I'd be hitting up Aescape after my tough workout days without fail. I bet the massage would feel amazing after a lifting or cardio session. What's Worth Noting About the Aescape AI Robot Massage The person who checked me in suggested sizing down in the Aescape workout set so it wouldn't lift up during the massage. I did, but the fabric still caught and pulled a bit during the massage, which was not uncomfortable but was distracting. I might have tried another size down, just to see if that reduced the friction. Aescape also doesn't yet offer a totally full body experience. My massage included the upper back, mid back, lower back, and glutes and hips. After experiencing how great the back massage was, I was dying for a really thorough neck massage, but the robot arms didn't venture into that territory or go south of the butt (although there are options that include the hamstrings). Would I Recommend the Aescape AI Robot Massage? I really would recommend a robot massage, especially as a quick and convenient recovery session after a workout. Do I think the robot massage will replace human massage, though? Not yet - although if they're ever able to deliver a truly full-body massage, they could definitely get close.

I might have tried another size down, just to see if that reduced the friction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eAescape also doesn\u0026#39;t yet offer a totally full body experience. My massage included the upper back, mid back, lower back, and glutes and hips. After experiencing how great the back massage was, I was dying for a really thorough neck massage, but the robot arms didn\u0026#39;t venture into that territory or go south of the butt (although there are options that include the hamstrings). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWould I Recommend the Aescape AI Robot Massage?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eI really would recommend a robot massage, especially as a quick and convenient recovery session after a workout.
