Though the artist broke several records— including having the fifth most-viral song (\"Good Luck, Babe\") in the world on Spotify and \"The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\" being in the top five most-streamed albums in the U.S. — much of her claim to fame also has to do with her commitment to her glam. For what was bound to be a successful evening for the singer-songwriter (she walked away with the award for \"Best New Artist\"), Roan's hairstylist Dom Forletta knew her locks had to be just as show-stopping as her talent has been all year.\"The intention was to present Chappell in her ultimate form,\" Forletta tells Fashionista. \"This look will be one of those moments people will remember.\"Chappell Roan attends the 2025 Grammy Awards (left). Jean Paul Gaultier Spring 2003 Haute Couture (right).Photos: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images, Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesFor her red-carpet appearance at the 67th Grammy Awards, the \"Hot to Go!\" performer (with the help of stylist Genesis Webb) wore a full Jean Paul Gaultier look from the designer's Spring 2003 Haute Couture collection. As if the layered tulle gown featuring prints of Edgar Degas' ballerina paintings — paired with fingernail-adorned, mesh opera gloves and custom black-and-yellow buckled boots by John Fluevog— wasn't eye-catching enough, she also pulled the accompanying feathered tulle headpiece from the original runway.\"The outfit came [before the hair inspiration],\" Forletta explains. \"We wanted to ensure the hair had its own moment, but didn't overshadow the outfit.\"Rather than toss Roan's hair into an updo like the runway model's, Forletta aimed to exaggerate the long, auburn style now synonymous with Roan's persona, just slightly embellishing the look she's become known for — a decision Roan had a hand in as well.\"It was a very collaborative process,\" says the hairstylist. \"We took the idea of amplifying Chappell's signature hair and really built on that, making it more impactful and dramatic. It was all about making sure the hair matched the intensity of the overall look.\"Photo: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyBeneath the multicolored, protruding fascinator, Roan's copper-hued, voluminous loose curls fell down her back from a perfectly messy half-up style, with the length reaching just below the end of her corset.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesTo create an authentic-looking texture, Forletta began with Roan's natural, unwashed, air-dried hair. He misted it with Amika Perk Up Dry Shampoo to remove any excess oils before going in with the brand's Superfruit Star Hair Styling Oil. (The look was sponsored by Amika and Wavytalk.)After sectioning her hair, Forletta used a mix of curling irons (including the Wavytalk CurlMaker Pro and Vent Sesh Flat Iron) and a figure-eight hairpin method to make Roan's curl pattern appear as consistent as possible. \"I alternated the direction of each curl to create maximum movement,\" he notes. \"I then flat-ironed the hair to create a zig-zag curl. This helped add dimension to the hair, making it feel fresh and dynamic.\"Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyForletta then added pre-styled Bellami Silk Seam Clip-In Hair Extensions around Roan's head for volume and fullness, ensuring the look was just as dramatic and sizable as her Gaultier garb.\"We've been working together for so long now, I really know her hair and its potential,\" Forletta says. \"I've become more confident and experimental. What once felt intimidating has evolved into a creative playground. Now, I'm able to push boundaries and explore endless possibilities with her hair.\"For the finishing touch, the stylist layered on Amika Un.Done Volume and Matte Texture Spray to bring even more fullness to the final result.\"I love that she lets me go bold. She never holds me back and lets me really go for it,\" says Forletta. \"It's amazing to [then] see it through the world's eyes.\"Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
