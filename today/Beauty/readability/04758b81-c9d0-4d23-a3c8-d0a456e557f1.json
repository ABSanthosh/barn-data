As much as I love flashy packaging and a gorgeous fragrance, I've always been someone who considers the impact my choices will make on my family's sensitive skin first and over the years have made a few lifestyle changes to keep us feeling our best both on the inside and out. Today I'll be partnering with Ivory to share what changes have made the biggest difference in our family's sensitive skin journey. Let me just give a brief low-down of our skin sensitivities. I have battled acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation since I was 11 as well as eczema and a dust and smoke allergy. Ben has seasonal allergies and bouts of rosacea and heat rash. Aria actually has the most resilient skin of all of us, but she also runs warm like her dad and will get heat rashes that we've gotten phone calls from her preschool about. Ezra seems to have taken more from me and as an infant had large swaths of eczema patches on his arms and legs as well as having food allergies which would cause hives all over. He's since grown out of the eczema this year but I'm very diligent about keeping his environment as allergy-free as possible and making sure I'm continuing to be conscious of the product decisions I make so that his reactions don't reoccur. This brings me to my List of (Small-ish) Changes We Made that actually ended up making a big impact on our lives! Â 1. Switching our Laundry Detergent I know from experience that when you have contact dermatitis aka \"itchy because something touched me\" nearly the first thing I will hear suggested is to switch laundry detergents. Especially when you have a new baby, we frequently hear about switching to baby detergents but in my experience, I found the scents to be too strong for my nose. Don't get me wrong, I looooove that intoxicating actual new baby scent but I'll be honest and say I'm not the biggest fan of that faux baby powder detergent smell. The detergent we've been using lately has been Ivory Gentle Aloe Scent Laundry Detergent which I am very honored to partner with because it ticks all of the boxes for what I look for in a detergent. It's hypoallergenic and contains no dyes, phosphates, brighteners, chlorine, or enzymes and is specifically made with sensitive skin in mind. It's also very effective at cleaning the dirt and food stains that magically end up all over my two toddlers by the end of the day and is affordably priced. It's super accessible since you can pick it up at Walmart! Oh, and you can also use it to clean hand-washed items (such as Aria's stuffed animals that always seem to end up wearing Mommy's lipstick) by adding 2 TBSP in a gallon of water which makes one less product I need to stock. ðŸ™Œ 2. Washing Sheets \u0026 Pillowcases Frequently Not only is slipping into freshly washed sheets just the most ASMR, mind-numbingly great feeling, it's also much healthier for you especially if you tend to suffer from asthma. SUPER FUN FACT TIME! I learned from my allergist that having eczema is positively correlated with having allergies which means that if you can better manage even minor allergy symptoms from prevention, it can actually improve eczema occurrences too. We are constantly shedding skin cells everywhere but especially on our bedding which can lead to dust problems, so you want to make sure that you are keeping it clean. Even more so, I try to rotate out my pillowcases regularly so that the acne on my skin is less likely to flare up. If you get too busy or forget, you can always put 2 pillowcases on your pillow and just remove the top layer after a few days so you can get twice as long before you have to wash again. On top of just washing them in general, I also add additional layers to protect against dust mites by using a mattress protector, a pillow protector under my pillowcases, and a comforter protector. It's felt exactly the same sleeping with the layered bedding, but it's helped me sleep better overall. 3. Using an Air Filter Having a nice air filter was another change I made after seeing an allergist and I can definitely see a difference in my health and energy when we sleep for a couple days in a hotel room or while staying with family. I like to keep our air filter close to our bed so that our air has less allergens while we sleep. I will note that not all air filters are equally as effective and different filters will work with different room sizes so make sure to do some research and change out dirty filters regularly. 4. Taking Vitamin D Supplements Because this is an ingested item, taking Vitamin D supplements may come as a surprise for helping sensitive skin but especially if you tend to be like me and slather on the sunscreen and hide from the sun whenever possible, having a Vitamin D deficiency is actually quite common. I had a pretty major deficiency when I had my blood tested about a decade ago and had to go on a doctor-mandated regimen of daily Vitamin D doses and I was shocked at how major of a difference I felt. My skin improved but I was actually happier too. Allergies are the body overreacting to things it comes in contact with and not only does Vitamin D help to balance that immune response, it also can help alleviate winter blues and staying-inside-too-much blues which all have to do with Vitamin D which is synthesized from the sun's UVB rays on our skin. Less sun means less Vitamin D, so the supplements really help so much. If you want to know exactly how much to take, I would always ask your doctor first but generally adults should be getting 600 IU each day whether that is from foods, sunlight, or supplements. (source) After making these relatively easy changes our whole family has lived a little healthier and less reactive than before so I really hope that some of my fellow sensitive skin folks out there can try these tips out. If you also suffer from sensitive skin I would really love to hear any additional tips you've tried that have helped you so let me know what skin issues you suffer from and any of your favorite recommendations that have helped in the comments.
