  "text": "I've always been a beauty girl, whether it was an obsession with the perfect nail polish application or collecting a million lipglosses, but for some reason hair has been the one category where I am admittedly lax about. I'd just rather spend the extra five minutes perfecting my mascara than finding out how to use that dang round brush which magically always gets my hair knotted. Yes, I'm hanging my \"beauty guru\" head in shame right now but as a new mom, ain't nobody got time for that! I'm certain this is why I came up with these hair hacks. Time crunch = tactics to make my life easier. From faster drying, to more volume, to even de-wrinkling shirts and smelling better, I wanted to share some easy hair hacks that literally anyone (even a lazy-hair gal like me) can do.  Watch the video here: PRODUCTS MENTIONED: If you have any low-maintenance hair tricks, let me know in the comments and lets all commiserate on which parts of the beauty routine get the short end of the stick when we are short on time. ;)",
