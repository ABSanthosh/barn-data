  "text": "When it comes to skin care, I live by the phrase, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I have my skin care routine down to a science—at night, I double cleanse, follow up with retinol, and top everything off with eye cream and moisturizer. In the morning, I opt for vitamin C, moisturizer, and sunscreen. I don’t often mix in other types of products (as someone with dry skin, I’ve had disastrous results with drying toners or harsh chemical exfoliants). When I do, it’s because I’m confident that the product I’m testing is worth the trial. My latest product experiment? Clinique’s Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Clearing Serum.I’ve always had freckles, and they’re one of my favorite features. But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed that there’s a difference between the cute freckles I’ve always loved and dark spots from external factors, like accidental sun exposure (oops) or post-acne marks. My normal vitamin C serum wasn’t cutting it for some stubborn dark spots on my chin, so I turned to Clinique’s new one, which is powered by a heavy-hitting combination of vitamin C, niacinamide, and a proprietary brightening molecule called UP302, which is inspired by an antioxidant-laden Chinese botanical called border silver (or dianella ensifolia). Clinique Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Clearing SerumFor fans of the old formula (the Even Better Clinical Radical Dark Spot Corrector + Interrupter Serum, one of their most well-known products), they might notice that the texture is a bit different. According to Ida Wong, VP of global product development for Clinique, that was by design. “The texture is a little more fluid and thinner,” she says. “We stayed very close to the OG, but [this] helps with the delivery of the actives.” For Wong, personally, she says the lighter texture eases layering. The formula does layer beautifully. My pet peeve when it comes to skin care is any pilling, and this serum doesn’t pill at all. Its real power, however, lies in its brightening abilities. Vitamin C and niacinamide are already known for their brightening properties, but Clinique’s proprietary molecule, UP302, truly takes it to the next level. “[It] really goes after those dark spots, uneven skin tone, that dullness in a major way that yields visible results while being very gentle on skin,” says Wong. UP302 is a plant-derived ingredient, which helps to inhibit melanin production and acts as a brightening agent on dark spots. In internal testing, it even out-performed kojic acid, another common ingredient which is often used to reduce pigmentation. As I’ve been using it, my skin has been softer and has a more luminous glow. Its clinical results show dark spot reduction in 12 weeks, so it hasn’t had a chance to break up some of my trickiest dark spots, but it has helped to fade some stubborn post-acne marks on my chin, and feels soothing and softening. If you’re looking for a dark spot serum that’s gentle enough for daily use and easy to add into your skin care routine, this one fits the bill.",
