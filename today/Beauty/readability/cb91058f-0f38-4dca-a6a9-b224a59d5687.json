  "description": "It's easy to forget that your scalp is an extension of your skin - that is, until it's covered in dandruff, you can't stop itching it, and you're forced to wear a hat to cover up how angry it is (yep, that's me). As someone with an unruly scalp, I'm always looking for treatments to help give this often-neglected area some TLC. Enter the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum ($44), which I discovered at the perfect time to offset the scalp damage I've accrued during these brisk transitional months. Curious to learn how a famous bond-building product tackles the scalp? Read on for my full review. What Is the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum? The Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum is a weekly scalp treatment that offers both short- and long-term benefits. It helps hydrate and soften the hair with a blend of ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and rice bran oil. Long-term results include preventative protection against scalp aging, with a more balanced scalp microbiome after two weeks of consistent use. The formula includes a pro-balancing blend of black pepper seed, magnolia bark, patchouli extract, and manuka branch leaf oil. It can be used on all hair types and textures (including sensitive scalps prone to irritation). It's also laced with antioxidants to halt premature scalp aging and protect against free radical damage. What I Like About the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum As someone with dark hair and dandruff, I was excited to see that the pesky white flakes that once took up real estate on my scalp subsided after using this treatment consistently for two weeks. My problem area is usually the front part of my hair along my hairline - it's itchy, and this is where I'd normally see the most dandruff. Now, there are no visible flakes and my scalp feels some much-needed relief from the itchiness. Aside from nixing dandruff, using this scalp treatment is pretty straightforward. The formula boasts a gel texture (versus a more thin, serum-y texture), which I appreciate because it's less messy to apply. Surprisingly, despite its thicker consistency, I don't find that it weighs my hair down or contributes to build-up. It's ideal for layering with other styling products and enhances my hair overall. Packaging-wise, I've always loved the sleek minimalism of all of Olaplex's products - this tube fits into my bathroom lineup perfectly without sticking out like a sore thumb. The scent is clean and subtle rather than strong and overpowering, making it great for those with sensitive noses. How to Use the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum Applying this formula is a breeze thanks to the thoughtful applicator, which is long and pointed - the perfect size and shape to part the hair and apply directly onto the scalp. (The brand recommends targeting three to four sections on the crown and back of head.) To use, I squeeze the tube along my middle, left, and right part lines, gently massaging the product in with my fingertips (or a scalp brush if I'm feeling fancy). This formula can be used on wet hair prior to styling or on dry hair as an overnight treatment. I love that this doesn't interfere with styling or make my hair look or feel oily come morning, which makes me more inclined to use it as part of my general hair-care routine. While the scalp treatment is gentle enough for daily use, I found that I got results using it only three times a week. What to Consider Before Trying the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum One thing to note about this scalp treatment is its size: If you're using it consistently three times a week or even daily, you may run out of the 1.7-ounce bottle quickly. Where Is the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum Available? The Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum is available at the brand's website, Sephora, and Kohls.
