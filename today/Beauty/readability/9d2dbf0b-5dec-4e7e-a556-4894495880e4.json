  "description": "Dove Cameron has never been one to hide her tiny tattoos. With ink dating back to when she was just 14 years old - she admitted on an episode of the \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" that she got it illegally and without parental permission - she has expanded and grown her collection of tattoos ever since and is an open book when it comes to the most intimate meanings behind each. Cameron has more than 20 known tattoos to date, including one that reads \"ride swift\" etched on the side of her hip, a design of a gun with a rose on her wrist in honor of her friend Cameron Boyce, who died at age 20 from epilepsy, and an arm tattoo in honor of her father, who passed away when she was 15. While most of her tattoos are on areas in plain sight, she has three that are usually hidden from the public eye - most of which are matching with people like her mom and sister and even past boyfriends. One is the sketch of a sunshine between her fingers that she got with her then-boyfriend, now ex, Thomas Doherty. She also has the Capricorn symbol on one hip (this is the tattoo from when she was 14) and the Gemini symbol, which is her ex Ryan McCartan's sign, on her other hip. One tattoo of Cameron's is so emotionally charged that it brought actor Dax Shepard to tears. Ahead, see the rest of Cameron's tattoos and learn what each one means.",

With ink dating back to when she was just 14 years old ‚Äî she admitted on an episode of the \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" that she got it illegally and without parental permission ‚Äî she has expanded and grown her collection of tattoos ever since and is an open book when it comes to the most intimate meanings behind each. Cameron has more than 20 known tattoos to date, including one that reads \"ride swift\" etched on the side of her hip, a design of a gun with a rose on her wrist in honor of her friend Cameron Boyce, who died at age 20 from epilepsy, and an arm tattoo in honor of her father, who passed away when she was 15.

She also has the Capricorn symbol on one hip (this is the tattoo from when she was 14) and the Gemini symbol, which is her ex Ryan McCartan's sign, on her other hip. One tattoo of Cameron's is so emotionally charged that it brought actor Dax Shepard to tears. Ahead, see the rest of Cameron's tattoos and learn what each one means.GettyDove Cameron's \"We'll Be Friends Forever\" Hand TattooCameron has a hand tattoo that reads \"we'll be friends forever.\" In 2025, Cameron was a guest on Dax Shepard's podcast, \"Armchair Expert,\" where Shepard expressed through tears how much seeing Cameron's hand tattoo had affected him emotionally. \"You did make me cry today, though, because I was seeing the tattoo that you got,\" Shepard says in the episode. \"I have little girls, and I say that same thing to them all the time.\" Cameron could be seen wiping away tears while she responded, \"That's so beautiful.\" \"That's what it should be, I'm so moved to hear you say that about your girls, because I truly was best friends with my dad, and he really tried his best.\" Cameron's father passed away in 2011.Dove Cameron's \"Ride Swift\" Hip TattooOn Feb. 25, 2023, Cameron shared a carousel of images, including a photo of her and a friend getting tattoos together. It appears the singer's new hip tattoo reads \"ride swift\" in a cursive font. Getty | Slaven VlasicDove Cameron's Gothic Script Hand TattooIn 2022, Cameron got a thick gothic script tattoo on the side of her right hand. It's visible when she's holding a mic, but it's unclear exactly what it says or what it means. In a recent Instagram photo displaying the design, the caption read, \"courir, partir, venir, mourir,\" which roughly translates to \"run, go, come, die,\" so it's possible it could hold significance to that.Dove Cameron's Sword Wrist TattooIn January 2022, for her 26th birthday, Cameron got a new tattoo of a sword on her wrist. She got the design with one of her friends from a Los Angeles-based tattooist named Sweetpea, who specializes in fine-line black-ink tattoos. The singer shared a carousel of images on Instagram documenting her birthday celebrations, starting with a mirror selfie and ending with a homemade birthday cake and fresh body art. \"Gorgeous gorgeous boys let me tattoo them because it's my birthday and/or surprise me by getting my birth year as their first tattoo,\" Cameron's caption on the post read, disclosing that not only did one friend get a matching tattoo with her (second slide), but they also let her tattoo her birth year, 1996, on them.GettyDove Cameron's \"None of This Is Real\" Thumb TattooOn May 18, 2022, Cameron shared a new script tattoo etched along her right thumb that reads, \"None of this is real.\" The post came with a cryptic message to her fans: \"I wish I could post photos of my naked body every day ‚Äî not because it's sexy but because it's terribly vulnerable. I wish I could reach through the phone and hold your hand. I wish I could attach the smell of my perfume to this post so you could smell what I smell. I wish more than anything to know you all so intimately like I know myself. I wish you knew you were safe with me. I am so happy to be alive. i wish connective apps were actually made for connection. I wish we weren't so afraid of each other. I love you so much, and I am feeling so human. Full hearts and heartbreak feel the same.\"GettyDove Cameron's \"ALCHEMICAL\" Shoulder TattooIn January 2021, Cameron debuted fresh ink with the word \"ALCHEMICAL\" in all caps on her upper left shoulder. While she's yet to reveal its meaning, the word itself can represent the philosophy and process of creation.Getty | Swan GalletDove Cameron's Finger TattoosOn the middle finger of her right hand, Cameron has a snake that extends from her knuckle. She was inspired to get the tattoo because of how femininity is usually compared to the reptile in a negative way. With the ink, she decided to \"take back the snake,\" she told Refinery29. She has an assortment of other tattoos ‚Äî mostly stars, arrows, and other constellation designs ‚Äî on her pinky, pointer, and ring fingers.Dove Cameron's \"Celestial\" and \"Body\" Wrist TattoosIn September 2021, Cameron stopped by Bang Bang Tattoo in New York City on Sept. 16 to get tatted by one of the most beloved artists in Hollywood, Dragon. She ended up getting two fine-line tattoos on her upper wrists that read \"celestial\" on her left and \"body\" on her right. Dragon shared a few photos from their time together on Instagram and captioned the carousel of images, \"@dovecameron it was an honor to work for you. Hope to see you soon again. Thank youüëçüèª‚ò∫Ô∏è.\" He also shared some behind-the-scenes snapshots on Instagram Stories from the tattoo session, including the stencils for the wording and the placement process where you can see faint lines of blue ink on Cameron's wrists, proving just how meticulous the artist is.GettyDove Cameron's \"She\" Ring-Finger TattooIn August 2020, Cameron added a new tattoo on her left-hand ring finger above her knuckle that reads \"SHE\" in all capital letters. While the caption on the photo was vague, reading \"who is she,\" Cameron's fans have their own ideas about the hidden meaning behind the new tattoo. Many speculated the ink is a nod to Harry Styles and his song \"She\" off of his 2019 \"Fine Line\" album. \"A harry styles song,\" one fan's comment read. \"She lives in day dreams with me,\" another comment read, quoting a lyric from Styles's song. Others included \"Harry styles that's all I see\" and \"So you a harry styles stan now? k i stan.\" Cameron has neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.GettyDove Cameron's Hidden TattoosCameron has a handful of tiny hidden tattoos that we know about only because she's spoken of them. We'll break them down here. Dove Cameron's Bikini Line Tattoo\"The multihyphenate star's very first tattoo when she was 14 is a Capricorn symbol on her hip, which she hasn't revealed but has spoken about frequently. \"I got a Capricorn sign on my bikini line because I wanted something that will always be me, even when I'm 85,\" she told Refinery29. While she kept the ink away from her parents at first, when she told them the next day, they gave her their approval. \"It was like a gateway, don't start,\" she joked with Drew Barrymore during a recent episode. Dove Cameron's Rib Cage TattooIn October 2021, Cameron debuted a never-before-seen tattoo on her rib cage. While she has not revealed what the tattoo reads, or the meaning behind it, fans have speculated that this is the tattoo she decided on after chatting it through with her audience at a recent show.Getty | Michael StewartDove Cameron's Snake Foot TattooKeeping in line with the snake theme, Cameron debuted a larger version of the animal on her ankle. Dove's Instagram followers first got a look at the serpent-themed design on July 2, 2020, when she shared a few throwback snaps from the day a Los Angeles tattoo artist, who goes by @sweriet, gave her the tat. It's unclear exactly when she got it, but we do know it's one of the largest and most eye-catching in her growing collection.Dove Cameron's \"√Ä Na√Ætre\" Inner-Wrist TattoosOn her 23rd birthday, Cameron got the phrase \"√Ä Na√Ætre\" tattooed in all caps on the inside of her left wrist. It means \"to be born\" and goes with the \"Immortal\" ink on the inside of her right wrist.GettyDove Cameron's Gun and Rose Forearm TattooAfter Cameron's close friend Cameron Boyce passed away at age 20 from epilepsy in July 2019, she got a tattoo of a revolver shooting out a single rose in December 2019. The tattoo is a symbol of Cameron's own views on gun control, which she and Boyce had in common. \"It's sort of a nationally recognized symbol for peace and anti-gun movements,\" Cameron said of the tattoo in a YouTube video on her channel. She then went on to explain that, before Boyce's death, the late actor was working to create an organization called Wielding Peace, which is still underway and seeks to use powerful photographs to advocate for ending gun violence. One project involved photographing people from all walks of life holding peaceful objects in place of weapons. During his photo shoot, Boyce held a bouquet of flowers. \"It was really beautiful, and I've been trying to think of a tattoo to get for him since he passed, and I just felt that this one was really appropriate,\" Cameron said.Getty | Kevork DjansezianDove Cameron's \"Immortal\" Wrist TattooCameron has the word \"Immortal\" tattooed on the inside of her right wrist.

It's located on the inner elbow of her left arm.Getty | Jamie McCarthyDove Cameron's \"Do It For Aphrodite\" Forearm TattooCameron has \"do it for Aphrodite\" on the side of her arm. Aphrodite was an Olympian goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality. Cameron told Refinery29 she got it because \"to do something for the raw, sexual, female natural energy of the world ‚Äî and do it on behalf of that, instead of doing it from a diminished, demure P.O.V. ‚Äî is both powerful and what we need right now.\"Getty | Dominique CharriauDove Cameron's Abstract Forearm TattooSometime in 2022, Cameron got an abstract line tattoo on her inner forearm. The ink is located below her \"candy is dandy\" tattoo.GettyDove Cameron's \"Mati√®re D'√©toiles\" Ankle TattooCameron got the words \"Mati√®re D'√©toiles\" tattooed on her ankle with her mom and sister, which is the French translation for \"Star Stuff,\" a bedtime story her mom wrote for them.Dove Cameron's \"X\" Pinky TattooIn 2017, on Cameron's 21st birthday in Las Vegas, she got a matching tattoo with her best friend Kiersey Clemons as a symbol of their friendship.
