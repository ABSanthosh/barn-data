It was one of the first beauty items I really enjoyed collecting and spending my free time on. I recently stopped by an OPI event and will full on admit I felt a little fangirly meeting the company's co-founder Suzi Weiss-Fischmann for the first time. All those cute polish names? She and a precious small group came up with them. The colors? Yup, she's had a hand in each collection. She was sharing the lovely brights in the upcoming Fiji launch as well as the whole permanent Infinite Shine collection which is a newer, long-wear formula. I found it fascinating how she said yellow is such a trendy color paired with nude, especially with nail art trends. Of course, Infinite Shine has some well-known goodies like You Don't Know Jacques! and a personal favorite of mine, Alpine Snow, which is what I chose to get on my nails. I'm SO happy to report how amazing the Infinite Shine formula is! Not only are the colors true and super shiny, but my polish lasted for nearly 2 weeks without chipping and clearly wore better than regular non-gel polishes. I know lots of companies have been coming out with their own \"gel-like\" polish lines so I'm happy to see that it's pushed the chemistry of nail polish to a better standard across the board. Have you guys tried any of the newer polish formulas? What did you think? Let me know in the comments!",
