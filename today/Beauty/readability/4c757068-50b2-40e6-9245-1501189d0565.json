  "description": "If you're a Pisces, you've likely been told - in the kindest way possible, of course - that you need to get back to reality numerous times throughout your life. Still, for those who fall under the twelfth and last astrological sign in the zodiac, your ability to see beyond your current circumstances is your superpower. It's the reason you are one of the most creative signs there is. From dominating the music industry (hello there, Queen Latifah) to starring in some of our favorite movies (looking at you, Lupita Nyong'o), Pisces is one of the most multi-faceted signs of the zodiac. Born between February 19 and March 20, on one hand, Pisceans are typically described as highly emotional and very intuitive. On the other, this ability to daydream might cause some people to label them as escapists. Regardless, we like to see them as creative visionaries, which is why they'd likely be the zodiac sign most open to getting some new body art. Pisces tattoos can range from straightforward zodiac designs to more abstract interpretations of the sign's constellation. Notable celebrities have added their own special touches to their Pisces tattoo designs (see Rihanna's interpretation of the zodiac sign behind her ear), and if you like to buck against the norm, their collections can be a great starting point when ideating your own Pisces tattoo ideas. Whether you're a fan of more unconventional designs, like to incorporate spiritual elements, or just want something small and dainty, ahead, find some of the best examples that you can add to your collection, like Pisces constellation tattoos and Pisces symbol tattoos.",
