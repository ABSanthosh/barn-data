  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Valeriya Chupinina As someone with combination skin, the arrival of summer or traveling somewhere warm can mean that my makeup starts to wither away within the first few hours of wear. Yes, even if I'm wearing a waterproof eyeliner or a mattifying, longwear foundation, I'm giving melted. Thankfully, as an avid user of social media, I came across a viral setting spray that I just had to get my hands on and it's my new secret weapon for surviving the heat. Introducing the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray ($32). This product boasts an impressive 16 hours of mattifying wear and offers waterproof and transfer-proof properties for makeup. Its lightweight formula also ensures comfort without any sticky residue, while its ingredients work to absorb excess oil and minimize pore visibility, leaving your skin feeling fresh and smooth. Not to mention, it has Beyoncé's seal of approval, having used it on her Renaissance Tour. For my full review of the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray, keep scrolling. About the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray This product provides up to 16 hours of mattifying wear. It's waterproof and transfer-proof. The formula contains botanical ingredients that assist in absorbing oil and shrinking visible pores. It feels super lightweight and is non-sticky on the skin. What I Like About the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray As an oily girl, it is super difficult to find a setting spray that actually delivers what it promises but the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray works like a charm. It feels super lightweight on the skin but somehow delivers the long-lasting protection that I would expect from a heavy-duty product. I find that its smell is pleasant, and its application is seamless. This setting spray feels like more of a light mist when sprayed on. This product is waterproof, and although I didn't dunk my head into a pool during my trials, it was raining heavily on the first night that I tested it. With it, my makeup stayed on easily-even the powder that I finished it with. When I layered my blush products, starting with a cream and then a powder, the color stayed just as pigmented for the next six hours as it did when it was first applied. I also tested this product on a more lightweight look - using a skin tint, bronzer, blush, and light powder - and even with less product on, I saw that it had the same effect. For the most part, I find that the makeup products that go viral on TikTok deserve their flowers, and that rings true for the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray. How to Use the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray To use this setting spray, start with a clean and moisturized face. Make sure your makeup, especially foundation and concealer, is applied and blended smoothly. Shake the bottle well and hold it about an arm's length away from your face (this distance ensures that the mist is dispersed evenly across your skin). After the setting spray has dried, continue with finishing steps like lipstick and mascara. Using the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray on Full-Face Makeup My Makeup After It Rained Using the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray What to Consider Before Trying the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray Even though the fragrance is light, this setting spray has a scent. So, if you dislike the smell of green tea, this may not be for you. Also, if you prefer a dewy look, it's worth noting this setting spray delivers a matte finish. Where Is the One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray Available? The One/Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray is available at Sephora and at One/Size's website.
