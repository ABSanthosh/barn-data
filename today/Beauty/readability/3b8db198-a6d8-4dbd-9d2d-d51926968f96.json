  "description": "The best thing about this year’s biggest nail trends is that there really is a look for everyone. With pistachio green manicures, and jewelry nails for the maximalists, glossy soap nails, and elevated French manicures for those who prefer a quieter manicure, there’s no shortage of nail inspiration. Just when we thought there was no more space for another minimalist manicure to capture our attention, the “no-makeup makeup” nail trend has emerged as the freshest look for spring and summer. Pared-back and beautifully simple, it’s effectively the equivalent of a tinted moisturizer for your nails; it adds polish and glow while letting your natural nail shine through. But what sets it apart from the other subtle manicures dominating this spring?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cerise 🍒 (@glossytipped) What is the “no-makeup makeup” manicure? Also known as a “naked” or barely-there manicure, the “no-makeup makeup” manicure is all about enhancing your natural nails rather than covering them up. “Sheer, clean nails exude low-maintenance and effortless sophistication,” says manicurist and Bio Sculpture nail technician Julia Diogo. “This barely-there manicure really does deliver ‘your-nails-but-better’, and with the right shade and topcoat, not only is your natural nail plate enhanced, but so is your skin tone.” The key to the look is opting for sheer, neutral tones with a shiny finish. You’re aiming for a “clean”, healthy, well-groomed look that’s so versatile.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Georgia Rae (@raelondonnails) How do you create the no-makeup makeup manicure? The secret to the no-makeup makeup manicure is that while it looks simple, it relies on careful prep and precision: “Cuticle work and shaping are essential in my prep to create this manicure,” says Diogo. “We want to avoid over-trimming the cuticles, so lightly buff to enhance the nail plates’ natural shine and cleanse your hands and nails beforehand to ensure the polish adheres as evenly as possible.” @the_gelbottle_inc Create ‘No-Makeup Makeup’ nails with @Amber using Blanc, Daisy and Kiss BIAB™ 🎀💅 This trend is all about your nails, but better—perfect for fans of the clean girl aesthetic 🫧 #tgb #thegelbottle #thegelbottleinc #cleangirl #nomakeup #nomakeupmakeup ♬ Spring Is Coming – Morunas Diogo points out that you want this manicure to be applied thinly; no bulky textures, just a couple of fine coats of polish for that natural look. As for colors? Sheer creams, translucent pinks, and soft nudes are what you want to look for, rather than anything too milky or opaque. “I’d also finish the nail into soft, short square or almond with a shiner tool and use a glossy topcoat to execute as cleanly as possible,” says Diogo.
