  "description": "Almost every skin-care professional will tell you that a good face wash and quality sunscreen are essential for a good skin-care routine. Although there are plenty of sunscreens on the market, most dermatologists recommend EltaMD's lineup, specifically the UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($44). It's sensitive-skin-friendly and has an oil-free formula that is non-comedogenic, according to the brand. As a 30-year-old who's been going to the dermatologist since age 13, I have been recommended EltaMD's UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 countless times. Although I've always loved how it doesn't exacerbate my acne, I've never been a fan of the white cast it leaves behind. But luckily, EltaMD came out with two tinted versions of its bestselling UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 in 2024. Ahead, I test the original, untinted UV Clear SPF 46, the Tinted UV Clear SPF 46 ($46), and the Deep Tinted UV Clear SPF 46 ($46) sunscreens. Keep reading to see why this brand is worth the hype, and whether the tinted versions reign supreme. About the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46: It is a hybrid chemical and physical sunscreen formulated with nine percent zinc oxide and 7.5 percent octinoxate, providing broad-spectrum UVA/UVB SPF 46 protection. The sunscreen is an oil-free formula containing niacinamide, vitamin E, lactic acid, and hyaluronic acid. It is available in three formats: untinted, tinted, and deep tinted. The sunscreen is ideal for those with oily to combination skin, acne-prone skin, rosacea-prone skin, and sensitive skin. What I Like About the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46: I've tried and tested plenty of sunscreens through the years, and I've noticed that mineral sunscreens leave some sort of white cast (even if it's subtle) unless they are tinted dark enough to match my tan skin. The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 has a unique hybrid formula that uses both physical and chemical UV filters so that its application - along with the look and feel - are more elegant on the skin compared to others on the market. The oil-free formula goes on thick and opaque but dries down to a demi-matte finish. It feels deeply hydrating on the skin but not heavy, especially during the colder months when my skin leans a bit drier. I've also noticed that some mineral formulations tend to break me out, but the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 does not clog my pores or make my skin feel congested. This sunscreen seemingly creates a barrier on my skin, similar to a makeup primer, shielding it from external dust, pollutants, and UV rays. Using the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 makes me feel like my skin is actually getting the broad spectrum SPF coverage it needs. Although the untinted UV Clear SPF and the Tinted UV Clear SPF do leave a minor white cast on my skin, it isn't as bad as 100 percent mineral-based formulas by comparison. The Deep Tinted UV Clear SPF blends into a nearly-exact match to my skin tone. Since it provides enough coverage, I don't have to wear foundation and just use spot concealer instead. If you have a fair to medium skin tone, the Tinted UV Clear SPF is a better match. How to Use the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 Using the two-finger rule, I measure out the sunscreen for optimal coverage and blend it into my skin. Because of its thick consistency, I suggest applying the sunscreen in layers so that it isn't overwhelming to blend out. For a streak-free look, I dust some setting powder on top. The Deep Tint UV Clear adds a decent amount of coverage to my complexion that evens out my skin, so I follow it up with my go-to color corrector and concealer for a natural makeup look. What to Consider Before Trying the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 has a thicker consistency compared to other options on the market, especially those that are purely chemical-based or K-Beauty inspired. It might not be the ideal formulation for those who prefer a weightless, moisturizer-like feel. If you have a tan to dark skin tone like I do, the untinted and the light tint may give you a bit of a white cast, so it's best to go with the deep tinted SPF. Both the untinted and tinted versions of the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 are on the pricier side, ringing in at $44 and $46, respectively. Given how much sunscreen you need to apply daily, this isn't as affordable as other options on the market. I'd suggest saving this sunscreen for days with higher UV index numbers or when your skin is more sensitive due to facials, chemical peels, lasers, or other professional treatments. Where Is the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 Available? The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 in untinted, tinted, and deep tinted formulas are available on the brand's site, Amazon, and Dermstore.

through the years, and I\u0026#39;ve noticed that mineral sunscreens leave some sort of white cast (even if it\u0026#39;s subtle) unless they are tinted dark enough to match my tan skin. The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 has a unique hybrid formula that uses both physical and chemical UV filters so that its application — along with the look and feel — are more elegant on the skin compared to others on the market. The oil-free formula goes on thick and opaque but dries down to a demi-matte finish.

The Deep Tinted UV Clear SPF blends into a nearly-exact match to my skin tone. Since it provides enough coverage, I don\u0026#39;t have to wear foundation and just use spot concealer instead. If you have a fair to medium skin tone, the Tinted UV Clear SPF is a better match. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to Use the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wkETsbVt5_XzBKWIw7G6Clwvp4k=/fit-in/792x1408/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/01/09/883/n/1922153/tmp_Taj4zL_77d599ccd98baedf_BDE06B18-1012-4EE9-9D66-32B2A53A99C5-ezgif.com-optimize.gif\" alt=\"Woman applying the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 on her skin.\" width=\"792\" height=\"1408\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/wkETsbVt5_XzBKWIw7G6Clwvp4k=/fit-in/792x1408/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/01/09/883/n/1922153/tmp_Taj4zL_77d599ccd98baedf_BDE06B18-1012-4EE9-9D66-32B2A53A99C5-ezgif.com-optimize.gif 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/lklggbmIgeZ4HmnOvue8AubLTpQ=/fit-in/1584x2816/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/01/09/883/n/1922153/tmp_Taj4zL_77d599ccd98baedf_BDE06B18-1012-4EE9-9D66-32B2A53A99C5-ezgif.com-optimize.gif 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Anvita Reddy\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\"\u003e Using the two-finger rule, I measure out the sunscreen for optimal coverage and blend it into my skin. Because of its thick consistency, I suggest applying the sunscreen in layers so that it isn\u0026#39;t overwhelming to blend out. For a streak-free look, I dust some setting powder on top. The Deep Tint UV Clear adds a decent amount of coverage to my complexion that evens out my skin, so I follow it up with my go-to color corrector and concealer for a natural makeup look.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Trying the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eThe EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 has a thicker consistency compared to other options on the market, especially those that are purely chemical-based or K-Beauty inspired. It might not be the ideal formulation for those who prefer a weightless, moisturizer-like feel. If you have a tan to dark skin tone like I do, the untinted and the light tint may give you a bit of a white cast, so it\u0026#39;s best to go with the deep tinted SPF. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eBoth the untinted and tinted versions of the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 are on the pricier side, ringing in at $44 and $46, respectively. Given how much sunscreen you need to apply daily, this isn\u0026#39;t as affordable as other options on the market. I\u0026#39;d suggest saving this sunscreen for days with higher UV index numbers or when your skin is more sensitive due to facials, chemical peels, lasers, or other professional treatments.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Is the EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 Available?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eThe EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 in \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feltamd.com%2Fproducts%2Fuv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf-46\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49422176__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003euntinted\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feltamd.com%2Fcollections%2Ftinted-sunscreen%2Fproducts%2Feltamd-uv-clear-tinted-broad-spectrum-spf-46\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49422176__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003etinted\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feltamd.com%2Fcollections%2Ftinted-sunscreen%2Fproducts%2Feltamd-uv-clear-deep-tinted-broad-spectrum-spf-46\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49422176__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003edeep tinted\u003c/a\u003e formulas are available on the brand\u0026#39;s site, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Acne-Prone-Mineral-Based-Dermatologist-Recommended/dp/B002MSN3QQ?tag=popsugarshopx-20\u0026amp;asc_source=post\u0026amp;asc_campaign=beauty\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/eltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf-46-review-49422176\u0026amp;ascsubtag=___psv__p_49422176__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=29069\u0026amp;awinaffid=173843\u0026amp;clickref=___psv__p_49422176__t_w_\u0026amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Feltamd-uv-clear-tinted-broad-spectrum-spf46%2F11370312%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eDermstore\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e ★★★★☆ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.popsugar.com/author/anvita-reddy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnvita Reddy\u003c/a\u003e (she/her) is an assistant editor for PS Shopping.
