  "description": "With New York Fashion Week underway, the most obvious place to scout for fresh haircut inspiration would be backstage. But while the myriad looks dreamed up by talented hairstylists are certainly something to behold, some of the coolest cuts can actually be spotted on the city’s street stylers.Sure, the outfits tend to take precedence over hair, but a good cut can totally transform an aesthetic. This season alone, we’ve spotted razor-sharp bobs, ‘90s layers and, anything-but-boring medium-length chops to name a few styles. Without further ado, here are our favorites straight from NYC’s bustling streets this fashion week. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Here's picture proof that the blunt bob haircut is going nowhere. This shoulder-grazing chop is elevated by the shine-enhancing chocolate cherry hair color. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylists predict that triple XL hair, essentially long, long lengths, will reign supreme in 2025. These flowing goddess braids spotted on a guest outside the Christopher John Rogers runway show are beautiful. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Elevate any updo by asking your hairstylist for dainty face-framing pieces like this guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylist Tom Smith anticipates that bangs will become a hairstyle in their own right this year — and he's not wrong. This cut features blunter pieces among wispier sections of hair, and the result is totally unique. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.As seen outside Collina Strada, this jaw-skimming bob features shorter, wispier, face-framing pieces, which can be blown-out to add a little volume and variety. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're calling it: The “kicked” bob is the cut of the season. It's characterized by gentle flicks at the ends where the hair turns upward. Invest in a good flat iron like ghd Chronos Max, $349 to achieve a similar look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The burnished copper color is the cherry on top of this curly pineapple hairstyle spotted on a guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The side bang is back. We're especially into this longer, curled, and more voluminous style spied on a guest outside the Christian Siriano show. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Feathered layers? Yup. Face-framing pieces? Check. Shoulder-skimming length? Perfect. This cut — seen on a guest outside Chistian Siriano — nails three 2025 haircut trends in one. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're more than a little obsessed with this bluntly-sliced, wavy bob seen on Allure editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel.
