  "description": "Along the same lines as no-makeup makeup, there's no-polish nail polish, which can come in a few forms. One of our favorites is the \"soap nails\" trend - a minimalist's dream that entails using a slightly nude-pink shade with an opaque coloring. The translucent hue paired with a high-shine finish is the key to this barely-there trend, and Selena Gomez is the latest celebrity to take it for a spin. For the unfamiliar, the soap-nails trend is reminiscent of that sheer, bubblegum-pink soap bar you probably saw at your grandparent's house growing up. If you're looking for a new nail color to brighten up your spring (no matter how many April showers continue to loom outside), this is the perfect trend to try out - with or without a professional, because it's so easy to recreate at home. Tom Bachik, Gomez's longtime manicurist and the creator behind the look, shared that the simple spring manicure only required two products. First, he used the Apr√©s Neutrals Gel-X Tips in Maisie ($15) in the round medium shape, and then he filed them slightly shorter than they come out of the box for a custom look. Because the tips are already painted, you could stop there and recreate her look for just $15. However, if you want to follow Bachik's instructions to the letter, from there, you'll want to grab a clear coat. He used the Click Colors Super Clear ($16) from his own nail-polish brand. He says he only used one coat, which gives it an ultra-transparent look and works with the natural, already-present pink-nude shade that the nail extension comes in. That makes this the easiest manicure to recreate at home possible ever. The best part is, as your nails grow out, they'll blend in with this barely-there shade, so you can stave off nail appointments even longer.
