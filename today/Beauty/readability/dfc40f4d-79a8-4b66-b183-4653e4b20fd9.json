  "description": "When shopping for beauty products, it’s easy to gravitate to specialty stores like Sephora and Ulta, where where every aisle is dedicated to all things beauty. However, there’s one retailer that always claims a sizable chunk of my paycheck (just consult my order histories) — and that’s Nordstrom. Having grown up in the heyday of mall culture, I spent endless hours among the impeccably-lit displays at my local Nordstrom counter, swatching and spritzing to my heart’s content. Highly-anticipated Anniversary Sale aside, the iconic department store is home to, in my humble opinion, one of the best beauty selections in the country — an accolade I don’t throw around lightly. From niche fragrance brands to the latest in beauty tech, Nordstrom’s curation of hair care, makeup, skincare products — and more — is top-tier. (Plus, the retailer’s loyalty program often runs special point multiplier events on its beauty and fragrance assortment, allowing you to rack up rewards fast.)But hey, don’t just take my word for it . Below, I asked R29’s discerning group of editors to divulge the best brands to shop at Nordstrom — here are their ultimate favorites. At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication. If you buy or click on something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission. Victoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre Eyeshadow\"I recently tested a bunch of products from Victoria Beckham Beauty, and was so blown away by the brand. In addition to feeling so luxurious and timeless (the tortoiseshell packaging feels like it’s from a different time!), the quality of the formulas is really on another level. Like MAC, the brand has also been very selective of its retail presence, but recently announced that it was entering Nordstrom’s rarified beauty assortment. My choice pick that I highly recommend you swatch IRL at your local Nordstrom store is Lid Lustre eyeshadow, a dazzling, shimmery way to gild lids in a single swipe. (Photos truly don’t do it justice!)\" — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterVictoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre Eyeshadow, $, available at NordstromCharlotte Tilbury Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter\"If I had to use just one makeup brand, I’d probably choose Charlotte Tilbury. It has everything — even skincare to prep your base — and having met Charlotte herself recently, I now know just how much time, effort and research goes into each and every product. I was so impressed. My all time favorite, though, has to be the Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter (especially the shade Peachgasm), which I use as a cream blush. Unlike others, which are packed with chunky, glittery pigments, this is so finely-milled and appears like a glossy filter on the skin. Best of all, it doesn’t budge until you see fit to remove it at the end of the day. I’ve used a handful of these right down to the last drop — they’re that good.\" — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty DirectorCharlotte Tilbury Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter, $, available at NordstromChanel BAUME ESSENTIEL Multi-Use Glow Stick\"When I think of the Nordstrom beauty floor, Chanel is the first name that comes to mind. I have such fond memories of visiting the counter with my mom, marveling at the elegant jars, iconic lipsticks, and indulging in tiny samples of their decadent creams on my baby-soft skin. Even now, Nordstrom remains my go-to destination for the ultimate in luxury beauty, whether I’m restocking a classic Chanel fragrance or picking up a must-have Baume Essential. And for those of you who aren’t familiar with the latter, it’s essentially the grown-up version of a highlighter – the chicest, most subtle way to add light and dimension to your face, IMHO.\" — Sara Tan, Global Beauty DirectorChanel BAUME ESSENTIEL Multi-Use Glow Stick, $, available at NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum\"Every cool beauty editor I know has a D.S. \u0026 Durga perfume in their collection. The Brooklyn-based brand’s ethos is rooted in “armchair travel” — aka how a certain smell can transport you back to a very specific time and place — and its creations are all fittingly interesting and unique. My recent favorite has been Big Sur Eucalyptus, a woody cypress scent that takes me right back to my hiking trip to Alishan Mountain in Taiwan last year. I love taking big breaths as I spray this on my pulse points, as the refreshing whiffs of green apple and eucalyptus never fail to open up my chest.\" — Venus Wong, Senior WriterD.S. \u0026 Durga Big Sur Eucalyptus Eau de Parfum, $, available at NordstromWestman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick\"If you know me, you know I am a hardcore Westman Atelier fan. I own most of the brands products from contour sticks, to glowy highlighters, and natural mascaras, and its products totally align with my barely there makeup preferences. I also find the formulas don’t trigger my sensitive skin. Plus, the packaging is so chic, minimal, and just feels luxe, I’ve given so many of the brand’s liquid lip balms as gifts throughout the years. The first Westman item I bought was the Face Trace Contour Stick. I love the shade ‘Biscuit’ because it has a cooler understone so it doesn’t appear orange like some other contour or bronzing products I’ve tried. The texture is also so creamy and melts into the skin easily. It looks so natural I’ll usually just blend it over my tinted sunscreen — no foundation or concealer required.\" — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships ManagerWestman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick, $, available at NordstromMAC Cosmetics MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick\"MAC Cosmetics has always been strategic with its retail partnerships. For most of its four decades of being in business, you could only shop them at MAC stores or on the brand’s website. Nowadays, they are still only in a few retailers – and Nordstrom is among the rare few. After all these years, the artistry-focused brand still makes some of the most innovative, high-performing products around. My latest favorite: the Macximal Silky Matte lipstick, which combines the bold pigmentation and matte finish of the brand’s Retro Matte lipsticks in a silky, non-drying (!) formula.\" — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior WriterMAC Cosmetics MACximal Silky Matte Lipstick, $, available at NordstromTata Harper Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil\"I discovered Tata Harper when I worked as a travel editor at a newspaper. So many luxury hotels on my bucket list (The Lanesborough Hotel in London, Le Coucou Meribel in the French Alps, and Gleneagles in Scotland, just to name a few) feature Tata Harper facials on their spa menus. After sampling its Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil, I’m now crystal clear on why the brand has received so much love from five-star stays: The texture is rich without making my skin feel like an oil slick, and it's packed with natural retinoids derived from rosehip. I love massaging this into my face with my fingertips after my usual skincare routine, and I wake up with plumper and brighter skin the next day.\" — Venus Wong, Senior WriterTata Harper Retinoic Nutrient Face Oil, $, available at NordstromLike what you see?
