It only makes sense that they wiggled their way into my list of a few favorite products for the month that I think you guys should check out! PRODUCTS MENTIONED: And can I just say that babies grow way, way too fast? Aria is already 4.5 months old and she's growing like a little weed! I still am in shock that I made a baby who is 95th percentile for length (considering I stand at only a meager 4'11\") but they say the first couple years aren't really an accurate indication for adult height. As long as she can find clothes and shoes that fit later on it will be worth the fact that she zoomed through all those cute baby clothes too fast. I keep telling her to stop being a teenager but we all know how little infants listen to our parental demands. ;) Share This Story You Might Also Like",
