  "description": "When it comes time to search for nail ideas before your next salon appointment, there are plenty of places to look. Pinterest always has some goodies, as does Instagram (especially if you take a deep dive into some of your favorite celebrities' profiles). However, when you're looking for something truly innovative that no one else has seen yet, TikTok is a gold mine. The app has led to some of the best, most out-of-the-box trends, like \"junk\" nails and the \"bimbocore\" manicure, and recently, we stumbled across another new one that's worthy of your attention. \"Nuance\" nails are all over the platform, and they're perfect for anyone who wants to test out nail art without committing to anything too extreme. Ahead, nail experts break down what the trend is and how to get the look for yourself. Experts Featured in This Article Rachel Joseph is a manicurist with Nailing Hollywood in Los Angeles. Chelly Soto is a V Beauty Pure educator. Tara Haye is a manicurist with Nailing Hollywood in Los Angeles. What Are Nuance Nails? \"Nuance nails [have] a cloudy, smoky effect using nail-art inks or gel polish,\" Rachel Joseph, manicurist, says. \"Think of a marble look, but more delicate.\" The look often resembles stones or crystals, so the trend features shades that would appear in different stones, like marble or granite, which means you can expect to see a lot of browns, burnt oranges, grays, whites, and pearlescent colors or tones. The manicure also tends to incorporate 3D gold or silver accents layered on top of the marbled design. The trend is suitable for all nail shapes and lengths, which means you can either change things up and experiment with something new or stick with your tried-and-true silhouette. One thing to note, however, is that it's most frequently seen on short, squoval-shaped nails. How to Get Nuance Nails If you plan on visiting a salon, Chelly Soto, V Beauty Pure educator, says you should always arrive with inspiration photos in hand. \"We always suggest coming prepared with photos when you want to accomplish a specific look,\" she says. \"We would also suggest requesting a nail technician who is experienced with marbling designs.\" If you're planning on taking the DIY route, we'd suggest having at least a little bit of experience with nail art under your belt since this design is a bit complicated. The look can be achieved with regular nail polish, but the process will be much smoother and faster when using gel because there are numerous colors involved. To get the look, start by prepping your nails, which includes cutting and shaping them and trimming your cuticles. From there, manicurist Tara Haye says you'll want to apply a base coat. Then, select the nail polish colors for your design by looking for complementary hues. Apply the first color on top of the base coat, beginning with the lightest shade, and work your way up to the darkest, instructs Haye. From there, you'll want to create your gradient, which Hayes says you can do by starting at the cuticle area and blending the colors outward toward the tip of the nail using a sponge or nail brush. The idea is that you'll lightly dab and blend the colors together. If you're looking for inspiration to get you started, or photos you can bring with you to your nex salon appointment, keep scrolling for some of our favorite iterations of the trend.",
