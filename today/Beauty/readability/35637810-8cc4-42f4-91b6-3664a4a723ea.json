  "description": "So, you're a self proclaimed skin-care afficiando? But do you know that dry skin and dehydrated skin are two different things? Though you can even have both dry and dehydrated skin at the same time, they're very different. The approach to resolving these skin-care concerns is important, as you might be using products for dry skin when it's actually dehydrated (or vice versa), which can further aggravate your skin-care woes. On top of it all, if you don't know your skin type, things can get even more complicated, especially if you're dealing with symptoms of dry skin like itchy skin. Confused yet? Don't fret, we've got your back and can help you figure out the difference between dry vs dehydrated skin in no time. Ahead, we chat with skin-care expert Emilie Montassier who breaks down all the facts and science for the best skin solutions yet, including the causes of dry skin, as well as dry skin treatment ideas. You'll be all caught up on your skin-care knowledge in no time, and all you have to do is keep scrolling. Experts Featured in This Article Emilie Montassier is a skin-care expert for Bioderma, as well as a medical science liaison for AstraZeneca. Dry vs. Dehydrated Skin The main difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin is that dry skin is a skin type, whereas dehydrated skin is a temporary state. Dry skin is a skin type much like oily or combination skin, that is caused by a lack of lipids. Montassier tells PS that the \"main issue here is that the skin barrier is impaired,\" meaning the lipid levels are lacking, causing severe dryness (not an ideal skin situation). \"Dry skin can be dehydrated, whereas dehydrated skin is not necessarily dry but could also be oily or combination\" Montassier says. Dehydrated skin is very different, noting that \"we can't consider dehydrated skin as a skin type but more as a temporary state,\" because it lacks water both internally and externally. Dehydrated skin is \"a very common problem affecting all genders and skin types.\" Causes of Dry or Dehydrated Skin Causes of Dry Skin As previously mentioned, dry skin is caused by a loss of lipids due to a problem with the skin's barrier so \"the skin loses more water than usual and also becomes dehydrated.\" Dry skin can be worsened by using the wrong skin care; likewise, not using any skin care at all can have a big impact on your skin health. Additionally, hormonal changes can also wreak havoc on the skin. Genetics can play a role in skin types too; some people are prone to dry skin more than others. Causes of Dehydrated Skin Dehydrated skin is caused by a \"mix of internal and external factors such as environment (wind and cold), social factors (smoking and alcohol), and emotional factors (stress).\" Montassier suggests keeping your showers at a reasonable heat and the central heating down. (Luckily, both your bank account and skin will thank you for it.) Another main factor contributing to dehydrated skin is lack of hydration inside the body due to not drinking enough water. We're well aware that it is the most overused skin care tip but it still ranks as the most important. Your skin needs internal hydration to externally benefit from it. Symptoms of Dry vs. Dehydrated Skin Dry and dehydrated skin are different, and therefore, they present different symptoms. Keep reading to learn more about each one. Symptoms of Dry Skin There are many different causes of dry skin, some more common than others. \"Dry skin suffers from possible itching, discomfort, scales, roughness, and even cracks in the skin,\" Montassier says. Those dealing with dry skin may also find that it is irritated easily, even from the most gentle products. Symptoms of Dehydrated Skin On the other hand, Montassier highlights that dehydrated skin symptoms often leave the skin in a state of \"tightness, discomfort, loss of radiance, increased facial lines, and cause trouble for biological functions such as the body's healing process.\" You may also find that your skin feels dehydrated but can also look oily, and you may still get breakouts despite the tight feeling. You might also find that your makeup becomes patchy throughout the day. One way to test whether or not your skin is dehydrated is to do what is called a \"pinch test.\" You can pinch a small amount of skin between two fingers, and see how long it takes for the skin to snap back into place. If it moves back into place quickly and easily, you likely aren't dealing with dehydrated skin. Skin Care Products For Dry or Dehydrated Skin If you're looking for dry skin treatment, there are specific skin-care ingredients that help with dry and dehydrated skin. Some ingredients that help with both include hyaluronic acid and ceramdies. Glycerin, snail mucin, and lactic acid help with dehydrated skin, while plant oils, seed oils, and shea butter help with dry skin. Some products we like with these ingredients are the Amlactin Daily Moisturizing Lotion ($14) and the Gold Bond Radiance and Renewal Body Cream ($6). Fore more suggestions, read our full round-up of hydrating body products. Montassier also suggests finding a product with lipids, which can help rehydrate the skin. She recommends using a \"daily gentle cleanser that increases lipid levels, like the Atoderm Shower Gel ($22).\" - Additional reporting by Renee Rodriguez Tori Crowther is a freelance beauty journalist and former PS UK editor.
