  "text": "As soon as puberty hit, it was like a switch turned on, and my skin began producing copious amounts of oil. I had such greasy skin that I’d apply a full-coverage, long-wear foundation and bake with a matte setting powder until my skin felt as dry as an old loaf of sourdough. Still, it would only take about an hour for my oily skin to poke through. This was a time before we collectively became obsessed with glass skin and glowy tinted moisturizers, so I hated how shiny my skin was. But someone told me along the way that my extra oils would someday ward off premature fine lines—and whether or not it was true, I took solace in those words. Unfortunately, thanks to a round of Accutane to rid painful cystic acne, my skin significantly dried out. I now have the non-oily skin I coveted in my youth, and I feel a little sad about it. When I don’t apply the right hydrating products, my forehead feels tight and begins to show signs of fine lines. One product I now rely on to keep dryness, tightness, and those pesky lines at bay is the Guerlain Abeille Royale Youth Watery Oil Serum.Courtesy of GuerlainLike the other products in the brand’s Abeille line, the new serum incorporates nutrient-rich black bee honeys and royal jelly to create a formula designed to plump skin, add a glow, and reduce the appearance of fine lines. However, the serum has an added benefit: It’s been proven to wake up and stimulate “senescent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).” MSCs are found in the connective tissues of the skin, which are vital to its self-repair process. When they become senescent—over time as our skin is exposed to various stressors like pollution and UV rays—the cells become unable to perform their job. Senescent cells have also earned the moniker “zombie cells” because, like those horrifying creatures, they resist dying and can even impair the cells around them, expediting the degradation of our skin. Eventually, “this impacts tissue firmness, accelerates the appearance of wrinkles, and reduces skin radiance,” says Dr. Frédéric Bonté, the head of research at Guerlain. He explains that when skin isn’t able to repair itself properly, which begins happening around age 25 to 30, it ages more quickly. Guerlain Abeille Royale Youth Watery Oil SerumAs someone who is around that age range (and is terrified of zombies), I began applying the serum morning and night about two months ago. The first thing I noticed was the incredible aroma (developed by legendary perfumer Thierry Wasser): The honeyed, nectar-inspired fragrance features in all of the Abeille Royale products. I’ve been so consistent with the serum that my partner recently took a whiff of my jar of Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Honey Treatment Night Cream and went, “It smells good, and it smells like you.” Abeille Royale has become my face’s signature scent. Also, unlike what you might expect from a honey-infused formula, the new launch actually instantly soaks into my arid skin like water. It’s so lightweight that it almost feels like I haven’t applied anything at all, so it would be suitable for anyone with more oily skin, too. I notice that it also helps my skin better absorb the products I lay on top. Without it, my moisturizer takes a lot longer to sink in, and my skin dries out much faster. By the end of a work day, I’m itching to run back home, scrub off my makeup, and douse myself in the honey-rich concoction. Courtesy of GuerlainThroughout the past few weeks, my skin has been firmer and smoother, and there is a radiance that wasn’t there before. I’ve become so accustomed to applying the serum that I can’t imagine letting my skin go without it, especially during harsh winters. In fact, I have a backup hidden away in my skin care stash, and I wouldn’t hesitate to pick another one up as soon as I run out.",
