  "description": "First things first: I'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan. I know, I know - it's blasphemous to all the Swifties reading this, but it's true. I like roughly two of her songs, I'm not huge on her outfits, and for the most part I abhor her makeup choices. (Sorry, I don't look good in a red lip.) All that being said, imagine my surprise when I saw Swift sporting an accessory I knew I wanted to try immediately: the Fazit Glitter Freckles Makeup Patches ($16). At an Oct. 7 Kansas City Chiefs game, Swift wore the freckles while watching and supporting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. She paired her silver and gold freckles with a bold red lip and some intense cat-eye eyeliner, and I have to admit, although I'm not usually a fan of her looks, this one hit a little differently. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Fazit Glitter Freckles and find out why they've become one of my favorite accessories. About the Fazit Glitter Freckles This product is a glitter makeup patch that can be applied like a temporary tattoo. The glitter freckles come in gold, silver, and rose gold as well as brown. They last up to three days and can be removed with makeup remover or cleansing balm. They come in packages of six, 12, or 18. What I Like About the Fazit Glitter Freckles I'm a retired rave baby and I think these freckles make the perfect accessory for a concert, fun night out on the town, or special event. I recently went to a birthday party in Joshua Tree and I loved how these glitter freckles elevated my look. I'm acne-prone, and these didn't break me out whatsoever, which is another plus. I also love that they come in gold, silver, and rose gold, because I snagged one of each - so I can always match up my freckles to my jewelry. I'm planning on going to an EDM concert later this month, and you can bet these freckles are going to come along with me. They're super cute and they're so easy to apply, you really can't go wrong. How to Use the Fazit Glitter Freckles To start, the brand recommends peeling off the backing and placing the patch sticky side down on your face, wherever you want the freckles to appear. Next, wet a towel and dab the patch for 60 seconds. From there, you can peel off the patch. They should last for 24-48 hours. To remove, the brand says you can use makeup wipes, micellar water, or an oil-based cleanser. It notes not to scrub hard, and instead to wash gently in a circular motion. When trying these for the first time, I followed the instructions exactly and found they worked just as described. I put them on after finishing my entire face of makeup. They were honestly extremely easy to get off as well. All I needed was the tiniest bit of cleansing balm to work them off my face, and then I double-cleansed with a gentle face wash to remove everything else. What to Consider Before Trying the Fazit Glitter Freckles I would start out by doing one half of the freckles, then moving to the center, and then doing the other half on the other cheek. I found that it was easier to make sure all of the freckles were in place when doing it piece by piece rather than trying to get each side wet all at once. Where the Fazit Glitter Freckles Are Available The Fazit Glitter Freckles are available directly on the brand's website.
