  "description": "I've been fortunate enough to have relatively clear skin for most of my life, but every now and then, there are those pesky pimples that pop up at the most random and unwanted times. Sometimes, it can be due to stress or simply a sign that a change in my skin-care routine is needed. Either way, I typically try to get rid of them as fast as possible with a spot treatment. However, recently, I've been even more successful at eliminating breakouts with the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch The Original ($16, originally $22). As someone with sensitive skin, I'm not the first to jump at just any new product. But that doesn't mean I'm not tempted by the idea of something that promises to get rid of acne in just a few hours. After finally giving the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch a chance, I was thrilled to learn that my easily irritated skin loves it. It helped eliminate my pimples overnight. Keep reading for my full review of the acne patch (which, by the way, happens to be on sale for Amazon Prime Day, but act fast because the sale ends Oct. 9). About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original Made of pure, medical-grade hydrocolloid, this sticker improves the look of pimples overnight. It's a chemical-free formula and allergy-tested to be suitable for all skin types. You typically see results in six to eight hours. The sheet's translucent matte finish blends well into the skin. Included in a box are 36 patches. What I Like About the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original From its unmatched staying power to the undeniable results, I can say that the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch truly lives up to the hype. Thanks to its gel formula, the patch gently clings to the skin for hours while effortlessly absorbing all of the gunk in the pimple. This is great, whether you're a heavy sleeper or on the go all day. It also helps you beat the annoying temptation of picking at your face, which helps prevent scabs and scarring caused by popping pimples. The patches come in 36-count and 72-count packages. How to Use the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original The Mighty Patch is incredibly simple to use. Whether you're going to sleep or just starting your day, prep your skin with your usual cleansing routine. You can apply toner as well, but be careful with your moisturizer as the area around the pimple needs to be dry and any oils will keep it from adhering properly. Then, you just stick the patch on, let it sit for six to eight hours, and peel it off when it turns white. And just like that, you're left with a noticeably smaller breakout and in some cases, it fully disappears. What to Consider Before Trying the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch The Original This acne patch is an excellent option for all skin types, including those with sensitive skin like myself. However, the brand recommends using caution if you're prone to irritation. Where Is the Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original Available? The Hero Cosmetics Mighty Acne Patch Original is available on Amazon, as well as Target, Ulta Beauty, and the brand's website.
