  "text": "It’s been a while since I’ve added any new Diptyque launches to my home collection as I have been on a self-imposed candle ban trying to use up all the candles I currently have. The new L’Eau Papier Collection caught my eye and by the time it launched I felt like I had used up enough to justify two more splurges. I love the L’Eau Papier Eau de Toilette for a fresh clean mix of white musk, rice steam accord, mimosa and blonde wood accord. They added a Papier (Paper) Candle and Encre (Ink) Candle to the collection along with a few other scented Papier items. I’m 10/10 in love. L’Eau Papier The L’Eau Papier Eau de Toilette ($130 for 50 ml to $180 for 100 ml) is a unique clean minimalist kind of scent. It’s light, gentle with a hazy feel. It’s hard to imagine what a paper fragrance smells like but when you smell this scent it just makes sense. Diptyque added this in a few other formats. I decided to try one the L’Eau Papier Hair Mist ($72 for 30 ml) and I love it. It has pretty good lasting power although it is still very soft. Candles There are two limited-edition candles in this launch and I love them both. The Papier Candle smells just like the perfume. It’s a very soft and subtle scent but does fill the entire room within a few minutes. I love it. It has a crisp and clean vibe. Diptyque also created an Encre Candle (ink) in this collection. It’s a mix of Indonesian patchouli and black liquorice and has a smokey vibe to it. It’s a softer creamier version of Feu de Bois. I wasn’t sure what to expect as I’m not really liquorice fan, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised! I think it’s a great summer to fall transition kind of scent. I’ve been really happy with the purchases, however they don’t really fit the usual Diptyque vibe to me. Most Diptyque scents are more dynamic and a little more complex while this collection is more minimalist and subtle. I still love everything, but if you’re new to Diptyque and these are the first things you end up trying, just know it’s different from most other things Diptyque. I still think Baies is their best candle. Scented Matches and Accessories As a Diptyque fan I also added a few other items to my home collection. I love their glass candle holders and photophores. They launched a Mini Ribbed Candle Holder ($84) for their minis. It’s so cute! When I decided to order it they were sold out online so I called one of the NY stores to have them ship it to my house. It has since popped up back in stock online a few times. You can set an alert if you want to order it online although I don’t know if it’s a permanent item. Mini Candle Holder, Small Candle Holder and Standard Candle Holder. I also tried two of the Scented Matches Sets ($30 each). These are longer matches in a paper box that were released with their refillable candle collection. I asked the New York store which ones were their most popular ones and they told me the Moss and Orange Blossom. They are scented which makes them fun but there is really nothing super special about them to justify the splurge (in my opinion). I do think they’re beautiful and having longer matches is always a plus for me so they ended up being worth it just to have and try them. I don’t know that I’ll repurchase them or buy any of the other scents. Overall love. Have you tried these yet? If not what kinds of scents are you loving for the home this time of year? Shop the Post You can find the Papier Collection out now. Available at Diptyque, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale’s and all other Diptyque locations. P.S. Thank you for everyone who has messaged me about the recent hurricane. We were very fortunate that only the edge of the hurricane hit Tampa Bay. Our area in St Petersburg still experienced massive storm surge (this was the biggest storm surge in over 100 years in our area). Andrew and I were not located in an evacuation zone so we stayed put and the counties here have been very proactive about warnings, alerts and providing resources for help. So many of the beaches, waterfront areas and many neighborhoods had life changing flooding and damage. We lost power for 3 days but no flooding to our home. So many have been very working hard 24/7 to repair broken power lines, clean up fallen trees. The storm surge was so bad many cars and boats floated to very odd places. My in-law’s place is by the water and they had a lot of flooding inside their home and there is a lot of damage there. Their place is in a mandatory evacuation zone so nobody was there when the hurricane hit, but the damage is devastating. Andrew and I spent a few days cleaning everything out for them. Still, we have been very fortunate and we are grateful. Thank you everyone for your kind wishes and for checking in on me over the past week.",

When I decided to order it they were sold out online so I called one of the NY stores to have them ship it to my house. It has since popped up back in stock online a few times. You can set an alert if you want to order it online although I don’t know if it’s a permanent item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Diptyque-Photophore-Candle-Holders.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Diptyque-Photophore-Candle-Holders-1440x2160.jpg\" alt=\"Diptyque Glass candle holders\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1620\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"Diptyque Papier Collection.

Thank you for everyone who has messaged me about the recent hurricane. We were very fortunate that only the edge of the hurricane hit Tampa Bay. Our area in St Petersburg still experienced massive storm surge (this was the biggest storm surge in over 100 years in our area).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew and I were not located in an evacuation zone so we stayed put and the counties here have been very proactive about warnings, alerts and providing resources for help. So many of the beaches, waterfront areas and many neighborhoods had life changing flooding and damage. We lost power for 3 days but no flooding to our home. So many have been very working hard 24/7 to repair broken power lines, clean up fallen trees. The storm surge was so bad many cars and boats floated to very odd places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy in-law’s place is by the water and they had a lot of flooding inside their home and there is a lot of damage there. Their place is in a mandatory evacuation zone so nobody was there when the hurricane hit, but the damage is devastating. Andrew and I spent a few days cleaning everything out for them. Still, we have been very fortunate and we are grateful. Thank you everyone for your kind wishes and for checking in on me over the past week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
