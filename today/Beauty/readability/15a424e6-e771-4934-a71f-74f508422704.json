  "description": "We love a good beauty haul. Who doesn't, right? It's hard to match the excitement of a big box full of new makeup and skin-care goodies arriving at your doorstep - and the thrill that comes with testing them all at once. But as much as we enjoy treating ourselves to new products at big-name beauty stores, sometimes (read: a lot of the time), a trip to Walmart, or its digital storefront is always a safe bet. Not only are there a ton of options, but they're all wildly affordable, which makes adding to your virtual shopping with wild abandon a lot less stressful. Plus, Walmart's brands include all of the tried-and-true beauty products you probably grew up with, like Maybelline, CoverGirl, L'Oréal Paris - you name it. As fun as it is to test out brand-new, buzz-worthy products, you can't compare it to the staple items you've used for nearly a lifetime. That said, when was the last time you scoped out Walmart's beauty bestsellers section? It's chock-full of top-rated makeup, skin-care essentials, and hair-care products, many of which cost $50 or less. Best of all, a lot of these items are currently marked down at the retailer's Spring Beauty Deals event, which is happening now through April. Keep scrolling to shop our picks for the bestselling beauty products from Walmart that you need on your radar, if not in your vanity ASAP.",
