  "description": "Image Source: Getty/John Nacion We can no longer deny what is (literally) staring us in the face: the invisible eyebrow trend is here to stay. We saw it years ago with Doja Cat and Kim Kardashian, and in early March, the look practically took over the 2025 Oscars red carpet. The latest celebrity to jump on the no-eyebrow trend? Jenna Ortega. The actor popped up at CinemaCon 2025 on April 1 sporting bleached brows - a move that made her look almost unrecognizable. We're so used to seeing her with dark eyebrows that match her typically jet-black hair. Ortega's makeup artist, Vincent Oquendo, shared a photo of the look on his page, giving us a peek at the inspiration behind the transformation and sharing a hidden reference you likely missed. He noted in the caption that the duo channeled a \"modern Faye Dunaway '70s reference with taupe brows.\" Dunaway famously starred in hits such as \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mommie Dearest,\" and many more. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vincent Oquendo (@vincentoquendo) If Ortega's new look is enough to convince you to try the trend, we've got some expert tips that'll help you pull it off. First and foremost, the best (and safest) way to achieve the look is by paying a visit to a professional. Any time you use bleach, you run the risk of over-processing your hair, which can cause it to fall out. Before you reach for the chemicals, there are a few things you should do. \"To prep your brows for bleaching, be sure to remove any makeup from them,\" hairstylist Jeremy Tardo says. \"Clean your skin of makeup or products but don't scrub it. If the skin is stimulated by scrubbing, it will create more sensitivity when bleaching your brows. Add Vaseline or a similar skin barrier lotion to the skin around your brows to protect your skin.\" Not ready to commit to something permanent? Don't worry - we have a temporary fix. You can always try TikTok's bleached-brow hack, which only requires concealer, setting powder, and a spoolie. Just grab a light concealer, apply it to your eyebrows using the brush, and then set everything with a translucent setting powder. Voila - bleached brows for a day - without the damage. Whether you're ready to steal Ortega's new vibe or you're just nosy and want a closer look, keep scrolling for some more close-up shots of Ortega's bleached brows.
