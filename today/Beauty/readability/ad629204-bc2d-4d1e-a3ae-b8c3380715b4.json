While I had been reaching for more milky tones through the winter months, now that sunnier days are here, I want something a bit brighter. Essie's Sugar Daddy ticks all the boxes. While it's sheer, the tone is a bright pink, which adds a pretty brightness to my nails after a couple of coats. It's like a sheer liquid blush for your hands.” — Eleanor Vousden, beauty editor, Who What Wear UKEssie Nail Polish in Sugar Daddy, $, available at UltaManucurist Active Glow in Raspberry“Please don’t take away my beauty editor card, but something about — gulp — bare nails feels particularly fresh right now. That’s not to say I’ve been going polish-free: I’ve been swiping on Manicurist Active Glow, a pearly shade that imparts the perfect amount of natural-looking sheen. Thanks to its reparative and antioxidant ingredients, I swear my nails are stronger after wearing it.” — Dianna Singh, features director, AllureManicurist Active Glow in Raspberry, $, available at AnthropologieOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Last Glam Standing“My favorite nail polish color for spring is undoubtedly milky lavender. It’s a bit of a contrast to my go-to pillarbox red, but I love how fresh and clean this color looks on nails — especially short ones like mine. Typically, I don’t gravitate towards really minimalist, clean-girl manicures, but this lilac purple means that I still get to enjoy a wash of color. The grow-out is so much less obvious compared to something more bold.” — Mica Ricketts, freelance beauty journalistOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Last Glam Standing, $, available at UltaNailberry L’Oxygéné Nail Polish in Love You Very Matcha“I love everything matcha-related, so I was already sold when I spotted the name of this shade from Nailberry. Once on, the creamy khaki green actually reminds me more of a perfectly manicured greenhouse, thriving with plant life in the spring. The low saturation means that it looks lovely with the neutrals and denim in my wardrobe, but I also love how it imparts a jade-green luster to my fingertips under the sun. Nailberry’s nail polish line gets a lot of love from me; so much pigment comes from just one coat, and the moisture-permeable formula is gentle on the nails.” — Venus Wong, Refinery29 senior writerNailberry L’Oxygéné Nail Polish in Love You Very Matcha, $, available at AmazonDior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma“I absolutely love Dior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma. It’s a beautiful russet red that looks just as gorgeous on my fingernails as it does on my toes. What makes it even better is how versatile it is. It pairs perfectly with any outfit, no matter the color. There’s something about the shade that has a retro ‘70s vibe to it, and it’s hands down my most complimented nail color. In fact, Dior nail polish is criminally underrated. It’s exceptionally durable and lasts for weeks on my toes, which means it’s worth the higher price tag. Even better, the brush is flatter than most and ever so slightly rounded, which makes light work of DIY manicures. I never make mistakes when I use this; it’s foolproof.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director, Refinery29Dior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma, $, available at DiorOlive \u0026 June Long Lasting Polish in Corrigan“I love all pastel polishes, but if I had to choose one color to wear for spring, it would be this one. Corrigan is the prettiest pistachio green and is fully opaque in two coats. A lot of pale green polishes tend to skew more minty or blue-toned, but this one is unique with its warmer undertones. I’m a big fan of Olive \u0026 June’s longwear and chip-resistant polishes, and I swear by the mani system’s prep and gel-like top coat for salon-quality nails at home. To me, this pale green is a spring neutral; fresh, unique, and subtly seasonal.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Olive \u0026 June Long Lasting Polish in Corrigan, $, available at Olive \u0026 JuneORLY Nail Lacquer in Bell Bottom Blues“ORLY has released a fleet of ‘70s-inspired nail varnishes to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and Bell Bottom Blues is my absolute favorite from the collection. Thanks to a shimmery, green undertone, the icy blue hue has a crystal-like sparkle that makes it mesmerizing to watch under the sunlight. I’ve been impressed by how well my ORLY nail colors have held up, especially when layered with the Bonder Rubberized Base Coat, which helps the color firmly grip onto my nails. I’ll be reaching for this color time and again to pair with my favorite white and blue linen shirts this spring.” — Venus Wong, senior writer, Refinery29 Orly Nail Lacquer in Bell Bottom Blues, $, available at OrlyOPI Nail Lacquer in It's a Girl!“I’m a nude-toned loyalist. A sheer layer of milky pink is forever my go-to, thanks to its ability to make me feel that bit more put-together. Imagine my horror, then, when I left the nail salon after settling on the wrong shade. Thanks to some very misleading salon lighting, the manicure I thought was a barely-there rose turned out to be a very-much-there shade of pink. And yet, the compliments have come rolling in. The shade responsible? The aptly named OPI It’s A Girl!, which has taught me that change can actually be a good thing. It’s a pretty, sugary pink polish that feels more playful than my usual, sensible nails. Will I be swapping out my beloved neutrals for candy-floss hues from now on? Unlikely. But if there was ever a time to flirt with a new shade (accidentally or not), then spring is the perfect excuse.” — Rachael Martin, beauty editor, Grazia UKOPI Nail Lacquer in It's a Girl!, $, available at UltaEssie To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment“My lineup of spring nail polish shades often changes, but a recent contender that has secured a top spot is Essie’s To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment. The shade has a natural, barely-there pink hue that looks great on all nails. But it’s far more than a pretty color: it can improve visible signs of UV gel damage in just five days, thanks to a formula that contains a strengthening 3-protein complex, methylsulfonylmethane aka MSM [said to promote nail growth], and ceramides. As someone trying to restore my nails to a healthier state while still wanting a hint of color, this polish has been a game-changer. It also dries down quickly without the need for a top coat.” — Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer, Refinery29Essie To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment, $, available at UltaDazzle Dry Nail Lacquer in Checkmate“I have a serious color crush on pastel blue (in fact, I’m known to wear it year round), and Checkmate is among my favorites. I’m a bit picky when it comes to baby blues; too pale, and it reads as a dull, powdery grey, and too vivid gets into sky blue territory. Checkmate is a true pastel blue with cool undertones that feel as fresh as the first spring day. It’s bright without being loud and feels airy and light. Plus, I love the Dazzle Dry system for quick, DIY manicures that dry to the touch in literally five minutes.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Dazzle Dry Dry Nail Lacquer in Checkmate, $, available at Dazzle DryLe Mini Macaron Nail Polish in Lily Rose“Spring instantly makes me want to lean into pastels, and Lily Rose is the perfect baby pink hue that reminds me of cherry blossoms. While Le Mini Macaron is known for its easy at-home gel manicure kits, I'm equally impressed by the air-dry polishes. This formula is super long-lasting; mine remained chip-free for over a week. It also doubles as a treatment thanks to nail-fortifying biotin.” — Kristina Rodulfo, content creator and beauty editorLe Mini Macaron Nail Polish in Lily Rose, $, available at Le Mini MacaronLike what you see?
