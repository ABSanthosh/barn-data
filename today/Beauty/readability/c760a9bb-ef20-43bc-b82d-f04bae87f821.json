  "description": "Since his debut in the acclaimed BBC screen adaptation of Sally Rooney's \"Normal People,\" Paul Mescal's career has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. The Irish actor has starred in several successful projects in recent years, including \"All of Us Strangers,\" \"Aftersun,\" and the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator 2.\" While fans of the Academy-award nominee are familiar with his impressive acting résumé, not everyone knows about his equally fascination collection of tattoos, which features at least eight unique pieces. Mescal's tattoos are primarily concentrated on his arms, which makes them easier to cover when filming different roles. To honor his family, he has two tattoos: one dedicated to his mother and another reflecting a cherished childhood memory with his father. Additionally, he has a tattoo paying homage to an iconic line from the romantic classic film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And if you thought he didn't have any ink referencing his breakout role, you can rest assured that he has one specific piece of artwork that he cryptically confirmed is linked to \"Normal People.\" Ahead, we have rounded up all of Mescal's known tattoos, along with their significance to the actor. Keep reading for a full breakdown of his growing ink collection.",
