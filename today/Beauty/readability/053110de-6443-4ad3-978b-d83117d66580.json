  "description": "I'll be totally honest with you: I didn't join the \"glass skin\" movement (or even know what it entailed, for that matter) until recently. As a beauty writer, I approach any trend or seemingly elusive marketing term with a healthy dose of skepticism. But I can say with total confidence that Peach \u0026 Lily really delivers on its \"glass skin\" promises. The brand's founder, Alicia Yoon, coined the term and started the trend with a hero serum of the same name - the Glass Skin Refining Serum ($39) - that truly gives you the glossiest glow. I can attest firsthand to its radiance-boosting power because I use it daily. I've never gotten more compliments on my skin, and it's all due to powerhouse ingredients that calm redness, brighten, clarify, and smooth. The best part? Yoon recently took the brand's legendary serum and turned it into a sheet mask. Whether you're a religious user of the Refining Serum or are new to the brand, trust me, this is one you don't want to skip. Peach \u0026 Lily's Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask ($8) contains hero Korean ingredients that provide satisfying and instant results we're all looking for. As Yoon explains, one mask is the equivalent of a 40-gram bottle of serum, so you know you're getting your money's worth. It should come as no surprise, then, that the mask sold out almost instantly when it launched. Happily, it's back in stock (run, don't walk), and I was able to take it for a test run. If you want to learn more about this new miracle-in-a-pouch, keep reading. I'm sharing everything you need to know ahead. About the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask The mask includes two percent ginseng extract (a very high concentration not normally found in skin care), which is packed with antioxidants to brighten and firm the skin. It also has a vegan collagen peptide complex (including copper tripeptide), which firms, plumps, and gives skin a glow. Niacinamide refines skin texture and boosts radiance, while a hyaluronic acid complex locks in moisture while plumping and hydrating the skin. Cica is responsible for calming and soothing red or barrier-impaired skin. The mask can be left on for 30 minutes to overnight. What I Like About the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask I'd recently gotten my hands on Peach \u0026 Lily's Glass Skin Refining Serum and completely fell in love. You can then imagine my excitement when the brand released this mask, promising similarly amazing results. First, some background on my skin. I have sensitive, barrier-impaired, acne-prone skin that also gets dehydrated, especially during drier months here in Los Angeles. Point being, finding the right products isn't always easy. I've loved every single Peach \u0026 Lily product I've tried because they never break me out and provide my skin with the long-lasting hydration it needs. This mask is easily one of my new favorites from the brand because it's so gentle. Usually, when I wake up in the morning, my skin is more easily irritated and a bit dehydrated, so I use this mask to bring much-needed life back to my complexion. I like to use this mask at least once a week, but lately, I've been hoarding the few that I have because I'm worried it will sell out again. $8 might seem a bit pricey for one mask, but trust me, it makes a visible difference after just one use, so I definitely think it's worth it. If you're like me and struggle with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation leftover from breakouts, this mask can also help in that department. Niacinamide is a powerhouse ingredient that I use in my daily routine to help lighten dark spots; this mask contains a two percent concentration of the brightening ingredient. Personally, I pair this weekly mask with the brand's Glass Skin Refining Serum and the results really speak for themselves. They both work great individually, but together, you'll get a massive hydration and radiance boost. The two are now nonnegotiables in my routine, and I'll for sure be stocking up on both. How to Use the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask The brand recommends cleansing and applying any toners or essences you may have before putting on the mask. It comes in two layers - one for the top half of your face and one for the bottom. (I found that the bottom half tended to slide around a bit, but it still got the job done.) Per the directions, you can leave the mask on for 30 minutes if you need a quick fix, three hours (or until it turns clear instead of white), or even overnight. Yoon told me to leave it on for at least an hour if you really want to maximize the effects. I've found that leaving the mask on for about an hour and a half gives my skin that lit-from-within glow. My skin is prone to breakouts, but this didn't cause any, and it even helped calm my skin and tamp down redness thanks to the cica and niacinamide in the formula. What to Consider Before Trying the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask Niacinamide can potentially cause irritation for some people in higher concentrations, but because there's only two percent in this mask, that shouldn't be an issue. (Again, my skin is super sensitive and I've never had a problem.) If you're concerned, you could try doing a patch test with the serum on a small area before applying the mask to your entire face, given that the ingredients are very similar. But as someone with super sensitive, acne-prone skin, I can tell you that this mask didn't cause any issues - it only helped make my complexion look better than ever. Where Is the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask Available? The Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Ginseng Collagen Mask is available at Ulta Beauty and the brand's website.
