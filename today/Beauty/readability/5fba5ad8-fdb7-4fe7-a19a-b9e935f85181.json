  "text": "The brand also introduced a new Bluetooth-friendly Airwrap.Photo: Courtesy of DysonFew brands are so disruptive to a consumer category that they come to define it. But with its industry-shifting blow-dryer and styling tools like the Airwrap, Dyson catapulted hair tools into a period of tech- and design-driven innovation, challenging others to keep up. For all the bells and whistles of its tech-savvy hairstyling tools, though, the company (which was once known for vacuums and air purifiers) hasn't seen fit to get into hair care — until now. On Thursday, Dyson announced the launch of its first-ever hair-care products, designed, of course, to work in tandem with its air-centric styling tools: The Chitosan Pre-Style Cream and the Chitosan Post-Style Serum, priced at $60 each (or $55 for a refill). Both formulas are centered on chitosan, a \"complex macromolecule\" derived from oyster mushrooms that promotes hair retention without leaving strands feeling crunchy, per the brand. They're also both engineered with \"triodetic technology,\" which secures styles through a lightweight structure of bonds that \"[allows hair] to move, flex and recall its style, in unison with the rest, resulting in flexible all-day hold, even in high humidity.\" Dyson Chitosan Pre-Style Cream and Post-Style SerumPhoto: Courtesy of DysonWhen applied to damp, towel-dried hair, the Chitosan Pre-Style Cream aims to fight frizz and boost shine with a mix of grapeseed, castor, argan and coconut oils, along with beeswax and heat protectants. It's also designed for all hair types: There are four available variants, spanning straight to wavy and curly to coily hair textures, with separate options for light and rich conditioning.Following drying and styling hair, the Post-Style Serum is meant to protect against \"up to 80% relative humidity\" and locks in a look with amino acids for repairing surface damage and hyaluronic acid for hydrating strands, per the brand. With the ability to hold styles for up to 12 hours, the serum is touted as suitable for all hair types, including color and chemically treated hair.\"We want to take the guesswork out of styling,\" Amy Johnson, head of education at Dyson, said, in a statement. \"Overuse can weigh hair down and cause styles to lose shape prematurely. Because Dyson's formula is highly concentrated, a little goes a long way. This system reduces the chance of error, allowing you to adjust the quantity until you find the right balance, ensuring consistent styling results.\"Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesDyson's chitosan-packed hair-care products aren't the only new innovations the brand has been keeping under wraps: It's also continuing to add to the bells and whistles of its styling repertoire, unveiling a new version of its Airwrap with a focus on personalization. Dyson Airwrap i.d., $599Photo: Courtesy of DysonDubbed the Airwrap i.d. (short for identity), the new tool connects via Bluetooth to the MyDyson app, where the i.d. Curl feature will recommend a unique curling routine based on the user's hair type, length, texture, style retention, skill level and styling goals. It then activates its recommended three-step routine for a distinct styling experience. Retailing for $599, the tool will debut in new Vinca Blue and Topaz, as well as Ceramic Patina and Topaz colorways.Dyson also introduced three new attachments to accompany its latest Airwrap: a conical barrel for tighter, more defined curls; a Wave + Curl diffuser that enhances natural curl and wave patterns via two different ways of airflow; and the Blade concentrator that smooths hair through two jets of air converging into one even sheet.Dyson's Chitosan Pre-Style Cream and Post-Style Serum are both available beginning Thursday at dyson.com, and will arrive at sephora.com in August. The Airwrap i.d., along with its new attachments, will be available on dyson.com starting Aug. 26.Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
