  "description": "Image Source: Getty Images/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic We'd be lying if we said we've never taken pictures of Megan Fox's nails to the salon and copied her exact manicures. If you're due for a new set soon, you're in luck because Fox just came out of her new baby bliss with nail art that's super trendy and packs a hidden meaning. Inspired by the birth of her and Machine Gun Kelly's new baby girl, Fox's manicure features soft-baby pink colors with 3D details and drawings of little cherubs. The overall style is reminiscent of \"castlecore nails,\" inspired by one of the top trends from the Pinterest Predicts 2025 report. \"Medieval core\" is trending up 110 percent and gothic-inspired beauty looks have followed suit. This, of course, includes nail art. Although Fox's nails have a much softer edge than traditional gothic looks (she swapped in baby angels for chrome crosses, after all), the details on Fox's manicure still adds to the lore. View this post on Instagram A post shared by NAILS OF LA (@nails_of_la) \"We wanted to create a set that felt soft, sacred, and personal,\" says Fox's nail artist Brittney Boyce. \"Megan just had her baby, so we designed these angel baby nails in a delicate pink.\" Boyce says that the angel images used on the nails are decals. \"Traditionally, you'd see this style with gold, but that's not [Fox's] vibe,\" says Boyce. \"Silver chrome felt cooler - more her.\" On the fingers where pictures of angels weren't used, the due opted for a french tip. Boyce has been working with Fox for years now, and even collaborated with her on her pregnancy announcement nails, so the moment is full circle. For that occasion, Fox's nails were gunmetal chrome mixed with black details, which complemented the theme of her oil-slick baby bump photoshoot. If you want to recreate the look at home, we found some angel decals that look very similar. You can grab an Angel Nail Sticker Set ($7) or these StickerRay Little Angel Nail Art Stickers ($4) from Etsy. The castlecore nail trend can be worn by anyone who wants to bring the whimsical fairytale vibes to their fingertips. Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.
