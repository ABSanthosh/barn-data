  "description": "We thought we had seen every twist on the classic french manicure possible - but oh, were we wrong. There's a new take on the throwback trend (and one we should have seen coming with the invisible french, the glazed-doughnut french, and many more cool iterations), only this one literally flips the traditional design upside down. Meet the reverse french manicure. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised by this take - especially with so many A-listers in Hollywood showing their support for the many different iterations of the design. The reverse french manicure, otherwise known as the inverted french manicure, is simple yet so visually pleasing. It looks just how you'd imagine: the cuticle is painted a solid color instead of the tip of the nails. As with any nail-art design, there are so many different shades you can choose from when trying out this trend. Chrissy Teigen, Megan Thee Stallion, Blake Lively, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Dove Cameron are all fans of reverse manicures. That should be all the proof you need to understand that the reverse french mani isn't going anywhere anytime soon. If you're stuck in a manicure rut, get inspiration for the nail trend taking this year by storm. We compiled a list of some of our favorite versions of the reverse french manicure that you'll want to save for later.",
