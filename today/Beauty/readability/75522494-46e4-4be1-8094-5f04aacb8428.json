  "text": "Rhode launched a new lip pencil called the Peptide Lip Shape – The Contouring Lip Shaper ($24 each). I loved the teasers and as a huge fan of neutrals I was very excited to try these. I shared a try-on in action here and I was really surprised by the feedback! The feedback was very mixed and after trying these for nearly two weeks I finally have my review. The Peptide Lip Shape is a creamy twist up lip product that I’d say is in between a lip liner and chubby stick. The formula is creamy and glides on with a very smooth application, but it has a semi-matte looking finish. I think the colors are SO beautiful, but only a few work for me. Lighter neutrals are so difficult for me to wear because I have a darker lip tone and while many look SO good swatched on my hand, they end up looking ashy or dry on my lips because of the contrast (ie MAC Crème Cup, Blankety and Myth or Tom Ford Blush Nude look like white out on my lips). Shades I hauled: Bend is a peach brown beige Twist is a neutral light brown Lift is a light dusty pink Lunge is a rosy beige tan Press is a pink mauve tone Lean is a medium brown Balance coffee caramel brown The biggest complaint I saw was about the lasting power and I semi disagree with the rants that came across the comments and messages about these. These aren’t long-wear lip pencils and I think most of you who were disappointed expected this to be like a lip liner. The texture of the Peptide Lip Shape is softer and the pigment/texture isn’t dense like a pencil so it’s more like a lipstick in pencil form. They’re designed to be more like a contour rather than a definer. That being said the lasting power isn’t the best but they definitely do not disappear immediately. If I wear these all over the lip, they fade the fastest from the center of the lip, but they do linger around the edges a long time on me. I really love the idea and concept, but I don’t love the formula. I also don’t hate them. I like these best when topped with a gloss. If I were to do my order over I would have only picked up Lunge and Press. I can make the others work with an added gloss but this makes them more high maintenance than I would like. Swatches: Below wearing: Armani Luminous Silk Foundation in 6.5, Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Powder in Medium, Rhode Pocket Blush in Freckle, Tom Ford Eyeshadow Quad in Peach Glamour + Makeup by Mario Master Mattes, Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Definer Caramel, Tarte Lights, Camera Lashes Mascara So bottom line, if you ask me are these worth the purchase? I would say they’re ok, but there are better formulas out there and I prefer a regular lip pencil than a chubby stick. I do think the Ilia Lip Sketch for a similar concept (chubby stick) is better, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the finish. The Pat McGrath Dramatique Lip Pencils are much better for lasting power, but these also pull matte and I think in general I just feel better with a glossy lip vs something that is matte. Chanel had the most incredible Lip Crayon back in the day, they’ve since discontinued it, but it was the best lip crayon I tried. You can find the Peptide Lip Shape now at Rhode Skin.",
