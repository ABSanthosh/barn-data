  "description": "This year served up some incredible beauty trends on a silver platter. They were all so good, we had a hard time selecting the most impactful moments - but here we are. While 2023 was the year of niche aesthetics, 2024 had some overarching themes that were classic but with a twist. Instead of leaning into Barbiecore or quiet luxury this year, we almost saw a \"back to basics approach\" to beauty. Folks favored easy (but effective!) TikTok hacks, updated versions of universally beloved haircuts, and natural, flattering makeup that looks effortless and chic. Unsurprisingly, most of 2024's viral moments also revolved around TikTok. Some users were on a mission to prove you don't need injections to make your lips appear fuller, while others gave the full rundown on finding your most flattering look possible based on contrast. Trends that gained the most traction were extra serviceable and wearable. Dessert-inspired nail colors à la Hailey Bieber also went viral for the same reason, piggybacking off last year's food-inspired nail-art craze. Overall, there's so much to talk about. While it seemed like something new was popping up daily, we identified a few of the biggest beauty trends that defined 2024. Keep reading for the full report. Reflective Hair Colors Every season of 2024 brought us some exciting and vibrant hair hues. Rich and reflective colors trended the most, from summer's wildly popular \"cowboy copper\" shade to fall's \"syrup blond.\" Now that we've fully steeped in the winter season, shades like maroon and the ultra-reflective \"winter gold\" are having a moment, with celebrities like Beyoncé and Kaia Gerber leading the charge. Big Chops Bob haircuts are nothing new. The bob is actually one of the most classic and timeless haircuts around, but this year, we saw a few chic and fresh versions take center stage. From the \"Prada bob\" and \"broom bob\" to the Italian bob and \"cowgirl bob, there's a style out there now that suits every face shape and hair texture. Simpler Styles Instead of heavier foundation and extra bold makeup looks, 2024 favored subtle and natural complexion enhancing techniques. Trends like the demi method and contrast makeup theory took over the internet. In the hair department, 2024 welcomed back pin-straight styles (yes, like the kind you rocked in the early aughts) and unfussy sleek buns after larger-than-life '90s blowouts climbed to the number-one spot of hairstyles in 2023. Sweet Treat-Inspired Looks Last year, we saw an uptick in food-inspired nail art, which continued well into this year. However, as time went on, we noticed a refinement of the trend and an extension past just our fingertips. Sweet treat-inspired nail colors and designs were prominent. As usual, Hailey Bieber paved the way for this trend with her maple syrup and cinnamon-roll nails, but other shades like cherry mocha and chocolate milk were also a huge hit. In the hair and makeup department, jelly-doughnut blush and cherry-cola hair satisfied our sweet tooth. Natural Aesthetics Natural aesthetics were paramount in 2024. Invasive plastic surgery procedures took a backseat to \"tweakments,\" such as ones utilizing stem cell injectable therapy, lasers, and radio frequency microneedling. Even our own editors dabbled in on-the-rise treatments like Sculptra, which helps regenerate your own collagen, and Skinvive to give skin an organic-looking boost. Other noninvasive procedures, like the \"liquid nose job,\" took TikTok by storm because of their ability to create real results without going under the knife. Lip-Focused Treatments TikTok-lead beauty hacks have dominate for years, but 2024's batch of favorites was heavily focused on lips. From a viral hack for subtle \"movie lips\" to a lip combo inspired by Angelina Jolie, picture-perfect pouts were the goal. Even modified takes on traditional lip filler, like \"butterfly lips,\" gained momentum in the beauty community this year. Not to mention, 2024 was the year of the lip oil, with countless brands launching their own spin on the product category.
