  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Kelsey Garcia My skin-care inspiration is that of a glazed doughnut. I dream of having hydrated, dewy, and near-reflective skin, and I'm happy to report that a recent purchase has brought me closer than ever to my goal: the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ($13, originally $25). I'm by no means the first person to rave about this beauty product. In fact, the essence already has quite the cult following. (A facial essence, by the way, is a concentrated yet lightweight lotion applied after cleanser but before moisturizer.) This particular one by Cosrx claims to hydrate the skin and even out its texture, all the while minimizing fine lines and acne scars. So, yeah, it's promising a lot. The secret to the product's success is snail mucin, an ingredient that's been appearing in more widely available skin-care products in the last few years. It's believed that the mucin naturally possesses moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid, to name a few. Some studies have also shown that it can reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, according to research published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a must-have for everyone. Right now it's heavily discounted for Amazon's October Prime Day, so make sure you stock up while it's still available, because the sale ends soon. Keep reading to learn more about the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Key ingredients include snail secretion filtrate (a substance derived from snails and beloved for its hydrating benefits), soothing allantoin, and hydrating hyaluronic acid. It's highly rated on retailer sites like Amazon, with nearly 75,000 five-star ratings. It doesn't contain any fragrance, sulfates, or parabens. What I Like About the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence I'll admit, I bought this essence before I knew anything about what it really was or snail mucin benefits. Instead, I simply kept seeing mentions of the product across the internet, recognized that it was fairly affordable and - since I'm gullible - that's really all it took. So off I went to oo35mm, a local beauty shop frequented by skin-care connoisseurs, in search of a bottle of the stuff. Because I am in my late 20s and own a smartphone, I posted a photo of my purchases on Instagram Stories. I kid you not, no selfie I have ever posted has received such engagement. (Frankly, I should have been offended.) Some people inquired about the whole snail situation, but most of the people who replied said they were longtime fans of the essence. There were a lot of flame emojis involved. It's been months since I started using the essence daily. I use it after cleansing and before applying moisturizer, and I am a complete convert. Though I was worried the additional skin-care step would clog my pores over time, leading to pimples and what have you, my skin's texture has actually improved, and it feels way more even now. The hydration payoff is also huge, and I feel like it actually helps my moisturizer work better, too. For a while, I had been feeling as though the cream would just sit atop my skin after application, and now I feel like it's actually penetrating through and sinking in. Best of all, I finally feel close to glazed doughnut status. Image Source: Amazon What to Consider Before Trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence One thing to consider before trying the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is that the texture isn't for everyone. To me, it feels sticky just for a few seconds before absorbing into my skin completely. This fleeting stickiness, though brief, has deterred some users. It's worth noting: the majority of shoppers agree that it ultimately doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky, and as far as I'm concerned, that shopper was being a tad dramatic. Nonetheless, if that initial texture will throw you for a loop, you might want to consider a different product. Where Is the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence Available? The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence is available at Amazon and Ulta Beauty.
