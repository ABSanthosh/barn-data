  "description": "From milk-bath manicures to \"glazed-doughnut\" finishes and even the \"supermodel\" nail look, there's no shortage of nail ideas out there. But recently, industry experts are predicting that we'll see a rise in one particular color: lavender nails. Back in 2023, digital lavender nails were all the rage. \"This color was named by trend forecasting website WSGN - along with its sister company Coloro - as 2023's color of the year,\" celebrity manicurist Julie Kandalec says. \"We saw it everywhere from runways to nail and makeup looks.\" Now, light purple nails in various forms are taking over. \"Lavender always invokes the feeling of spring for me,\" celebrity manicurist Elle Gerstein says. \"It's such a tranquil color.\" If you've immediately started searching for lavender nail ideas, you'll likely find numerous manicures that can fit your personal aesthetic because the shade is so versatile. \"It's a non-boring neutral that still has some pizzazz,\" Kandalec says. Whether you're a fan of glitter, negative-space designs, or a classic french nail art, lavender-themed manicures will never steer you wrong. While single-color manicures are an easy way to get in on the fun, there are so many lavender nail designs to choose from that you're going to want to dedicate a whole Pinterest board to the ones you'll find from a simple Google search. To help you narrow down your options, we went ahead and rounded up the best lavender nail ideas that you should consider replicating at your next manicure appointment. Trust us: you may want to call ahead and secure your spot in your favorite nail tech's chair now.
