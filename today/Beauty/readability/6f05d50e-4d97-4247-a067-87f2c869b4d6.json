  "description": "Being a shopping editor is almost synonymous with being a product guinea pig - especially for beauty. I've had my fair share of trying the best (and weirdest) products approved by TikTok and celebrities, but I still had yet to try an LED mask. I've seen them everywhere, from my FYP to my Instagram feed, but being a minimal skin-care routine girl, I never gave into the hype (having relatively clear skin might have something to do with it). But alas, I've been influenced and finally gave into temptation with the Higher Dose Red Light Mask ($349) - and I get the hype now. There are so many LED masks on the market, so of course, I was super careful when choosing one for my first experience. This one from Higher Dose is not only TikTok-approved, but it's FDA-cleared, which gave me more peace about using it. Although I've only been using it for a little over a month, I've noticed even more brightness in my skin - so much so that I get compliments almost daily, and I'm highly considering going through most of the summer without foundation. Keep reading for my full review and find out why this mask is worth the investment. About the Higher Dose Red Light Mask The red light works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, boost collagen and elastin, reduce redness, and boost your mood. It comes with three straps for a secure fit, a controller and charging cable, extra plugs for international outlets, a pair of black goggles, and a dust bag for storage and traveling. Its dimensions and light features include: Bulbs: 66 LED bulbs; LEDs: 132 LEDs (two per bulb); RED: 630nm; NIR: 830nm; Irradiance: 50 mW/cm2 (power density of the LED lights); Time: 10 minutes or 20 minutes; and Size: 295mm (width) x 216mm (height). What I Like About the Higher Dose Red Light Mask All jokes aside, I love everything about the Higher Dose Red Light Mask. Admittedly, the red light is something to get used to (I definitely saw stars after closing my eyes first use), but its benefits surely make up for the temporary photopsia. With such a busy schedule, it's very rare that I do more than my usual 10 to 15 minute skin-care routine, but using this mask forces me to pause and relax. You can either use it by plugging it into the wall or through its cordless feature, but I love using it plugged in. Whether it's for the recommended time or a little longer, the red light is super relaxing and allows you to have some time to yourself - completely uninterrupted. Not to mention, it keeps me completely focused while watching this controversial season of \"Love Island USA.\" Apart from its calming abilities, I love how much my skin glows after using this mask. While I have relatively clear skin, it is sensitive so there are moments when I notice a bit of redness, but I'd never found a product to conquer the issue before. After my first use, I noticed a significant difference in my complexion and texture, and my skin even felt more refreshed - as if I had just gotten a luxurious facial. It also helped to clear some stubborn marks that pimples had left behind, and I can tell the progress will only continue. You can see the difference in my skin just one month apart. How to Use the Higher Dose Red Light Mask While it might look complex, the Higher Dose Red Light Mask is easy to use. It comes fully charged straight out of the box, and you can simply put it on after doing your usual cleansing routine. You can adjust the mask over your face using its side and top velcro straps (I rarely use the top because of my hair), and choose your time of either 10 or 20 minutes. And that's it - you're an LED mask pro! What to Consider Before Trying the Higher Dose Red Light Mask It's worth noting that the battery life on this mask isn't as long as other models. You get about three uses before having to recharge it, so I'd recommend charging it overnight. It's also a bit pricey, but the results make it worth the investment. Where Is the Higher Dose Red Light Mask Available? The Higher Dose Red Light Mask is available on the brand's website and at Sephora.

It comes fully charged straight out of the box, and you can simply put it on after doing your usual cleansing routine. You can adjust the mask over your face using its side and top velcro straps (I rarely use the top because of my hair), and choose your time of either 10 or 20 minutes.

You get about three uses before having to recharge it, so I\u0026#39;d recommend charging it overnight. It\u0026#39;s also a bit pricey, but the results make it worth the investment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Is the Higher Dose Red Light Mask Available?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eThe Higher Dose Red Light Mask is available on the \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhigherdose.com%2Fproducts%2Fhigherdose-red-light-face-mask\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49449932__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003ebrand\u0026#39;s website\u003c/a\u003e and at \u003ca href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM\u0026amp;mid=2417\u0026amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fred-light-face-mask-for-fine-lines-glowing-skin-P508179%3F\u0026amp;u1=___psv__p_49449932__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003eSephora\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e ★★★★★\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/naomi-parris\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNaomi Parris\u003c/a\u003e is the assistant shopping editor at PS, based in New York.
