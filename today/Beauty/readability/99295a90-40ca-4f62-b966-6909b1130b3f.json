  "description": "Nail lovers know that manicures typically fall into one of two categories: minimalist or maximalist. Maximalists have conversation starters like coquette nails and \"junk\" nails; minimalists have classics like french tips and \"rich girl\" nails. It's rare that we come across a trend that fits into both categories - but it does happen. Allow us to introduce you to your new favorite manicure: \"denim\" nails. Fashion trends have a habit of influencing what's hot in the beauty world, and the latest nail obsession is no exception. As the name suggests, the trend is inspired by none other than - yep, you guessed it - your favorite pair of jeans. It's gaining popularity because of how customizable it is - whether you opt for something as simple a light wash or if you want to go all out with rips and fading, trust us - there's a denim nail look for you. Keep scrolling to learn more about the nail trend and find out how to re-create the look at home. Experts Featured in This Article Olivia Aguirre is the lead nail artist for Côte Beauty. Olive Van Iderstine is nail-care brand Olive and June's manicure trend expert. Rianna Basurto is the director of marketing and brand development at Bellacures. Elle Gerstein is a celebrity nail artist located in New York City. Sonya Meesh is a celebrity nail artist. What Are Denim Nails? \"Denim nails are a trendy nail design that mimics the look and texture of denim fabric,\" Rianna Basurto of Bellacures says. \"They can range from deep indigo shades to soft, acid-wash blues, often with subtle distressing, fading, or even stitch-like details to resemble real jeans.\" There are variations that opt for matte finishes in order to get a true fabric effect, but a glossy or metallic sheen is also perfect for the trend. The fun thing about denim nails is that they're a bit of a choose-your-own adventure. You can opt for a manicure that looks like you'd be wearing it on your bottom half or you can choose the more pared down version that incorporates different shades of blue. The good news? Denim nails are truly versatile. \"Just as jeans are a classic wardrobe staple that never goes out of style and look good on everyone, the same can be said for denim nails,\" nail expert Olivia Van Iderstine says. However, there are a few guidelines. \"The ripped style is usually applied to a longer nail but the solid denim colors work on shorter nails as well,\" celebrity nail artist Sonya Meesh says. How to Get Denim Nails The first step is deciding which take on the denim nail trend you want to recreate. This is where inspiration photos come in handy. Once you have reference photos, you'll want to make sure your manicure begins with the proper nail prep. Whether you're DIY-ing the look at home or visiting a salon, freshly filed nails with pushed back nail beds are key. If you're looking to do it yourself, the simplest way to do it is to start with a blue nail polish. Luckily, there are plenty different options to choose from. Some of our experts' favorites include Olive and June's CNH ($9) and Dior 796 Denim ($32). From there, you can choose to add embellishments, stitching, or rips using a nail art brush - or you can keep things simple with a single-color manicure. \"To create the denim texture, dab a makeup sponge into white or light blue polish and lightly press it onto the nails to create a faded, textured effect,\" celebrity nail artist Elle Gerstein says. \"Alternatively, use a fan brush to streak thin, uneven white lines across the nails for a woven fabric look.\" If you don't have time for a nail appointment or to swipe on polish at home, you can always opt for press-on nails. The Olive and June OMG Glue Press-Ons ($10) are the perfect indigo color to get the look quickly. One last thing to note? \"Something that's really important and often overlooked in making your manicure look great is healthy, hydrated skin - I rely on the Côte Beauty's Hand \u0026 Body Lotion ($52) to help make my manicure look its best every day,\" nail artist Olivia Aguirre says. \"Hydrated nails also help to prevent chips and keep your manicure looking fresher for longer.\" Ready to get that salon appointment booked or tackle the look on your own? Keep scrolling for some inspiration photos you're sure to drool over.",
