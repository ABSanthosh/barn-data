Yet, in today's world, preparation is key when it comes to nail appointments. Gone are the days when choosing a polish color was the most difficult decision you had to make. Nowadays, there are endless options to consider before settling on a hue. You need to decide what nail shape you're going for, as well as whether you want to splurge on dip powder, gel polish, or shellac nails. We understand that if you've never strayed from regular polish before, all of these choices can seem a bit confusing. Plus, not knowing what a shellac manicure is in the first place can definitely add to the indecision. To help clear things up, we went straight to a pro and spoke with celebrity manicurist Julie Kandalec, to get the lowdown on our biggest question: what is a shellac manicure? Keep reading for everything you'd want to know about the treatment. Experts Featured in This Article Julie Kandalec is a celebrity manicurist and founder of Julie K Nail Academy. What Is a Shellac Manicure? This may be surprising, but shellac and gel polish are not the same thing, even though they're often used interchangeably. A common misconception, shellac is the name of the gel polish created and patented by CND, a global leader in the professional nail world. \"Shellac combines the best properties of gel - wear and protection - and the best properties of polish - color and shine - for flawless wear with no dry time and damage-free removal,\" Kandalec tells PS. The key to achieving the ultimate shellac manicure is to follow CND's patented system, which involves using a specific shellac base coat, color coat, and topcoat that is cured with an LED lamp designed exclusively for shellac. Curing is the most important part of the process, as it \"ensures proper adhesion, long-lasting wear, and hassle-free removal.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by CND™ (@cndworld) Shellac Nails vs. Gel While gel manicures are also known for their long-lasting wear time and durability, they can be thicker and less natural looking than shellac nails. \"The removal process is where clients see the biggest difference in using shellac versus other gels or gel polish,\" says Kandalec. Gel nail removal is often more complicated and may require filing or soaking your nails in acetone, whereas shellac can be removed with acetone and a cotton swab. How Long Do Shellac Nails Last? According to Kandalec, a manicure properly applied using the shellac system will deliver around two weeks of wear. However, it all depends on how well you take care of your nails between appointments. A friendly piece of advice: wear gloves while doing house chores to help extend the life of your shellac manicure. How to Remove Shellac Nails When it comes to Shellac, the unique formula of the product allows for easy and seamless removal. Kandalec says, \"When acetone-based remover is applied, the coating breaks down into tiny pieces and releases from the nail.\" This is possible because the shellac formula creates undetectable tunnels throughout the coating when it is cured in the CND LED lamp. When it's time to remove the coating, the acetone penetrates through these tiny tunnels to the base layer, causing the coating to release from the nail without the need to scrape or force it off. Removal of shellac can take anywhere from five to 15 minutes, depending on the products used. While many people believe that gel polish is damaging to nails, the truth is that damage can be caused by improper application or removal of the gel polish. Peeling, picking, or forcing off gel polish can be detrimental to nail health. To ensure the best results, Kandalec recommends using 100 percent pure acetone or the gel remover made by the manufacturer. And even though it's tempting, it's crucial to avoid peeling off shellac, as it can lead to significant nail damage.
