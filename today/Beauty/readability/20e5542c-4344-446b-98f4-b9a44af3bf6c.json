Alright, it's that time of year again when Sephora does their grand 20% off sale for VIB status shoppers (you get this if you spent $350 in the last year there, which is embarrassingly easy to do). There's a 15% off sale in the Spring but this holiday one is the real event where I usually save up to spend my money for a better deal. So here's the lowdown. Use code 20VIB from November 11th-14th online or you can also shop the sale in stores at Sephora and Sephora inside JCPenny. The discount works on your whole cart so this has always been the best time to stock up on longtime favorites or to try out something new from spendy products that rarely get discounted. With this in mind, I wanted to share some of my top picks that I think are so worth it to pick up. Sephora Sale Picks Urban Decay Cannonball Mascara - $20 I miss this mascara so much every time I try something else for a while. It's one of the few mascaras that not only hold my lashes once they've been curled but lengthens lashes with fibers and is truly waterproof. Koh Gen Do Aqua Foundation - $62 This in shade 123 is my holy grail foundation for beautiful, natural looking skin. Even when I wear this all day it still keeps that smooth, skin-like texture that looks amazing both in real life and in photos. Kate Somerville ExfoliKate - $24 The first time I used this again after having my baby (I avoided certain acids during pregnancy) my skin literally glowed the entire next day. It's bar-none my favorite exfoliator out there and makes your face noticeably softer and smoother. SK-II Facial Treatment Essence - $165 I like to think of essence as the ultimate skin balancer. It serves as an extra moisture layer to improve hydration with lots of extra skin-loving pitera and minerals, but it also helps reduce t-zone oiliness and the appearance of pores. It's pricey but as I get older I can definitely see a difference when I use this regularly and when I don't. Clinique Smart Custom Repair Serum - $59.50 This serum has helped reduce my post-acne hyperpigmentation more than anything else I've tried. If you are prone to dark spots, this is something you should try. Clinique also has a Dark Spot Corrector but I found the Custom Repair Serum personally gave me even better results. Tarte Smooth Operator Setting Powder - $33 I am a firm believer that a good translucent setting powder is what makes the difference in cakey, heavy-looking makeup versus looking like you have perfect skin. This one has an airbrush effect but also keeps greasies at bay better than basic silica powders like Make Up For Ever HD Powder. Benefit Goof Proof Brow Pencil - $24 This pencil is one of the softest out there which means no scraping to get nice color payoff. I use shade 3 and it makes filling in brows quick and easy. Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer - $399 I'll fully admit I'm a huge Dyson fangirl and their new dryer claims to cut drying time way down and with less damage to boot. Yes, it's a $400 dryer which is a splurge for anyone so I'd definitely take advantage of using the code on this one if you are gadget-obsessed like me! T3 Whirl Trio Interchangeable Styling Wand - $270 It's funny that it took me so long to upgrade my curling iron when I went for a better flat iron and blow dryer such a long time ago, but I've got to say that T3 is hands-down my favorite by miles. My hair is curled quickly without extra hairs getting caught or burning and they last through the second day. This set has 3 interchangeable barrels and the white + rose gold looks so gorgeous. Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Romance Palette - $42 If there is any eyeshadow palette that the beauty community has been going nuts about it's this one. I love that it's mostly matte neutrals which run warm, which I find to be flattering and easy to wear day and night. Lancome Juicy Shakers - $21 I am obsessed with these cute gloss-stains that are as fun to apply as they are to look at. Each comes in a scent reflecting the name and are great for an easy gradient lip look! My fav shades are Wonder-Melon (hot coral), Mangoes Wild (rose), and Walk The Lime (red). Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum - $80 There are a couple of newer brands that have been on my radar and Drunk Elephant is at the top of that list. People have been raving about them for their effective, balanced skincare that doesn't have skin-irritating fragrances in it and Paula's Choice gave them impressive 5-star reviews so I'm looking forward to testing out the C-Firma Day Serum to see if it can give me brighter, clearer skin! From past experience, a lot of popular products tend to sell out quickly so my tip is to add items to your cart tonight so you can have a swift check-out once the sale hits tomorrow. Happy shopping and let me know if you picked anything up!",
