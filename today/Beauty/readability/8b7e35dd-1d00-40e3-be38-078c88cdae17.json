  "description": "Image Source: Cindy Ord/MG24/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue It's not often that we spot a celebrity-loved manicure that we can easily re-create at home, but Dua Lipa is here to deliver. Not only is her latest manicure one of the easiest to DIY (more on that later), but it also drums up major feelings of nostalgia. If you went to the nail salon even once in the early aughts, chances are you got the exact flower manicure she's currently sporting during a trip to Italy. Obviously, the nail art space has evolved a lot since then, but there's something so sweet about Lipa's fresh take on this vintage (can we call the early 2000s vintage?) design. Even if you never got your nails professionally done as a kid, you probably came across this nail-art book at sleepovers teaching you exactly how to achieve this floral mani at home. That book, along with magazines, were the original source for nail inspiration long before Instagram was a thing. If you didn't try your hand at it when you were younger, now's your chance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by DUA LIPA (@dualipa) Lipa used just two colors to create hers: black and white. The color palette automatically elevates the look. She has two flowers on each fingernail, with one on the very edge and bleeding off the side of the nail. This allows the design to work on both shorter natural nails or nail extensions. How to Re-create the Look If you want to re-create this look at home, you'll need a base shade of your choice. We recommend something neutral like a pale pink or beige or even just your natural nail with a clear coat on top. Then, you'll need two more shades to create the flower designs. It's helpful to pick contrasting colors to help the different parts of the flower stand out. We love the O.P.I. Opaque Dark Black ($12) and the O.P.I. Opaque Light White ($12) polishes because they're not runny or see-through. Then, you'll need a tool with a rounded end to create the petals and middle of the flower. You can grab Art Dotting Tools ($6) on Amazon, or just use the tip of a bobby pin. Start by creating the center of the flower in one shade. To make the petals, first wipe off your tool and switch to a different shade to make the five dots surrounding the center. Yes, it really is as easy as you remember.
