Any time I'm scrolling the app, I can guarantee I'll learn about a new skin-care product, a fun nail trend, or an easy hair hack (with the occasional tarot card reader telling me my ex-boyfriend is thinking of me sprinkled in). The app has helped me master how to create the perfect winged eyeliner on downturned eyes, how to get a voluminous ponytail, and how to nail the best \"my lips but better\" makeup combo. Recently, I've been seeing everyone on the app going bananas over \"Utah curls.\" At first glance, I didn't really see what the big deal was, but after seeing countless videos over the last month, and spending a few hours Googling, \"what are Utah curls?\" it was clear that I needed to try them out. The curls are loose, bouncy, and different from your run-of-the-mill beach wave. Keep scrolling to learn more about the hair trend, find out how you can do it at home, and see what my results were after trying it out for myself. What Are Utah Curls? @sydneyjcutler Since it pains me to see yâ€™all restraightening your ends ðŸ˜© #hairtutorial #hairtok #utahhair #utahcurls #utah â™¬ original sound - Syd So, what are Utah Curls? At first glance, they might just look like your average beachy wave, but they're actually a bit different. One key difference is that Utah curls have straight ends, whereas beachy waves don't. Also, beachy waves can usually be achieved using any kind of hot tool - such as a wand, a curling iron, or even a flat iron - but to get Utah curls right, you need a curling iron with a clamp. How to Get Utah Curls If you're a beginner to using a curling iron, it might take a bit to master. I'm pretty adept with mine, but this took even me a few tries to get right. To start, you want dry, preferably smooth hair that has been blown out. Next, I used the Drybar Hot Toddy Heat Protectant Mist ($29) all over my head. If you're using hot tools, you absolutely need a heat protectant. I love this one because you can use it on dry hair without getting that wet feeling. After dividing it into sections, I took the T3 SinglePass 1 in Curling Iron ($170) and began curling. I've tested a lot of curling irons over the years, but this is the one I always go back to. It's the best option for beachy waves, loose waves, and everything in between (and ultimately I think it's what made my Utah curls look their best). If you're trying to achieve the look at home, your best bet is looking for an instructional video. In my opinion, it's a lot easier to watch and try to replicate the movement than follow a written tutorial. I started by clamping my hair with the iron about mid-way down and then curled upward, away from my face. However, the key to Utah curls isn't how you curl, it's how you unravel. While unwrapping, I twisted the curling iron underneath and behind the strand of hair. When I got to the ends, I dragged down to make sure they were straight. Immediately after each curl, I made sure to let it cool in the shape it was in. Once my entire head was finished, I brushed through the ends with a wide-tooth comb. The tutorial I watched said to use a light-hold hairspray and even some hair paste, but I opted to forgo additional products entirely. My Utah Curls Results Overall, I liked my Utah curls, but they weren't my favorite hairstyle. I'm much more into a sleek, bouncy blowout achieved with my Dyson Airwrap, but this worked for me - especially for a second-day look. I think this hairstyle looks best on medium-length to super-long hair. I've seen it done on short hair, but in my opinion, it doesn't quite have the same effect, especially if the hair is layered.

Once my entire head was finished, I brushed through the ends with a wide-tooth comb. The tutorial I watched said to use a light-hold hairspray and even some hair paste, but I opted to forgo additional products entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Utah Curls Results\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eOverall, I liked my Utah curls, but they weren\u0026#39;t my favorite hairstyle. I\u0026#39;m much more into a sleek, bouncy blowout achieved with my Dyson Airwrap, but this worked for me â€” especially for a second-day look. I think this hairstyle looks best on medium-length to super-long hair. I\u0026#39;ve seen it done on short hair, but in my opinion, it doesn\u0026#39;t quite have the same effect, especially if the hair is layered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/renee-rodriguez\"\u003eRenee Rodriguez\u003c/a\u003e (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
